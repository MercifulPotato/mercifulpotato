At that time, the only other significant front would be the North African front, which wasn&#x27;t really competing with Barbarossa for logistical support (North Africa being limited to trans-Mediterranean shipping availability, which the British were doing a passable job of interdicting).<p>&gt; &quot;The Other Side&quot; was fighting on four fronts at their borders, and had supply lines a thousand miles long on ground<p>Do remember that it&#x27;s basically fighting the same enemy on all the fronts (who have the same this-is-not-close issue as Germany). In the one case where it&#x27;s different, keep in mind that Soviet factories were moved east of the Urals to places like Novosibirsk, which is further from Moscow than Berlin is to Moscow.<p>&gt; the US against the Axis in Europe, the US was not a major or deciding force<p>The US was about ½-⅔ the total force in Western Front. While the Western Front was smaller than the Eastern Front, the US also played a major role in the supply chain of the USSR--virtually all of the trucks and trains that kept the USSR&#x27;s war economy running were supplied by the US, which was also supplying Chang Kai-Shek via The Hump (although Britain was responsible for those logistics), while meanwhile reconquering the Philippines and other Pacific islands from the Japanese. And don&#x27;t forget, most of the US manufacturing is several hundred miles from the coasts (the Great Lakes don&#x27;t count for transoceanic shipping purposes).')
