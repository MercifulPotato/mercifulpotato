Item(by='trey-jones', descendants=None, kids=[25962467], score=None, time=1611953621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961420, text='Well there is this quote, often attributed to Einstein himself: “Never memorize something that you can look up.”<p>I don&#x27;t know whether he really said or thought anything like that, and I also don&#x27;t actually agree with the literal meaning.  There are some things that it pays to memorize, in my opinion.  As I keep reminding my daughters: times tables (or math facts as they seem to be known nowadays) are important forever.<p>The principal behind the quote, however, I&#x27;m fully behind.  I live in the docs.  Even if it&#x27;s something that I know pretty well, I often like to check to make sure I understand exactly what&#x27;s going down.  There are too many little details that are easy to forget.  If it&#x27;s important and you aren&#x27;t sure, look it up!<p>Finally, I could probably claim to be able to write build a simple web app without using google, but I&#x27;m sure I would lean heavily on my editor to remind me of argument order, syntax, etc.  Maybe there is a little bit of difference there: if my editor&#x2F;IDE can tell me what I need to know, it&#x27;s probably just that bit faster than searching for it in a browser.<p>Shoutout to lsp-mode.')
