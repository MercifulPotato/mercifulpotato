I mean surely if she wanted she could go away to SF to live with him? Hopefully violence wasn&#x27;t involved but the whole parental wish thing worked because of family system, lack of opportunities and culture - so I am sure plenty of things have changed for the good even if it didn&#x27;t work out in this one case.')
