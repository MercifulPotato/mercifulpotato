Most new innovations are the result of access and engagement with existing Corporate Intellectual Property (plus an expensive education).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;not-ipr.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;not-ipr.en.html</a>')
