The writer appears to have a lot of hardware expertise, and almost none about systems. Single point of failure? Check. Closed hardware systems that might be unsupported sometime soon? Check. No diagnostics? Check.<p>This was a fascinating project and I commend the writer for posting all the hairy details, but I am slightly appalled at the wastage.')
