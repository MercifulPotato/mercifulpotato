For some reason it really fascinates me to see titanium being used that way, because it&#x27;s not the way most places use it (it is a notoriously hard metal to work with). I wonder, are laser sintering and other techniques fundamentally slow or can they be improved to be more competitive?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;p1Vk2hMO0ME?t=83" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;p1Vk2hMO0ME?t=83</a>')
