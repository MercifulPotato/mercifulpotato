You have members of both parties state that the election was secure and fraud minimal. You have international observers say the same. 60+ legal challenges thrown out because of a lack of specific allegations and proof. Elections observed by both parties lawyers.<p>Stop with the conspiracy theorizing. There are literal billions spent on elections every year, and if there was fraud being perpetuated by one of the parties, it would be in the interest of the other party to spend massive amounts of money to uncover said fraud, and they do, and they have found nothing of substance.<p>In addition to private study, there have been countless academic studies that state the same.<p>Stop giving breath to ideas that are without evidence and which are corrosive to our democracy.')
