This is not a zero-sum game, or at least, it does not have to be.<p>It&#x27;s much more interesting to focus on not having a society where you can do important work and not be treated well for it.  I&#x27;m helluva lot more grateful that someone comes around once a week in a big garbage-truck and takes away my garbage, than I am that some hipster with a macbook is making some new  webgui framework that will &quot;change the world&quot;. I can do without the webgui framework infinitely more than without the garbage-man.<p>We should be focusing on building a society where no job means poverty, that&#x27;s not even an ambitious goal, it&#x27;s the absolutely least you can expect of a decent society with decent people living in it. Sure, there can be competition for highest-paying jobs and for whatever are considered more pleasurable jobs, but nobody in any job at all, should be in a bad situation because of their job, if they have a job, if that job exists, society have decided they need them, and it&#x27;s every ones duty to treat them well and with respect.<p>So, thanks garbage dude, your job is more important than mine, at least you live in a more civilized country where you can afford more or less the same things I can.<p>Or as the article writes so much better:<p>&gt;  “What’s the issue with giving people decent jobs that allow them to have decent lives?” This reality might sound deflating, especially for a kid thinking about what they want to be when they grow up, but looked at another way, it can also be quite enchanting. If a dream job is like any other job, then isn’t making all jobs better the dream?')
