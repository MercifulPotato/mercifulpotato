I think there are lots of other kinds of hard work kids can, and ideally should be given the opportunity to, practice. Things like sports and music and community participation and outdoor activities (for instance, backpacking&#x2F;camping and rock climbing are things that are popular where I live and require hard work) and other non-school activities along these lines that require effort. Even something like getting really good at a difficult video game requires hard work. Watching TV and YouTube videos and such doesn&#x27;t.<p>As is obvious from this thread, I don&#x27;t have much expertise in what kinds of things are particularly hard with ADHD, but I suspect there are some kinds of hard work which are compatible and can be encouraged, and I&#x27;m definitely not focused solely, or even primarily, on school.<p>Edit: By the way, I have really appreciated your comments and patience in this thread. I certainly hope I haven&#x27;t implied I don&#x27;t think ADHD is &quot;100% real&quot;.')
