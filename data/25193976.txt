I do grind my teeth, but it&#x27;s sporadic and stress-related rather than a constant thing.<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to correlate actual jaw tension, teeth grinding, and migraines in any meaningful pattern. I&#x27;d say a good 60-70% of my migraines are due to some mix of brightness, hunger, thirst, exercise, sleep, and stress. Another 10% alcohol, and the rest is random: &quot;Here&#x27;s the migraine you ordered! Oh, you didn&#x27;t order one? Well here it is anyway, enjoy!&quot;')
