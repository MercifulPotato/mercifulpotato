That means that CPS conversion is going to work. Seen that way, call&#x2F;cc is just a  convenience feature that spares you the work of the conversion.<p>Introducing weaker language constructs and claiming that they are easier to reason about seems spurious, because there still may be full fledged continuations coming with CPS. I guess this so called reasoning will only work for a limited subset of all programs.<p>I actually think that call&#x2F;cc has the advantage of forcing people to realise what the ramifications of proper tail recursion are.')
