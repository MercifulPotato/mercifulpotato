I was on my way to a conference of scientists and TV broadcasters, and the organizers had kindly sent a driver.</i><p>&gt;&gt; <i>&quot;Do you mind if I ask you a question?&quot; He said as we waited for my bag. &quot;Isn&#x27;t it confusing to have the same name as that science guy?&quot;</i><p>&gt;&gt; <i>It took me a moment to understand. Was he pulling my leg? &quot;I am that science guy,&quot; I said. He smiled. &quot;Sorry. That&#x27;s my problem. I thought it was yours too.&quot; He put out his hand. &quot;My name is William F. Buckley.&quot; (Well, his name wasn&#x27;t exactly William F. Buckley, but he did have the name of a contentious TV interviewer, for which he doubtless took a lot of good-natured ribbing.)</i><p>&gt;&gt; <i>As we settled into the car for the long drive, he told me he was glad I was &quot;that science guy&quot; --   he had so many questions to ask about science. Would I mind? And so we got to talking. But not about science. He wanted to discuss UFOs, &quot;channeling&quot; (a way to hear what&#x27;s on the minds of dead people -- not much it turns out), crystals, astrology ... He introduced each subject with real enthusiasm, and each time I had to disappoint him: &quot;The evidence is crummy,&quot; I kept saying. &quot;There&#x27;s a much simpler explanation.&quot; As we drove on through the rain, I could see him getting glummer. I was attacking not just pseudoscience but also a facet of his inner life.</i><p>&gt;&gt; <i>And yet there is so much in real science that&#x27;s equally exciting, more mysterious, a greater intellectual challenge--as well as being a lot closer to the truth. Did he know about the molecular building blocks of life sitting out there in the cold tenuous gas between the stars? Had he heard of the footprints of our ancestors found in 4-mil-lion-year-old volcanic ash? What about the raising of the Himalayas when India went crashing into Asia? Or how viruses subvert cells, or the radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence or the ancient civilization of Ebla? Mr. &quot;Buckley&quot; -- well-spoken, intelligent, curious -- had heard virtually nothing of modem science. He wanted to know about science. It&#x27;s just that all the science got filtered out before it reached him. What the society permitted to trickle through was mainly pretense and confusion. And it had never taught him how to distinguish real science from the cheap imitation.</i>')
