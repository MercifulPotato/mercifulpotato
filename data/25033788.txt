Item(by='vinay427', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604922477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031894, text='I live in Switzerland. There are a few key differences.<p>1. The scale of population difference between the most and least populous full cantons (that have equal representation in the St√§nderat) is somewhat lower than CA versus WY, and they&#x27;re geographically much (!) closer which I suspect at least allows for a bit more &quot;intercantonal&quot; exposure.<p>2. Even more importantly, in my opinion: the two houses in the bicameral system have essentially identical powers. There isn&#x27;t a system of important executive or judicial appointments requiring only a Senate appointment (although the analogs here are blurry), so a majority of the national population&#x27;s representatives must also sign off as well as a majority of cantons. Providing the Senate unique powers protect the tyranny of less-populous states without limiting the dependence on the federal government.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federal_Assembly_(Switzerland)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federal_Assembly_(Switzerland)</a>')
