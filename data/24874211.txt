But what you did, with a single italicized reference at the top, is an HN idiom as well.<p>A long back-and-forth of quote and rebuttal though is definitely not the style here. That style makes sense in Email and Usenet, because you&#x27;re often using readers that don&#x27;t show the parent comment at the same time or in a thread. It makes very little sense here, where we&#x27;re essentially reading the same comment twice.')
