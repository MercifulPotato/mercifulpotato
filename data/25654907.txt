Every now and then I give JupyterLab a go but I keep going back to classic notebook. The only two extensions I need is Vim key bindings and Black formatting. I might checkout version 3 in a few months, but classic has a “feel” that just works for me. I’ve also tried the VSCode abs PyCharm notebooks. The dealbreaker is always how it displays the output of cells. It sucks compared to classic.')
