In those travels it has included reading a pretty decent amount of Scala code.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call it a mess so much as a very -expressive- language. But the cost of that is there are a lot of different ways to do things, and some parts of Scala that are very powerful can be <i>very</i> confusing until you understand them.<p>My favorite analogy for .NET developers; if they remember their confusion the first time they had to comprehend =&gt; delegate syntax, there&#x27;s lots of little things in the same vein in Scala; ways for the compiler to generate sugar. There&#x27;s just so -many- of them it can be overwhelming, doubly so when in some cases the wrong choice can in fact have pretty big performance implications.')
