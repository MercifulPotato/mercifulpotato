You can do ACME with an HTTP challenge or a DNS challenge.  The HTTP challenge is adequate for proving that you control x.example.com, but serving a website on x.example.com doesn&#x27;t prove that you own y.example.com.  But, being able to create example.com DNS records does, so that is what&#x27;s required to get a wildcard certificate.<p>I imagine you are confused because the proposal above sounds like &quot;just get *.example.com, then copy that cert to everything that will ever serve traffic for example.com&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t sound like a great idea to me.')
