Item(by='lasagnaphil', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610002837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662849, text='I disagree, left-right isn&#x27;t sufficient enough to capture the peculiarities of current US politics.<p>it&#x27;s more along these three camps:<p>- Progressives &#x2F; Left Populists (such as Bernie, AOC, etc...) - they aren&#x27;t really &quot;extreme left&quot;; they are more moderate lib-left if you ask any Europeans. They don&#x27;t really want to demolish capitalism as some actual Marxists suggest, they just want to fix&#x2F;modulate capitalism to be reasonable to the ordinary people, at the expense of large corporations and free market policies. Although some of them are in the Democratic Party, they are still failing to exert any power in there, which is mostly comprised of neoliberals. However, they are gaining an noticeable amount of partisan support these days, up to the point that the neoliberals had to actually strategize a bit to make sure Bernie doesn&#x27;t win in the DNC primaries.<p>- Neoliberals &#x2F; Globalists (Obama, Biden, etc...) - this is where the majority of politicians are at, comprising the majority of the Democratic Party, as well as about half of the Republican Party (or even more). Although it seems on the surface that the Dems and Reps are fighting the shit out of each other, many of them are still bind by the common interest of supporting various austerity policies, free reign of large corporations and making sure the global free market economy continue without any problems. Note that the left tends to use the term &quot;neoliberal&quot; more, while the right tends to use the term &quot;globalists&quot; more. From the left and right populist&#x27;s view they are the source of all evil, and from a neoliberal&#x27;s view the populist left&#x2F;right are respectively &quot;communists&quot; and &quot;fascists&quot;.<p>- Right Populists &#x2F; Nationalists (Trump, etc...) - Just like the progressives hate that the neoliberals are looting people with austerity measures and skyrocketing housing&#x2F;healthcare&#x2F;education costs, the right populists hate that the globalists are looting people by shutting down former industrial businesses, and imposing some weird liberal cultural hegemony upon them. Though I do not completely know the dynamics inside that camp, there seems to be a common agenda of being oppositional to immigration and being pro local business, as well as a deep hatred of liberal media. They have started to take over the GOP party, which is why there are no-Trump Republicans fighting against it.<p>Trump is kind of an outlier - he was a real-estate neoliberal but was kind of an outcast among them, and he forced his way into politics with many years of reality TV image-shaping. Many on the far-left criticize him being a neoliberal in right populist coating, and some on the far-right are disappointed by Trump about him having achieved nothing (which is a different phenomenon than no-Trump Republicans - I&#x27;m talking about actual fascists here!)<p>There are also some on the left (state communists, anarchists) as well as the far-right (fascists, neoreactionaries) which I&#x27;ve excluded, as they are still a bit fringe.<p>It also seems that the right often oversimplifies the left as well as the left oversimplifies the right, and that&#x27;s partially because there are power struggles inside both of the respective camps that makes the whole situation a bit complicated. For example, if you picked a random BLM protester, chances are you&#x27;ll get a neoliberal (if their protest was co-opted by the establishment Democrats), a progressive (if their protest wasn&#x27;t co-opted but are still mainly peaceful and still believe in electorialism), or an anarchist (if they do not believe in electorialism and are more interested in looting and smashing the police). A naive right-populist will see protesters destroying police stations and say that the Democrats are letting this happen and the left are all &quot;cultural Marxists&quot;, but in reality it&#x27;s a situation where anarchists are on the rise and the neoliberals are failing to take control over the &quot;peaceful&#x2F;orderly protest&quot; narrative. Actually, I don&#x27;t really know if the protestors participating in the violence are simply &quot;anarchists&quot;, maybe they are just uninterested in these labels and just want to wreck shit up as they are fed up by many decades of police suppression.')
