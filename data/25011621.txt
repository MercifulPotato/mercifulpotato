IMO software engineering is bad in many ways because we lack experience. And we do lack experience because we do not repeat what we do. Most developers work on legacy code that is older than their own stint at the company. Yet, the constantly ship new features. That means they are constantly working as maintainers and producers in parallel.<p>My suggestion would be to have dedicated producers and dedicated maintainers.
