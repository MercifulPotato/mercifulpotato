It isn&#x27;t mentioned on the Wikipedia page <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deprecation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deprecation</a> .

On the other hand, other people believed that everything that was deprecated might eventually be removed, which was never the intent either.&quot;<p>Or in Python, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0004&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0004&#x2F;</a> &quot; This PEP defines a procedure for removing modules from the standard Python library. Usage of a module may be &#x27;deprecated&#x27;, which means that it may be removed from a future Python release.&quot;<p>That terminology is still in use; in  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0632&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-0632&#x2F;</a> published last month, titled &quot;Deprecate distutils module&quot; you can read &quot;In Python 3.10 and 3.11, distutils will be formally marked as deprecated. ... In Python 3.12, distutils will no longer be installed by make install or any of the first-party distribution.&quot; That&#x27;s a two year period where it&#x27;s deprecated but not removed. Further in the text you can read &quot;Deprecate but do not delete&quot;, telling me they aren&#x27;t viewed as synonyms.')
