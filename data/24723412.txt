I&#x27;ve decked it out with 64GB Ram and a 2TB SSD. 8 Cores, 16 threads, boosting to 4,1ghz, 3 outputs capable of 4k 60hz, (2* dp over usb-c, 1 hdmi 2.0), 2 full size USB A Ports... and a lot more goodies all packed in a very supremely built chassis.<p>I couldn&#x27;t want for more, (ok Thunderbolt, but that&#x27;s not as valuable as everything else).<p>I&#x27;m VERY happy with it&#x27;s performance and couldn&#x27;t be more grateful that AMD is providing much needed competition in the CPU market, I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten a machine this powerful at this size otherwise.<p>So yeah, i&#x27;ll upgrade my Desktop to Ryzen 5950 once I get the opportunity, even if it&#x27;s just to hold more fire below Intel&#x27;s feet.')
