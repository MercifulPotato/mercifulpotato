It starts with Reagan&#x27;s SDI program, repackaged by each of the Bush&#x27;s. It&#x27;s like a booger we just can&#x27;t flick off. So they keep spending money without any real idea of how it fits into a deterrence policy.<p>It isn&#x27;t going to alter the strategy of an all out attack by China. And it won&#x27;t alter the outcome. It&#x27;s nonsensical to consider this worth the money without protecting specific targets. It&#x27;s not good enough to just randomly save a few cities.<p>If this is about DPRK, it&#x27;s an announcement in advance that your diplomatic strategy has a decent chance of failing.<p>If this is about giving a president defensive options, it&#x27;s not going to do that because they will just say &quot;these are really bad odds&quot; and go for a preventative&#x2F;preemptive strike instead. They know that too so you&#x27;ve just invited your adversary into a surprise first attack scenario as possibly their best chance.<p>It&#x27;s a nonsense program, and even more ridiculous to tweet about it.')
