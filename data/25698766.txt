That&#x27;s kind of an important qualifier. Signal has been steadily growing for a while, and while doing so, implementing plenty of features from other competing apps: disappearing messages came, stickers came, group video calling came, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re definitely going to overtake WhatsApp, but they&#x27;ve found a niche, are slowly expanding from there, and are doing so by implementing desired features. That&#x27;s how most social networks have gotten where they are. There&#x27;s no reason why Signal&#x27;s current feature set is forever set in stone.')
