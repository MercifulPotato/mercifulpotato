Even if there are people up there, we can&#x27;t tell if the gun is aimed at anyone or pointed &quot;low&quot; (into the top few stairs) or at a higher angle to aim at a person as it&#x27;s only a 10 degree or so difference in angle and we don&#x27;t see the full scene. All we can do is make assumptions, which isn&#x27;t helpful.')
