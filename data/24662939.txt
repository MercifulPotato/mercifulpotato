Considering that these gig economy services are mostly consumer facing I think you&#x27;d just see demand fall off a cliff if prices were raised by regulation.  The survivors would have high wages but unless some other employment option is available labor force participation will suffer.<p>I think if it was as easy as cranking the regulation knob to 11 someone would have already done it.')
