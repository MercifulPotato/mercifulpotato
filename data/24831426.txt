I picked that example because if you really need to talk with them, it&#x27;s not optional.<p>I <i>can&#x27;t</i> avoid Facebook to do that.  It&#x27;s not a convenience issue.  The local group is on Facebook, so I have to use Facebook to achieve my task.  There isn&#x27;t a &quot;less convenient&quot; alternative for me to use, if I need to talk to those people as a group.<p>I could try phoning someone in the group, or emailing.  That might get something to happen.  But it won&#x27;t let me achieve the basic task, which is to communicate with a particular <i>group</i> of people, i.e. all of them identified by some common interest.  The alternatives will just let me talk to one person who is connected to the group, with a different effect.<p>Well, that&#x27;s just my side.  But can we say the reason the group is on Facebook is due to convenience for the people who created the group?<p>It&#x27;s arguable, but I think probably not any more.  Most likely, the group was formed on Facebook because the people forming it were already on Facebook due to similar network effect pressures for other things they got involved in at some time, and for this new group, <i>if they picked a different platform, a lot of people they want to reach wouldn&#x27;t have the same level of access to the service they aim to provide</i>.  The task for them was to pick a platform lots of local people could realistically join.  If they had picked some forum on a private domain, or even a mailing list these days, realistically it wouldn&#x27;t have been as effective for the service they are aiming to provide locally.<p>So it&#x27;s network effects over many layers, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to sum that up as convenience any more.')
