I&#x27;ve often pondered what I would do in this scenario.<p>I have some hobby projects that I do purely for fun.  Feeling an obligation to work on them because other people find them useful would really drain me.  The point is to get away from work and rediscover the joy of programming, not add more work on top of work.<p>I guess I can just keep them private.  But if someone really happens to find them useful, I would be happy if they forked them for themselves.  Maybe a giant disclaimer at the top of the readme so I&#x27;m clear and upfront how the projects will be managed (they won&#x27;t be).<p>Regardless, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a problem I&#x27;ll never have.')
