But neither the Marxist nor especially the Leninist form of that is the same thing as the “socialism” pursued by non-Marxist socialists, and in non-Marxist socialism there&#x27;s no consistent role of socialism as a stepping stone to something else, whether utopian Communism or some other end-state.')
