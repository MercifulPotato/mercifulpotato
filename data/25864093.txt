Having a specific date where that arrangement ends doesn&#x27;t seem to be more flexible, if I wanted to leave in a month I would just give my notice and leave.<p>I&#x27;m in the same position as you career wise and I often get offers to join contract roles and they are very unappealing to me. When I do the math on the benefits I&#x27;d lose out on and the additional taxes, rarely are these offers competitive let alone when I factor in the greater volatility inherent in the arrangement and the lack of unemployment benefits. Also in my experience the recruiters pushing the contract roles are the most desperate and aggressive, that doesn&#x27;t lead me to believe these roles are all that high quality.')
