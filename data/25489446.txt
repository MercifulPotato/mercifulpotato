Two other huge games for me were H.E.R.O. [1] and Dropzone [2] (the latter a re-imagining of Defender), both of which have a lot in common with Fort Apocalypse.<p>Both are still extremely playable. Dropzone in particular has some great graphics for its time. It was made by Archer Maclean, who&#x27;s more known for International Karate&#x2F;International Karate+, which I also played incessantly as a kid.<p>Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy, and Pitfall 2 also come to mind as examples of classic early platformers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bpzN0fagzi8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bpzN0fagzi8</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VSJ5Iuv-0gU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VSJ5Iuv-0gU</a><p>&gt; At the start of the pandemic, a friend gave me all of his old Atari 2600 carts.

The graphics are terrible by any post-1982 standard, and the hand-drawn screenshots in the paper catalogs of yesteryear made it look worse, so hardly anyone bought it. But it&#x27;s actually a pretty good game. You can sit down with and play for several hours while relaxing, instead of gnashing your teeth and swearing at other players.')
