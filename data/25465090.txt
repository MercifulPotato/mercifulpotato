I didn&#x27;t even see weird glitching animations which I would have expected more of. Maybe this is worse for non-stealth playstyles I don&#x27;t know. But my experience certainly didn&#x27;t match what people write on the internet. So either I am just lucky or people were too hyped about it?<p>The most annoying thing IMO is that the pacing is a little to fast for my taste. Constant calls about <i>gigs</i> which are probably meant to keep people entertained. These are IMO unnecessary because the city is fascinating enough in its own.<p>This game already had me in tears and was certainly worth its money already. The characters and story is amazing. The depth of the world is amazing. Visual quality is amazing. Waiting will make it only better.')
