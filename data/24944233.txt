This type of statement tends to shut down discussion instead of encouraging it. We should be striving to come to a consensus on topics and to share perspectives - not to just throw our hands up because we might not have perfect knowledge.<p>Regarding QAnon, while media stories might be sensationalist, QAnon itself is a disturbing trend. QAnon originated in conspiracy theories (on 4chan) and is still promoting some pretty fringe theories.<p>In my opinion, the real danger of QAnon is their use of social media to take people further and further into their theories. I was disturbed when the &quot;save the children&quot; campaign was in full force on Facebook&#x2F;Twitter. I did not need a media story to tell me about QAnon in these moments, I could personally click on stories and follow the rabbit hole back to QAnon. They led to conspiracy theories about politicians trafficking children, the &quot;deep state,&quot; etc. These were not hidden - they were only a couple clicks away from the &quot;save the children&quot; posts that were trending. These types of conspiracy theories do not contribute to any sort of rational discourse - they only push people farther into the QAnon group.<p>I believe Facebook (and Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, etc) has the responsibility to not allow these &quot;rabbit holes&quot; that feed conspiracy theories. Otherwise, anyone with enough influence to generate these echo chambers can use them to influence large swaths of the public into believing things that have no basis in reality.')
