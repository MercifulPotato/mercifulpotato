Not only does it not show previews for thumbnails, it doesn&#x27;t even show the image in the detail pane. It just shows the registered application icon. So, you get a sea of big blue (E) Internet Explorer icons.<p>Not sure if this is a Chrome or a Windows thing, or if there&#x27;s a setting for it. But as a user, I clicked about a bunch and couldn&#x27;t find a way to see the actual images.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;NYHCDZw.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;NYHCDZw.png</a>')
