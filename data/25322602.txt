My (perhaps naive) idea about my problem these days is that we just train our brain to be distracted. I have tried to fix it by applying deep work techniques (get rid of distractions, plan what I&#x27;m going to do, plan the breaks, make sure to eat&#x2F;drink, etc). Basically I try to train myself (in a very Pavlovnian way) to enjoy concentration and hate mind wandering.')
