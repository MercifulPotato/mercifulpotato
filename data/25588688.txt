I&#x27;m using a cheap ESP-32 dev board to allow control from my phone via WiFi even when my computer is asleep. I went much smaller though - only 16 pixels, powered by an old phone charger.<p>This works for now because my primary use-case is ambient lighting when the room would otherwise be dark. I&#x27;m planning to build some larger-scale higher-density light panels to provide more illumination for those dark winter days.')
