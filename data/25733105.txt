An incorrect but an illustrative way to describe error messages for them is &quot;The programmer needs to suffer&quot;. They are any combination of cryptic, terse, complex, exposing internal machinery of the compilers and linkers etc. There are many reasons for this: computers were not powerful enough to afford better code analysis, parsing, backtracking etc; the users of the tools also knew the tools and could tinker with them etc.<p>&quot;New school&quot; is from late 2000s on. I usually say it started with Elm. Clear messages pinpointing the exact problem, solutions to problems inside error messages, error clarity as one of the priorities in language&#x2F;compiler&#x2F;tool design.')
