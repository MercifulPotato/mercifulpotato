Apple has been a case study in how vertical integration, and how designing software and hardware together, can yield immense performance benefits.<p>However, it would be a terrible move for interoperability. OEMs would be inclined to purchase Microsoft&#x27;s chips (MS&#x27;s vertical integration would mean that their chips would outperform the competition when running Windows), and Microsoft could in turn restrict their chips to the Windows operating system.')
