They are, but that&#x27;s not the problem. The problem is that the sensor package is impossibly tiny because <i>it&#x27;s a webcam</i>. You <i>need</i> more light--and by the standards of that tiny sensor package you are in fact sitting in an unlit room because it&#x27;s just not getting enough light not to crank up the exposure and kill your framerate.<p>This is a universal problem regardless of webcam and regardless of laptop manufacturer, even Apple.<p>To fix this, you either need to give it the light it wants or get a better sensor&#x2F;lens package--and in this case, &quot;better&quot; means &quot;bigger&quot;.<p>Which is why you buy a mirrorless camera when you&#x27;re serious about decent video in your office.')
