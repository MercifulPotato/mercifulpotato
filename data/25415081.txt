There&#x27;s little in the language to force you down that path, other than decades of it being the prevalent way Java is written, which bleeds into the standard library, core frameworks, and becomes the Java Way of Thinking.<p>Yes exactly, that&#x27;s why I personally stay away from Java. The language is totally fine, the tooling is also fine, performance is great, there&#x27;s everything there in theory to build and maintain great projects, however, the culture is atrocious and overengineering is everywhere. And that&#x27;s very hard to go against decades of culture momentum going this way.')
