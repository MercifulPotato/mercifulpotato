I don&#x27;t have the time to look into the detail here right now, but it could simply be a case of the conversion between the formats losing the the colour space data from the image?<p>The one group highly unlikely to blame here is web standards bodies, who don&#x27;t have anything to do with how image formats are rendered (it gets as far as defining the default colour space when none is provided, but that&#x27;s it). But I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s likely an image file problem rather than a display problem.')
