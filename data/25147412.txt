Downside is a slightly higher latency because address and command have to travel over them too, but this is amortized over the burst transfer.<p>The real problem with RPC is that devices has tiny capacity; 256 Mb today and max spec’ed to 8 Gb (yes, I am aware that they consider it a feature, but I don’t).  Also, it’s actually pretty expensive today compared to regular DRAM.')
