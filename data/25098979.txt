This is against every conviction I have as a citizen for whose freedom it is essential to have control over the machine that enables me to connect to the world and do my work. We are no toddlers, Apple does not need to put us in a walled garden, a promised land without any malware and danger (that‘s the promise, but in reality they want to control every aspect of their ecosystem, like an emperor that wants to tax every aspect of acting and movement in his land).')
