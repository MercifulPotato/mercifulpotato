Open every new website (the one which doesn&#x27;t have a saved container for it) in a new random&#x2F;untagged container - destroy that container and data&#x2F;everything when I close the last tab of that site<p>2. Unless I tag&#x2F;name that container for that website and then persist it the way you do - and give me one click operation to tag name and (maybe select an icon&#x2F;colour for that container)<p>3. What about giving website favicon as an option to the container icon<p>4. Get rid of those &quot;Oh you are opening this website B (container_B) from a website A (container_A) - do you want us to open it in container_B instead&quot;? &quot;Always&quot;? Yes! Yes! Make it default or give me an easy options to make it default damn it - give me an option the first time where I can mark &quot;always do this&quot;!<p>5. Do we really need special container for Firefox and then for the rest? Why not ship with a default already set container in the Multi Container add-on that&#x27;s Fb container?<p>There&#x27;s an option &quot;Select a container for each new tab&quot; but it&#x27;s not very helpful as it lets you just choose either one among all the existing containers, or &quot;No container&quot; and that is blocking pop-up.')
