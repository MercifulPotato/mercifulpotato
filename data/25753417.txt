No one gets special treatment when it comes to \nFDA approval, and this is the way it should be.<p>You can get fast tracked if you show superior effectiveness, meet an unmet medical need, or get rid of serious side effects of an existing therapy. We should look at ways to speed up this process, (in the grand scheme of things 9 months isn&#x27;t that long to wait to cure a disease) not eliminate it altogether. If we approved something that actually does harm, it will further undermine efforts to widely vaccinate the public. We already have issues with people trusting vaccines when there is no evidence of negative effects, I can&#x27;t imagine how hard it would be if we had another thalidomide on our hands.')
