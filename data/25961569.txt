Don&#x27;t &quot;boldly proclaim&quot; anything. Be humble, even as you keep this in mind.<p>I&#x27;ve been asked at traffic stops at least 3x, by police:<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t have any drugs in here, right? Don&#x27;t mind if I take a look?<p>What do you say?<p>&gt; Nope, no drugs!<p>Great, you&#x27;ve consented to a search.<p>&gt; No, officer, I don&#x27;t consent to a search of my vehicle.<p>They might still search, but now their search is without probable cause _and_ your consent, which means even if they _do_ find drugs in your car, your lawyer will be able to spring you easily.<p>Cops do take advantage of those who cannot afford lawyers, but a way you can set yourself up for success is guide the interaction in such a way that a lawyer would have no problem proving the cops violated their own guidelines.')
