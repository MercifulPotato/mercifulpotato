Fraud and scams are high margin activities, so bad actors can end up with more money to spend than a lot of legitimate developers.<p>It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous that we have real name policies for social networks, but the dev dependencies for a basic web app can have thousands of unnamed contributors.  We really need a low friction system where individuals can start signing their code with verified identities.<p>If I pull in 1k dev dependencies via NPM, I should be able to get a list of the 1k developers that signed off on those packages.  If no one is willing to step up and put their name on a package it shouldn&#x27;t be used by major projects like React, Vue, etc. IMO.')
