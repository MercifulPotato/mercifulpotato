Ideas are easy (well, not really, but most smart, aware people have them).<p>The differentiator is execution and the ability to network properly. Maybe try your ideas when you don&#x27;t have five college-aged kids and debt.<p>I had the idea for &quot;Slack&quot; 4 years before it came out. Seriously, _exactly_ the idea of Slack. I even semi-pitched it to Microsoft and they blew me off. I saw Napster&#x2F;(internet downloaded music) four years before 1999, but I suspect I wasn&#x27;t the only one. I started a knowledge base of company resumes at my consulting firm in 1995 and now that&#x27;s a billion dollar industry (we never finished it because coworkers hated the idea of their resume in a database).<p>I may be smart, but so far I have been unable to execute any of my billion dollar ideas. Being smart only really gets you so far. I did try to build a tech-ed company ten years ago (Textfyre) that would thrive in the Covid learning world, but we could never get funded.<p>Still swinging though. May be the one I&#x27;m working on now will connect. We shall see.<p>My advice to anyone with an idea? Learn how to execute. Join startups, read books, network with entrepreneurs, go to startupweekend (when Covid is over), learn how to build a solid pitch deck, a business plan, and a financial worksheet. These fundamentals are the difference in getting an idea to market. And finally, make sure you focus on customers. Not on your logo, business cards, a PR website, or even paid employees. Get customers. Get revenue.')
