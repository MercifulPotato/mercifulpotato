The tech burbs of Palo Alto , Menlo Park are not super walkable and you are relying on the BART and other public transport .<p>Even SF is not very walkable compared to Chicago, DC, Philly, Boston, etc. (All significantly cheaper than SF.) Even by American standards, the BART is a pretty second-rate metro. (And that&#x27;s not even counting the fact that nowadays it&#x27;s essentially unsafe at night, for single women, etc.)')
