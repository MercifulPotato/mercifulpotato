But back when this all started and every company that had my email sent the &quot;how we&#x27;re protecting our customers&quot; blast, it got me interested in not just staying at inbox-0, but trying to stem the amount of mail coming in.<p>This is unscientific, and obviously depends on activity that triggers transactional emails, but I&#x27;ve probably cut the amount of inbound email I get  by about 50%. I would say in an average week I get about 15-30 emails now.<p>So I&#x27;m just curious what the histogram looks like for HN readers. How many emails do you get each week that aren&#x27;t work-related?')
