For example, a project can tell if it has been forked but otherwise has <i>no</i> idea what the forker is currently doing!  Is the forker working on a possible future contribution (and worse, could that work be duplicating something that is already in progress elsewhere?).  There are also plenty of forks that seem to <i>never</i> evolve, not even taking the minimal effort of pulling recent upstream changes.<p>The contribution mechanism could be broken up into different phases, something like:<p>0. Visitor forks project but this should be <i>invisible</i>, i.e. it is not “your repository” for all to see, since you haven’t actually <i>contributed</i> anything to it yet.<p>1. Visitor clicks button stating “intention to contribute” that notifies upstream project immediately.  This includes information such as the nature of the proposed change.<p>2. The project maintainer then has the opportunity to communicate immediately, e.g. “sure!” or “please don’t do this, $SOMEONE_ELSE is already doing it” or “I don’t think that is a good idea” or whatever.  Then the project can put this into a visible state on the GitHub page so that everyone knows about this in-progress work.<p>3. Eventually the work is done, and is <i>converted</i> to a Pull Request as opposed to just appearing out of the blue.<p>4. Once accepted, the repository is publicly listed on your profile since you have made an actual contribution to it.')
