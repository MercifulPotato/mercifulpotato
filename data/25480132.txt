Hindsight is 2020 and resources are limited, if you let speculation without evidence rule the day you&#x27;ll be drowning in potential problems, most of which will never materialize.<p>Nobody is saying &quot;just ignore the new strains&quot;, they&#x27;re saying &quot;there is no reason to panic about new strains given the evidence&quot;, yes the evidence could change but that can be true of anything; you might wake up tomorrow to find out that new evidence suggests cell phone use increases risk of dementia, but there is no good reason to go around living your life like this might actually be true.')
