That’s risky, because it opens up debate on individual points that could throw the discussion off. I suppose it’s the style that I don’t appreciate, as I’d like for this information to be presented more like a medical report in layman’s terms than a heart to hear. Overall, Dr Morrow sounds exasperated. I don’t blame him for that.')
