People are careful about their own lives, which is probably a good survival mechanism.<p>What <i>specific</i> policy are you suggesting?  The more &lt;40 year olds that get the virus, the more virus there is. The more virus there is, the more people who are spreading the virus, the more people who can get the virus, including people at very high risk of dying or being disabled from it.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware no place has let the virus spread uncontrollably, think everything was fine, and not lock down at some point.  The policy clearly has to be somewhere in between fully locked down and fully opened up, and I&#x27;m not sure discriminating by age and health is going to be some magical solution.')
