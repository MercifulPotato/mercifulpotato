Item(by='quantified', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606177979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185527, text='Agreed on the role in a good-faith process: “this is the thing we all signed off on”.<p>Our loop is around whether or not we can establish who the “we” was. The original commenter was making a statement about the purpose of a signature and I was stating a disagreement with that purpose. At very best, we need to recognize multiple purposes. But since contracts all come down to what is supported by a court of law, it needs to be the right signature. If you’re saying the presence of a signature is all that is necessary, it’s perfectly fine for you to create a contract in which I pay you money and assign some mark that says I agreed to it. But you better be a decent forger then. Some of the ritual elements are in place to protect against bad faith.')
