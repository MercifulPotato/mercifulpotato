If the hub got detected last, it dropped to usb 2, if one of the monitors came online last, it would drop to 30hz refresh rate. Frankly - I was a little floored when I realized that I was the one being dumb and the system was mostly <i>still</i> just making things work. Just for shits and giggles I booted up an x-session after to see what it does.  The answer is lots of black screen.')
