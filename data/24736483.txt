Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=[24738371], score=None, time=1602300128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24734437, text='&gt; Concretely about this post: it seems really naive!<p>Proton Mail is not just an app. It&#x27;s going to be up to the courts to re-affirm that a private party cannot force another party to give them profits of an unrelated product.<p>These kinds of &quot;deals&quot; are partially what got the Teamsters in trouble and are characteristic of the criminal mobs (which included the mafia). &quot;I heard you have a second job selling stocks, be a real same if something happened to your app&quot; - classic protection racket.<p>Calling others naive does not make your stance compelling.')
