I appreciate that and will try to respond.<p>I didn&#x27;t consider your ideological preference when banning you. It would be the same if you were arguing for the opposite side, so no, I don&#x27;t see any irony—the logic seems boringly straightforward. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even know what ideological preference an account has—it turns out if you do something often enough, you can train yourself to mask out those bits.<p>Claims of &quot;bias and ideological blind spot&quot; about HN are legion, but they&#x27;re wildly contradictory. The people you disagree with make just as impassioned claims about how overrun HN is with bias in favor of <i>your</i> side. I could give you so, so many links...<p>I totally get how a cynic would trace this back to YC&#x27;s business interests, and there actually is a chain that connects HN moderation to that, but it&#x27;s different than the one you imagine. Here&#x27;s how we actually think about this: the way to maximize HN&#x27;s value to YC is to maximize how interesting it is to the community [1]. I know it might be hard to believe, but it&#x27;s that simple. It&#x27;s a rare treat to get to work on a problem where you literally only need to optimize for one thing <i>and</i> you know what it is [2].<p>The neat thing is that you can imagine this motivation to be as sinister and greedy and evil as you like, and it&#x27;s still awesome. If YC owns the leading place on the internet for good hackers to gratify their intellectual curiosity...that is crazy valuable [3]. Why would we manipulate HN for any other purpose? That would be stupid—it would lose us the good will of the community, which is the entire thing. Whichever way you slice this problem, YC&#x27;s interests are aligned with keeping this community happy. It&#x27;s a fortunate historical accident that we ended up in this position, and personally I feel grateful for that (because it allows me to do this job without much conflict of interest) and am pretty fierce about protecting it.<p>So how does this connect to banning you? Well, the things we ban accounts for—like snark, flamewar, attacking other users, ideological and political battle—are what causes a forum like HN to get less intellectually interesting. That&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t want flamewars. It&#x27;s not a moral or an ethical point. It&#x27;s just that flamewars are boring. They <i>feel</i>  like they aren&#x27;t boring, for a while, but that&#x27;s an illusion—it confuses high-activation with curiosity, and in reality those two are mutually exclusive. Once the anger and trauma have vented themselves, there&#x27;s nothing left, and people are left feeling bitter and disconnected from each other—hardly a condition in which to playfully explore the world.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to imply that the things you care about and are fighting for don&#x27;t matter. They do matter, a lot—and that&#x27;s true of the others as well. But this is an optimization problem. Our job is to keep HN interesting. Scorched earth is not interesting [4]. Therefore we have to ban accounts that take this place in that direction.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=yc%20business%20interests%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=yc%20business%20interests%20by...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20optimiz%20by:dang&amp;...</a><p>[3] I&#x27;m not saying HN is good at it—I wish it were better. The point is that the niche is so valuable that anything else YC might do to try to squeeze value out of it would be dumb. Also, it&#x27;s all relative: if the rest of the internet descends into flames and HN can manage to remain interesting, its value grows. We&#x27;re basically in an outrun-the-bear joke.<p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=by%3Adang%20scorched%20earth&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu...</a>')
