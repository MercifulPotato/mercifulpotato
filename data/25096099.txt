If you&#x27;re using software that the state deems to be subversive or &quot;dangerous&quot;, a developer certificate would make the nature of the software you are running pretty clear.  They don&#x27;t have to know exactly which program you&#x27;re running, but just enough information to put you on a list.<p>&gt; You shouldn’t probably block ocsp.apple.com with Little Snitch or in your hosts file.<p>I never asked them to do that in the first place, so I&#x27;ll be blocking it from now on.')
