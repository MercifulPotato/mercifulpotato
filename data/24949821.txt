Being rich alone doesn&#x27;t matter to me, I don&#x27;t give a damn what e.g. Jeff Bezos has to say about the matter.<p>Being a prolific author doesn&#x27;t mean much to me and neither does being an environmental philosopher in this context. Someone like Peter Singer definitely is an authority on environmental ethics, but on the effect of climate change&#x2F;the ecological state of the world I don&#x27;t see why anyone would consider him an authority.')
