I ended up chosing pfSense, because I thought it offered a better support. I regret now, especially that I only recently learned that OPNsense offers a free ET Pro (Telemetry)[1] subscription for Suricata, which is otherwise available to pfSense on a paid basis only.<p>Now I am looking to migrate to OPNSense, but unfortunately their backup files are not compatible and OPNSense does <i>not</i> make any effort to facilitate the migration ([2]), which, especially in light of recent pfSense controversies, is IMHO  a serous omission . Not that I am saying they should provide a &quot;one click wizard&quot; solution, but at least having a way to tell which of the pfSense backup sections are incompatible with OPNsense and need to be otherwise set up manually would be great.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.opnsense.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;etpro_telemetry.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.opnsense.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;etpro_telemetry.html</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opnsense&#x2F;core&#x2F;issues&#x2F;28#issuecomment-141755217" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opnsense&#x2F;core&#x2F;issues&#x2F;28#issuecomment-1417...</a>')
