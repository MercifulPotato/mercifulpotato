(I am the author of DataGridXL: I was very happy to see the lib reach the front page on Hacker News some three months ago.)<p>I have created editCSVonline for a number of reasons:<p>- It&#x27;s nice for anyone to not have to resort to Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel to edit a simple CSV file.<p>- I use simple tools like this (tools that aid developers) all the time: tools like JSON linters, favicon generators or SVG icon finders. This is my free help-a-fellow-dev web app.<p>- It promotes my product DataGridXL.<p>In many cases I have found that editing CSV files using editCSVonline&#x2F;DataGridXL gives better performance than Google Sheets, which I am quite proud of. Take a look at the DataGridXL performance demo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;demos&#x2F;one-million-cells" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;demos&#x2F;one-million-cells</a>) to see the difference with other data grids out there.<p>Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments!')
