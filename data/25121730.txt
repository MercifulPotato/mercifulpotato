But I still struggle to have a correct mental model of developping features on branches that you then merge into a very distant branch.<p>It is ok when you create a branch from develop, code your feature and merge back to develop.<p>But then things get messy: you need to backport that feature to some release branches.<p>And all that is asynchronous (backport feature « n+1 » but not feature « n » nor « n-1 » from develop onto branch 1.0 LTS and branch 2.0-SNAPSHOP. ok done? Perfect, let’s ship that.  Good feedback from users? Ok cool. Now do the same with « n-1 »)<p>you want to keep track of code movements between branches, so you use merge (not rebase or cherry-pick).<p>Pffffiou I honestly do not know how to handle that at scale with Git.')
