Good idea but the execution is lacking, I find the UI to be clumsy on full-page width. The font is too large and while I don&#x27;t mind monospace fonts usually, it does not look neat for me in this case.<p>And as others have mentioned, things are rarely a two-sided topic. Would it be possible to allow for a topic to have more than two sides? n-number of positions to take that are somehow pre-picked by the OP?<p>Also, as others have mentioned, how will you moderate it? Will you allow highly controversial topics like those regarding WW2 and race? Where will you draw the line? The quality of a forum is firstly decided by the people who post on the forum, but moderators decide who are able to post on a forum, so in effect, moderators end up being the final arbiters of forum quality in the end.<p>I would find it very interesting if there was a forum that was formal in tone, allowing people to sometimes border on offensive but never hateful topics. A forum like that would in theory perhaps allow most if not all voices to be heard and talk to one another? While such a place probably would not be pleasing to most, it seems like something the internet lacks at the moment.')
