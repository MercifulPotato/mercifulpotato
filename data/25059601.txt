Item(by='echelon', descendants=None, kids=[25061317, 25060284], score=None, time=1605111572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25059525, text='Nevermind the genocide, 1984 surveillance, censorship, technology stealing, punishment of the relatives of expatriated citizens, etc. China will leapfrog the West and devour our knowledge industries.<p>If you like the salary you make today, then think about what happens when China&#x27;s enormous supply of engineers working &quot;996&quot; gets access to the Western market. When their tech companies supplant our own.<p>We need to put in place immediate plans to shift manufacturing to Vietnam, India, Mexico, and Africa. We should duplicate the Belt initiative, but make partner nations our allies. Have them buy into our sphere of influence rather than be indebted to China forever.<p>We need to strengthen our allies and make this move to wean ourselves off of China together.<p>We have so many levers at our advantage. China has to import food and energy. Trade is still denominated in USD. And they&#x27;ve been horrible to other nations. It won&#x27;t be hard to stop their rise and replace it with our own growth if we work together with our allies.<p>Edit: I realize there&#x27;s a huge international audience here, but imagine saying these things in Shanghai. Or compare saying bad things about Xi and Trump. The West has to win. If China were free and democratic, I&#x27;d change my attitude in a second and maybe even consider moving there.<p>I also realize the West has a whole host of problems of its own: racial inequality, widening economic prosperity gap, etc. But I do believe our democratic model is vastly superior to one that criminalizes thought.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m sitting at -2 now, but upvotes keep pushing me back up. I expect once this falls off the front page that I&#x27;ll wind up with a positive score. This <i>always</i> happens with my negative comments on China. No detractions or conversation, only downvotes. I think this is due to the diverse international audience. I really wish someone with the opposite perspective would chime in.')
