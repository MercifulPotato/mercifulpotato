You are advancing a perfectly rational discussion and shame on anyone who just disagrees by downvote.<p>What you describe is an easy trap to fall into, doubly so in a world of imperfect and insufficient data like finance. You very rarely know the full picture and everything you work with is basically stochastic. Yet this stochastic nature can be easily hidden behind copious numbers that seem to add up. However, I&#x27;d like to avoid blaming the tool for this. Just as a hammer cannot be blamed just because it enables plenty of &quot;craftsmen&quot; to cobble together rubbish constructions.<p>Excel is an incredible enabler, and unfortunately it is indiscriminate in that it also enables people to do the wrong thing. The solution here is education I feel.<p>There&#x27;s also a flipside I often encounter by the way: analysis paralysis. Data analysis - whether we talk about sexy data science with python, Julia, etc on huge cloud server clusters, or good old boring pivot tables in excel - means that a lot of stuff can now be analyzed in minute detail. I&#x27;ve seen so many efforts get bogged down in a depth first search of fractal-like problems because one can find new and surprising things no matter how deep they dig.<p>Again I think the issue is not the tools, but the practitioners who still have plenty of learning to do in producing concise results that are easy to digest. I consider this a form of art.')
