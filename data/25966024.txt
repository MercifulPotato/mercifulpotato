Item(by='sova', descendants=None, kids=[25966787, 25966294], score=None, time=1611980676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965895, text='The infrastructure is run by private parties -- but since the advent of encryption it ought be possible to lay down some basic principles or precepts of the online denizen.  &quot;The Right to be Forgotten&quot; is a strong step in the right direction, but anonymity sometimes makes people act rashly -- which reminds me of the need for Nettiquette.  I believe the difficulty comes in guaranteeing backdoors for law-enforcement and crime-deterrence while still affording a strong level of privacy.  It&#x27;s unlikely that law enforcement will simply &quot;get used to&quot; the fact that encryption works and is difficult [and in the case of ECC likely intractable] to decipher.  The alternative is state-run applications and tech-companies with cross-sectional presence of politically inclined people, or some weird tryst of tech companies, lobbying, legislation, and law-enforcement that effectively elevates tech companies to governance level without the primary oversight of elections to place them there.  If there is a third option I&#x27;d love to hear it.')
