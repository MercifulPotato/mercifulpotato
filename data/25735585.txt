For example if you click verify it forces interactive verification. If you click the sessions and then click a session you can verify individual sessions. Of course you can&#x27;t non-interactively verify a users main key.<p>I&#x27;m also confused why each device is handled separately. I would rather I just share a key around (and ideally it rotates occasionally) and not share what and how many devices I have and what one I am using  at the moment.')
