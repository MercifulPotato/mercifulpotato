The important question is: is it certifiable for Civil Transport duties without MCAS?<p>The answer to that question, is no. The FAA themselves said as much.<p>Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll need to run back through my stack of MAX related literature to find it again to properly cite later, but I&#x27;m fairly certain it should be found in Final*, Executive Summary, high level description of the control system&#x2F;Conclusions...<p>I can bloody see the line seared into my forebrain, not that that means much. It&#x27;ll be out of the edit window, but I&#x27;ll come back with a cite unless someone else has the time and interest to do the digging before I get back to it.')
