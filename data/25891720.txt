Even 1 day per week that ends up being a day you sort of dread.<p>That said a 1.5 to 2 hour commute once a week is doable but that still only gets you to a closer to nature location. It doesn&#x27;t really give you the option to live in a different cheaper city if that&#x27;s what you want--which is what many people (not myself) are looking for rather than a rural house.')
