There are other means to guarantee rights that don&#x27;t inherently undermine themselves by directly infringing rights in the process.<p>The state is a protection racket. They claim to exist to defend you—mostly from other states, or other entities that do pretty much exactly what states do with without the false veneer of &quot;legitimacy&quot;—but in the end the only real threat to your life and property if you don&#x27;t do as they demand comes from the state itself. Unfortunately they&#x27;re a <i>popular</i> protection racket, with a large emphasis on PR and propaganda, so if you try to stand up for yourself your own neighbours will turn on you rather than joining you.')
