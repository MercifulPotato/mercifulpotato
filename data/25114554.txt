Everyone seems to have no issues about lecturing about masks, distancing, lockdown&#x2F;open...but apparently obesity is now a third-rail that can&#x27;t be discussed. Additionally, the &quot;progressive&quot; tendency to regard obesity as a harmless difference is incredibly pernicious but probably is another third-rail.<p>I absolutely believe healthy people are being punished to provide a cushion to obese people during this pandemic. Its too late to change the conversation now, but I will personally never again modify my habits or sacrifice my life for obese people. This thread really drives home how deeply invested people are in their excuses (I have no time, its stress-release, etc). That&#x27;s fine, you can cling to whatever you want, but I&#x27;m done changing for you.')
