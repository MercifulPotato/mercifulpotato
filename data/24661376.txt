Knock yourself out.<p>However, you seem ignorant of reality and of history.<p>In many cases the issue isn&#x27;t that most Americans are actively thinking about how inferior the minorities are.<p>It&#x27;s much more about the racist structures built into American society over the past 400 years.  We&#x27;ve been slowly (and much too slowly, to my mind) coming to grips with these issues.<p>In doing so, we&#x27;ve shed an enormous amount of blood.  Before our civil war, ~13% of our population was enslaved[0].<p>During that war, 2% of the population were soldiers  killed on the battlefield.  And the number of civilians killed is unknown, but likely substantial.  Imagine if wherever you live, 3% of the population were to be killed, vast swaths of your cities, towns, villages, farms and ports destroyed[2].<p>After the war, once the armies of the &quot;victorious&quot; side left the American south, tens of thousands of former slaves were, murdered, beaten, tortured or imprisoned.<p>Discriminatory laws were enacted and enforced[1] throughout the former Confederacy[5], and was continued in the West and Southwest[3][4], not just against the former slaves, but against those of Mexican, Native American and Asian descent as well.<p>Even in the North (with most of the population and nearly half the area) where slavery was illegal <i>before</i> the war, discriminatory practices against free blacks as well as former slaves was common.<p>But don&#x27;t forget that Catholics (Irish, Italians, etc.) and Jews were often discriminated against too.  Certainly not as harshly as people of color, but that existed, and still exists today.<p>For decades, legal discrimination persisted.  It was more than 80 years after our civil war before we <i>started</i> to dismantle the governmental systems that both implicitly and explicitly discriminated against nearly 15% of our population.<p>And over that time, all across the country many thousands were killed and abused with impunity.<p>That change came only because of the bravery and determination of the blacks in the US.  We would berate them, beat them and kill them for being &#x27;uppity&#x27;, but they never stopped demanding their right to be full American citizens.<p>And thanks to them, things have changed a great deal here in the US.  We still have issues of discrimination in housing, employment, over-policing and a raft of other areas.<p>But even in my lifetime (I&#x27;m over 50), I&#x27;ve seen significant positive change.  It&#x27;s not nearly enough, nor is that change coming quickly enough.<p>But it is happening.<p>These days, complacency and inertia are the biggest obstacles to positive change.  Many people just don&#x27;t think about it, or if they do, are content with knowing that <i>they</i> don&#x27;t discriminate.<p>Many have married&#x2F;cohabitate with those of a different ethnic background.  Many have children who do so.  This varies a great deal depending on where (remember, the US is <i>big</i>) people live.  In many places, there aren&#x27;t many people of color.<p>Diversity tends to be more within and sprawling around urban centers and many descendants of former slaves live in the south as well.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t a whole bunch of dyed-in-the-wool racists and white supremacists here in the US.  There are.<p>Not so long ago, the militant racists were roundly criticized and ostracized.  So much so that <i>most</i> of them wouldn&#x27;t express their bigotry unless they knew they were among those who shared their hateful ideas.<p>Now those folks are emboldened.  Their numbers haven&#x27;t really increased, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;ve attached themselves to other reactionaries who prefer the economic unfairness of our society.<p>The difference these days is that <i>factions</i> of certain political groups want to use bigotry as a political tool.<p>Yeah, we&#x27;ve got problems here in the US.  But you don&#x27;t repair 250 years of slavery and a 100 years of legalized discrimination overnight.  And you don&#x27;t do it in 70 years either.<p>This is a bleeding gash on American society that&#x27;s slowly healing.<p>I hope that I &quot;will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&quot;[6]<p>You may recognize those words, but read the whole speech.  It&#x27;s <i>almost</i> as much a demand for economic fairness as it is one for an end to discrimination.  Which, given the increased inequality we&#x27;ve been seeing, should give all of us some food for thought.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1860_United_States_Census" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1860_United_States_Census</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jim_Crow_laws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jim_Crow_laws</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2020&#x2F;sep&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-the-south-won-the-civil-war-review-heather-cox-richardson-donald-trump" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2020&#x2F;sep&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-the-south-...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c-span.org&#x2F;video&#x2F;?471923-1&#x2F;how-south-won-civil-war" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c-span.org&#x2F;video&#x2F;?471923-1&#x2F;how-south-won-civil-w...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Confederate_States_of_America" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Confederate_States_of_America</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinginstitute.stanford.edu&#x2F;king-papers&#x2F;documents&#x2F;i-have-dream-address-delivered-march-washington-jobs-and-freedom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinginstitute.stanford.edu&#x2F;king-papers&#x2F;documents&#x2F;i-h...</a><p>Edit: Fixed link references and subject&#x2F;verb agreement.')
