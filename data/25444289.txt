If he is just learning, emacs might be overkill. I was just simplifying the minimum requirements. But I agree with you about parens. This is not 100% popular but for a newbie I&#x27;d add the following recommendation:<p>Make sure your editor has parinfer available. Not parindent, parinfer. People swear by parindent, but you don&#x27;t need it on day one. Just try it later on. Parinfer is your friend.')
