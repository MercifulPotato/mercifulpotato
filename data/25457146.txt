Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608222987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25456811, text='Obviously not the coupe.<p>I’m not sure about ISOFIX anchors, but here in the US the LATCH anchor system actually has a relatively low weight limit, typically 40-65 lbs (including weight of seat) depending on how it’s installed. Beyond that weight limit, you’re supposed to skip the anchors and just use the regular seatbelt.<p>This would be an issue if you have 3 children that need rear facing seats. But given that we typically transition kids into forward facing seats between 1-4 years old, realistically you’d need twins or triplets before this is a necessity. A parent with 3 kids could attach a seat in the middle via seatbelts for the oldest child, and use the anchors on the outside seats for the younger child.<p>Not as convenient as a 3 row SUV, I’ll agree. But far from impossible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecarcrashdetective.com&#x2F;3-across-installations-civic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecarcrashdetective.com&#x2F;3-across-installations-...</a>')
