Think of HAML in regards to HTML for example: you can write nice DSL-specific code that gets translated into valid HTML code. (There is already a relevant module for that for Arturo, thought at a very experimental level: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arturo-lang&#x2F;art-html-module" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arturo-lang&#x2F;art-html-module</a>).<p>I&#x27;m thinking of the same thing for LaTeX (and perhaps even more sophisticated). One of my main &quot;businesses&quot; is centered around typesetting and electronic publishing, hence I&#x27;m a heavy ... LaTeX user.<p>Feel free to ask anything else. All suggestions and contributions are welcome! :)')
