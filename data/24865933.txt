The solution then is to never ever stop the car. And you may also need to fool the onboard gps and vision systems into believing the car is moving.<p>So in the future, a crappy old car will need to be left running 24 hours a day, in an augmented reality garage that fools the car into thinking it is on a long journey.<p>I would like to write a science fiction story from the point of view of a sentient car in that situation. But I have to write my code instead.')
