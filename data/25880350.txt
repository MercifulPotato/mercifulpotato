I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Between charging at home and charging at work, it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary to occupy the charger every single time you pull in. Maybe once or twice a week, depending on your commute. A long range Model 3 has as much range as your average gasoline vehicle... how often do most people fill that up?<p>Seems to me if 4000 employees go electric and you can slow charge anywhere from 5-30 miles&#x27; worth of power per hour at a worst case scenario and up to 44 at the best, then it stands to reason not everyone has to plug in every single day. In fact, I&#x27;d argue most folks would only need to charge up once a week, and for those with very short commutes, once every 2-3 weeks.<p>I think 250-500 chargers for 4000 vehicles would likely be sufficient to keep everyone charged up and moving around.')
