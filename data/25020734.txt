Item(by='ek750', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604790997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25019062, text='The dogma raise <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dygma.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dygma.com&#x2F;</a> that i recently obtained is the first backlit keyboard that I’ve seen that uses per key rgb backlighting in a useful manner.<p>It has 8 layers and is completely programmable including the backlight.  I set different colors on different keys for a layer so I can visually verify which layer I’m on.<p>Not quite the flexibility of what you mentioned, but it might be possible, as the firmware and programmer are open.  Kind of like what apple had in mind with their absurd touchbar, but with physical keys.')
