The rest of the industry combined has only a single fatality.<p>You are missing the point.  Tesla is the industry leader in fatalities primarily because they have such a huge lead in the number of miles.  Miles are not directly comparable to each other because each company has a different approach, but Tesla&#x27;s fatality rate is 1 every 800 million miles. Waymo appears to be the leader among the rest of the industry with 20 million miles.  How can you predict Waymo is safer than Tesla at this point?  They  may end up being safer, but it is way too early to say that right now.')
