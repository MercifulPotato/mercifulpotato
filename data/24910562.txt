It used to be time-consuming to draw complex, colorful characters onto paper, so our written language evolved away from them (although, some pictogram-based languages did emerge, 日本語, 中文). But with computer text, suddenly emojis are much cheaper to write, and are given consistent definitions. On top of that they can convey information in a way text can&#x27;t.
