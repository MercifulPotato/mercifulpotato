When I got back to it to check it out again on the desktop the page is missing CSS (firefox) and from the text I thought it really was some server hosting.<p>I was wrong. I checked again and on Chrome you have the full site and if I am not mistaken, for $5 for three months you get a mastodon, a matrix (and a xmpp) identity which is pretty cool (or it&#x27;s cumulative, I don&#x27;t know. But $20&#x2F;y for messaging should be okay, though it&#x27;s still far away from whatsapp $1 subscription).<p>This page needs some love but it&#x27;s exactly what I had in mind :).')
