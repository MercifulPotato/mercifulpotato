New tractors get much better fuel mileage<p>Some do, some don&#x27;t but this is mostly true (which is why the farmer in question is re-powering the old tractors).<p>&gt; 2. New tractors have technology that can go a long way to making the payments on them<p>This is pretty flatly false. Whatever monitors, guidance, and steering technology (which is all I can think of that you might be referring to) is available for these tractors as well.<p>&gt; 3. New tractors have a lot more operator comfort and if you&#x27;re putting in eighteen hour days that&#x27;s important.<p>This is also addressed with new seats and making the cab air-ride in the article.<p>But then these upgrades are why I think this in particular is a false economy, he is spending a lot on these old tractors!<p>Gently used is still pretty pricey, newer year but high-hour tractors are where I always feel the sweet spot is, a 9,000 hour 2005 model tractor is pretty cheap and is also pretty good in most cases.')
