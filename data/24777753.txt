It helps with onboarding as well. I&#x27;ve been in situations where depending on the `:latest` tag of a base image caused different versions of that image to be used on different machines, resulting in developers having weird issues that no one else was having (&quot;I thought Docker was supposed to solve this!&quot;). Now, I only use non-specific tags like `:latest` or `:12-alpine` before I distribute the Docker image, by either collaborating with others or pushing it to Docker Hub. It just gives me peace of mind to know that others are building on the exact same stack as I was building on.')
