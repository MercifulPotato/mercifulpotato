Literally everyone I know who watched the presentation thought it was an ad by Verizon to push their stupid 5G network with stupid examples that made it seem like you didn&#x27;t have internet access before. This stupid thing is the reason why the iPhones have a little discolored patch on the right side. I hope Apple got paid well for it, because the amount of damage this entire thing has done to their brand is fairly deep.')
