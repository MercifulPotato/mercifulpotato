It might be more helpful to think of them as tools with a specific purpose.<p>So if you have, for example, cystic fibrosis, you have a defect in a cell channel called the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) and its job is to handle traffic of specific molecules into and out of the cell.<p>So your question is a little like asking &quot;Why can&#x27;t the cell just spit out random tools that randomly do different things?&quot; And the answer is that it&#x27;s not helpful to the cell if wrenches sometimes randomly morph into hammers or screw drivers when you ordered X number of wrenches because DNA is the blueprint instructions for creating this tiny little factory of life called a <i>cell.</i><p>It&#x27;s coded to create wrenches and it&#x27;s coded to create a specific number of wrenches and it&#x27;s not necessarily more useful for misfolds to turn into random other tools instead of the pile of junk that misfolds create.')
