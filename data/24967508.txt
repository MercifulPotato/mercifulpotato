That created some ambiguity in my head. Perhaps you disagreed with that specific point? Perhaps you were calling into question that specific point because the source is bad? That&#x27;s why I asked for clarification. No ill will.<p>Could be my interpretation. My apologies. No need to be snarky about it eh.')
