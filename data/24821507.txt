Let&#x27;s see.<p>I experienced the same thing with paradox of choice. Unfortunately the solution was just to spend a lot of time on it, trying different things and researching options by asking people and doing internet searches and browsing malls and outlets. Going from &quot;no good clothes&quot; to &quot;all good clothes&quot; took me a full year of off-and-on effort.<p>Most important thing is finding things that fit. I didn&#x27;t used to know what this looks like, but by trial and error and feedback from others I learned. Personally I aim for things that fit snugly without being too tight. I think a good mental rule of thumb (at least as a straight man) is to think about what looks attractive on a woman-- things that tastefully emphasize her figure. I realized the same goes for men. You want clothes that show your body&#x27;s lines. This means jeans that aren&#x27;t baggy, but which show off your legs and gluts. It means shirts that bring out your chest and shoulders or which simply mesh with the lines of your figure.<p>A really important thing is feedback. Women friends are best for this because usually they&#x27;re much more aware of style than men are (just how it is). DO NOT ask parents or older relatives; do not ask male friends unless they have notably good style. In general you want feedback from women who you know well enough to trust them to be honest with you.<p>The &#x2F;r&#x2F;malefashionadvice subreddit can be very useful, it&#x27;s a mine of recommendations, discussions, and guides.<p>Lastly, a general outline of what I went with, just to give starting ideas:<p>-I wanted a collection of well-fitting t-shirts. I ended up mostly going with v-necks from Uniqlo, personally-- they&#x27;re cheap but fit me well. There&#x27;s a million options for simple t-shirts, from Target to Banana Republic to Tom Ford. Frankly you can go cheap here and be fine.<p>-I wanted an assortment of well-fitting jeans. I ended up with Everlane, tailored Levis, and Diesel, in different shades of blue and black. I&#x27;m still looking for chino pants that work for me.<p>-I wanted a wide array of button-up shirts. This is important because it&#x27;s just the cornerstone of modern male fashion. Nothing gets noticed faster than when someone switches to wearing these, imo. I get these from all over: Macy&#x27;s, Banana Republic, Express, Armani Exchange, Club Monaco, and Levis. Make sure they&#x27;re not baggy! Wear them over a t-shirt and roll your sleeves up, it&#x27;s a great look. <i>Leave the top two buttons open.</i><p>-I wanted a wide array of shoes. I literally wore white New Balance sneakers for 27 years until moving to NYC and being shamed into diversifying. I found that boots come in many varieties and look fantastic with jeans. I have a pair of Timberlands, some cheap black leather Polar Fox ones from amazon, some suede Steve Madden boots (cadwyn), and some Rockport tennis shoes.<p>I also got some sweaters and better-fitting sweatshirts. I&#x27;m still working on finding a winter coat that looks nice. Scarves are great!<p>Apparently you live in London, so you&#x27;re in one of the best places in the world to buy clothing (along with NYC and Paris). You can find anything there.<p>All in all I think I&#x27;ve spent around $2500 on the full wardrobe, but you could get away with less.')
