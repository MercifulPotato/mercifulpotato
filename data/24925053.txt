At least, I for my part could never imagine ever willingly giving up a &quot;real feature&quot; (my perception!) like xdotool for the cosmetic benefits of no tearing (which to me feels like a problem on the importance level of &quot;getting the blinky blue LEDs on your GPU fan to work&quot;), but at the same time there is clearly a large number of people on tech support forums, stackexchange etc. to whom it is of show-stopping significance, as evidenced by the effort and time put into achieving non-tearing and how often it is presented as a self-evident killer feature of systems like Wayland.')
