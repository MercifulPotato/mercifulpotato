I just came here to study and want to return once I am done. But one thing I can say for sure, back in my home country I never worked as hard as I did in America. In America, I worked my ass off, I feel like its the robust education system that made me this person. I enjoy studying&#x2F;working more than going outside and partying. I feel America helped me discover more about myself than I would have ever learned in another country. I thank America and its predecessors who created such a beautiful country.')
