I could write a book on this, but suffice it to say, I didn&#x27;t have confidence in my own vision until I took the time to really look at others and realized that the main difference between me and the average idiot was that I had bothered to look at the ideas of other idiots at all. It was like their entire  ontology had become an ant farm. It was the moment I realized, I am a super-idiot.<p>I only half joke, because becoming a super-idiot liberated me from the perfectionism and the addiction to approval that caused a stultifying and primal narcissistic fear of criticism.<p>If you are struggling with this, take it from someone on the other side of it: It&#x27;s ok, you&#x27;re an idiot.')
