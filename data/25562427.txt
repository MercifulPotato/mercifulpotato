Television manuals used to contain hardware schematics, car manuals used to be way more detailed, etc.<p>Apple also had detailed info on their hardware. The Apple II reference manual had schematics, mapped it to the PCB, described what each part did, described 6502 assembly and had an assembly listing of the monitor ROM. The only thing missing to build a copy, I think, was an assembly listing of the Basic interpreter.<p>The phone book edition of Inside Macintosh also had info on the hardware, but a lot less of it.')
