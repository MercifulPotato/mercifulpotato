I have been wishing there was an accessible database-ish software for doing my accounts, as the current mega-spreadsheet I use is pretty hairy and none of the specialised apps quite fit the bill. The closest thing seems to be Airtable, which while nice, is quite expensive.<p>Recently I was visiting hospital quite a bit (ante-natal) and witnessing the horror of the massive NHS form filling software the nurses and midwives have to use. It&#x27;s clunky and sprawling but one of the main sins I think is it&#x27;s lack of adaptability. In the old days of pen an paper, a new form could be written, or adapted, and photocopied easily, and on-site. Now if a new field needs to be added or a process is changed it needs to go (I imagine) to some centralised IT development office and fed into a ticketing system where it might get changed in a few weeks or months. There&#x27;s no room to quickly adapt at a ground-level, so you end up with things like this excel sheet problem.')
