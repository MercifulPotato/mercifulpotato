I think if Apple generates that message or its triggered, then it&#x27;s one-shot - if the user says &quot;No&quot;, it will never be seen again (to be clear, to me and most, this is desired behavior).<p>So instead you have the app asking things like this, or &quot;can we send you notifications?&quot;, and so if you say no, it can ask later, and not trigger the OS interaction until just-in-time.')
