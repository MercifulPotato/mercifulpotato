They have this overconfidence, but flop on the next release and patronize the dev team about perf.<p>1) tracked from the beginning so it is drained from the system merge by merge<p>2) architected in at the design level and not applied as a spell.<p>I really like what the rust team is doing with tracking rustc compilation times.
