You&#x27;re right that we need to be aware of what remote-hiring &quot;competitors&quot; do too, and we certainly try to follow for example the discussions that pop up here on HN once in a while (e.g. GitLab, Stripe, VMWare recently).<p>To comment on your question specifically, a drawback would be that if we paid only Swedish market rates we would struggle to hire good candidates in places like Switzerland or the U.K. At some point we may need to formalize compensation structure, but for now we care more about finding the right people to work with regardless of where they are located and if the match is right we&#x27;ll try to find a solution that makes everybody happy.')
