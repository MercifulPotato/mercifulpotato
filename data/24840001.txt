(They&#x27;ll happily use their market dominance to wring every last penny out of their suppliers and their employees, though.)<p>Simplifying greatly, this is the main difference between antitrust laws in the EU and the US: the EU doesn&#x27;t really have the concept of a benevolent monopoly. In the US, you have to make a strong case that the company is engaging in anticompetitive practices.<p>Notably, this has less to do with how the alleged monopoly treats its own customers than with how it treats other companies in the same space.')
