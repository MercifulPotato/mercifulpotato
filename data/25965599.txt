Nor did they use the same protocol: testing weekly with a swab and detecting and informing the participant of a positive status will get that person to report symptoms to the trial more often than if you don&#x27;t.<p>They use similar measures of efficacy but they&#x27;re not the same thing and are not perfectly comparable.  Still, it seems very likely that the mRNA vaccines are much better than AZ.')
