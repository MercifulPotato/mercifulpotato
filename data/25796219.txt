Many smaller companies built their entire businesses using Clojure stack.<p>The days when Clojure was just &quot;a toy to impress your friends&quot; are long gone. It&#x27;s a mature ecosystem for the serious craft.<p>Today it&#x27;s the most widely used FP language; it has gained popularity and doing better than OCaml, Erlang&#x2F;Elixir, Elm, Haskell, F#, and even Scala.<p>Clojure is slowly but steadily growing. Without any support from the big players. I think the core Clojure team has fewer people than teams at Facebook and Google for front-end libraries like React and Angular.
