So you get user management, but you also need to use their template and plugin system (so Java for Keycloak) and you can&#x27;t use a different OAuth2 provider because well - you use Keycloak. I really love the projects and they have their use cases - with Ory however, you simply pick what you need:<p>- Login, registration, mfa, user management, password change, account recovery, ... - Ory Kratos: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ory&#x2F;kratos" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ory&#x2F;kratos</a><p>- Permission management, roles, who is allowed to do what - Ory Keto: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ory&#x2F;keto" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ory&#x2F;keto</a><p>- OAuth2, OpenID Connect Provider that you &quot;connect&quot; to your user management (e.g. Ory Kratos) - Ory Hydra: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ory&#x2F;hydra" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ory&#x2F;hydra</a><p>- A &quot;middleware&quot; which checks if requests are authenticated (who is the caller?) and authorized (is the caller allowed to do that) - Ory Oathkeeper: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ory&#x2F;oathkeeper" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ory&#x2F;oathkeeper</a><p>It&#x27;s a bit like lego where the other projects are more like the full car you buy. The car might use little fuel but it&#x27;s slow and you can&#x27;t change that. The lego parts you can combine any way you want.<p>Plus, Ory is written in Go and we aim for supporting planet-scale distributed data stores to support global deployments with low latency, and other cool stuff!<p>The last point, we are actually building out a cloud service (think CockroachCloud without the licensing issues), which means that you don&#x27;t buy a support contract from IBM but instead get everything with a few clicks! Kinda like Auth0, Okta, or Firebase - but with everything open source (maybe like sentry.io?)')
