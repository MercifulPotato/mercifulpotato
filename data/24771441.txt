When you have 1K or even 64K of RAM and need to run for a while the only way to be sure you never run out of memory is not to use malloc at all. Fragmentation is a thing. This may mean managing fixed collections of objects much like the allocators in the article, but the linker figures out where to put them at compile time.')
