She has helped me out of a tight corner medically. I would like to return the favor. I hope to help her make a website to create a portfolio of her work. I also plan to optimize it for local search. Because it is a favor, I don&#x27;t intend to charge.<p>I want to setup something very low maintenance (domain, blog etc) that she can manage herself. It is going to be low traffic.<p>For my blogs, I host wordpress on a digitalocean droplet. I am looking for something simpler for her.<p>Do you have any suggestions?')
