I also spent a lot of time fighting with Redactor, the WYSIWYG editor that often messes up the &quot;WYG&quot; part. I still have to clear the cache manually using the command line. I&#x27;m used to this workflow, but I&#x27;m not sure I could teach another editor to use it.<p>Mission accomplished!')
