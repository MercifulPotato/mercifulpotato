However, where I disagree is that you seem to expect us to simply &quot;face the truth&quot; that the discrimination exists; you&#x27;re deploring the existence of alternate possibilities!<p>&gt; Some <i>even venture into the possibility</i> that a black person complaining about being passed over for promotion might just not be good enough for the job and then just blame discrimination <i>rather than facing the truth</i> (pure gaslighting). [emphasis mine]<p>Let&#x27;s consider the possibility, but please don&#x27;t expect us to just accept it&#x27;s true.  And please don&#x27;t expect us not to consider other possible alternatives.')
