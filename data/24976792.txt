Item(by='fyfy18', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604382927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976452, text='eBay has a lot of different use cases. Although it was originally for selling your second hand junk, now I expect a lot of their sales come from new items.<p>In my country eBay doesn&#x27;t exist (i.e. they don&#x27;t have a localised site, you can sell on other country sites though). The main &#x27;second hand junk&#x27; services are:<p>- a local version of Craisglist<p>- Facebook Groups (for hyper local listings, mainly for very cheap or free stuff, e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m moving tomorrow, come get my half destroyed IKEA furniture&quot;)<p>- Vinted [0] - although it&#x27;s intended for second hand clothes, a lot of people sell new items they bought in sales from other countries, so it&#x27;s more like eBay in this retrospect<p>For new items Etsy (crafts and furniture) is quite popular.<p>For electronics Tindie (although it&#x27;s custom &#x2F; DIY, rather than &#x27;random adapter that only 5 other people worldwide have bought this month&#x27;). Most of the time when I want some sort of electronics that I can&#x27;t find elsewhere I will buy from eBay in another country (using a shipping service) or AliExpress (then wait 2 months).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;27&#x2F;vinted-the-second-hand-clothes-marketplace-raises-141m-at-a-1b-valuation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;27&#x2F;vinted-the-second-hand-clo...</a>')
