More generally, it&#x27;s a &quot;design smell&quot; for me to see something like this:<p><pre><code>        &#x2F;&#x2F; define a new timely dataflow computation.\n        timely::execute_from_args(std::env::args(), move |worker| {\n</code></pre>\nWhy would something as fundamental as creating a new dataflow need a comment?  In other words: why is that not self-evident from the syntax?<p>Not to denigrate the technical accomplishments. And elegance&#x2F;readability is a very personal thing.  But it does seem jarring when the language constructs don&#x27;t obviously map cleanly to the design intent.')
