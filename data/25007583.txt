The problem is many teams with 5 Ruby programmers is doing what 100 Java programmers&#x27; work. There would usually be many teams in Java projects, and nobody have full picture of the project. Then people would create jobs out of nowhere because they have to do something... Just see how many projects have dedicated teams writing piles of code for Kubernetes.<p>I would rather hire much fewer elites for higher price instead.')
