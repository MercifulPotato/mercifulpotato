If you&#x27;re going to get a significant fraction of the human race living off Earth you&#x27;ll need to build something nicer than Earth, and Mars doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>Giant ring-shaped space stations like the orbitals in the Culture series seem like the way to go. You can build enough of them for a population of trillions simply by disassembling the moon, and build them with climate, gravity and aesthetics that are pleasing to humans.<p>Mars is probably a necessary first step, but it&#x27;s small fry.')
