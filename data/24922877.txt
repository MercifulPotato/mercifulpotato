Or for OpenBSD 4.4?<p>I think the state of support for Linux and open source in general is much, much worse than for commercial software.<p>No one is maintaining &gt;10 year old software. Especially not for free.<p>Do note that this is not a story about not being able to run Win 7 anymore - it&#x27;s simply about having it more difficult to release and install new drivers on it.')
