One of Nietzsche&#x27;s central tenets is that pretty much all &#x27;knowledge&#x27; and &#x27;belief&#x27; is just us projecting our interpretations (rooted in what we would now term cognitive biases, value judgements, sensations, etc) on reality and then &quot;reading&quot; them back to ourselves as the ground truth, which is in fact unknowable as such.<p>In general, Nietzsche regards philosophical attitudes as determined by physiology and environment, and in fact says later that Stoicism is a fine medicine for certain kinds of people in some periods of time.')
