I believe there are other products that DO do that to some extent, though.<p>However, taking out that premise, it still looks interesting, and I would love to try it out. I tried to get someone on one of the static site generators but just getting everything setup on their computer and then teaching them the needed workflow was not trivial, and not something I would try again with anyone less tech-savvy or without being there with them during setup and teaching. I&#x27;ve seen platforms that simplify, but then you are paying a fee again for that too.')
