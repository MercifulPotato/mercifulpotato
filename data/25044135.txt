It should probably be possible to disable&#x2F;reneable it using a menu option and an optional toolbar button.<p>- actually disables <i>all</i> telemetry when you try to disable telemetry<p>- optional but recommended: a &quot;getting started wizard&quot; where you select your preferred search engine, if you want to install TST or Sidebery, and if you want to set memory consumption to sane defaults.<p>- otherwise works exactly like Firefox<p>- Charge $50 a year, possibly more.<p>I&#x27;d probably sign up immediately.<p>Questions:<p>Q: what if Mozilla finally gets it and implements this?<p>A: Fine, just go to the next thing they broke.')
