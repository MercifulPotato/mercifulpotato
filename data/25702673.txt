Thanks in advance.<p>The way to slow China&#x27;s growth most efficiently is through economics; it&#x27;s not the people of China that we want growth to slow for, the purpose and intent is to take power away from the CCP - to free the people of China, as in America and other Democracies, we inherently trust - have faith - that individuals can make the right, good, best decisions for themselves.<p>&quot;Moreover actions of China in Hong Kong are supported by majority of people in China&quot; - this is the functional result of control-oppression systems on free speech with threat of a spectrum of potential harm that can come to you, your family, even your place of work. This isn&#x27;t the positive argument point you think it is. The CCP can control the narrative and suppress the truth as they see fit.<p>&quot;Given the way US president pardoned people who committed genocide...&quot; - this is a very weak argument considering the US compared to the China is an apples to oranges comparison to begin with: every 4 years the US has an election vs. in China it&#x27;s the CCP in control always; this is a weak foundation to argue from on its own. It&#x27;s an even weaker argument when you don&#x27;t understand that Democracy - and the freedom to vote - is literally polling the population to understand that state of the union, of the nation, their health and their beliefs. Trump is a symptom of multi-generational dis-ease progression, where the efficiencies of capitalism, along with the duopoly that&#x27;s been able to form and solidify - along with the regulatory capture that has occurred for 4+ decades, industrial complexes and bad actors tightening their grip of society by extracting more and more resources from the average person, and allowing suffering and dis-ease progression to occur. Mainstream media has played a role as well, the amalgamation of it into just a small handful of controllers - for TV and newspapers - has allowed the narrative to be more easily controlled; not as much as the CCP&#x27;s control but it gets close to it, resulting in only 2 main narratives - of the duopoly. Itâ€™s incorrect, a mistake to believe Trump is America, he simply made his way up through broken-weak systems that I just described - that exist via currently inadequate policy, this current state - status quo - that we can and have learned from - and will evolve from with new, updated policy to help steer, right this ship called America.<p>Sorry but the &quot;no deaths&quot; is a false dichotomy - the treatment of these people can be like of the Uighurs if they don&#x27;t fall in line with whatever rules they want to enforce; and certainly the CCP will be looking into everyone in HK&#x27;s past to then see what they should do with them on a case-by-case basis.<p>&quot;China is built by hard work of its people not by CCP.&quot; - you&#x27;re injecting an argument that that makes it seem like I or other people believe Chinese people aren&#x27;t hard workers? I bet no reasonable person would put forward that argument, no reasonable person would think Chinese people are lazy. It sounds more like propaganda&#x2F;narrative that the CCP would want to perpetuate to try to demonize the &quot;other&quot; - so the Chinese population will think &quot;we&quot; think lesser of them, to cause them to dislike, be angry with, or hate &quot;us.&quot;<p>The majority of reasonable people of Democratic nations only want the best for the Chinese people, and the majority are reasonable - however there are for example the ~74 million Americans who have been mislead, manipulated, by Trump, the captured Republican party and mainstream media that these people watch - to believe Trump was the answer to &quot;Make American Great Again&quot; - except Trump isn&#x27;t an entrepreneur or a businessman, he&#x27;s a con artist and a pathological liar, and archetypical narcissist; someone like Andrew Yang, who&#x27;s an entrepreneur and has been successful, learning through experience and understanding the foundation, math, and exponentials of how policy propagates - is the type of person, along with his holistic-foundational policy proposals, are the polar opposite to Trump; and the slogan play of MATH - &quot;Make America Think Harder&quot; is simply a beautiful refinement and contrast to MAGA.<p>And seriously - we only want the best for the people of China, and a foundational part of what&#x27;s best for EVERYONE in the world - to avoid the pitfalls of tyranny and avoid potential scenarios like Uighurs &quot;re-education&quot; camps (genocide by internationally agreed standards) - is freedom of speech.<p>Happy to continue this discussion or clarify anything.')
