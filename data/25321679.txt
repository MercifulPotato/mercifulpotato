My 486 PC could run UNIX, was 32-bits, was on par with with the MIPS-based DECstations (also faster than VAXstations) and yet was an order of magnitude cheaper.  It did take a while though- a decade later people were still using SUN workstations because the high-end EDA tools were not yet ported to Windows (well 1990 was before even Windows 3.1).')
