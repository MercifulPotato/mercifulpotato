Even though I spend many years in Asia at that point, and had gotten used to the culture, Tokyo was different. After a few days that feeling wore off, and the things that were different compared to other cities just became normal. I went back last year, and I&#x27;m still amazed by the city, but there&#x27;s not really many things that stand out anymore.<p>But one thing I&#x27;ve learned after almost 10 years in Asia, things that look &quot;weird&quot; to Westerners, are often completely normal to people living in Asia. And things that are &quot;normal&quot; in the West might be weird to people in Asia. (That really goes for any kind of cultural difference)')
