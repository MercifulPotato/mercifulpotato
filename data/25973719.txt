I do understand that with Mozilla&#x27;s increasingly limited resources and ever decreasing market share it is a hard for them to put those resources into supporting PWAs.<p>However, this just brings us one step closer to being at the mercy of the walled-off gardens of app stores (Apple, Google, Microsoft).<p>I would like to see more competition and diversity in adding more powerful APIs and features to browsers, so we can bypass those app stores. Strangely enough only Google seems to be working on it.<p>Anyone worried about deplatforming of apps should focus on demanding PWA support from browsers and OS, especially Apple (who vigorously defend their walled garden). Requiring greater support for PWAs is a better short-term and long-term solution to deplatforming than any ideas about changing laws.')
