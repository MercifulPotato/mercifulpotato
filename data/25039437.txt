It&#x27;s the right, as according to current American politics because that&#x27;s the context.<p>The world. Historical American politics. A larger context. I&#x27;m repeating myself and you&#x27;re ignoring it. Please stop asking questions that have already been answered. If you have objections to using a larger context, state them, but don&#x27;t pretend I didn&#x27;t answer your question already.<p>&gt; Things would be different still if we went back to the Civil War or Ancient Greece.<p>Yes. You can pick specific contexts in which the modern american republican party was downright progressive. But you have to cherrypick those contexts, as you just did. Saying &quot;world politics today&quot; is a fairly objective measure, is it not? I mean there are even parties in Europe that are right-of-the-Republicans, so it isn&#x27;t as though they&#x27;re the furthest right. It&#x27;s just that the Europeans call those parties fascist, and in some cases the parties embrace that label. Here people get annoyed when you do that.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not, I&#x27;m asking simple questions that go unanswered. The only reasoning I received was that you want people to recognize a shift. But since you claimed that the shift was being &quot;ignored&quot; as marketing and propaganda, isn&#x27;t highlighting that shift effectively the same?<p>You&#x27;re still ignoring it, and we&#x27;re still discussing semantics, not politics. Do you want to have a productive conversation, or do you want to keep avoiding discussion of actual policies?<p>&gt; I find it more so actually since politics changed naturally so it&#x27;s the activist position to claim what the parties &quot;really&quot; are based on a selection from the past.<p>I can&#x27;t parse this.<p>&gt; And immigration refers to people, not trade. Clinton made this speech [1] in 1995, but if any Democrat made the same speech today they would be vilified. That shows the left hasn&#x27;t shifted to the right at all, they shifted even more to the left.<p>This is the first time you said the word &quot;immigration&quot;. I&#x27;m done.')
