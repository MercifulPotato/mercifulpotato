We can either embrace it and reap the rewards or we can cede the market opportunities to China and others.<p>The laws of physics are irrelevant, we already have the technology to accomplish most of what we need. And regarding the laws of economics, we are in a period of record low inflation (according to the fed) despite record low interest rates. As such, this would be a prefect time to make the transition to clean tech. There is tons of capital floating around desperately seeking returns, and a little inflation would be very welcome right now.')
