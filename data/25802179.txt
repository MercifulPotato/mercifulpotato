Java doesn&#x27;t. C, C++, Haskell, OCaml don&#x27;t. In OSes, Windows and Mac OS don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m actually struggling to think of anything outside of Linux and Node that has this concept of &quot;here&#x27;s a major version that is marked LTS and here is a beta, but we&#x27;re not going to call it beta, we&#x27;re just going to call it an odd-numbered major version&quot;.')
