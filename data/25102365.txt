If you bookmark something that you know you won&#x27;t need later (e.g. after you finish researching something), then it adds a mental burden of having to clean it up later. When a lot of them accumulate, it&#x27;s really hard to recall why exactly they were added in the first place and whether each one of them should be now removed or not.<p>- Open tabs are the opposite - if you close them, they&#x27;re gone forever. So once you no longer need a certain tree of tabs (e.g., like above, you&#x27;ve finished researching something), you just dispose of the whole tree; if there&#x27;s anything particularly valuable in there, you can add it to bookmarks.<p>So, e.g. if I&#x27;m doing house renovation I may have trees of tabs with hundreds of open tabs in them while researching something. Same when coding, if I&#x27;m investigating a particular topic I may have tons of open tabs that will eventually get closed all together.<p>In some rare cases, I keep a tab or a tree of tabs open just so I don&#x27;t forget to navigate back to it in the foreseeable future (at which point it will likely get closed).')
