However, I&#x27;m not really sold on Stadia generally yet. There&#x27;s definitely some input lag and I can feel my mouse movements being &quot;spongy&quot;. I&#x27;m also having a hard time driving, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the input lag or just the game. Also, even if the game is running at the best possible graphical options (which Cyberpunk 2077 isn&#x27;t), you&#x27;re still just getting a compressed video stream, so dark gameplay doesn&#x27;t look good (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0x0.st&#x2F;iFRT.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0x0.st&#x2F;iFRT.png</a>).<p>No regrets though, since I paid 50â‚¬ for it and I&#x27;m getting a free Chromecast Ultra and a free Stadia controller.')
