It was never her he wanted. Not really. It was America.<p>Trouble is, the reviewer is dead wrong on Gatsby&#x27;s psychology.  Gatsby, like the protagonist of <i>Tender</i>, and various characters from his short stories, is a working-out of the central tragedy of Fitzgerald&#x27;s own life, his failure to find a soul-mate.  This is hinted at in Hemingway&#x27;s <i>Moveable Feast</i>, and laid out fairly plainly in some of his letters.<p>Gatsby in particular fails because he fixes his desire on an unworthy object, who does not return his love.  With mirror symmetry, Gatsby himself is unworthy of the love of a decent woman, being a grifter.  The dramatic resolution can only be death for Gatsby.')
