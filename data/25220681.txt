Gordon also claims that these trends are most visible in the US, since the US is in many ways at the vanguard of technology-driven productivity growth; other economists have well documented that GDP growth is highest among economies playing &quot;catch up&quot; (which is why, in bull markets, developing markets often have far greater growth than developed markets).<p>I don&#x27;t have them on hand, but there are some interesting papers on the &quot;cost of innovation&quot;, some of which have recently been on HN. The estimated ROI (measured by cost-per-patent or cost-per-new-pharmaceutical development, for example) is claimed to be declining. (See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;why-the-u-s-innovation-ecosystem-is-slowing-down" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;why-the-u-s-innovation-ecosystem-is-...</a> for a summary.)<p>To your specific examples:<p>* Life expectancy increased primarily due to widespread vaccination and better public health (e.g. clean drinking water, pasteurization). These are &quot;one time&quot; gains; the efficacy and returns (in terms of QUALYs) on investment in new health technologies have been <i>much</i> lower in the last few decades, which leads one to wonder if the low-hanging fruit have been plucked.<p>* Use of space has had some meaningful productivity gains (like GPS, mass wireless communications, or cheaper areal surveillance), but, again, these seem to be declining returns; it&#x27;s not clear that we possess the technical means to make interplanetary travel economically viable, so this seems analogous to an observation of Gordon&#x27;s that I love: that in 1960 you could get between NYC and San Francisco in about 6 hours, and today, you can do so in about 6 hours.<p>Interestingly, I disagree with the authors of this essay in exactly the opposite direction you do: I think the &quot;Great Stagnation&quot; is real, and I think their &quot;innovations&quot; are underwhelming. (So I can wear a screen on my face instead of holding it in my hands? Big deal!)<p>Ray Kurzweil somewhat famously suffers from a severe recency bias when he claims increasing rates of innovation: to him, the change from (say) iron to steel is kind of minor, but the change from analog to digital TVâ€”that&#x27;s a big deal!<p>I feel these authors make a similar error. In 100 years, I don&#x27;t think many people are going to care deeply about when we came up with the Oculus.')
