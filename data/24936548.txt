Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604008521, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24936297, text='&gt; The moral issue isn&#x27;t particularly grey. The legal one...<p>Also not grey—same as before.<p>&gt; Can you answer all that with enough certainty as to assert that you &quot;have any idea what you&#x27;re talking about&quot;?<p>Hey there.  I&#x27;m a former Mozillian.  I was a heavy contributor to Devmo in its early days (2006–2008).  A bunch of that content is mine.  It&#x27;s not Mozilla&#x27;s, and I know on what terms I made it available.  So to answer your question quoted above (a) yes, in fact, I do know what I&#x27;m talking about, and (b) I don&#x27;t have to be able to give an answer for every slot in your contrived matrix; it suffices if I&#x27;m able to say, &quot;hey, you can&#x27;t do that with the pieces that belong to me&quot;.  And that&#x27;s something that I can say—with certainty.')
