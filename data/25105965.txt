I am talking about a very specific neurological&#x2F;psychological phenomenon, that is highly suggestive that memory access is dynamic, that it varies on the topic, that it varies based on perspective (abstract vs real-time object level), <i>and that it occurs here on HN</i>.<p>My claim is also contrary to a claim higher in the thread:<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Compare this to how things were 15 years ago, [or how they are in here, where everyone and their dog can challenge your opinion]. [You become more open minded long term, and can handle criticism in a more mature way].<p>Now it&#x27;s true that <i>on a relative basis</i>, HN is superior to many other forums, and also that it is true <i>to some degree</i> that <i>certain</i> opinions can be challenged, and subsequent discussions will be handled in a mature way.<p>This is far from comprehensively true though.  And also, it can be observed that <i>people seem to not like to discuss this idea</i> (that certain topics cannot be maturely discussed on HN, including the <i>the abstract idea</i> that certain topics cannot be maturely discussed on HN).')
