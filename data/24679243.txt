I&#x27;ve always wanted to own several real ones, but even though it&#x27;s what my heart wants, my brain always wins. The economics are tough, the barrier to entry is high, and Cineplex is a ruthless cutthroat competitor.<p>I was a big fan of Famous Players but always found Cineplex (Canada) to be an extraction business which runs its locations into the ground. That&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;ve done to Famous Players.<p>Landmark Cinemas (Kinepolis) is our second biggest chain, but small compared to Cineplex. They have a young CEO and corporate team and they seem to be giving Cineplex a run for their money.<p>I won&#x27;t shed a tear if Cineplex falters and needs to be broken up or shed locations. I&#x27;m just hoping that it lowers the barrier to entry so some young entrepreneurs can take a stab innovating in this industry and moving it forward.')
