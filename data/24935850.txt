Item(by='epriest', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604005374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934862, text='I mean that GitHub does not &quot;try&quot;, in the sense of looking at the interdiff, doing fuzzy matching, trying to identify line-by-line similarity, etc. It places comments only if the hunk is exactly unchanged and gives up otherwise.<p>Phabricator does &quot;try&quot;, in the sense that it examines the interdiff and attempts (of course, imperfectly, because no implementation can be perfect) to track line movement across hunk mutations.<p>My claim is that all comments which GitHub places correctly, Phabricator also places correctly. And some comments which GitHub drops, Phabricator places correctly (on the same line a human would select)! However, some comments which GitHub drops, Phabricator places incorrectly (on a line other than the line a human would select).<p>So the actual implementation you prefer is not one that tries, but one that doesn&#x27;t try! Phabricator could have approximately GitHub&#x27;s behavior by just deleting a bunch of code.<p>That&#x27;s perfectly fine: many other users also prefer comments be discarded rather than tracked to a possibly-wrong line, too. I strongly believe this isn&#x27;t a good behavior for code review software, which is why Phabricator doesn&#x27;t do it -- but Phabricator puts substantially more effort into trying to track and place comments correctly than GitHub does.')
