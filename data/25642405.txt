The muscle spasms caused me to hit my bedframe. The headaches left me unable to do anything productive for a couple days. I had spent the prior days taking the bare minimum to make the headaches go away but it was a fine line before deciding to forgoe it.<p>Teenage me had built up to taking 700mg&#x2F;day on average. A year before quitting I&#x27;d start the day with a bottle of 5 hour energy and a 200mg caffeine pill just to get out of bed.<p>I still drink the occasional tea or take a small energy drink before going for a long workout.<p>I refuse to ever drink coffee again. I&#x27;ve become appalled at how ingrained coffee and caffeine is in the cultures around the world. It&#x27;s become normalized for people to say that they&#x27;re grumpy before consuming caffeine. I don&#x27;t want to be dependent on anything like that ever again.')
