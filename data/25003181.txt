It&#x27;s pretty much an american tradition. I bet in 2016, you were screaming at the top of your lungs that &quot;Trump stole the election&quot;.<p>&gt; One political party has been trying to undermine the system and sow mistrust within its own ranks in order to maintain political power.<p>Are you claiming that the republican and democratic parties are one and the same? Because you would be right.<p>I love all the democratic operatives here accusing Trump of delegitimizing the election process when that&#x27;s all they&#x27;ve been doing the past 4 years. Now, it&#x27;s the republican side&#x27;s turn I guess.<p>Hypocrisy is the ugliest human trait.')
