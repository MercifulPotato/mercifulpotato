I think if you&#x27;re not sure, you probably don&#x27;t need it. I&#x27;m young, work from home, healthy. I have friends who are nurses -- they yearn for a vaccine. My grandparents and my parents know that they are at risk and would line up for one. I have a friend with diabetes who would feel like his life was back. I&#x27;d gladly take a vaccine if it became available -- would love to not worry about giving it to my parents, and contribute to herd immunity -- but for me personally the virus has never really scared me on a personal health level.')
