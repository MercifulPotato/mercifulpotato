Stuff that will correctly be called out as unfortunately really &quot;hampering individual freedom&quot; (including the freedom to be a jackass) and being &quot;unnecessary&quot; and &quot;bureaucratic&quot; and (quite intentionally and without quotation marks) gatekeeping.<p>Civil engineering is sort of the oldest and ultimate example, where a bad design puts people&#x27;s lives at risk. In deference to said lives, senior engineers in that field review every drawing or calculation that goes out the door, and they also mentor the junior engineers, who have to be graduates of accredited schools, and also can&#x27;t get certified until they&#x27;ve spent a certain amount of time being mentored and passed the exams, etc.<p>The mindset you&#x27;re talking about is basically all about craftsmanship or elegance of a solution. Formal mentorship or apprenticeship programs do a great job of maintaining and transmitting that. School isn&#x27;t really enough, and certain fields have recognized that fact.<p>In software however, and I&#x27;m not sure whether this is the problem or the symptom, the number of developers apparently (I was told recently) doubles approximately every 5 years. Which means the field is always overwhelmed with new people, full of energy but not experience, who want to do something cool and exciting, but haven&#x27;t been, for example, burned by their own past decisions to try to do something cool and exciting. They see only upside. Which is valuable in itself, but they need more direction than they&#x27;re getting, from the older engineers who have the war stories and who aren&#x27;t especially concerned with being cool (which c&#x27;mon let&#x27;s face it, is essentially a mating display) and who are <i>boring</i>.')
