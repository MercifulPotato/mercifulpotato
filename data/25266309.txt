I try to add the ocassional low quality comment for balance :-)<p>&gt;<i>so I am going to say that an elitist &quot;screw people who cant afford an overpriced mac&quot; is not a good thing imo.</i><p>Well, my intented meaning was more like &quot;Don&#x27;t create&#x2F;sell apps for a platform you dont even own to test in&quot;.<p>The main reason to go for &quot;by the minute&quot; builds on the Cloud for a machine you don&#x27;t own is to either help with porting to an architecture you don&#x27;t use, or to churn apps with some cross platform framework to a platform you don&#x27;t use&#x2F;care about.<p>I think the latter would be more frequent.<p>If they were mere poor hobbyists guys legitimately coding for the platform, they&#x27;d own a machine, either new, or second hand, or whatever. It&#x27;s when you don&#x27;t code in the platform, but only want to target it for selling that you have an issue...')
