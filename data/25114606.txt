Let&#x27;s take it back to the math a moment:<p>Let&#x27;s take your 3% chance of death (actually the population survival rate is significantly higher IIRC, but OTOH there&#x27;s long haul COVID to consider too). If the vaccine is 95% effective, all else being equal you have a 3% chance of death without the vaccine, and a 0.15% chance of death with the vaccine. So the question becomes: is there a greater than 2.85% chance of the vaccine killing you or doing you crippling injury? If not, you&#x27;re probably better off taking the vaccine.')
