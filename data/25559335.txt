To know that, we need to observe the <i>dynamics</i> of my opinions, i.e., how they would evolve -- or not -- as new evidence becomes available to me. Even then, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to tell, since we&#x27;d also need to judge whether the new evidence is strong enough to warrant a change in opinion.<p>You, however, only get to see my <i>static</i> opinion, a snapshot at a point in time. With no knowledge about how my opinion evolves, you have no basis to judge whether I&#x27;m committed to my opinions.')
