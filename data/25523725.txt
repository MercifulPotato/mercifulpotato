Easy.<p>Got more random thoughts to add to a table item? No problemo, just open the item and you have a full-blown page to work with (which you can even nest another table inside of).<p>Some random item that you should really follow-up on next Tuesday? Just add a reminder.<p>Somehow that just resonates with the way my non-typical (adhd) brain works, and it&#x27;s what&#x27;s keeping me with Notion for my personal stuff despite its frustrating slowness and many other flaws.')
