Let&#x27;s say the pod gets `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxC8::aaaa:bbbb:cccc`. Anything with a correctly configured tunnel and that pod IP can route it traffic, no proxy or iptables needed.<p>I’ve been meaning for a while now to experiment with this same idea in Erlang. I.e., hack up the Erlang runtime to use an IPv6 address as its PID type, such that each Erlang node running on a machine gets its own &#x2F;64 subnet to hand out; and each Erlang actor-process on that node gets an IP allocated from its node’s &#x2F;64 range.<p>This <i>could</i> just be a way of letting Erlang nodes talk to each-other through tunnels. <i>Or</i> it could be a way of having Erlang “VMs” exposed directly to the Internet as their own little machines.')
