Maybe this is a case where the standardization of SQL has actually worked against such innovations? Or are there sound architectural reasons why creating a schema <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be just `insert into meta.(schemas|tables|columns) â€¦`? It would enormously simplify the amount of syntax to remember, at the cost of having to know the relevant meta-schema.')
