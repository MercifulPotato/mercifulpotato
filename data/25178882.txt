People from React (I am not one of them) just understand this better, because they know that the reactive approach is superior for UI. People who have not experienced that have often a problem grasping this simple fact.<p>SwiftUI has annoying bugs. I haven&#x27;t hit performance issues yet. But if you encounter these issues you can always escape to UIKit. I already did several times, I have my little set of SwiftUI components already which replace the original ones. For example, Image is a buggy component which doesn&#x27;t display SVG assets properly. I made an XImage component which fixes that.<p>On the other hand, doing everything in UIKit from the start is just a waste of developers resources. My time is too precious for that.')
