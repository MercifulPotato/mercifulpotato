Much of it appears to just have been handicaps in the original compiler implementation. At this point someone should step away from the compiler implementation look at how people are working around the language and do a 2.0&#x2F;&quot;use strict&quot; type thing where they redefine much of the language. Then like what happens with new C++ revisions let the compilers catch up.')
