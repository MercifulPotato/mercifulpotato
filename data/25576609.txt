It was both an expansion and partial repeal of Prop 13.  It was supposed to work in tandem with Prop 15 (the other partial repeal of Prop 13):<p>Prop 19 (Allow people 55+ to take their Prop 13 tax breaks to new homes): Yes. You may ask why someone like me, who is strongly against Prop 13, would support a bill that seemingly expands Prop 13. This bill will encourage older people to vacate their large (and mostly empty) single family homes by allowing them to keep their low taxes and move to smaller single family homes or even fancy downtown condos. That alone would be a good thing, as it would free up needed housing for younger families that are growing and have kids. As long as Prop 13 exists, this will actually make things better by making it financially smart to leave your large unused home (which right now it is not).<p>But is also does more than that! There is also a partial repeal of Prop 13 hidden in this bill. It would force a tax reassessment when you inherit a property if you donâ€™t move into it. This would mean a huge boost to local tax funding which goes towards schools, police, fire, etc. and closes a loophole that wealthy people use to help their kids stay rich by giving them rental properties that are only profitable because of their tax breaks. Also this prop is opposed by the Howard Jarvis association, which is usually an automatic yes for me, because Howard Jarvis is always wrong.')
