These bots are only able to exist because people are willing to purchase the products bot-owners are selling at a significantly higher markup. This whole thing would go away if retailers raised their prices or supply to meet demand.<p>Also, these limited product releases and steep black friday sales are psychologically manipulative. They&#x27;re designed to create a false sense of exclusivity and urgency for the consumer. I&#x27;m happy to see it backfire on retailers.')
