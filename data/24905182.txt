How is it you can make a business out of that? How is it that the idea is only now reaching viral popularity, even though its a rather obvious concept that had various well-known incarnations in the past (e.g. automated &quot;pingbacks&quot; on blogs in the 2000s), was fully conceptualized into an even better idea all the way back in the 1970s (Xanadu&#x27;s transclusions), and probably traces its lineage all the way to ancient Sumeria. I sometimes don&#x27;t understand the lifecycle of ideas and tools in our reality.<p>(That&#x27;s not a jab at Roam Research folks. I congratulate them on building a successful piece of software. Though I&#x27;m not going to use it anyway, because I like to own my data.)')
