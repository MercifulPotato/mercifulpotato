In the past I have written production frontends in Angular and experimented with Vue and React. Out of all of them I found React to be the most enjoyable, but even then I still struggled with project setup and found the tooling confusing. I even quite like TS as a language, but I feel it&#x27;s still quite limited by the fact it transpiles to JS.<p>Recently, I discovered yew [0]. It is a Rust framework for building frontends using wasm. I really appreciate the robustness that Rust brings such as ownership checks and ADTs. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone, but it may be worth looking at if you perhaps find modern frontend development confusing frustrating. I&#x27;ve found it to be quite the breath of fresh air.<p>If you do decide to have a look I found the examples [1] and getting started guide [2] very informative.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yewstack&#x2F;yew" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yewstack&#x2F;yew</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yewstack&#x2F;yew&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yewstack&#x2F;yew&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yew.rs&#x2F;docs&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;project-setup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yew.rs&#x2F;docs&#x2F;en&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;project-setup</a>')
