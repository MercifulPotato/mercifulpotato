In reality the UK has just pulled the rug out from under its most productive service sector and cut out the heart of its tax base.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t have the skills or the culture to develop new service markets, because it&#x27;s thinking like a 19th century imperial power running a 19th century economy, not like an interconnected smaller power with significant unique skills and talents in a mixed 21st century economy.<p>When you sell a plane or a computer or a tractor to a foreign country you don&#x27;t just sell an item that needs to be shipped. You also sell training, spares, continuing support, consultancy. and business development.<p>These were relatively friction-free when freedom of movement was a thing. Now they&#x27;re much harder, because they rely on employees visiting customers and possibly staying with them for long periods - which can&#x27;t be done with paperwork and restrictions.<p>This &quot;deal&quot; makes all of this much harder for EU trade, and does nothing at all to make it easier in Rest of World.<p>And all of this held up for weeks by arguments about fish, which are barely a rounding error in GDP terms.')
