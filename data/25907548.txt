And they do this, because it saves them billions of dollars. If they had actual competition, they would spend more on customer support because it would be a point of contention, but since they have no competition, they just let bots handle everything and they completely ignore their customers who have no choice but to continue to use their products. This is a form or monopolistic behavior that needs to be addressed by regulations.<p>Monopolies should be forced to spend money on real humans or some form of effective customer support, with a regulated SLA. It&#x27;s the only way to keep these companies in check once they have completely starved any form of competition away from them.')
