Even if I stipulated that your sources are credible and true, which they may be, <i>you</i> are making massive leaps in logic in order to support your claim and not even attempting to explain how you got there or addressing my very direct criticisms.<p>That I am “uncomfortable” talking about this is just a lazy and ironic <i>ad hominem</i> argument.
