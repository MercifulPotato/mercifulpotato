Infinity Ward (and possibly Treyarch to a lesser extent) seem to be only just in control of their games - rampant size on disk, instability, etc. When the game works it&#x27;s rather good, but  it really seems like COD&#x27;s time out of the spotlight hasn&#x27;t kept its developers sharp.<p>Cyberpunk is DRM free so it should be OK on launch and only a matter of time if it&#x27;s not.')
