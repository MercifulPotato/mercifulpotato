Item(by='pardner', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1609462378, title='Target Disk Mode in latter-day Intel Macs finally is reasonably fast', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='TL;DR Formerly unusably-slow for backups a few years ago, the built-in Target Disk Mode in Macs has actually improved in latter-day Intel models (using a Thunderbolt 3 cable), now nearly 1&#x2F;2 as fast as an external USB-C drive dock.<p>My test: use Carbon Copy Cloner v5.1.22 to clone an internal SSD with 690GB of data. “Find &amp; replace corrupted files” is OFF*.<p>Source: Macbook Pro 16″, Catalina 10.15.7<p>Destination: 13&quot; 2020 Intel MBP, Catalina 10.15.7, in Target Disk Mode, using a 40G Thunderbolt 3 cable.<p>Result: Direct-connect two MBP using a high-speed Thunderbolt-3 cable was 5.9 GB&#x2F;minute, about half as fast as backing up via USB 3 to an SSD in an external drive dock (12 GB&#x2F;minute).<p>Keep in mind that two “trips” are required if the goal is to move the data to a new Mac via an external SSD (first from source -&gt; external SSD, then from external SSD -&gt; target)… so when you add the time it also takes to restore the external SSD to the target Mac (which I did not measure), the net time difference between the two approaches is less.<p>For my purpose, simply cloning Mac#1 to Mac #2, the direct-connect using Target Disk Mode was simpler and adequately-fast. YMMV.')
