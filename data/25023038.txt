None of them allow third party stores either.<p>And if you want to remove them, that’s just arguing that a business model is at issue not a specific business.  After all Epic is selling ports of the same game across multiple platforms any paying each of them a cut of games sold in other stores. If Apple just takes the same cut and allows more App Stores on their platform, or is that ok or is this just a question of money?')
