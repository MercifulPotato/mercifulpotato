Item(by='an_opabinia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608236415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457848, text='Ultraprocessed is a counter marketing term from the meat and dairy lobby. It is authored in opposition to things like Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat. Nobody uses this term organically, look in Google Trends yourself. It is an obvious and conspicuous marker of a campaign, exactly equivalent to something like “drinkability,” an Anheuser Busch marketing term.<p>This is a market that traditionally derives most of its profits from a close relationship with the government, for subsidies (the #1 source of profit for farms, maybe for the whole agricultural sector) and health guidelines (the cheapest, and therefore highest RoI advertising). Beyond Meat enjoys none of these advantages and its equities wildly outperformed e.g. Tyson.<p>I am not saying that marketing does not play a role in health outcomes. Just that the nutrition discourse is overwhelmingly marketing budget driven, that actual nutritionists struggle against consumers immensely, and that once you’ve heard one ad campaign you easily become jaded of all of them. Well meaning people get coopted by all of this.')
