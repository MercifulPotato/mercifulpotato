I frequently find myself having to argue with said supporters, and I can&#x27;t argue that this justification makes sense other than to say... well they should have banned him before hand.<p>It feels like they were looking for almost anything remotely shitty that Trump said to ban him.  More specifically, they are looking for a reason to ban him based on saying anything not in support of the next administration, because of his supporters storming the capital.  I can see the chain of logic here, I just think it&#x27;s a little weak and being selectively enforced.<p>Edited: to make more sense hopefully.')
