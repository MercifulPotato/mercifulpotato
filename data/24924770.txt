Simply put, there isn&#x27;t enough land to plant enough trees to get us out of this mess. That doesn&#x27;t mean that planting trees isn&#x27;t useful, I think the paper makes a good case for why it&#x27;s cost effective and buys time, but it isn&#x27;t enough alone.<p>My personal take is that the cheap carbon credits are indeed a more cost effective use of money right now, but it&#x27;s low hanging fruit that we will run out of soon.')
