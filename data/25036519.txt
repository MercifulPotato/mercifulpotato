I have only the latter, and I can say the latency is not at all noticeable. My only complaint is with the accuracy of the digitiser: My strokes tend to end up a fraction of a millimeter higher up on the page than where I intend them to go. This is very rarely a problem for me, but can be a source of irritation when I make minor corrections. I have no idea if this is universal or specific to my device, but I intend to find out.')
