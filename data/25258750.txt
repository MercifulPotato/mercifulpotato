In a spreadsheet, one might type over a cell because it&#x27;s an exception. In Grist, you&#x27;d need to think what makes it special, and\nchange the formula to reflect that. E.g. `=$Price - $Discount if $Status != &#x27;Comped&#x27; else 0`. But once that exception is turned into a rule, it applies to all records. Which is a good thing.')
