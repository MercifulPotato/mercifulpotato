Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=[25005782], score=None, time=1604646070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25004711, text='The RIAA letter cites 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)(1).  The letter alleges sharing of circumvention software.<p>The letter does not cite 1201(a)(1); it does not allege circumvention.<p>For a section 1201 violation to be criminal it needs to be willful and for the purpose of financial gain.  See Section 1204.  To me, the term &quot;illegal&quot; means &quot;in violation of the law&quot;, and hence enforceable by so-called law enforcement.  Here, non-wilful violations of &quot;the law&quot; that are not committed for financial gain are only enforceable by copyright owners.  This, to me, falls into the category of violating someone&#x27;s intellectual property rights, not violating &quot;the law&quot;.  If you see things another way, that&#x27;s fine.  I respect your opinion and ask that you in turn respect mine.')
