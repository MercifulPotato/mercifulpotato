However I’m not sure on the quality of the feedback given by the reddit crowd regarding your previous home lab setup.<p>Reason:<p>1.  Using pre loved (= second hand) rack servers in the living room with redundant PSUs will cause a lot of trouble with every female living in the same household. It is too noisy....<p>2. Consumer grade hardware is pretty reliable nowadays. I had no failure for quite some years despite the fact that I’m operating my machines on the upper limit of their thermal specifications. (I have a GPU cluster and a cluster of RPis)<p>3. Ryzens or Even a ThreadRipper is much more power efficient than the good old Xeon E5s. Thus you may have a lower operating cost.')
