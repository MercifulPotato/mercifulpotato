(The workings of body and mind are <i>not</i> encoded in DNA.)<p>The only thing that&#x27;s encoded in DNA is how to make proteins.  Everything else is emergent from the interactions of those proteins and &quot;encoded&quot; only in evolutionary history of how those interactions work when they do so in a repeatable fashion.  DNA is <i>not</i> a &quot;blueprint&quot; for making a body or a mind... it is much more like the &quot;seed&quot; pattern for a run of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, except with a bit of indeterminism for environmental influences thrown in. There are things about the phenotype you can predict from the DNA because you&#x27;ve got past examples, but a small change in initial conditions or the environment during development can also throw you way off... you have to run the whole process (i.e. grow a complete animal) to ever be sure what the phenotype looks like or behaves like.')
