I eventually got an HP Omen 15 which I&#x27;m pretty happy with, but I&#x27;ll remain bitter that options with brighter and&#x2F;or faster screens or beefier graphic cards were never an option, and what options I had were often hard to find.<p>As for the i9-10900K, if you check out a review from launch [0], you&#x27;ll see nothing but good things to be said about the performance, with a very large trade-off of being a ridiculously power hungry, heat-producing CPU. If you&#x27;re OK with that, then you&#x27;re probably perfectly happy with the Intel CPU. For me, a cool and quiet CPU that can still smash my parallel processing needs and meet my gaming needs is a better sweet spot.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomshardware.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;intel-core-i9-10900k-cpu-review&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tomshardware.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;intel-core-i9-10900k-cp...</a>')
