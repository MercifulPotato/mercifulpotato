But I don&#x27;t see how the choice of the framework helps getting pixel perfect matches especially between different browsers. It seems to me rather the right implementation counts. E.g. using canvas drawing would be one approach to guarantee pixel perfect matches. Also you could do then checksumming in test cases to ensure the images are always the same.')
