Most states ban modern day assault rifle calibers for hunting deer because they are too small in diameter to do enough damage and deliver a humane kill. Hunting calibers (.308, .243 win, 30.06) are much larger and more powerful than the 5.56&#x2F;5.45 the modern M4-pattern and AK74 use.<p>In addition, per wartime regulations the worlds armies are only allowed to use FMJ which leaves a much smaller wound channel. Hunting rounds are typically soft point or hollow point and expand on impact to leave a much larger wound channel to increase the likelihood of a humane kill.')
