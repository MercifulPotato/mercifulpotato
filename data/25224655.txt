The rest of the world tends to take the process of enumerating freedoms positively. The law says you have it or don&#x27;t.<p>In the U.S. the culture was framed around the preservation of liberty and the enumeration of the boundaries, and limitations on the ability of government and regulation to encroach.  The problem with that is it opens a can of worms constitutionally that increasingly have led to the torture of common language in order to attempt to change the meaning of already passed laws instead of passing new ones which seem to be growing increasingly difficult to do.<p>Further, you have an entire caste of people specifically trained to use language in unintuitive ways.<p>As far as &quot;Assault rifles&quot; go, most people can&#x27;t even define what one is. The fact is, an AR-15 that has the &quot;look-and-feel&quot; of a military patterned rifle is functionally equivalent to more &quot;traditional looking&quot; stock rifles like a Mini-14.<p>They are the same fundamental device. Neither one is more or less capable of killing someone. To anyone with experience with firearms, the &quot;common sense&quot; espoused by gun control people amounts to hysterics. All it is is a bunch of people tryimg to legislate everyone else&#x27;s rights without demonstrating any understanding of the subject matter at hand other than being a special interest mouthpiece.')
