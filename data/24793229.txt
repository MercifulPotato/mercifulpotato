You have to draw the line somewhere, right? If your answer is &quot;no, these platforms should be perfectly neutral&quot;, then are you okay with child pornography and terrorist beheadings in your feed?<p>If you say no to this, and the answer is based on the law, what happens if the law is unethical and for example the Trump&#x2F;Republican administration passes a law saying &quot;Acknowledgement of the gay lifestyle is illegal&quot; (a la Russia).<p>Regardless of any political division there is a general humanistic &quot;ethical line&quot;.  It varies from person to person, but if you discount outright nazis and child pornographers generally we can find where that is.<p>Why should a private corporation not choose where that ethical line is for it?')
