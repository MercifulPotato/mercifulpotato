You can do that and more for cheap today, but not then.<p>I don&#x27;t buy this. OpenAI literally released pricing for GPT-3, so either they grossly miscalculated their cost base (unlikely) or there&#x27;s some scaling&#x2F;instability&#x2F;resourcing issue preventing them from doing so (much more likely).<p>I think it&#x27;s telling that they spent the last 6 months on yet <i>another</i> flashy demo (DALL-E) rather than actually productionizing GPT-3. It just feels like constant smoke and mirrors.')
