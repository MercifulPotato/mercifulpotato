It&#x27;s a giant tablet on a stand. Effective, yes, but also definitely a hacky afterthought, too. There&#x27;s no attempt of any kind to integrate it into the lines or flow of the rest of the vehicle. And they still can&#x27;t be bothered to put some basic physical switchgear in the thing. There&#x27;s nothing tactile about it, nothing that <i>feels</i> premium or well-designed.')
