Putting one on, say, every residential block would be a huge expense, and there&#x27;s a chicken&#x2F;egg problem where the demand doesn&#x27;t justify such a step yet... but if everybody gets on board, one per block wouldn&#x27;t be enough.  And right now, folks get tax breaks for their EVs instead of getting taxed for necessary infrastructure improvements.<p>This is the sort of infrastructure work that a Green New Deal should support.  But that&#x27;s a political poison pill, as supporting energy sector jobs is &quot;patriotic&quot; if it&#x27;s carbon based and &quot;communism&quot; otherwise.')
