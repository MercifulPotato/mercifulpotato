Compare Coinbase (centralized) with Uniswap (decentralized).<p>Coinbase users put their trust in a custodian. That custodian has the ability to steal from them or be stolen from. That&#x27;s how MtGox went down in flames.<p>Uniswap users don&#x27;t have to custody their funds with anyone to trade. They can use whichever they want.<p>Coinbase&#x27;s platform can change on the whims of the company. Users have to accept this if they want to continue using the platform.<p>Uniswap is nothing more than a handful of small contracts which are unalterable and public. If you don&#x27;t like, fork it. Don&#x27;t like the official frontend? You can fork that too. Some wallets just build uniswap directly into the app. And since you don&#x27;t have to sign up to use uniswap, the experience is completely seamless.<p>Now there&#x27;s a lot more you can do with decentralized applications, but this should help get the point across.')
