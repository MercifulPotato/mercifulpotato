It seems crazy to me. I understand that the assets are illiquid and you wouldn&#x27;t get the full value in a fire sale, but doesn&#x27;t this situation essentially put the board in the position where just by firing Masayoshi Son they&#x27;ll practically double the value of the company overnight. Does anyone seriously believe that Masayoshi&#x27;s investments could possibly return that much value to shareholders?')
