However my point is that science appears to be fairly poor at building universal belief, which is something religion excelled at with scientific precision. There are advantages and disadvantages to both cultures. One disadvantage is organizing ourselves around something like global climate change where scientific consensus is near unanimous, but the culture at large is very slow to heed. Religion is very good at getting masses of people to do what they are told regardless of their best interest. Look at the American religious voter for example.<p>My point is that if science is more than a methodology, if it is a cultural spectacle, then it&#x27;s probably wise for us all to admit that it is in fact very much like a religion. I am saying that science as a cultural reality can  benefit from dropping the claim to be better than, or something other than a religion.<p>Don&#x27;t stone me for saying so.')
