Item(by='eigenvalue', descendants=0, kids=None, score=5, time=1608144159, title="Ask HN: What are the implications of QuantumScape's battery tech announcements?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Assuming their claims hold up in the real world (it would be surprising if it were a fraud like NKLA given the extreme pedigree of the people involved), they are talking about nearly a doubling in energy density (kwH per kilogram) and charging up to 80% in 15 minutes, so not much longer than it takes a diesel truck to refuel at a gas station. And it seems to have a pretty long duty life of 800 cycles while maintaining ~80% power output, and safely runs in normal temperature ranges.<p>Does this suddenly make electric semi-trucks a no-brainer? Does it make the hydrogen fuel-cell approach to truck propulsion a dead-end and waste of time? Does it mean that we won&#x27;t need nearly as much lithium as we would given the older lithium ion battery tech? What other implications?')
