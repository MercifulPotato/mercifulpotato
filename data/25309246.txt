I surely can empathize with every person that wants to have a well paying job but just don&#x27;t feel anything towards anything that is well paying.<p>Just set your expectations realistically. If you are of slightly above average intelligence and you are not uber excited about programming (ie. typical developer), chances are you are never going to be rock star developer. Plan your career realistically taking that into account. Maybe work in area that doesn&#x27;t require changing entire stack every 2 years?<p>My friend decided consciously (we had a discussion) he is not ambitious but still wants to earn. He is now Cobol developer working with people that are on average twice his age. He has been and will be well paid for many years. He works 8h day, has time for his kids and other interests. He says he couldn&#x27;t be happier.')
