Think about it as you would when debugging software:  how might you (an instance of a class in a complex system) know what other people (instances of classes within the system) are &quot;talking about&quot; (where talking derives from thinking&#x2F;computation that takes place <i>within</i> those object instances)?  Are you obtaining this knowledge via the calling of public interfaces?  If not, then what is the True source of this knowledge?<p>Ironically (or not), the title of this overall thread is &quot;This is Real, That&#x27;s Not&quot;.  The content of the discussions is a fine reflection of <i>the very phenomenon</i> that Doreen is talking about, and I suspect a plausible demonstration of why humanity can&#x27;t sort its shit out, decade after decade:  an inability (or unwillingness) to acknowledge the self-delusional nature of the human mind.<p>&gt; What is the motive there?<p>The motives are complex, <i>and unknown</i> (the necessary callable public interfaces to obtain such knowledge <i>do not exist</i> - and yet, observe the number of people in this thread who perceive that they have knowledge of the contents of other people&#x27;s minds. <i>Is this not an extremely interesting phenomenon?</i>  Might this phenomenon have consequences in a complex system, especially if it exists <i>but is completely unrealized</i>?<p>I suspect that a <i>specific, conscious</i> motivation to bring about <i>the specific end state</i> that we are experiencing (inequality, homelessness, human suffering in general) <i>also does not actually exist</i>.  Rather, I reckon the mess we are living in is more like some sort of a cosmic demonstration of the law unintended consequences, due to an unwillingness to acknowledge the complexities inherent in reality.  A religious person may consider this punishment from God for disobedience.  A comedian (or a schizophrenic) may consider it to be comedy at its finest.  Each individual perceives reality through a custom lens, and comes to vastly different conclusions.<p>I could be wrong of course, but it&#x27;s a fun way to look at it.  Part of the fun is observing how people react to crazy ideas like this, that may actually have a fair amount of validity to them (how might we know, <i>for sure</i>, if they do, or do not?).')
