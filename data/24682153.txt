Hypatia of Alexandria, Galileo Galilei and countless others. Some of them were probably murdered before becoming famous and have been erased from history. And many smart people were deterred to try anything scientific because the church made it too risky.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t for the church, today you would be probably living in a Mars colony.')
