I mean, of course, you, a random internet commenter with no medical knowledge whatsoever knows better than a plastic surgeon who deals with patients every day what information those patients need most to make better decisions about what is, for many of them, the biggest decision they have to make about their bodies in their lives?<p>&quot;As a woman who gets tired of some people acting like I am only a sex object and the only parts of me that matter are the parts covered by a bikini&quot;<p>What a petty, misanthropic way of looking at the efforts of someone who is doing their best to help people (not just &#x27;people&#x27;, women, specifically) at often one of the worst points in their lives. I hope you just wrote this comment off the cuff and regret it after re-reading it after your coffee, because if this is really how you feel, I feel truly sorry for you for being such a bitter, nihilistic person.')
