Accordingly each province has a law, such as the Professional Engineers Act in Ontario [1], which creates the regulatory association and gives it power to enforce its bylaws under the Act.<p>The Act is a bit different in each province. The Act for Ontario says<p>&gt; Offence, use of term “professional engineer”, etc.<p>&gt;(2) Every person who is not a holder of a licence or a temporary licence and who,\n (a.1) uses the title “engineer” or an abbreviation of that title in a manner that will lead to the belief that the person may engage in the practice of professional engineering;<p>&gt;(b) uses a term, title or description that will lead to the belief that the person may engage in the practice of professional engineering; or<p>...<p>&gt;is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable for the first offence to a fine of not more than $10,000 and for each subsequent offence to a fine of not more than $25,000.
