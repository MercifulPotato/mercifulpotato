I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the correct interpretation though. The government advice for tier 4 says:<p>&gt; You must not leave or be outside of your home except for where you have a specific purpose, or a ‘reasonable excuse’<p>&gt; If you live in a tier 4 area, you must stay at home. You must not leave your home to travel unless for work, education or other legally permitted reasons<p>So when Boris says &quot;should&quot; I believe he means &quot;must unless you are in one of the excluded categories&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;tier-4-stay-at-home#stay-at-home" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;tier-4-stay-at-home#stay-at-home</a>')
