Many (most?) don&#x27;t have a jumpback link, and when the link is too close to the edge of the page it gets overridden by the prev&#x2F;next page control. I&#x27;ve ended up giving up on reading footnotes in ebooks. If it weren&#x27;t for coronavirus library closures, I would read a small fraction of the ebooks that I read right now.')
