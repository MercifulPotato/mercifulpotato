I wish I had more options for visualizations.  Fot instance, at this scale, it would be really nice to have a scatter plot of events at exactly the time they occur, rather than by the hour<p>2. I really wish I could customize the graphs more - like if I have a 3 day view, I would rather group the events by the hour rather than the day, and it seems like I can&#x27;t do that.<p>3. Is there a place to just query all the events, and get them in a table form?  Like I would love to just be able to get <i>all</i> of a particular event in a certain time period, and then look through the properties and exact timings one by one.<p>Anyway, just some casual observations from a potential user.')
