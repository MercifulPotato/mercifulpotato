I didn&#x27;t think they required branded SFPs, they don&#x27;t on some of their other hardware.<p>Similarly for mikrotik.<p>I usually find that companies with &quot;licensable&quot; features on their hardware are the ones locking their SFPs to their switches&#x2F;etc in an effort to enforce what is basically a port license (aka buy our $80 SFPs instead of the generic ones we are rebranding so we can make $ on your port usage vs just adding a $$$&#x2F;port license fee).')
