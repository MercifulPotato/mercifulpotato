You need it to stand the test of multiple generations.<p>&gt; students aren&#x27;t majoring in HASS at all anymore.<p>Some are.  Some aren&#x27;t.  In the past, some were, and some weren&#x27;t.  So... not much change.<p>&gt; At a high level HASS is more non-penetrable than any hard science where you can plug numbers in and test whether or not the equations they give you actually work.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s because HASS <i>isn&#x27;t</i> hard science, so it doesn&#x27;t work like hard science.  If you expect it to, that&#x27;s your fault, not HASS&#x27;s.<p>&gt; Universities are now job training institutions where people go for credentials and get out, nothing more.<p>Some do.  Some don&#x27;t.  Perhaps more do than used to.<p>&gt; The students there don&#x27;t join any of the extracurriculars or sports teams, they just get their STEM degrees and get out.<p>Some do.  Some don&#x27;t.  Same as before.<p>&gt; So HN, have the humanities and university system failed society?<p>You really sound like you came here with your own view (and an axe to grind), and you want HN to endorse it.<p>The humanities have in fact failed society, but not at all in the way you describe.  People not going to extracurriculars has <i>nothing</i> to do with whether the humanities have failed society.  (Extracurriculars aren&#x27;t the humanities, and college students aren&#x27;t society.)<p>First, the humanities have failed society by being hijacked.  All the various flavors of Critical Theory have hijacked the humanities.  They largely aren&#x27;t the humanities any more; they&#x27;re cheerleaders (and indoctrinators) for a particular narrow subset of views.  They should be thinking and teaching much more broadly than that.<p>Second, the humanities seemingly forgot how to speak to the broader society, or else forgot the value of doing so.  They speak (so far as I have seen) to each other, and to humanities students, but they speak little to the broader society.  (Though it could be that, when they do so, I don&#x27;t recognize it as &quot;humanities&quot;, which would mean that they are in fact doing it well rather than badly...)')
