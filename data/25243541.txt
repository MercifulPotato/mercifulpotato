Tbh I can’t wrap my head around why people keep sharing this article like it means something. Is it just math illiteracy? The question that they are clearly trying to answer is ‘is the problem worse than the cure’ but instead of measuring the change in covid deaths due to lockdown and comparing that to the change in suicides due to lockdown, they are comparing the total deaths in each category. That makes as much sense as “I’m currently 120 miles from Chicago and it’s 2:00, so dividing 120 by 2 I figure I’m going 60 mph.”')
