Perhaps the most annoying part of modern infosec is the absolute deluge of noise you get from scanning tools. Superfluous CVEs like this contribute to the sea of red security engineers wake up to when they look at their dashboards. Unsurprisingly, these are eventually mostly ignored.<p>Every large security organization requires scanning tooling like Coalfire, Checkmarx, Fortify and Nessus, but I&#x27;ve rarely seen them used in an actionable way. Good security teams come up with their own (effective) ways of tracking new security incidents or vastly filtering the output of these tools.<p>The current state of CVEs and CVE scanning is that you&#x27;ll have to wrangle with bullshit security reports if you run any nontrivial software. This is especially the case if you have significant third party JavaScript libraries or images. And unfortunately you can&#x27;t just literally ignore it, because infrequently one of those red rows in the dashboard will actually represent something like Heartbleed.')
