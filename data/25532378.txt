Brexit will only make my life worse. I don&#x27;t see any upside to it. None. We are also setting a terrible example to the rest of the world when we should all be cooperating to tackle COVID, climate change and other international challenges.<p>A bunch of old white guys, who will be mostly dead soon, have wrecked the UK on the altar of nationalism, bigotry and nostalgia.
