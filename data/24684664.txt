More money in goes right through to the other side.  Those extra 600 per week did not get banked, it got spent.  Granted, I didn&#x27;t see any of it because I&#x27;m thankfully still working; but I&#x27;m under zero illusions that it didn&#x27;t pay for things like TV, cable, maybe a computer; and most probably some touchless delivery meals.')
