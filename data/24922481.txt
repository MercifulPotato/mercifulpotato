One of my projects at work is supporting a legacy ColdFusion website that is nearly 20 years old (well, it was started 20 years ago, but has seen updates since). We&#x27;d love to move it to something faster, but it is huge and it would literally take years to rewrite it. Other things take priority so it will probably never be rewritten. I imagine there are Python projects in a similar boat.')
