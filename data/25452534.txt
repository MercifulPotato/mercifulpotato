Dropping all the legalese, the contract was roughly this: &quot;You have no rights. We have all the rights. This contract is perpetual in eternity.&quot; After I had brought up my concerns, their representative used almost the same words that &quot;it does not imply what you think in the context...&quot; I figured that either they were fools or they thought I&#x27;m a fool, but in either case I&#x27;d better leave the table.')
