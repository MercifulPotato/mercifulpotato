Race is used to describe something completely different.<p>If it was like dog breeding, you&#x27;d say that the people who come from Pitcairn Island are one race, then those who come from the Shetland Isles are another, then the Sentinel Islanders are another, and the royal families of europe are another, then there&#x27;s the rest of us, who&#x27;ve been interbreeding forever.<p>This is obviously not how race is used. How it is used is some loose mix between melanin, nose and eye shape, and hair type. Does that make sense? Of course not - and why should it? The people who came up with the idea also burned people at the stake for witchcraft.')
