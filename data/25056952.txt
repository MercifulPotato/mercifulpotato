They&#x27;re pretty much useless today because there&#x27;s no context.<p>If I had had the foresight to bring along a cassette recorder, that would have been the context. But I didn&#x27;t, and neither did anyone else. Of course, there&#x27;s no way I could have afforded the large number of cassette tapes, either, so the point is moot.<p>It&#x27;s too bad all those lectures are lost to history.')
