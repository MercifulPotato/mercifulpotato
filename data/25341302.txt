Many of which probably involve massive suffering and lifelong disability. It also ignores the 38000 car occupants that die every year due to accidents. And the 3,000,000 injuries to car occupants each year of which 2,000,000 include permanent injuries.<p>So cherrypicking the smallest number seems very disingenuous to me.')
