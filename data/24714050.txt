Check it out:<p>WLOG assume the car is in door A (The rest will be the same by symmetry.)<p>You pick A, B, or C.<p>The host picks one of the other two doors to show you.<p>The universes can be described by your choice, followed by the host&#x27;s random choice. There are 6 possibilities: AB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CB.<p>Since we&#x27;re not in a universe where the host chose a car, we eliminate BA and CA.<p>We are left with four possibilities: AB, AC, BC, CB.<p>AB = You chose the correct door. (probability 1&#x2F;4)<p>AC = You chose the correct door. (probability 1&#x2F;4)<p>BC = You chose the wrong door. (probability 1&#x2F;4)<p>CB = You chose the wrong door. (probability 1&#x2F;4)<p>Since the host&#x27;s choice was random, it&#x27;s 50&#x2F;50 as to whether the car is behind the door you chose or the remaining door.<p>This same reasoning breaks down when the host knows what&#x27;s behind the doors because you&#x27;re no longer eliminating a couple of the universes and it&#x27;s a 2&#x2F;6 vs 4&#x2F;6 situation.')
