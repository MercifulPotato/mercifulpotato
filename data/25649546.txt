I went to a physical therapist to learn it, and unfortunately I have no idea who else teaches these kinds of exercises.<p>Given the nature that they&#x27;re physical, explaining them over text could lead to problems and I don&#x27;t want to recommend something that could injure someone due to a misunderstanding.<p>As an overall concept, muscle building works by finding the sore muscles, holding them in spot where they are sore, but holding in spot in a soft way, not a tense way, and then counting slowly to 10.  Then give 5 to 10 seconds of relax, then do again, 10 times at first.  It only takes a few weeks doing exercises every other day for the muscle strength to build.<p>Headaches by definition are caused by tense &#x2F; sore muscles, so learning the right exercises will remove headaches.  However, sinus headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches are different.  Also, if you have mattress or pillow problems, muscle building exercises are like walking up a high altitude mountain; it&#x27;s not going to help as much as you&#x27;re like.  It may help to start with your mattress, if applicable, and then learn muscle building exercises.<p>Posture problems, like having your head too far forward, is caused by using the incorrect muscles which then strengthens the incorrect ones and weakens the correct ones.  (Usually neck and upper back muscles.)  By muscle building the weak ones, your posture will naturally fix itself.<p>When working on shoulder and upper back muscles I do muscle building exercises with my arms with 5 lb weights.<p>When it comes to headaches, I do a series of neck muscle building exercises.<p>Oh also, chiropractors are pseudo-science.  If you feel like you need a chiropractor, what for 99% of the people out there actually need is muscle building exercises.  The muscles hold up the spine, so even with a messed up spine muscle building exercises help more than just about anything else, often completely removing pain.')
