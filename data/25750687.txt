Building good UX is hard, iterative work and requires a connection of right and left brain thinking via communication or generalists.<p>Graphic, UI, UX and game designers are typically not as engaged with open source as programmers and engineers. Is this a cultural issue or is it inherent? Ultimately any given UI is a concretion, but I&#x27;ve noticed a strong trend to abstraction in these fields. Design Systems&#x2F;Language, Design Thinking and so on. I mean the term &quot;UX&quot; is in of itself an abstraction. And the digital tools that designers use today are much more powerful and varied than just a decade ago.<p>Maybe it is a matter of time until there is more engagement in open source from the design world.')
