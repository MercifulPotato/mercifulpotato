If someone thinks SmartScreen isn&#x27;t a good solution, they should disable it. Using a different solution is independent of that.<p>To use your smoke detector analogy: if a smoke detector goes off twice a day and once in the middle of the night every other night, you sure as heck DO throw it out. If only because every false alarm desensitises you to actual alarms and makes your default reaction to just remove the batteries of that thing.<p>The real issue is that the false alarms don&#x27;t necessarily come from a faulty detector, but are due to the fact that someone keeps smoking in the house or keeps burning their food all the time and then keeps telling everyone that smoking doesn&#x27;t affect them negatively, because they only smoke one cigarette every other day so smoking is actually safe for everyone and that the detector is to blame for all the false alarms.')
