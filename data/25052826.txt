We haven&#x27;t had to build any special build tooling. The build times are greater than Go, but we&#x27;re able to keep things manageable by breaking the project into separate Crates (all still within the same repo and directory tree), which can take advantage of incremental compilation.<p>Rust has the memory control we&#x27;re looking for with the safety of a higher level language. For programming that requires concurrency, as most server software including this project does, it&#x27;s fantastic as the compiler will prevent data races. The way Rust has you deal with errors also makes it easier to write correct code at compile time rather than finding problems at runtime when they can be harder to track down.<p>Most of what I wrote here a few years ago still feels true:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.influxdata.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rust-can-be-difficult-to-learn-and-frustrating-but-its-also-the-most-exciting-thing-in-software-development-in-a-long-time&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.influxdata.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;rust-can-be-difficult-to-lea...</a><p>I also talk about using Rust in the announcement blog post here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.influxdata.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;announcing-influxdb-iox&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.influxdata.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;announcing-influxdb-iox&#x2F;</a>')
