They don’t necessarily think about usability except in terms of a11y. Uptime, yes. Human experience interacting with it? Likely only if it resembles workflows that are similar and painful for them. This isn’t faulting these people defining these requirements! It’s a call to all the types of HN readership to put yourself more in the position to bring the knowledge that informs your contribution into the requirements process. You might never know that the success of the project you work on depends on your knowledge of color accuracy or time zones or particular patterns of abuse... until you get yourself a seat at the “first things first” table.')
