The FDA collects fees from OTC drug manufacturers (who operate under a standard &quot;monograph&quot; recipe that outlines their doses and formulations); those fees fund the FDA monograph programs. That makes economic sense! I don&#x27;t think people anticipated distilleries becoming OTC drug manufacturers by dint of producing hand sanitizer.')
