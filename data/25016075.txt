Users of CSV files are not just people who can use Vim or a hex editor, it’s a general-purpose format. I can’t read nor edit the file with TextEdit, Notepad might also make it hard. Software that assumes C-style strings (where NULL terminates a string) can’t process your file without a complete rewrite. And even with Vim, I had to type ^Vu0000 to get the NULL in there, which is much less comfortable than comma or tab. (No, I’m not adding a key sequence for NULL to my .vimrc.)')
