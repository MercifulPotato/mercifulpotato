Getting to GPT10 is just a matter of money at this point. This straightforward scaling scenario leads inevitably to more resources spent on more compute (and different kinds of specialized computation), which simultaneously drives down prices and pushes forward performance.<p>Siri is the Altavista of AI. When the Google of AI appears in the next 5 years, it will rock our world harder than anyone expects. No one expected Google, even though plenty were hyping the internet. The same thing is happening with ML today.')
