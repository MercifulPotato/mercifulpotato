According to [0] we can see in 2019 the UK consumed 20.8bn litres of diesel and 16.2bn litres of petrol for non-commercial use. Taking the energy consumption of 10 KWh and 8.9 KWh of a litre of diesel and petrol respectively gives us an annual total of 3.4x10^11 KWh.<p>Dividing this number by 8760 (the number of hours in 2019) gives us 40,203,196 KW, or 40 GW total energy consumption. Assuming that electric vehicles are 5x more efficient than ICE, gives us about 8GW of electricity needed to replace all petrol and diesel consumption in the UK.<p>According to [1] the UK&#x27;s peak consumption is currently 61.9 GW with a theoretical maximum of 75.3 GW. So to replace all non-commercial fuel used would be 13% of the peak usage.<p>According to [2] the UK&#x27;s total electricity generation in 2019 was 323.7 TWh which is 3.237x10^11 KWh which is roughly equivalent to the total energy value for non-commercial diesel and petrol calculated above. Assuming again the 5x efficiency gain that would mean a ~20% increase in the amount of energy that would need to be generated.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ukpra.co.uk&#x2F;en&#x2F;about&#x2F;facts-and-figures" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ukpra.co.uk&#x2F;en&#x2F;about&#x2F;facts-and-figures</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ofgem.gov.uk&#x2F;ofgem-publications&#x2F;76160&#x2F;13537-elecgenfactsfspdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ofgem.gov.uk&#x2F;ofgem-publications&#x2F;76160&#x2F;13537-elec...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;877047&#x2F;Press_Notice_March_2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a>')
