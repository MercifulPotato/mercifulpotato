I am not going to worry about some abstraction. You have to be more particular. In my case I change features on on need basis with no problems. Hence I have 0 issues with the monolith. Micro- services actually do not really make life any easier. All that immense cloudy push is driven by handful of very big corps who&#x27;d build architecture for scale that most of the businesses would never even dream to approach. So I&#x27;ll let them worry about their problems and I&#x27;ll worry about mine. I am not in business of transferring my money to cloud paying 10x and more comparatively to my current solutions.')
