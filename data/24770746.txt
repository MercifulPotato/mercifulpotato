Item(by='charwalker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602625947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748032, text='Collecting, storing, selling, or otherwise using any digital data in any way traceable to a person, entity including device or location, or other single identifying point of information should require informed consent and contract with minimum dollar value set by law to like $10. Add a bypass where entities do not have to sign to this contract to use the app or site, opting out of all tracking and data collection beyond those specified in ToS for subscribers or registered users of the service.<p>Now every service in the US that can identify any individual entity must agree to a contract with minimum monetary value for every entity or stop collecting data that has any use beyond generic trends, much like Google trends itself. Maybe eliminate third parties without their own user consent and contract so if I consent to the site having my data (for $10) then any deal with third parties must reflect a smaller amount (say $2) per third party data pull. Fold that cost into the cost of selling user data.<p>Add exceptions for good faith research, education, healthcare, and similar groups (not all nonprofits but select types or areas of work) so they do not have a minimum dollar amount but maintain a contract with informed consent by both parties. Force opt out by default behavior by making auto-check options to subscribe, agree to terms, etc all unchecked with disclaimer about what you are signing up for by checking including email volume or third parties. Add language for a simple overview of any contracts or ToS acknowledging the law and entity rights including ability to use the service without data collection.<p>Basically, F u Pay me but for digital data with further third party deals returning on the investment that is your site vising, sales, etc habits. Make it so companies either have to fork over real money (not pennies on their revenue) or stop collecting data.')
