I build different rigs for timelapse motion control so the steppers are perfect, but live action motion really needs the speed a servo can provide. I did take what I learned from that to building a motion control focus puller for time lapse that used the stepper from this test. This rig doesn&#x27;t need to arbitrarily adjust focus and does a &quot;dumb&quot; move focus ring from point A to point B in predetermined amount of time. Much easier to program.')
