This is curious to me. My understanding is that drugs fail primarily in two ways:<p>1) It&#x27;s ineffective - fails to treat the disease. Which is partially covered by model validity, but also impacted by pharmacokinetics and distribution.  Essentially your molecule can work, it just can&#x27;t get where it needs to go in a high enough concentration to make a difference.<p>2) It&#x27;s unsafe - your molecule is toxic either acutely or long term.<p>The data[0] I&#x27;m aware of indicates that these issues occur with roughly equal frequency.  (My assumptions being: failure in Phase 1 trials are an issue of safety, failure in phase 2 can be caused by safety or effectiveness).  Which for me calls into question the focus solely on good disease models.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrd3078" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrd3078</a>')
