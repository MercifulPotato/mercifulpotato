Item(by='randomdata', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612082641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975569, text='<i>&gt; There is no reason in principle that they couldn&#x27;t do this as soon as you fill out the paperwork, i.e. on March 1st the instant you lose your other job and become a sole proprietor with no income.</i><p>But you won&#x27;t really know if March is going to be income-less until it is over. On March 1st I may still be hopeful that tomorrow will be a better day. Soon it is the 31st and I realize I didn&#x27;t make anything. You&#x27;re still dependent on hindsight, no? Whereas UBI fronts the money and then if March 15th provided me a major windfall, I can give it back.<p>We can shrink the period even further. Let&#x27;s say a day. If you cannot find a source of income on March 1st, you can submit the paperwork at the end of the day. But you&#x27;re still looking to the past, whereas UBI would give you the money first and then adjust accordingly in the future. In the real world there is always going to be some kind of lag to the time to filing the paper work. There isn&#x27;t a constant stream of conscious delivered to the tax man. And reporting daily is a <i>huge</i> amount of overhead for someone. I cannot imagine in practice that it would be practical to provide such reporting more often than a weekly&#x2F;bi-weekly schedule at the very most. The length of period doesn&#x27;t actually matter here, though. The logic is exactly the same if you report every second or only once per year.<p>I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m still not seeing how a negative income tax can ever provide you the money before you know what your income is (the past). In contrast, UBI assumes you will have no income and then is clawed back if that assumption is false (the future). That is not just framing, there is a practical difference in the real world as far as I can see in your examples.')
