The temporal ambition started with titling the next movie &quot;Episode V: Empire Strikes Back&quot; and renaming the original movie &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;. I agree maximizing profits plays a big part, he made things up as he went along and in interviews over the years he switched between saying it&#x27;s a 6&#x2F;9&#x2F;12 movie saga. But whatever his motivations, he still had the temporal ambition to &quot;start from the middle&quot; and leveraged that idea to build a lasting franchise. And that really impresses me.')
