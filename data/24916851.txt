So in order to use the app at all you do have to upload your documents to servers you don&#x27;t control. But this isn&#x27;t my biggest pain point, as long as export capabilities are comprehensive and my data is private.<p>But that&#x27;s not the case here. For an open-source app that requires uploading personal documents to yet another USA-based server there is a surprising lack of focus on privacy. Without end-to-end encryption it&#x27;s unreasonable to take the privacy risk that serious use of this app entails. And I&#x27;ve been burned by one too many productivity apps to believe there&#x27;s not going to be a willful or accidental privacy breach here too.')
