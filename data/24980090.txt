Item(by='ineedasername', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604415117, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974201, text='They&#x27;re available around me like that too, but not in sufficient quantities. If my district tried to buy 1,000 from Walmart, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to. They&#x27;re trickling in from suppliers slowly. It&#x27;s also difficult to do a dozen of one type, 50 of another model, etc. The district needs to support these, and the more models there are the bigger the burden of support, different OS versions and levels of support&#x2F;updates from the manufacturer. So, not a first choice, but it&#x27;s still better than nothing. If they managed to get 200 more kids learning then it would be worth it.')
