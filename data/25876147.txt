The internet adds more options for &quot;central meeting places&quot; even if the geography is absurdly large (say, a random sampling of Texas or Alaska) even if you can&#x27;t find other ways to incentivize travel to in person meetings.<p>That said though, when was the last time any representative in the US was concerned about in person community meetings? It&#x27;s a beautiful ideal, but in practice it seems nonexistent. The status quo, especially when you look at the maps of how some districts have been gerrymandered to incredibly abstract shapes is already broken from the ideal. Maybe it&#x27;s time to shift the ideal? We have the technology to try new things that aren&#x27;t necessarily beholden to geography today, among other ideas.')
