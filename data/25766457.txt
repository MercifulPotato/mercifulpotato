I think itâ€™s an incredibly nuanced subject why people downvote. On sites like stack overflow or quora where there is more structure around answers and questions a cookie-cutter type response as to why somethings are downvoted may be a good approach but not on hacker news type sites. It would be a great idea to create a tool that allows others to leave a private reply anonymously so one can learn at least what others are thinking when they downvote even if one does not agree with the provided reply.<p>The anonymous reply could be visible to everyone also as long as it remains anonymous I think is the key.<p>In fact it could even improve the community if serial downvoters are required to leave replies instead of downvoting an unpopular comment to the abyss.')
