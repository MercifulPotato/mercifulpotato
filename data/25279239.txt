Item(by='LeonM', descendants=None, kids=[25279590], score=None, time=1606932225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277054, text='I found the example of the automated email to the ship&#x27;s captain a bit weak.<p>&gt; The point is that we don’t know, the captain of the ship itself didn’t know, and that nobody may know<p>It all boils down to abstraction. Just like the captain doesn&#x27;t need to know why a certain type of steel is used for the hull of his ship, or how the software works that monitors his engines. The captain doesn&#x27;t need to understand the calculation that goes behind the optimal arrival time of his ship.<p>But I&#x27;m sure that, if he&#x27;s curious enough, he can contact the right people at his employer to tell him why certain decisions are made.')
