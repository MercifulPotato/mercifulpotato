Specifically, the guidance advised pilots to\ncounter unwanted roll tendencies from a malfunctioning rudder with the application of up\nto full aileron control inputs. However, the guidance did not advise pilots that, at some\nairspeeds, an uncommanded full rudder input could not be successfully opposed by full\nwheel (aileron and spoiler) inputs and that a reduction in the airplane’s angle-of-attack\ncould improve the effectiveness of the roll controls relative to the effectiveness of the\nrudder. Boeing’s guidance for relieving a jammed rudder informed pilots only that they\nshould use maximum force to overpower the jam and specifically warned pilots against\nturning off flight control switches “unless the faulty control was positively identified.” No additional guidance was provided about the effects of flight control switch selections\non rudder jam conditions.</i>')
