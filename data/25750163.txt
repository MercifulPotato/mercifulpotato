Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610472717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25750018, text='&gt; Living in the Suburbs has many benefits. Larger homes, backyards and is safer for kids to run around. All valid reasons to chose them. Lets not try and change people, but work with their preferences.<p>No one will need to try and change people, they will be forced to change once the budget deficits force their hand.  The ones that can may move to a new jurisdiction and start the game over.<p>I also would not say kids are safer in suburbs.  Lots of car traffic, lots of big roads to cross, lots of big cars since why not buy an SUV&#x2F;pickup.')
