Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608472545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25481415, text='How is it clickbait? The title says it compares a specific CPU model vs another specific CPU model and that is exactly what it does. Where do you see deception in the title?<p>&gt;Show me an x86 laptop in the same power envelope that can match the fanless MacBook Air with the m1. Iâ€™ll wait. Oh and do so at roughly 1k.<p>How does this prove that the title is lying?<p>&gt;On the desktop the Mac mini is 699 USD in its base spec. The 5800X is 500 euros on its own before motherboard, case, ram etc etc.<p>Again, how is this relevant to whether the title is clickbait or not?<p>&gt;Apples to apples benchmarks either controlling for power or price would make for a more relevant article.<p>Seriously, what does this have to do with clickbait?<p>Here is my perspective. I saw lots of articles that pretended that the M1 is better than all x86 CPUs including Ryzens (one of them is linked in the article). This was getting on my nerves because everyone is being dishonest. I clicked on this article because the title compared a Ryzen desktop CPU with the M1 with the expectation that these benchmarks disprove the garbage journalism and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. The Ryzen 5800X performs better than the M1. x86 is still strong in single core performance. Those real &quot;clickbait&quot; articles were just lazy and trying to hype something up.<p>This article is not clickbait and you are just being dishonest.')
