A nerve cell cannot speak for the cells that are ultimately harvested. To make it ethical, the nerve cell has to choose the suffering, to at least join the fate of all the crushed other cells. Because one way or another, billions of living cells are killed.<p>But you can turn this also the other way round: If we are all, humans, cows and trees, ultimately one living creature, why should we worry more about dying cows than we worry about our dying skin cells or dying white blood cells that defend us? We are killing more awareness by drowning our attention in cheap entertainment and we are enduring more suffering by not delivering food to the starving children, and adults around the world.')
