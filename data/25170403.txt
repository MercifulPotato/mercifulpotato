Also, M1 GPU has &quot;extensions&quot; that aren&#x27;t being benchmarked...<p>&gt; The PS5 is, in raw performance, 4 times faster than the M1 chip.<p>I already said that the ps5 GPU is a generation ahead of M1, so it is no wonder it is more performant.<p>Anyway, like I said, we will have to wait for some comparable benchmarks. Not sure how that will ever happen though.')
