You learn dedication at university.<p>It&#x27;s not dedication. It&#x27;s simply a deadline that you must meet or face failure otherwise.<p>&gt;University also teaches you to take a risk on something long term. You pay a bunch of money, and work hard without compensation for a number of years, hoping it will pay off somehow. Your risk not making the grade and dropping out, losing the investment of time and money.<p>Actually university is opposite of taking a risk. It&#x27;s a safe choice. You get a degree - you get a good job. It&#x27;s something that always drilled into everybody.\nTaking a risk is doing something that is opposite of common sense.')
