Instead, he might go off and do something like Terence Tao and hack away at the Twin Prime conjecture in a series of papers that require a PhD in mathematics just to understand the abstract. It&#x27;s a lot harder to become famous that way, even if the work being done is much harder in some sense.<p>I don&#x27;t want to diminish the genius of pa-h mathematicians, because Euler is still a legitimate genius by any measure, but part of the reason why he could get around the way he did is that he was metaphorically working in a field where he could pluck ripe fruit off the ground. Similar geniuses exist today, but even as geniuses they still need ladders to get to the fruit now, and that just takes more time.<p>I&#x27;m not lamenting this, celebrating it, or judging it... it just is the way it is.')
