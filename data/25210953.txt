No labeling is needed.. speech that doesn&#x27;t cause physical harm should not be labeled!<p>Im speaking as a proponent of free speech only as I could not vote for that person and do not believe much of any political mumbo jumbo (to me it&#x27;s two billionaires using their resources to do whatever and make up whatever to win).')
