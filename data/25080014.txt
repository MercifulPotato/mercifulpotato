Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605253547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077664, text='&gt; Of course neither side would use all their active warheads on the opposing country; they would save some for other nations<p>Nor would all of those warheads will detonate, land on target (some will hit and target the ocean) or launch successfully.<p>&gt; But full scale nuclear war would eliminate North America,<p>I doubt it. Maybe you&#x27;re being hyperbolic here, to whit.<p>If you eliminate the top 20 US ports, the aircraft carriers and a couple military bases (including Washington DC), you have destroyed modern USA but you do have to wait out the sub launches and miscellaneous hidden missile silos. There&#x27;s little point to sending nukes to Montana, Kansas, etc. Nothing more (probably a lot less). Show me something that asserts anything more is necessary.<p>You don&#x27;t eliminate land and population you dont have to, to win a war. Mad-max wastelands are hyperbolic fantasy that ignore basic human agency, imo. Country X isn&#x27;t scared of refugees or natives of Louisiana forming an invasion force to retaliate so there&#x27;s no reason to wipe out the land. Again, misfires happen and nuclear fallout is bad for everyone, but that&#x27;s not the same thing as &quot;eliminating&quot; NA.')
