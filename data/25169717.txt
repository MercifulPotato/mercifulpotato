You will never convince a bin part&#x2F;least common denominator manufacturer like Intel or AMD to do that.<p>Of course you will because that happens <i>all the time.</i> How do you think we ended up with VT-x and friends? Intel took a use case that reached enough usage and added specialized instructions for it. This has happened a <i>ton</i> over the years on x86. See also AES-NI for a more application-specific addition. In addition to obviously the huge amount of SIMD experimentation.<p>This is not fruit Apple discovered. AMD &amp; Intel haven&#x27;t been leaving this performance on the table the last 20+ years. Hell the constant addition of instructions for certain workloads is a major reason x86 is as huge &amp; complex as it is.')
