At the places I&#x27;ve worked&#x2F;hired, if a candidate&#x27;s ask was below the bottom of the range we paid that role, we just paid them the bottom of the range (regardless of their ask). It&#x27;s a win&#x2F;win from a hiring perspective. You hired a candidate for the minimum you possibly could (from a budget perspective) and the candidate is grateful you didn&#x27;t hire them on their bad ask.<p>At some terrible companies even, it&#x27;s harder to hire someone outside of their defined salary band. Even if you don&#x27;t care about being nice or paying fairly, your life is just made easier by paying them the bottom of the range rather than dealing with HR about salary bands.')
