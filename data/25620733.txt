This and ziglearn.org are just great as a starting point.<p>If I may here are three additional pieces of information that if added to your documentation will clarify some more things for the beginner&#x2F;reader:<p>1) Arrays and Slices section<p>Arrays in Zig are values. They store the pointer and the length, but an array is a value so the raw pointer can never be accesses unless....<p>You coerce the array to a slice. A slice reveals a pointer to you.<p>2) Add tagged unions (I do not understand what they are but they exist, maybe some fellow reader here could help me)<p>3) If, for, while and switch can ALSO BE EXPRESSIONS!<p>Now to the part that does not address you directly but everyone.<p>These tutorials are great, but they are the mere starting point. I admire Zig and its design, I admire Andrew and that awesome community, I love Zig Showtime and everything. But there are two problems I have with Zig that annoy me and that is only because I REALLY want to learn it and ditch C already:<p>*  I am trying to figure out how to do system&#x27;s programming. Like use all the system calls and their system library wrapper equivalent&#x27;s that I am so used to in C. After an hour of research on the net I could not even figure out how to read in and go through the contents of a file (fread, fstat, fgets, fopen). That stuff needs to go into the official documentation or at least to ziglearn.org<p>* The same way the Zig compiler is awesome the underlying build file you often wanna write is just horribly documented. I don&#x27;t understand half of it and it changes a lot. Andrew should really politely ask people on the internet to take down old repos and blog entries.\nPlease document the build system and build file writing better.')
