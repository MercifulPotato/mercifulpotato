But I think that saying &quot;AirBNB focused on brand&quot; is almost literally a misinterpretation:<p>&quot;Brand is an extension of the Airbnb model, not its own strategy. If the product doesnâ€™t deliver on a differentiated experience, brand building usually does not create loyalty.&quot;<p>This post seems to say that AirBNB didn&#x27;t just focus on brand, but they innovated on &#x2F;somehow&#x2F; making booking UX &quot;10x&quot; (let&#x27;s leave the ostensible 10 aside for a moment and just say &quot;a lot&quot; instead) better than incumbents. But that requires a durable product advantage, one that consistently creates a differentiated experience. It&#x27;s more accurate to say that brand is a downstream side effect of the core product than a sole or primary focus.')
