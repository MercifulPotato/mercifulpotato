You should then be able to parse this Answer because the other participant might have rejected some of the parameters you gave it in the Offer (e.g. it could be ready only for audio and reject your video). Or just ignore the Answer and hope that you know the other party so well that they won&#x27;t reject any of the parameters you provided in the Offer.<p>Finally you would need to receive ICE candidates from the other party, and parse them in order to know <i>where</i> (what IP and port) to send your RTP packets (and RTCP Sender Reports, if any)')
