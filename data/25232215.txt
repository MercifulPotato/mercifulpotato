It boils down to breaking things down and solving each sub-problem as it comes up linearly and then you bust out Socratic questioning to really explore a specific sub-problem to understand it better.<p>So for learning a new language one of the first questions you might ask is &quot;how do I install xyz language&quot;, which you tackle on the spot. Then you move onto the next question which might be &quot;how do I install xyz web framework&quot;, and then you move to the next thing. Before you know it, you&#x27;re a few hours into learning and you already solved basic things like how to get things installed, have a project generated, maybe respond with HTML on a couple of URL endpoints. Not only have you solved these problems but you have something to show for it too.<p>Independent of question driven development, Socratic questioning has been one of the most valuable things I learned in the last couple of years. You can think of almost anything, big or small and attack the problem with the same set of questions. It almost works like magic when you combine both for learning and applying something where you&#x27;re trying to reach an end goal.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;learning-a-new-web-framework-with-question-driven-development" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;learning-a-new-web-framework-...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;would-socrates-use-docker-today" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;would-socrates-use-docker-tod...</a>')
