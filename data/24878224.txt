Item(by='jnxx', descendants=None, kids=[24878360], score=None, time=1603534932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24874806, text='&gt; The more we learn about nuclear, the more expensive it seems to get, in contrast to pretty much any good tech.<p>A lot of the cost of nuclear is about bringing down risk to an acceptable level. And this is why nuclear accidents have increased to cost of nuclear plant construction: They have partly confirmed, and partly uncovered, areas in which plants were not safe enough.<p>The Three Miles Island accident has shown that it is possible that cooling fails, with the consequence of a reactor core melting down, and having a significant aggregation of critical reactive material sitting at the bottom of the reactor vessel. As any physicist knows, an uncontrolled aggregation of fissile stuff can go boom. And this is what in fact happened in Fukushima - several times.<p>In addition, there has been modeling since thee eighties what happens if cooling fails, and the results have been ... not so good. The pressure vessels will not withstand heat and pressure for longer than hours. Which is too little time for wide-range evacuation in a densely populated area.<p>In addition, in Fukushima we&#x27;ve seen what happens if a plant loses electrical power from cooling systems. This is also a real danger in the US plants which are in some cases exposed to disasters like hurricanes or flooding.<p>We have also seen that the storage of <i>used</i> fuel in a nuclear plant is a mayor hazard because it needs to be continually cooled for a long time. And on top of that in plants constructed so far, it has much less protection, so an airplane falling into such a spent fuel storage can cause a significant accident.<p>Then, in the Japanese Monju plant we&#x27;ve seen that breeder reactors which are cooled with liquid sodium are difficult to keep safe in case of a fire. We also now that such breeders can become super-critical if certain things line up. And so on.<p>So, in short, nuclear became more expensive, because we know much more what can go wrong. Whining about &quot;regulatory hurdles&quot; will not cut it. What is the intention here is apparently to cut down on safety regulations, which will have the result of increased risks.')
