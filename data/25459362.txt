Especially if they make deeper cuts on pricing (10% of sales instead of 30% and 3% of transactions instead of 30%).<p>I&#x27;m slightly leery about it all, but definitely warming up to MS this past decade. WSL2 and VS Code have made my life much easier to say the least. Of course this is the intended effect, I no longer have the urgency to get into a full Linux environment this way.<p>On-Topic: glad to see this GWSL thing, as I&#x27;d been thinking about doing similar... getting X and pulseaudio working in windows, and configured right in WSL environment is a pain to say the least.  If this eases that pain even if only for local logins, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  I spent a couple days trying to get it all working... I could launch Ubuntu&#x27;s Firefox instance, but couldn&#x27;t for the life of me get audio working right and just gave up after a couple days.')
