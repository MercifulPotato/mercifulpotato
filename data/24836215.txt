Then, several years later, lo and behold HTTP3 is hyped next, and one big motivation is that HTTP2 turned out to have a head of line blocking problem.<p>What on earth is going on here? Google obviously has great engineering talent and HTTP2 must have been high profile enough to not leave to a bunch of interns. So there must be more nuance to this, does anyone know the score?')
