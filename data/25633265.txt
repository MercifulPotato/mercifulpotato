A union doesn&#x27;t have to imply that it controls everything, or that everyone has to be part of the union to work somewhere.<p>A union could also just be a large entity that collectively bargain on behalf of the workers, and can do so better than they could separately. Often that involves stuff like better safety, pay, getting rid of bad stuff like non-competes etc. And where I&#x27;m from those new things are enforced company wide, not just for the union. So every worker profits from the union, even non-union members.<p>If anything, the non-union members are the deadweight where I live. They get the benefits, without paying any membership fee.')
