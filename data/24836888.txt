Of course the reason people try to multiplex higher level protocol streams over TCP is some butt-hurt over cost&#x2F;availability of multiple TCP connections and a desire to make the higher level protocol appear to have more &quot;parallelism&quot; than is really there. In the case of HTTP so that e.g. you are not forced to use sprite-sheets, data-urls, or just less bloat in order to minimize load latency.<p>My experience so far is that in practice this rarely works out, you end up with nastier TCP level issues instead and I get the impression that this has been the actual experience with HTTP&#x2F;2 as well.<p>In that case the stupid part would be assuming that multiplexing over TCP is a good idea, despite various cautionary tales to the contrary.<p>As I said, I haven&#x27;t looked into this carefully so my superficial impressions might well be wrong, which is why I&#x27;d appreciate input from someone who has properly looked into it.')
