The amount of effort involved in just trying to get a balanced view of our political situation is insane, and few people are willing to spend that much energy. But even though few see the whole picture, most have <i>very</i> strongly held political opinions. This naturally tends towards echo chambers which is obviously really bad if you&#x27;re in a democracy which vitally depends on everyone being well informed.<p>I think this is mainly because we set the wrong incentives, for example outrage drives clicks which drives ad money, though we can also throw evolution some shade for lacking foresight when it made outrage such a strong emotion and gave us a tendency towards reaffirming our own views.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t know how to solve it, and it&#x27;s certainly not a new problem (I guess it&#x27;s been a thing since democracy is a thing), but it seems the web amplified it <i>a lot</i>, to the point where I think it&#x27;s to blame for our current political division.')
