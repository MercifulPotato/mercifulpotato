As far as I know, FTL&#x27;s performance is in line with WebRTC&#x27;s performance. As long as the servers in-between are fast, a good WebRTC implementation should match it.<p>Unfortunately, with Mixer&#x27;s death, I don&#x27;t think there are any major turnkey players left with low latency sub-second streaming. I&#x27;d probably use Discord as a primary alternative which uses WebRTC with Discord&#x27;s servers in-between.<p>If your home connection has the bandwidth to support the load of multiple users, a service that does direct P2P like Parsec will probably give the best performance.')
