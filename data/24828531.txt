You create a system where you <i>have</i> to do certain work because nobody else can. It&#x27;s easy to interpret this as being about your qualities instead of your failings.<p>And eventually this bites everybody on the ass. These people will often become a bottleneck, because while it may look like they won&#x27;t delegate to others, the truth is that they cannot. They don&#x27;t know how, and they&#x27;re standing at the bottom of a hole before it becomes apparent.')
