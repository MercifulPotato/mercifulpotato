Not supporting this currently but something we could do based on our architecture\n- We support searching for title&#x2F;publications&#x2F;authors etc, will definitely add searching within content too at some point<p>Current focus is to be able to streamline our processes and tech so we can indeed deliver some books facilitating a proper reading experience.<p>Jotting down all feedback, hope we had more resources to build more (hope we will eventually get this chance). any other ideas or thoughts, feel free to contact me directly at yorgos@myscreenbreak.com')
