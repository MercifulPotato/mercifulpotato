I <i>am</i> arguing for universal healthcare and for central government to cover things like medical leave and childcare. <i>As and when that&#x27;s actually implemented</i>, I might support some relaxation of the standards for when people are considered as employees (though I suspect Uber probably wouldn&#x27;t care whether these people were classified as contractors if it didn&#x27;t mean they were on the hook for healthcare and benefits). In the meantime, the laws that we currently have are that employers are required to provide these things; Uber needs to step up and fulfil their legal obligations.')
