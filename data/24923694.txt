People make good money writing articles about the latest notetaking app and serving ads. Personally, I&#x27;ve never needed to crack open an old notebook after the relevant project has passed. I have a stack of them from college at my parent&#x27;s house and they are simply collecting dust. Even if I had everything digital I would never feel the need to go back and sift through them since they are no longer relevant.<p>The act of taking notes with a pen and paper, to synthesize thoughts into symbols and sentence structures, is far more meaningful than looking at the note again imo.')
