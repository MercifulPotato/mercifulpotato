Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25863394], score=None, time=1611257312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862852, text='I don&#x27;t believe that they would have been raised by a happily married woman with grandchildren -- or any woman. Oh, you can never say &quot;never&quot;, but I think that very, very few women would see themselves in the characterization expressed there.<p>I cited text that, I believe, women would see as red flags. (I&#x27;d let women speak for themselves here, but HN is rather a suasage fest, and it shouldn&#x27;t fall to the few who are here to do all of the work. If they disagree with me we should certainly discuss that.) Regardless of who the OP actually is in real life, that&#x27;s the way they presented themselves, and I think it&#x27;s important to HN readers to see how that is interpreted.<p>I cannot think of any more productive way to show that. I tried to be as polite and specific as I could while saying what I believe a woman would say, if she felt safe enough to do so. (I reiterate, I wouldn&#x27;t if I thought it likely that a woman would, in this forum. I&#x27;m a secondhand substitute.)')
