Because even the if the RIAA can&#x27;t bribe the judge and jury to liberally interpret the laws on the books, they will freely and openly bribe congress to create new laws to replace the ones that were previously not effective.<p>Advocates for open source software and cryptography and right-to-repair and non-draconian copyright&#x2F;patent protections need to do the things that their opponents do: they need to pony up the cash to do some real lobbying. Otherwise they get stuck in the same perpetual trap of trying to defend their status, one individual situation at a time, against the overapplication of laws that were poorly conceived to begin with. Sad, but the only language that congress talks is money.')
