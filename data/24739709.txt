In fact, it requires a certain degree of magical thinking to believe that the information WOULDN&#x27;T get a wide degree of publicity.<p>Consider the massive numbers of people and industries who are ideologically and economically motivated to show that climate change is a hoax. It&#x27;s an absurdly charged issue. Also consider the massive effort that would be required to thoroughly debunk the many dozens of sources of evidence and papers that suggest climate change is both man-made and accelerating.<p>You are correct that some types of information don&#x27;t spread as fast as others. In fact, the vast majority of information on earth doesn&#x27;t get prominent national attention. By definition, it&#x27;s quite abnormal to reach that level. I don&#x27;t know much about breast cancer screening, but it seems obvious that &quot;breast cancer screening isn&#x27;t as reliable as we thought&quot; isn&#x27;t a shoe-in for front page news, and I&#x27;m not sure why that should have any implications for climate change news.')
