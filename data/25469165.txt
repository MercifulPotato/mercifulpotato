Some headers will always be different (any sort of timestamp based header for example) while others must not be different. URL query params can be in any order, etc.<p>I think if you do api diffing at any reasonably large scale you’ll find yourself immediately building tools to help cut the signal from the noise, and this is an exciting step in that direction.')
