Personally I have desktop and laptop. Laptop is not as powerful as desktop but it is still a little monster soon to be replaced with the big monster of laptop. Laptop is being used for going to client, general development when staying out of the main office for extended time in summer etc. I am not using it in a settings where the external power is not available so I do not really care about the efficiency. Rather I care about performance, especially during builds.')
