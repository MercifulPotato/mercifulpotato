That&#x27;s not only reasonable, it&#x27;s necessary if you want an Apples to Apples comparison.<p>That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re not concerned about the code to render with GPU or some other junk - but we are fundamentally talking about two programs that do different things - but then comparing their line count.<p>Your rant may be valid in other cases, but it seems super off base here. Your rant has, imo, nothing to do with what&#x27;s happening in people pointing out the discrepancy.')
