On top of that, teams threw their entire effort into a single vaccine because billions of people will need it, and they may need it multiple times depending on how this vaccine goes. Cancer drugs are often for one type of cancer, which has fewer people and thus less priority.<p>If 7 billion people were at risk of developing one type of cancer, I think we&#x27;d have a better chance at developing it.
