Item(by='rstuart4133', descendants=None, kids=[24879007], score=None, time=1603533809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857938, text='&gt; I can write software today that will work without modification even on versions of windows from 15 years ago without recompilation.<p>I had a Windows user loudly say this in a room while I was in it.  It&#x27;s true Microsoft does a reasonable job of keeping one programs working.  Not perfect, I&#x27;ve had many stand alone programs fail to run in &quot;compatibility mode&quot;.  It&#x27;s a commendable effort nonetheless.<p>But in contrast, Linus has kept his &quot;don&#x27;t break userspace&quot; promise damned near perfectly.  So upon hearing someone claim yet again how much better Windows does this than Linux, laptop running some 2020 debian stable and a 64 bit Linux kernel, download Debian potato (circa 2000) and expand to a directory on machine running the latest Linux 64 (potato is 32 bit only), chrooted into it, apt install whatever, and showed him it all just works.  I could do that with any distribution on my modern Debian laptop.')
