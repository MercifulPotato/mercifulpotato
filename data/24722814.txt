It&#x27;s the democrat party that should have to denounce it&#x27;s history... except they let people like Ralph Northam continue to govern despite being photographed in a KKK hood. And before you start say &quot;Oh the great switch&quot; the part that&#x27;s never explained by that bs theory is how one day people who had been fighting for civil right woke up and decided to undo everything they had fought for for the last 100 years. You&#x27;re being taught to hate people that aren&#x27;t hateful because then it makes it easier to justify the means of seizing power.')
