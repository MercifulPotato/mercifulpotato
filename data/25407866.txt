So she says &quot;Okay, we&#x27;ll mail you a check.&quot;<p>And that&#x27;s the last I ever heard about it.  I figure they kept it.  I could follow up with the comptroller&#x27;s office, but it&#x27;s already more than my time is worth, so I just complain about it in public, like this, from time to time.')
