We generate an XML file representing the schema which is committed to source control.<p>Then when new version is being deployed, the tool compares the database with the XML, and generates SQL to alter the database.<p>For stored procs etc it compares the text of them, so those that weren&#x27;t changed are ignored.<p>It&#x27;s a simple homebrew tool but it gets the job done.')
