OTOH most logging systems aren&#x27;t set up for dynamic contextual reconfiguration, a place could have a competitive advantage over debuggers with a bit of effort.<p>IME I find it easier to deal with modifications to code than configuration in IDEs, precisely because I can identify diffs and if desired commit the modifications to source control on my own branch. I frequently debug things like third-party libraries (e.g. Ruby gems by adding my rvm gemset) to a git repo to track my modifications.<p>It&#x27;s generally harder to export and import breakpoints from an IDE. They are usually driven by line numbers, which aren&#x27;t particularly stable over code changes.')
