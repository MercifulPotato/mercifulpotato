If I&#x27;m understanding you right then you don&#x27;t quite understand what I&#x27;m saying.<p>My claim is that it&#x27;s disingenuous to say that Uber is exploiting their workers. If you think these are terrible conditions that nobody would ever work under unless they were being coerced you have to grapple with the fact that nobody is coercing anybody to become Uber drivers.<p>If you think that these are immoral working conditions then what you really believe is that a large chunk of our society is immorally made to live in poverty, and you&#x27;re blaming Uber but how could this be Uber&#x27;s fault?<p>If someone has genuinely decided to accept work for $4&#x2F;hr and this shocks you so much that you&#x27;re demanding Uber give them more, you should <i>also</i> be shocked that so many people are currently earning $0&#x2F;hr if you have any hope of having a consistent worldview.<p>When seen from this lens the whole argument over SB 5 and Prop 22 makes no sense at all. Stop focusing on Uber, ask your legislators to stop focusing on Uber, and to start attempting to solve the real problem.')
