I try to follow the latest trends in front-end development, and I haven&#x27;t heard anything about Deno for a while. It didn&#x27;t sound very attractive when I read about it, and I&#x27;m not excited about switching. I&#x27;ll begrudgingly start using it if the community decides that it&#x27;s better. Their dependency management idea also seems pretty bad to me, and it would be difficult to maintain. NPM + Snowpack [1] feels like a much better system.<p>I think Node.js is probably going to stay the winner for now, but that might just be me.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snowpack.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snowpack.dev</a>')
