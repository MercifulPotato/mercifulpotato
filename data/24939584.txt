In a non-technical sense to be sure 3 is a bigger number than 2 but that&#x27;s a terrible reason to do anything.<p>Keccak&#x27;s sponge construction is novel, it has some cool features compared to Merkle–Damgård but when SHA-3 was standardised we had very little experience with this construction. Now, maybe we lucked out and these are the perfect parameters, not too slow, not too weak. But most likely we went too far in one direction and so hence &quot;Maybe Skip SHA-3&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperialviolet.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;31&#x2F;skipsha3.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imperialviolet.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;31&#x2F;skipsha3.html</a>')
