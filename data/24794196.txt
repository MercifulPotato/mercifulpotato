I feel wuite the opposite. people make decisions based on many factors: logic, yes, but also past experience, common heuristics, mood, and situational context.<p>A lot of what education is supposed to do is shape your instincts towards what is productive: there&#x27;s no particular reason that reading history in my spare time should _feel_ productive, but it does.

They&#x27;re not; they&#x27;re a conflict of mindsets, fully fleshed out states of being.<p>Arguments are a facades on beliefs - states of being. That&#x27;s not an illness; that&#x27;s being human.')
