The likelihood of contracting it is of course very high, but the risk of adverse effects are only high for a relatively small stratum of the population.<p>It makes sense to reserve &quot;very high&quot; for pathogens like HIV or Ebola, not SARS-CoV-2.  For a very large majority of the population, SARS-CoV-2 has approximately equal risk to the four seasonally circulating coronaviruses, so even a small risk from an overlooked data point might be significant.<p>We need to reach herd immunity one way or another, so I&#x27;m not sure the discussion of individual risk is the right one.  With no data being available for patients to examine ourselves, it&#x27;s hard to even know how to make these decisions.')
