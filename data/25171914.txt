Nobody wants to hire someone who doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s an unattractive quality, and it suggests they won&#x27;t succeed as an employee.<p>And interviewing at a very selective company doesn&#x27;t need to negate your belief in your own value. If you could be the top applicant at some other company but you interview at a company that might not even hire you, then applying there should be a choice that you&#x27;re making because the trade-off is somehow beneficial to you. Your value within the overall job market remains, and you can always walk away.')
