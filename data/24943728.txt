Defensive driving doesn&#x27;t act based on predictions of what external agents _will_ do, which may have regional variation. It identifies what external agents _could_ do, which does not have regional variation, and engages accordingly with rules and physics e.g. by making sure that the vehicle always has a safe escape path if it needs to stop abruptly or swerve to avoid a collision.')
