Maybe that&#x27;s wrong, but I don&#x27;t want to live in .md code mode (for this reason, I miss Evernote). I author in Typora, but I don&#x27;t want to keep <i>notes</i> in MD.<p>* It&#x27;s sync-ing options don&#x27;t map to the most used syncing tech on desktops these days. I&#x27;d have to pay for Dropbox (given my current ecosystem) just to use it to sync.<p>* I want folders and sub-folders. Folders and tags don&#x27;t work for me.<p>* I wish these systems had a built-in journal mode, like Roam.')
