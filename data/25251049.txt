Item(by='forgotmypw17', descendants=None, kids=[25251221], score=None, time=1606714886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25250611, text='I have not dared have children until I&#x27;m certain I can take care of them, and I think I&#x27;m getting close. I don&#x27;t believe in marriage, but I&#x27;m in a relationship. My partners accept me and support me.<p>I am low-maintenance, so it is not a burden on them. My rider is clean water, unprocessed food, Web hosting, a 104-key, a computer, and an Internet connection.<p>I unsubscribed from rent by not renewing my lease and moving out. I rented a storage space for the things I was still attached to at the time, but for much less. After all those boxes went unopened for months and I didn&#x27;t miss them, I felt comfortable getting rid of them too.<p>I read that Elon Musk was big on couch-surfing, so I thought, if he could do it, why not me? I was blessed with friends and family who would put me up for various amounts of time, and the grace and patience to get along with them.<p>Generally speaking, if you want to accomplish something great, you should study those who have already done it. Read their biographies. Read articles and comments about them online. Ignore the noise of common advice you could&#x27;ve gotten from any other schmuck, and look for what they did differently from everyone else.<p>Elon Musk couch-surfs. Steve Jobs &quot;dropped out&quot; of college on paper and kept attending classes he was interested in. Kurt Cobain wore layers. Jimi Hendrix took speed and spent endless hours practicing guitar. Jesus abandoned physical possessions and embraced all-encompassing love of our Universe. If they could do it, why not you? Probably not any smarter or more capable thank you. All it takes is determination.<p>Perfect your actions. Every little thing that you do, make it impeccable. If you can&#x27;t do the small things well, how can you hope to do the big things any better?<p>Connect with the other dimensions. Ignore the nay-sayers and concretists. 150 years ago, something like telephone would be considered impossible. 50 years ago, videochat was just barely non-fiction. We&#x27;ve been alive for millions of years, adapting to all the possibilities our existence provides.<p>In my quest, I visited Urbana-Champaign. I went to the old Netscape office and sat in the parking garage and meditated and slept and dreamed. I traveled to Redmond and Mountain View and all over Silicon Valley, and I listened to the space.<p>I think what&#x27;s really carried me through all these changes is my relationship with higher power. I believe in intelligent Universe which helps me, provides for me, and never gives me more than I can handle.<p>I&#x27;ve heard a saying via my family, and later via others: Gd gives you a day, and Gd gives you food to eat. I live by that, I believe that Gd always loves me, is always there for me, is always watching me, rooting for me, supporting me, and will never give me more than I can handle.<p>I cannot overstate the comfort I feel from knowing this in every situation. It&#x27;s like being an ant or a beetle, but knowing that there&#x27;s a giant mountain of a human somewhere up there who&#x27;s watching out for me, and won&#x27;t let me come to any harm.<p>Of course, my ability to take care of an ant is infintesimal compared to the one who is sysadmin, operator, and developer of my very existence. And an ant has a much greater chance of comprehending a human than I have of comprehending this existence. So I just run along and hope that I&#x27;ll find some sweets in my path, and that I am amusing or interesting or good enough to still be taken care of tomorrow. Kind of like that car battery in Rick &amp; Morty.<p>You can model this any way you want in your mind, but the key is that this spirit of goodness permeates everything in our existence, and it&#x27;s always looking for a way to make things a little bit better, a little bit nicer, a little bit kinder. It&#x27;s infinitely more powerful than all the money in the world put together. It&#x27;s infinitely smarter than all the world&#x27;s computers and humans together. It can literally control every aspect of our existence, modify past present and future faster than you can type sudo. And it&#x27;s here, right now, watching you read this from inside your very mind, opening it up to receive its gift.')
