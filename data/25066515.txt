With QEMU, the performance gap is huge right now.<p>I have several ARM&#x2F;QEMU virtual machines running on my AMD virtualization server, but the emulation overhead makes everything painfully slow, even when assigning 20+ cores to the VM. I picked up an 8GB Raspberry Pi because it&#x27;s often faster to run a workload on the Raspberry Pi than even the many-core AMD emulated system.<p>The emulation overhead across architectures is huge with QEMU.')
