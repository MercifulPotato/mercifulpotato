I sold the house as an opportunist looking at a rational profitable outcome, rather than based on an irrational fear of paranormal manifestations. On the contrary, I did enjoy having the &quot;ghost&quot; messing around, even if it was a bit freaky at the start.<p>It&#x27;s especially disconcerting when the scientific side in the debate is quick to dismiss the paranormal side as irrational. For one, we have seen a similar debate in the past (classical vs quantum physics) and look how that debate turned out. Scientifically oriented people like Dawkins or Tyson who dismiss the opinions of the other side with a wave of the hand are largely damaging the entire process of scientific thought.')
