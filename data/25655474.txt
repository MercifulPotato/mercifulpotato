Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25655481], score=None, time=1609918875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655425, text='Office 365 (or Microsoft 365 or whatever they want to call it today) is also good value. ~$5&#x2F;month gives you more or less the same as Google where it comes to email&#x2F;calendar and 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage. It can go even cheaper at ~$2&#x2F;month for just basic email (on the &quot;Kiosk&quot; plan) if you don&#x27;t need cloud storage and just need hosted e-mail.<p>Regarding your counterpoint, I disagree. It&#x27;s not about ProtonMail claims of encryption or security or anything, it&#x27;s just that their business model is to be selling hosted e-mail services and not advertising, and they have no incentive (nor the technical expertise in-house) to read your e-mails for advertising purposes. Furthermore, ProtonMail and all these other services only get a part of your data, so even if they do use your data nefariously, it&#x27;s better for each one to misuse a separate chunk of it than for one entity to have <i>all</i> of it.')
