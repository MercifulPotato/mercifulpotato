I think we picked around $20&#x2F;person, when in the past we probably spent $75-100.<p>This has been good for us, mainly because it lowers the pressure of gift exchanges. There&#x27;s a big difference between giving (and getting) an unwanted $10 item compared to an unwanted $50 item. The limit removes emphasis from the material value of the item and puts it more on the thought behind the gift.<p>Generally, I think gift-giving culture in the US is out of control and largely doesn&#x27;t benefit the giver nor the recipient.')
