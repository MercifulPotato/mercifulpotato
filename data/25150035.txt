If Facebook wants to do their own thing, they&#x27;re going to be going against Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and the rest of the community.<p>We&#x27;ve seen from both the world of capitalism in general and definitely the software world that consolidation eventually happens, so maybe this situation is inherently unstable and doomed to fail. But IMO the OSM community should work to make it last as long as possible.')
