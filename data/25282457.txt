Item(by='throwawaysflake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606947380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25282081, text='It is the min. additional required, given they calculate capacity usage into very small units (like one of our statements was for $0.20 which is also how they position themselves), I was under the impression from the rep they could re-paper with a token amount(basically roll over without any new significant purchase, for a 10k contract, 1k is to me significant). I of course should have pushed what the new contract min might be so that is on me. But as I mentioned in my reply elsewhere details that their min. purchase policies changes and apply to different people differently, which is their prerogative, but I&#x27;m just recommending people not to trust what their sales rep portrays and if you are small, just stay on demand because they may have some huge new min. purchase requirement that is not in your contract.')
