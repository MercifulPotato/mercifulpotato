Yea the reason why I chose GitHub issues as a &quot;database&quot; was because it is simple to add a short link that manner. Definitely may get messy and there are other shortcomings like the lack of ability to indicate&#x2F;reuse aliases. The other way to run a URL shortener service with low effort would be to use Firebase. Your idea is a cool one, love it especially since  it uses GitHub actions too!')
