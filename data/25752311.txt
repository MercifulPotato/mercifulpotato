I think I&#x27;d like to know people were donating - I could ask they tell me but I&#x27;d never know if they didn&#x27;t bother emailing or if nobody thought it worth donating - but I don&#x27;t want any of the (tax) hassle that might come from personally receiving a donation, even if I always remembered to re-donate it on.')
