That said, I try not to judge people on how they acted in the past, but how they currently act. Compare that more recent interview and videos (like Mark Rober&#x27;s) and he seems to have mellowed out a lot. Maybe it&#x27;s all for the cameras and he&#x27;s privately still a massive jerk, I don&#x27;t know, but my impression of him lately based on stuff I&#x27;ve seen online has generally left a good impression.')
