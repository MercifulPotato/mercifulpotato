I was looking at a CPU that was fairly wide superscalar, but had super tiny caches.  I observed that this chip was probably only efficient at running Dhrystone.  His response was &quot;We win and lose 7 figure CPU sales based off of Dhrystone benchmarks. DMIPS&#x2F;Watt is the only benchmark that matters for the majority of our sales in dollars&quot;')
