Usually, the power drain is when CPU+GPU are maxed out, not one or the other. I suppose if you did manage to get into a situation where this was an issue, you could find a bigger power supply. Up to about 180W these tend to be common and reasonably priced, then size and weight start going up dramatically.<p>While we&#x27;re mentioning other minor gotchas, another one is memory latency and bandwidth. While desktop systems commonly have XMP and 1.35V support, very few laptops do (typically running at JEDEC timings at 1.2V). While there&#x27;s diminishing returns, the difference between JEDEC 2933 CL21 or 3200 CL22 and say 3800 CL16 can actually be noticeable in certain workloads and is often effectively &quot;free&quot; (one-click in the BIOS) extra performance on the desktops.')
