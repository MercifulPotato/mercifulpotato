Clearly communicate with your manager about your promo goals and work with them to make sure you&#x27;re assigned projects that will help you achieve those goals.  Many things related to promo are out of your control, and there aren&#x27;t any projects that will guarantee your promotion, but you can at least work proactively to avoid missing promotion because you&#x27;re doing well but didn&#x27;t have the right projects.<p>2.  Don&#x27;t work too hard.  In my experience, pushing yourself to work too hard has limited upside for you personally.  For all its faults, Google is a place where you should be able to succeed without working nights&#x2F;weekends.<p>3.  Don&#x27;t get complacent.  Google is also a place where it&#x27;s easy to become comfortable with the status quo.  Being comfortable is nice, but don&#x27;t let it get in the way of your personal development, or impede your growth as a SWE and person in general.<p>4.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask why things are done the way they&#x27;re done on your team.  I think coming in a noogler, one of the ways you can add value to your team from day one is as a fresh pair of eyes on everything.  Onboarding can be a daunting process, but don&#x27;t assume that everything is done the way it is for a reason, and don&#x27;t assume that you can&#x27;t suggest a better way to do things.<p>Also happy to answer any specific questions you have.  Good luck!')
