If people want an an annuity when they retire, they can go buy it from an insurance company.  Politicians should be forced to pay government employees in cash or cash equivalent (aka 401k&#x2F;HSA&#x2F;etc), but any and all compensation needs to happen immediately.<p>As a side note, defined benefit pensions don&#x27;t have a place in the world anymore.  It&#x27;s the same thing as putting your money in a target date retirement fund from Vanguard&#x2F;Schwab&#x2F;Fidelity, except you also have to pay all those actuaries and pension fund managers so the expenses are higher.<p>Their purpose has been automated out of existence, but only exists due to politics in the government sector.')
