I found the RX&#x2F;TX ports were working but control signals were not, I poked around the chip with an oscilloscope and found those pins were high-impedance, the chip didn&#x27;t even attempt to output anything. I contacted tech support. They told me to buy a new one because my chip was an old batch without this feature (I guess it&#x27;s a bug), but they can also provide a firmware update to me under NDA.<p>It&#x27;s microcontroller all the way down.<p>Fun fact: It&#x27;s also how those fake FTDI FT232 chips on the gray market were made. Counterfeiters just picked a cheap general-purpose microcontroller in mass production and wrote a Mask ROM for it. What&#x27;s funny is that, the counterfeit chips actually have better process node than the real one (it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better, though).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zeptobars.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;read&#x2F;FTDI-FT232RL-real-vs-fake-supereal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zeptobars.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;read&#x2F;FTDI-FT232RL-real-vs-fake-supe...</a>')
