The biggest winner might be the Air - going to 4+4 cores and longer battery life while dropping the fan sounds like the perfect portable laptop. It will be interesting how much performance difference the fan in the MB Pro brings. The Mini at a lower price point is also great news. When introduced, the Mini brought a lot of new users to the mac at 499.

Even at half the prices Apple would make a decent profit. As a consequence, the excitement about the affordable entry prices quickly vanishes and many people might not get the amount of storage they should - or they go somewhere else. At least for the Mini, you would probably only upgrade the RAM and buy a TB SSD.<p>For the Mini and the MB Pro, not having a 32GB option hurts.
