He is more than surprised and investigates it deeply, very happy to finally get an answer to many questions.<p>One day, he hears a distorted voice, coming out of nothing - it&#x27;s a psychic, asking him if he is worrying about the money.<p>Jokes aside, the world has lost a great man. All the stories you guys posted here are more than amazing. The dedication and selflessness is hard to come by today, I hope someone can continue his mentality. If there were more James Randi&#x27;s in the world, maybe my grandma would stop believing Uri Geller bend her key she place on the TV 20 years ago.')
