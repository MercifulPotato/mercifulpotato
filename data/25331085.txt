Totally a false signal. In my view, the opposite is true. The top performers tend to commit less. People who are genuinely passionate about coding don&#x27;t tend to put that much effort into the more pedantic aspects of the process; they&#x27;re more focused on big ideas such as the structurally important parts of the architecture.<p>The developers who make a lot of commits are often more concerned with optics and they will argue for hours over unimportant tedium while sometimes missing the big very important ideas (the ones which will have real impact and flow-on effects for years to come). Basically they can&#x27;t tell the distinction between what is important and what is not. They can&#x27;t tell apart bureaucracy from value creation. Obsessive focus on commit size and other tedium is a key signal that someone doesn&#x27;t know what is really important. They tend to be conventional thinkers (driven by peer pressure and peer approval) and their idea of productivity is distorted by false consensus (like the one this article attempts to instigate).')
