I&#x27;ve been feeling like I&#x27;m scamming the company, because there have been entire weeks where I literally didn&#x27;t work.<p>Don&#x27;t be too hard on yourself. A lot lf people are going through this. Some people are really struggling with wfh, others have multiple kids at home and can only work at 20% because they just have no time or energy left. Others study with mental health problems. And finally, others have experienced serious strains with their SOs due to being locked in together for so long (which might be worse than actually splitting). My point is, this is the reality for now, we are all aware of this, and I&#x27;m guessing your boss is banking on you being able to go back to normal after the pandemic is over.<p>Beyond that, what helped me is to think of the people that depend on you. Whoever you are or should be mentoring is an actual human being that depends in one way or another on you. Same for your coworkers and boss (although. &quot;coworkers&quot; is such a vague word in a big corp). So don&#x27;t do it for the salary, do it for them. Keep doing therapy, keep going on ine day at a time , there&#x27;s a light at the end of the tunnel.<p>ps: what was the sport? rock climbing, swimming, soccer?(just curious about what hobbies can i take once this is over)')
