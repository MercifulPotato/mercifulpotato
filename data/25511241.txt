And how did you use that knowledge? And I&#x27;m not knocking too hard on the excellent tank-like hardware and great build quality of the expensive stuff, but when you saw the speed of Linux&#x2F;x86 and realized what you could get at that cost, it must have been a huge shift in your thinking, and I just want to know more about that particular time.')
