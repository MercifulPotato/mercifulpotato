It sound a bit ridiculous unless they actually don&#x27;t want to be found. Maybe they only allow GoogleBot because that&#x27;s all they thought of and the extra cost is in researching what all the other search engines call theirs.<p>Perhaps other search engines should spoof GoogleBot. Browsers have being doing that since forever spoofing Netscape (Mozilla), Safari, etc. for the same reason.<p>&gt; Why don&#x27;t we have Google share the results and we can use that money to do more productive things than recreating that work?<p>This sounds like a common fallacy of people criticizing the free market. Duplicated effort looks wasteful but turns out to be far more productive than the lack of incentive that comes with not being able to profit from your work&#x2F;investment.')
