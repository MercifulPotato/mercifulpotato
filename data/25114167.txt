Allow me to explain.<p>If a hacker were to retrieve some emails before the DKIM key was made public, they could then sign their hacked emails with their own timestamped signature, proving that they are in fact authentic (since the signed timestamp shows that they were retrieved before the DKIM key was released).<p>Therefore, by rotating the DKIM keys &quot;every few weeks&quot; you are giving the would-be hackers a deadline to retrieve the target emails - a few weeks - which could lead to hackers preemptively hacking as many <i>possibly useful</i> accounts as possible (not just the ones they know they want at a given moment), every few weeks.<p>(The merits of OP&#x27;s argument notwithstanding)')
