I am not sure what I will have with tsoHost.<p>Do not want to run my own VPS (like Linode or DigitalOcean) because then I have to manage updates, down time, backups, etc.I have an idea to use AWS for Python crontab apps, but I need to first understand how to do it, which would take some time.<p>Basically I want SSH access with a lot of customization, but that somebody else does the management :-).<p>From my investigation https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opalstack.com&#x2F; look like the best option.<p>Any advice ?<p>P.S. For the last 12+ years, I am very happy with WebFaction, sad to see it gone.')
