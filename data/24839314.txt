I think they mostly try to play the good guys to get on users&#x27; sides but actually are pretty much the opposite. They know everything about you.<p>Why was the FBI even <i>able</i> to get access to that person&#x27;s phone? Sounds like there was a loophole. Not happening if it were an encrypted Android device with a high-entropy password.<p>Apple also has vastly different policies in different countries. They do cooperate with government privacy invasions but they don&#x27;t publish that fact in the US. It&#x27;s a business decision but they are most definitely profit-focused, not privacy-focused.')
