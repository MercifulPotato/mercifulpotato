For me, the phone&#x27;s always been utilitarian.  I use it to take pictures, text friends, make calls, and occasionally check email or search the web when a computer isn&#x27;t handy.  And I use it for navigation&#x2F;mapping when I&#x27;m travelling, and on the rare occasions I drive, I listen to Spotify.<p>For comparison, in the past week, I&#x27;m just over 7 hours of use, with 5:45 in Messenger, and most of the rest split between mail and the camera.  I suspect messenger is only so high because I leave it running and unlocked during conversations.  Every notification (18 per day, 126 total) was a text message or a phone call.')
