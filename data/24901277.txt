And if not in our lifetime, is it ever achievable?<p>How could you upload just your brain and be the same person? Need your whole body, surely?. This overlaps with Transporter problem from Star Trek and the Prestige, it&#x27;s not you who lives in there, just a copy.<p>&gt;but human BCI could be the best&#x2F;most important development in our history. Any problem gradient with a chance of unlocking immortality should be leaned into.<p>You would be creating a mirror of yourself on the computer, it wouldn&#x27;t be you. An immortality for your brain image maybe.')
