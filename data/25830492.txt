I actually like that it uses the mean rather than some clustered mode in a lot of the cases I tried out. For example, “space” is pleasantly brighter than the dark black&#x2F;blue hue that would come from that approach. It’s a little warmer and brighter than that, and feels like a truer representation of the concept in my mind’s eye. Obviously it will end up muddy for some things with several dominant colors. The mean approach also allows for some fun experiments like “black and white” which returned a rewardingly exact gray for me. Which led me to “newspaper” which is gray with most weight to the red and some to blue, and looks just right. I just spent about 15 minutes on this. Simple fun and useful, I am totally going to use this for something, thanks!')
