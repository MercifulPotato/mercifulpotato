If the templates explain why a thing was closed, there isn&#x27;t much for the user to refute. They can always fume, but fuming on a closed ticket is like screaming into the void. Leveraging bots helps as well. e.g. if an issue template isn&#x27;t followed, removed, or omits key required info the issue is closed by a bot and a reply is dropped letting the user know that their attempt to circumvent the requirements means they get no support.')
