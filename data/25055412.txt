It&#x27;s an honest discussion, but too many people upvote&#x2F;downvote <i>only</i> based on agreement with the point of view. I&#x27;m perfectly happy to upvote a comment I disagree with if it is well thought out and improves the discussion in a thoughtful way. Conversely, I&#x27;ll downvote someone I agree with if their comment is inflammatory.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m done here, no energy left after going through these threads. I generally agree with your sentiment though, albeit not on everything.')
