There&#x27;s no failsafe automated way to detect anything. In fact, there&#x27;s no failsafe way to detect anything.<p>But checking for duplicate envelopes is part of the process. That&#x27;s how duplicate votes are found and thrown out of elections (see the Stokke case). Checking for voter eligibility is part of the process. That&#x27;s how votes are invalidated (see the report I linked elsewhere in this thread).<p>There is no evidence that ballot fraud exists at a scale which affects elections in the United States. The fact that it exists at all is not a good enough reason to disenfranchise millions of people.<p>Taking tens of thousands of ballots (the number needed to swing the election) from nursing homes will absolutely cause detected double-votes. Not to mention that collecting those tens of thousands of ballots necessarily involves a large number of people. And when a conspiracy includes a large number of people, the chances that someone talks skyrockets.')
