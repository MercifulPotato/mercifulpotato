Police is state level, AFAIK. Fire department is paid for by an extra tax on fire insurance (so, I guess you could argue it&#x27;s a property tax via extra steps), and state funds. For streets, it depends, cities pay for city streets. Autobahn is mostly federal, others are state, federal.<p>For the taxes, it&#x27;s complicated, because there are some taxes for which the cities and states can decide the amount, and others (for example VAT), from which they get a certain fraction, but the amount is decided on the federal level.<p>Edit: Let me add: Property taxes are very strangely regressive. You pay it whether you rent or own, and there is a minimum apartment cost, so you&#x27;ll always pay, while a low income might not be taxed at all. Then, often, there is a sudden jump from apartment complex to SFH.')
