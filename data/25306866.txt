I wrestled in college and it was like starting over. I went from being one of the best wrestlers in my state to being one of the worst wrestlers at my Division II small not that great wrestling team.<p>By my second year I&#x27;d closed the gap considerably as had many of the other incoming freshmen who returned for a second year. Two of the freshmen were actually ready to compete their freshmen year and I found out later that they had practiced with college wrestlers quite a lot during their high school careers.<p>I heard someone once say compare yourself to those at the level above you rather than your current level. It&#x27;s a bit draining but it is a good way to progress quickly for athletes.')
