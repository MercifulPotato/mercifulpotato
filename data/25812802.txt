It&#x27;s not a reason to do things one way or another. There has never been a large long running system, centralized or not, 500 page book or not, that hasn&#x27;t had user downtime or didn&#x27;t incur cost. This part is not a matter of theory nor what decentralized systems set out to solve.<p>There are other valid lessons for why choose decentralized but this is not a &quot;ha, got&#x27;em&quot; moment for that. There are also valid pros for centralized as well, hence their real world success and the reason most &quot;decentralized&quot; tech ends up being run in a very centralized fashion when it matures.')
