Drawing on this, I feel that this comment is unnecessarily partisan and divisive.<p>&gt; 2) Mentioning the replication crisis in social science gets a lot of the social science academics observably upset and defensive.<p>The replication crisis is widely discussed in social sciences. Nearly every major social science journal will have at least one, likely many, editorials and articles on the crisis tailored to their field. Maybe this is explicitely a Management Studies thing? The field is relatively small and insular, and so cannot be generalized to wider social science. And are your experiences drawon from the community as a whole, or the faculty in your department?<p>&gt; 3) I have enjoyed my time spent with CS academics a lot more, luckily have some interaction even now - the ones I have spoken to seem to lack the ego-driven blind spots the social scientists exhibit. The CS group seems to have a lot more fun with their research.<p>Maybe this is just the local community of wherever you studied? I&#x27;ve met equal parts ego-driven and chill people in both CS and Social Science. A major concept in most social science fields is samplingâ€”I&#x27;d urge you to consider how representative the people you are talking to actually are, and how your sample might be biased from the global population. My prior is that there would be little difference in personality, in aggregate, between the fields.<p>&gt; I.e. I have observed that even when a manager or leader wants to hire developers, social science damaged managers and HR will actively sabotage these efforts because they are still, fundamentally, driven by Taylorist, control fetish concepts (which they refuse to accept)<p>I mean, that&#x27;s one possibility. The other is that hiring people is difficult and expensive, and that credentials are a quick and useful, if flawed, method of sorting through the pile.<p>And are most HR people really trained in Management? I honestly don&#x27;t know, but I  doubt that the typical Psychology or Sociology major, for instance, is going to know of, remember, or consider using Taylorist management theory.<p>It definitely seems that you enjoyed your time in CS more than your time in Management. That&#x27;s great! CS is an important field with lots of cool people. But generalizing this preference into a wider philosophy that privileges CS at the expense of (all?) social sciences is silly.')
