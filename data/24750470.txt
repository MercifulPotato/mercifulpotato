So why not aim to build for fun first!<p>- Build pointless things! (like this). They&#x27;re great to express yourself and they&#x27;re much easier to finish and release (less pressure).<p>- You don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to finish anything!! But if you really want to finish that side-project, try a pointless project to boost your morale.<p>- Divide and conquer - Large side-projects can be overwhelming. Divide that MMO game into smaller projects which are easier to finish.<p>Maybe this is all pretty evident to most people... but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to see it written explicitly.')
