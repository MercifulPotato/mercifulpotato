Look at the horizon. Look at the starry sky. And soak in the realization that you will <i>never</i> know or experience everything. This world is <i>way</i> too big for our human brains. The vastness of the sea itself is already unimaginable. And once you look to the stars, you realize that you will never experience every cubic meter of the universe with the same intensity as the grains of sand beneath your feet.<p>This is probably the most gut-wrenching realization I ever had. I&#x27;ve gnawed on this for many a night. But it also leads to the fundamental question: What <i>do you</i> want to experience?<p>It&#x27;s the choices we make and the options we decide against that define us. You <i>have</i> to choose. And the great part is: You can! It is entirely up to you to turn the brief and glorious period of &quot;I&#x27;m alive&quot; between two inconceivably long spans of &quot;I&#x27;m not alive&quot; into the best it can be. But that involves making choices <i>against</i> things.')
