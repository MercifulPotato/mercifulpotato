Didn&#x27;t Einstein also write his seminal papers while he was working at the patent office?<p>Also from that example, it seems that three times more male students than female students failed their exam. Doesn&#x27;t really prove sexist discrimination, especially with the first example where she got the good grade and Einstein the bad one.')
