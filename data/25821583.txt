It&#x27;s not that you are imaginary, but it&#x27;s imaginary that we are friends. We don&#x27;t know each others&#x27; history or identity let alone care for each other as friends. But I can speak as if we are friends, and unlike a Wilson, sometimes get a friendly response.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re a crutch that makes it easier to not go get real friends. But this crutch also sometimes makes it easier to get through the long night. Thanks.')
