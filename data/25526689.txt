Just as D50 is red tinted.  So if users will view your rendered image surrounded by an rgb-white screen, if&#x2F;when the resulting small red&#x2F;yellow&#x2F;green&#x2F;white shift is problematic, you might consider rendering using a non-standard 58K whitepoint.  Just saw someone burned by this the other day, with a &quot;supposed to be white with a localized tint&quot; object (the Sun), which D65 then confused.')
