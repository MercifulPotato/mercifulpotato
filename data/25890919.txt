The PMs do lots of valuable work that allows us to do our work well (and prioritize it so that we&#x27;re doing the right work).<p>If they&#x27;re subject matter experts, that&#x27;s best - they&#x27;re your translator&#x2F;interpreter, able to speak in terms of both tech and the problem domain.  And they know what the user wants because they were the user of your competitor.<p>But even if not, they can be the best assistant you&#x27;ll ever have.  Dealing with customers, sales, higher-ups, etc. so you can focus on your work.  Technically they may be above you in the org chart, but you can&#x27;t have a better assistant than a good manager that gives you what you need, clears the way, and runs interference so you can work doing what you do best.')
