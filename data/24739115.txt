For any given function used in a program, you have no guarantee that you can locate where that function is implemented in a straightforward way.  In the worst cases, you have to resort to using dumb hacks like ctags or a project-wide recursive grep.  It makes it hard to read any given program in the Knuthian wayâ€”laid up in bed with a printout to study how it works.<p>(Go has the same problem.  When I started seriously looking at Go, I was surprised that it copied C here, given the strong influence from Oberon.)')
