Then I had 7-8 years break off Linux and last year decided to install it on my new desktop machine.<p>Went with Plasma first - did not go well. I simply cannot get comfortable with it and general look and feel is not working for me (I prefer defaults and I avoid much tweaking and any 3rd party customization). I settled on Cinnamon, but it was close tie with GNOME which was actually quite refreshing experience for me.<p>So, to each his own, but I just do not see KDE as &quot;the sanest&quot; default.')
