If I&#x27;m sitting down to write a new feature I can do the git fetch origin and go directly to a branch, but if I&#x27;m investigating an issue, I&#x27;ll often open that develop&#x2F;master branch directly, find the problem, do a pull to make sure there are no changes that got checked in, then &quot;git checkout -b&quot;.<p>Alternately if I&#x27;m helping other developers, I&#x27;m on their branch a lot, and it basically becomes a &quot;push your changes and I&#x27;ll take a look&quot; and I just open that folder and git pull.<p>I think I use more git pull now than I did originally, because I&#x27;m working on less of my own code.')
