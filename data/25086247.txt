But unlike ideologies that don&#x27;t purport to be objective from humanity, religion carries the seed of its own undoing. Much like Martin Luther nailing his 95 theses to the church door, an abuse of the ideal can be countered by the ideal. I can&#x27;t think of any non-religious ideology that has done that; countering those abusive ideologies requires ascribing to a different ideology. Nazism didn&#x27;t defeat or replace Nazism, but Christianity has defeated Christianity before.<p>But that said, I agree that someone saying &quot;God is on my side&quot; is inherently problematic in a different way than just &quot;I have the most power to enforce my will&quot;. Of course, I don&#x27;t see that as a value judgement on the existence of religion; after all, regardless of my, or society&#x27;s, beliefs, the power behind the individual is still there, or not, regardless of their claim of God&#x27;s support.')
