Individuals might stick to their principles and refuse to compromise, but parties are not so limited.<p>Losing a solid voter base might mean that the Republicans need to change their platform to appeal to more voters, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re forever doomed and will never win another election. Maybe that means compromising on abortion. Maybe it means immigration reform - but from the Republican perspective, and not giving amnesty to illegal immigrants. (And funnily enough, IIRC amnesty isn&#x27;t particularly popular among LEGAL immigrants) Maybe it means pulling their heads out of their asses re: climate change, and running on a revenue-neutral carbon tax.<p>All of this means changes, but not an end to the party.')
