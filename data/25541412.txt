I think the other original purpose was to make sure inventions would eventually become publicized and exploitable by all.<p>That exponential patents idea seems like it would render patent protection prohibitively expensive for all except maybe the rich or inventors unusually well-position to quickly capitalize on their invention.  The little guy who takes ten years to get his business off the ground is out of luck.')
