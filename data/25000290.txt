You&#x27;re currently spending money on diesel fuel, which is already paying for the expensive infrastructure to transport and store and dispense an energy-dense liquid. Just shift who you&#x27;re paying for your energy, and now the electric utility uses that money to upgrade their infrastructure to let their customers buy more of their product.<p>Companies are generally happy to expand their operations to allow their customers to buy more of their product.<p>You may not be intentionally trying to be negative, but you&#x27;re parroting the same FUD lines used against EVs for decades, and against horseless carriages a century ago. (And which, incidentally, became entrenched in Oregon and New Jersey in the form of laws prohibiting motorists from operating the dispensing infrastructure.)')
