Item(by='markvdb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602143031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713098, text='&gt; For example, I routinely see people in cross-cultural relationships try to learn each others&#x27; languages but fail miserably at learning when they get into disagreements and have that disagreement in English instead of the language either person is trying to learn.<p>This made me smile. My partner and I have different native language backgrounds. During the few serious disagreements we&#x27;ve had, she would curse in my native language. Following your line of  thinking, that would prove her excellent language mastery. Even if I&#x27;m on the receiving end of the cursing :-)')
