Unfortunately the ribbon cable put tension on the boards, causing them to flex, which could cause the socketed RAM chips to unseat, as cited in the Wikipedia article, hence the &quot;pick up your Apple &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; and drop it&quot; approach to re-seating the chips.<p>Jobs remained adamant that computers with fans were junk, so the original Macintosh also lacked a cooling fan, in spite of having an internal power supply, CRT, and supporting analog board. This presumably contributed to the large number of analog board failures in classic compact Mac models.<p>*which might be part of Stanford&#x27;s Apple museum collection or at the Computer History Museum?')
