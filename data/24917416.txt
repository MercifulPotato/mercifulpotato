For example, vitamin D deficiency can be a symptom of an underlying issue that is actually what causes sicker patients. Or what’s even more likely, vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among elderly and African Americans, who have been disproportionately hit harder by COVID because they’re more vulnerable to disease in general (former) or are more likely to be unable to isolate due to being an essential worker (latter).<p>And before we start debating these specific possibilities, the point is to illustrate we can’t just assume more than the sampling method dictates. Different studies are needed.')
