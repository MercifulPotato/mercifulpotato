Austrian economics is right, Keynsian is wrong.</i><p>At this point in history, how can anyone claim that Keynesianism is &quot;wrong&quot;?<p>&gt; <i>I would summarize the Keynesian view in terms of four points:</i><p>&gt; <i>1. Economies sometimes produce much less than they could, and employ many fewer workers than they should, because there just isn’t enough spending. Such episodes can happen for a variety of reasons; the question is how to respond.</i><p>&gt; <i>2. There are normally forces that tend to push the economy back toward full employment. But they work slowly; a hands-off policy toward depressed economies means accepting a long, unnecessary period of pain.</i><p>&gt; <i>3. It is often possible to drastically shorten this period of pain and greatly reduce the human and financial losses by “printing money”, using the central bank’s power of currency creation to push interest rates down.</i><p>&gt; <i>4. Sometimes, however, monetary policy loses its effectiveness, especially when rates are close to zero. In that case temporary deficit spending can provide a useful boost. And conversely, fiscal austerity in a depressed economy imposes large economic losses.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;keynesianism-explained&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;keynesianism-ex...</a><p>I&#x27;m sure that there are nuances in the model that can be more or less accurate, but the idea that (aggregate) demand drives economic activity, and that (central bank) interest rates and government (stimulus) spending effects economic activity seems fairly certain. Especially with everything we&#x27;ve seen over the last ~20 years: Fed-driven US real estate bubble, post-2008 economic recovery, lack of inflation due to low&#x2F;zero rates even with lots of &quot;printing money&quot;, austerity caused economic slowdowns (in the EU).<p>It&#x27;s been one giant economics petri dish of experiments. How has Keynesianism failed? Non-K folks were predicting all sorts of problem, and yet the Ks were saying &#x27;<i>it&#x27;ll be fine</i>&#x27;:<p>&gt; <i>We believe the Federal Reserve&#x27;s large-scale asset purchase plan (so-called &quot;quantitative easing&quot;) should be reconsidered and discontinued. We do not believe such a plan is necessary or advisable under current circumstances. The planned asset purchases risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed&#x27;s objective of promoting employment.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;economics21.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;open-letter-ben-bernanke-287.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;economics21.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;open-letter-ben-bernanke-287.ht...</a>')
