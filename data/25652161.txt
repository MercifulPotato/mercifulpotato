Sorry about all those scoldings and chidings. I know they&#x27;re annoying, and if it helps at all, they&#x27;re even more tedious to write than to read [1]. But unfortunately the system can&#x27;t regulate itself without feedback from some dedicated component—this is very clear. If we went by upvotes alone, the site would be dominated by indignation and sensationalism [2].<p>It&#x27;s interesting to ask why. I thought about that for years and I think I found an answer. It&#x27;s because although the community has many smart and well-intentioned people, each is giving only a fragment of their attention to HN (at least I hope they are). Some critical functions, like optimizing the site globally rather than just reacting to specific stories or comments, require someone whose job it is to give full attention to HN [3]. It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re better—except in the sense that one gets better at anything with practice—it&#x27;s that we play the role of looking out for the community as a whole.<p>Actually the system has three components: community and moderators, but also software. That&#x27;s interesting too, because it has always been a property of HN that the core moderators were also the programmers. We rely heavily on software to help manage the portions of the problem that can be handled that way, with the intention of freeing more of our attention for the optimization problem. It only works up to a point, but without it we&#x27;d be doomed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=tedious%20write%20read%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=tedious%20write%20read%20by:da...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22upvotes%20alone%22%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22upvotes%20alone%22%20by:dan...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22863209" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22863209</a>')
