I guess this really is nostalgia for a time when you could go out and spend $10-100k, and buy a workstation that had capabilities simply not available on a consumer pc.<p>Thats kind of a hard thing to do these days.. and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a market for it.<p>If you want to do that now you just look at “server“ class equipment, or its &quot;workstation“ smaller siblings, to get ”truck” features... multiple cpu sockets, more ram, more pcie lanes etc. Add pcie cards to as required for the workload. All the old-school unix workstation benefits, and it will still be able to run excel and outlook, which matters in lots and lots of environments.')
