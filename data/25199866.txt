They can&#x27;t say no.<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see whether broadband competitors match the offer or just siphon off a handful of switching customers. In Massachusetts many Internet markets are a monopoly (Comcast) or a duopoly (Comcast + Verizon or RCN).<p>There are also a tiny handful of municipal providers (including Braintree, Norwood, Whip City Fiber for Westfield and area, and Russell). If people are still heavily working&#x2F;attending school from home in March I can imagine a bit of pressure on towns and cities to do the very hard work of starting up Internet as a utility.')
