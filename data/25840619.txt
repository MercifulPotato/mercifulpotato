Don‘t have young kids at home.<p>Sorry for the unqualified snark here, just couldn‘t resist. The realities couldn‘t be more different for different people at this time.<p>Someone recently asked me whether I enjoyed my Corona free time as well.<p>I didn’t know what to answer as could not even comprehend the concept.<p>I‘m missing everything. Time for myself. Silence. Holidays. Physical movement. Sanity.<p>Work and Noise, non-stop, around the clock. Still falling behind on all projects with limited understanding of single colleagues with more time to kill than Netflix has content.<p>I love those rascals, but I‘m crashing on the couch every night and barely make it out of bed the next day. Just functioning and surviving.<p>Never been more exhausted in my life before.')
