Item(by='zug_zug', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609646216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25618724, text='&gt; In its appellate brief, the government argued that Kareem lacked standing because he makes an unsupported assertion about being targeted in a war zone.<p>This is odd to me. I guess in my mind it goes without saying that the government should be required to name all individuals it&#x27;s trying to kill, presumably to allow them to surrender themselves for trial. I get in combat this may not be practical, but it sounds like this individual identifies as a journalist (and the fact that he&#x27;s appealing to the court system).<p>Perhaps stating the obvious again, I think the idea that the individual should have to prove to the government that he&#x27;s on a kill list, when the government has access to the kill list, is a bothersome mentality.')
