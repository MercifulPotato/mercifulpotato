I may have a hard time enforcing such requirements, but nobody has a LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE RIGHT to use my service without my permission, no matter how dumb my requirements are to be granted that permission.<p>Note: The above obviously doesn&#x27;t automatically apply to existing legally binding contracts such as with a paying customer, though in most cases either party is free to break the contact at any time assuming they are willing to pay the penalty specified in said contract.')
