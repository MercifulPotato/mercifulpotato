Item(by='Fogest', descendants=None, kids=[25089190], score=None, time=1605294165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25085482, text='Yeah I go to order a burrito at a local cheap burrito place and it no longer is a &quot;cheap burrito place&quot;, then I have to add on the extra fees from DoorDash. It is annoying to me that these delivery companies will take around 30% of the cut from the restaurant, and then also are taking fees from me. Pick one, but don&#x27;t screw over both sides. I want to support local, but sometimes they are too far for me to be able to get versus a big chain. So I&#x27;d like to order delivery, but at the same time I don&#x27;t feel like it is supporting them when a massive cut is taken out of their profit.')
