Like are senior members of society such as judges, doctors, military officers, teachers, politicians, etc completely comfortable smoking cannabis in public or would that still cause some surprise if they were that casual about it?<p>Because I don&#x27;t think that is even the case with tobacco - people shamefully hide that even though it&#x27;s always been legal - let alone cannabis?<p>I think the only drug which is completely normalized is alcohol. They serve alcohol at state dinners and expect most people will want it. I doubt they serve cannabis.')
