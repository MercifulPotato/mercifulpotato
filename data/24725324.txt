That gives me time to do my research and get back to them. It also shows them that I&#x27;m actually looking into it, rather than that I forgot about the message.<p>When I have an issue that&#x27;s blocking me, if I don&#x27;t get a response from someone within 10 minutes I&#x27;ll start reaching out to other people. If I know the first person is already looking into the issue I won&#x27;t waste other peoples&#x27; time.')
