It&#x27;s a densely populated subsection of one.<p>&gt;<i>crucially, Toronto’s population density is less than many other American cities including Philadelphia (4,512), Chicago (4,594)</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think Chicago and Philly are not comparable to Toronto despite being being only 1% and 3% more dense.
