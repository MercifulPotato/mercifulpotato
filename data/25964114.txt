The web bloated things up so that you spend time hooking layers to more layers and debugging layers instead of focusing on business logic and UI in terms of users&#x27; needs. Now you micromanage technology instead of actual work.<p>People often say, &quot;yes, but we have so much wonderful choice now!&quot; Perhaps, but organizations are paying dearly for that choice.<p>Oracle Forms may have been esthetically ugly, but it did the CRUD job fairly well without fuss and muss, and developers were quite productive with it. The client was kind of a GUI browser so that you didn&#x27;t need to install each application on each user&#x27;s PC. It was also multi-platform. (Oracle mucked up the client by migrating it to Java applets.)<p>Some point out they don&#x27;t work well on phones, but few of our apps are used on phones at our org. The UI was crippled to be mobile-friendly, but nobody is mobile-ing for real-work stuff. Make a special phone portal for the 5% or so of apps that need it instead of tangle up the 95% &quot;incase&quot; someday someone will want mobile. YAGNI.<p>If the industry would just learn to live with ugly K.I.S.S., they could save a lot of money and time. Warren Buffett says one of his greatest strengths is the courage to say &quot;no&quot;. Few have that, and bloat the IT world as a result. Maybe fear of missing the Buzzword of the Week turns our stacks into buzzword pack-rats.')
