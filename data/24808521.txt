We are awake about 112 hours a week so 40 hours = 36% and 15 hours = 13% so maybe 13% is too little and we should look to make work fun rather than less hours. I figure even if we have AI robots that can do everything people will still teach each other yoga, acting and the like.<p>Also people are competitive - maybe 15 hours can pay for food and shelter but then the Joneses next door work 60 and buy a Porsche.')
