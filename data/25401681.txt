This is the &quot;observer effect&quot;.<p>To test, just open a terminal and compare a few samples of `ps aux | grep WindowServer` with Activity Monitor open and with it closed.<p>Mine averages 7-11% with Activity Monitor closed and 20-40% with Activity Monitor open. It&#x27;s even more noticeable if your refresh rate is set to &quot;Very Often&quot;. Closing Activity Monitor brings the WindowServer CPU back to normal.<p>As other have noted, this site provides no evidence. The keystone daemon is not running in the background constantly. When it does run, it&#x27;s plainly visible and not &quot;hiding itself&quot;.  According to the launchd job config located at `&#x2F;Library&#x2F;LaunchAgents&#x2F;com.google.keystone.agent.plist` my keystone process is set to run itself every 3623 seconds. Probably randomized to avoid the thundering herd problem. When it does run it checks for updates, often downloading new ones, and then quits.')
