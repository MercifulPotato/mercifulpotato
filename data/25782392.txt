People assume I own a private island somewhere because I&#x27;ve been at my publicly-traded company for 20yrs and have the accumulated wealth from all that stock growth.<p>But when the stock first grew, we all sold b&#x2F;c it was worth a lot back then. Then it grew again and we sold more. And again and again.<p>The only people still holding original stock were those who didn&#x27;t need it (e.g. already wealthy), and were willing to gamble on continued growth, because they could afford to watch the stock drop in value and not miss it.')
