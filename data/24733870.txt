As far as I know, there&#x27;s no advantage to the `comment` macro over `#_`.<p>I think `comment` is nice if you have an editor that doesn&#x27;t syntax highlight and let you structurally edit discard comments. But in my Emacs setup, code that is after a discard comment still gets all highlighting and syntax editing and evaluation as any other code, so I don&#x27;t feel a need to ever user `comment` macro over it.')
