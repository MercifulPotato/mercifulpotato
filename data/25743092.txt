No actual wealth was created.<p>It is true that the <i>way</i> the stimulus payments were made amounted to a wealth transfer to people less well off, so that (plus the fact that much of it was used to pay off debt) does represent an actual reduction in wealth inequality. But I think it&#x27;s hardly the rosy picture the article paints, all things considered.')
