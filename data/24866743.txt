I was just calling your bluff.  I&#x27;ll take an angry mob over lack of police accountability, and the police cannot police themselves so the public needs to do it by whatever means necessary even if that harms innocent police officers.<p>I will always choose the people over the police, even if the people are violent.  A public mob is better than a police mob.<p>Until the police are held accountable to the public, I feel no remorse for anything that happens to them.')
