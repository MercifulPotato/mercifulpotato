The low end of the <i>80% confidence interval</i> (the 95% CI is what is usually used to state a “margin of error” when a CI isn&#x27;t explicitly identified and would be <i>much</i> wider) for the 538 forecast for Biden’s vote share was ~50.9%. His actual vote share at current count is ~50.7%.<p>Results a hair outside the 80% CI doesn&#x27;t indicate that a forecast is “dead wrong”.<p>EDIT: While I think 538 has made some progress in simplifying it&#x27;s reporting to help deal with this, aside from deliberate misinformation (which is a substantial factor in the “criticism”), I think the main problem remains that people <i>really, really</i> don&#x27;t grasp uncertainty even when it&#x27;s shoved in their face, and are prone to criticize something for not being a precise oracle even when it&#x27;s expected error range is prominently presented.')
