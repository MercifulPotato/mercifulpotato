It doesn&#x27;t work for people who want to start a business with a business model of using copyright law to extract monopoly rents, but then, it never has, and that&#x27;s always been the point.<p>And, yes, it&#x27;s not, for that reason, a good fit for narrow software entrepreneurship, but that&#x27;s always been the domain of proprietary software.<p>What&#x27;s new is startups building on OSS to build mind share, and then trying to shift to rent extraction while wanting to pretend to still be interested in OSS.')
