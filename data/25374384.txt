If you need to get below 2 seconds, yes, you&#x27;ll likely want to use a WebRTC based technology to deliver the video. There&#x27;s a couple of open source approaches out there, including Pion [1], which is a go implementation of a WebRTC stack. You could also build something on top of Jitsi [2]. Commercially there&#x27;s also a few solutions, including Milicast [3], Red5Pro [4] and others.<p>The biggest problem with WebRTC based stacks is that the cross device compatibility is still generally poor, and the cost of operation is generally very high, as you can&#x27;t use commodity CDNs for delivery.<p>If you&#x27;re comfortable around the 2-5 seconds latency mark, there&#x27;s more traditional HTTP based technologies available. MPEG-DASH has a Low Latency mode which uses chunk transferred HTTP fragments, and Apple has recently introduced a Low Latency HLS mode, which works in much the same way [5] [6]. You can build LL-HLS and DASH-LL solutions on top of open source toolchains like Streamline [7], and use commodity CDNs for delivery to reduce cost.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pion</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jitsi.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jitsi.org&#x2F;</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.millicast.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.millicast.com&#x2F;</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.red5pro.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.red5pro.com&#x2F;</a>\n[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mux.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;low-latency-hls-part-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mux.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;low-latency-hls-part-2&#x2F;</a>\n[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mux.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-low-latency-live-streaming-landscape-in-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mux.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-low-latency-live-streaming-landscap...</a>\n[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;streamlinevideo&#x2F;streamline" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;streamlinevideo&#x2F;streamline</a>')
