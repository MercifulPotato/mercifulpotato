The lenders actually pay me to store their capital. Weird times.<p>In actuality, though, I also pay a 0.5% &quot;contribution&quot; fee which covers mortgage company administration and collective risk. So the effective rate is around 0.22%.<p>For the 20y bonds the 0% interest is also just the actual bond rate. The administration fee will have to be added.<p>The &quot;contribution&quot; fee rate depends on how much of the home value has been mortgaged. Below 60% it is typically around 0.5% because of the relatively low risk (you can probably always auction off the house at get at least 60% even in bad times). When mortgaged from 60 to 80% of the home value the fee is higher.')
