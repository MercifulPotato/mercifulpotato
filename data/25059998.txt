Unless your name is Richard and you&#x27;ve designed middle out compression, we are where we are as end users. I&#x27;d be happy if someone with your genius insights into editing of photo&#x2F;video data would go to work for Adobe and revolutionize the way computers handle all of that data. Clearly, they have been at this too long and cannot learn a new trick. Better yet, form your own startup and compete directly with the behemoth that Adobe is and unburden all of us that are suffering life with monthly rental software with underspec&#x27;d hardware. Please, we&#x27;re begging.')
