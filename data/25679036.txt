So they ended up prioritizing counting the in-person ballots on election day, and got to the backlog of mail ballots after the polls closed.<p>This was all a very easily predictable, simple result of the election laws in the states, and it <i>was</i> predicted.  None of this was surprising to anyone who paid attention prior to election day.')
