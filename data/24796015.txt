(Presumably they don’t want to, or they’d be doing it already, but under this regulation that’s how they have to operate.) So HN Prime pops up — which is basically HN as it exists today — and then a bunch of smaller constellation communities that allow things that Prime doesn’t, like spam and porn.<p>And that’s different from present situation because…? We <i>already</i> have Twitter Prime (Twitter), as well as the constellation Twitters — Conservative Twitter (Parler), Nazi Twitter (Gab), [Niche Interest] Twitter (various Mastodon people instances), etc. We haven’t fundamentally changed anything; all we’ve done is move the moderation “problem” around a bit.')
