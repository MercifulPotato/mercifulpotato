He just blindsided his staff on &quot;day 2&quot;, it could easily happen that another 2,3,4, or more people are now planning to GTFO before they&#x27;re next. All that careful planning will then be for shit because he just cut to the bone, and then the bones will start leaving.<p>There&#x27;s no easy way to do this stuff. It&#x27;s ugly no matter how you approach it.')
