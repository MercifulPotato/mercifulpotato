Item(by='maxsilver', descendants=None, kids=[25097407, 25097408], score=None, time=1605404545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25090705, text='It&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous that Food Delivery apps aren&#x27;t making gobs of cash right now.<p>(1) Restaurants are closed for indoor dining (or <i>obviously should be</i> anywhere they aren&#x27;t). You literally can&#x27;t sit in a restaurant in good faith, anywhere in the US today.<p>(2) The Food Delivery app prices are usually 5% to 20% higher than the in-dining counterparts.<p>(3) In addition to that, the order&#x2F;delivery fees are much higher than all other competitors. (At least, on my app the &#x27;delivery fee&#x27; from GrubHub is 25% higher than the equivalent delivery fee from the local Pizza Hut and Panera Bread, for example)<p>(4) And because of all of that, the default tip rates are also higher than all other delivery services.<p>(5) Despite all of the above, everyone is still paying for it. Paid-in-full delivery purchases are at an all-time high, despite all-time high prices for it.<p>(6) There&#x27;s a massive record-high unemployment due to people who have lost their jobs from the pandemic! It&#x27;s cheaper than ever to pick up folks as part-time drivers. And pizza places generally actually <i>employ</i> their drivers, delivery apps lie to the feds and claim their employees as 1099-contractors, cutting their costs even lower.<p>Sure, DoorDash&#x27;s &quot;efficiency&quot; claims are all lies. But who cares, they don&#x27;t need &quot;magically efficient logistics&quot; to make their model work, this model has <i>already worked</i> for every single random pizza place or equivalent from the past 40+ years straight.<p>These delivery-only-apps have the highest revenue and margins (while having the lowest overhead cost and lowest employee cost) of any food service business I&#x27;ve ever heard of. They&#x27;ve been handed the <i>best possible scenario for their business</i>. How they aren&#x27;t wildly profitable right now is absolutely due to ridiculous management&#x2F;financing shenanigans alone, and not because &quot;ordering food for delivery via touch-tone telephone&quot; is some inherently unsustainable business practice.')
