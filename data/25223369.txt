Of course improvisation still plays a more important role vs. western classical music, but it is driven by a set of standard canonical themes.<p>That hasn&#x27;t been my observation at all. 100% of the stuff I find on Spotify is improvised and interpretative.<p>Could you point to some specifics? Not only is that interesting, perhaps it can also provide insight into the underpinnings of the &quot;identity&quot; of a raga. I think there is definitely a commonality between different people rendering the raga but I haven&#x27;t come across a &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; of the sorts.<p>Thanks for your comment!')
