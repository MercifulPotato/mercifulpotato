There&#x27;s lots of amazingly weird japanese vehicles you can buy for less than $8000 via reputable brokers.<p>you will want to learn to read the inspection report forms for each vehicle, and the grading system used in japanese used car sales and auctions.<p>Shipment to a west coast port should be under $1800 USD.<p>The US federal import paperwork for a 25 year old vehicle is not very onerous or difficult, if you google a bit about it you can find examples of what it looks like.')
