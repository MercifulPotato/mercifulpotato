If not, why did you say it is?<p>You say: “Of course it doesn&#x27;t make sense to build that <i>library</i> into the platform.”<p>I agree, but nobody is talking about building <i>that library</i> into the platform.  The comment you are replying to is talking about the <i>feature</i>, not that library:<p>“Now you say it doesn’t make even sense to put this <i>feature</i> in the platform”<p>Do you think it makes sense to put this feature into the platform?')
