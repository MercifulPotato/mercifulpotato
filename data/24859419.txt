I would not recommend it for healthy people.<p>However, I <i>strongly</i> recommend it for people who struggle with chronic depression or anxiety. Microdosing is a way to break <i>rumination</i>, the asshole uncle of meditation whose constant shitty thoughts in the back of your mind are the fuel that keep you feeling depressed or anxious.<p>LSD Microdosing is the Aspirin (and I use that word very intentionally, it is not a cure, it is <i>relief</i>) that lets you start to interrupt that cycle, which will give you back enough of your life that you can start to make other more long-lasting changes')
