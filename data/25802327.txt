I don&#x27;t doubt you know your stuff, but manufacturing is a huge field, widely distributed, it is done by small companies as well as large ones, and specifying and purchasing a PLC system can be done to satisfy operational needs without necessarily having suitable network infrastructure and security expertise. The number of PLCs &quot;accessible from Internet in a real production site&quot; is probably in the thousands.')
