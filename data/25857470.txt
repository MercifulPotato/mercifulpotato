The bitter orange <i>Citrus × aurantium</i> is called <i>nerantzi</i>, coming from Sanskrit via the Persian <i>naranj</i>. Meanwhile, the sweet orange <i>Citrus × sinensis</i> is called <i>portokali</i>, as it was brought to Greece by Portuguese traders.<p>The Greek word for the colour orange is also <i>portokali</i>, but with the stress on a different syllable. This is a bit weird, as AFAIK the bitter orange reached Greece first.')
