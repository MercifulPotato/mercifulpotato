This is not a game where being new invites an interesting game, if the other players are uninviting.<p>I remember one board game gathering where they played Dominion, including a younger player, but I bowed out from playing. There was one particular player in that group who was boisterous and loud, and could name every combo as they were setting up. After a while we could all tell he was winning, mostly from his loud exclamations. Eventually he did win and bragged about it so badly, the younger player left with his family with his head down. I felt bad because I knew that the game, from that initial jerk player, would not end well.<p>This is why I admire the game Dominion from afar, but will rarely ever play.')
