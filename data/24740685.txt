Item(by='yongjik', descendants=None, kids=[24741372], score=None, time=1602353158, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740364, text='Consider a more realistic version of Chinese room.  Bob gets a slip of paper, with written Chinese on it, and slips it into a black-box &quot;Chinese room&quot;, which produces another paper with a perfectly written Chinese answer.  Bob hands it back - it is pretty obvious that Bob doesn&#x27;t need to have an inkling of Chinese.<p>Except, in this version, there&#x27;s an actual Chinese speaker, Xin, sitting inside the room.  It&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s Xin, not Bob, who understands Chinese.<p>Now let&#x27;s move back to the original Chinese room argument.  It&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s the <i>room</i> that understands Chinese - or, rather, the whole system composed of the rules (the room) and its executor (the person), but not the executor by itself.  It only seems absurd because our real-life experiences make us presume that, when there&#x27;s a room and a person, the <i>person</i> must be the more sentient part.  IMHO the whole argument is a philosophical sleight of hand.')
