At the same time, a &quot;horde&quot; usually numbers more than 8, except when treated ironically, after the manner of &quot;three&#x27;s a crowd&quot;. So I would suggest &quot;horde&quot;, or &quot;crowd&quot;. 8 is just a bit thin even for a crowd, unless it concerns a certain president&#x27;s inauguration attendance.')
