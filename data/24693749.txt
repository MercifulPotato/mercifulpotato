Break their algorithms by going on a bit of a virtual shopping spree. You wont even have to buy anything, just place in cart and cancel later on. Get those targeted ads replaced with ads for machine parts, woodworking tools, craft supplies, coffeemakers, etc. Make sure you ARE logged in when you do this, so that these results have a higher priority for the algorithm to pull. Some products will also COMPLETELY poison your profile, just like a runaway slave throwing red herring. Anything related to pregnancy or impotence will do this. If they want data, give it to them. Drown them in it.<p>PS. I wind up shopping for parts for my job on my phone all the time, I know this works. Even when you dont have the accounts connected, they do.')
