If we leave all of that work to the machines do we lose a skill that’s fungible for sustaining life?<p>Assuming we can completely automate healthcare and AI is responsible for developing new diagnostics and treatments without human oversight. Who acts as a check on these systems and who is responsible for correcting issues when they arise?<p>If we can automate 90% of manual and low-skip labor, who makes up the remaining population responsible for completing those tasks and how are they incentivized to continue performing those tasks?<p>I like the idea of utopian automation, but we don’t have completely automated transportation (maybe one of the closest possibilities). This seems to be putting the cart before the horse.')
