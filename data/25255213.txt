But I&#x27;m presuming that some people are caught who were cheating, and without the software they would have cheated and not been caught.<p>We can suggest that with an honor code in place, maybe some of those cheating students would have not cheated, because... I mean, if they were willing to cheat with software in place, I&#x27;m not sure why would have been deterred by an honor code.<p>I think in about 98-99% of cases, people who claim an honor code prevents cheating are deluding themselves. Yeah, if you don&#x27;t have any way of catching cheaters, then you can pretend you have a 0% cheating rate. But it&#x27;s pretend.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m not speaking for my employer at all.')
