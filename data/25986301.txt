I assumed that aside from commercial break timings (one break in the middle) and start&#x2F;end gaps they should be the same, but my results automating based on timing clusters didn&#x27;t work too well.  Some subtitles were split into multiple segments, sometimes grunts or ambient noise had subtitles, etc.<p>I might try this out.')
