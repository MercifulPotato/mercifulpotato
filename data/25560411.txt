But these books also come to mind when I consider books I’d rather burn than read – not because they take place in the suburbs but because they’re so poorly written and illustrated. My only claim here is that the best children’s books forgo suburbia.</i><p>Just thinking about my kids&#x27; favorites of late and the Ladybug Girl series is set in exurbia and Mac B Kid Spy is set in suburban California when he&#x27;s not flying off to England and elsewhere in the service of the Queen of England.')
