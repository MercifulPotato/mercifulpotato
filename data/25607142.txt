What if Jo isn’t a heroin addict but instead a poor third world person who lives a subsistence level life?<p>Should I be prevented from offering Jo a better, higher paying assembly job because a small group of sleazy manufacturers use his country to escape environmental regulations?<p>Apple isn’t outsourcing assembly to escape environmental regulations. It’s offering better paying jobs that are lifting chinese and Indian workers out of poverty, while also reducing the cost of their products. That makes them more affordable to a wider audience. Apple, workers and consumers win, because free trade benefits all parties.<p>Environmental controls can only be implemented at the national and international level. If China doesn’t implement them, it’s not the fault of US companies.<p>If you make leading edge batteries that produce lots of toxic waste as a byproduct, the US will require you institute expensive controls&#x2F;cleaning processes  to prevent it from leaking into the environment.<p>But if China doesn’t have similar controls, making those batteries will be cheaper in China. If the US maker doesn’t go to China to make their batteries, they will lose marketshare to companies that do, or more likely Chinese companies.<p>If the US bans Chinese made batteries over environmental reasons, it makes US made electric cars uncompetitive and we lose sales and jobs to Chinese and European car makers.<p>So it’s never free trade at fault, it’s lack of international cooperation on environmental policies. If Chinese made products had to meet a base set of environmental manufacturing standards to be sold in Europe AND North America, they’d comply or lose 90% of their sales.<p>But the problem is that your arguments are often used disingenuously by labor unions whose actual agenda is protectionist policies to raise manufacturing costs in the third world to protect their members from competition. They really want to impose US level minimum wages in third world nations, which would be a disaster given they don’t have the capital and skills to support them. A backwards policy that hurts us too by protecting low value jobs we should be advancing out of.')
