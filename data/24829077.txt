Enterprise systems and installations rarely follow latest kernels and packages.<p>CentOS 8 still uses 5.8 for example and will use it for a long time.<p>I manage such systems and unless something explicitly needs 5.9, we won&#x27;t upgrade them. If it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s working. Everything is isolated from outside network so, external threats are not very important. We&#x27;re also an academic installation so, there&#x27;s nothing sensitive inside.<p>Edit: This doesn&#x27;t mean that we won&#x27;t security-patch our systems. That&#x27;s done pretty quickly and regularly. It&#x27;s different.')
