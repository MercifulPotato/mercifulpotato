The Chinese &quot;single product city&quot; is something of a free-market wonder. I visited Dehua (a ceramics city) and spent the time fascinated at how anything related to ceramics production is cheap in that city. It is no one individual factory that achieves economy of scale, but rather the full city, and everyone in it benefits. Small producers can achieve globally competitive pricing on their goods without having to take delivery of truckloads of input materials.')
