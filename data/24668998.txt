I used to run a 4 node Raspberry Pi 4 lxd cluster. One of the nodes failed over a weekend while I was out of town.  The containers which were running on the node properly restarted on a different node. That should have been the end of it until I was back in town and could restore the node to operational status. Unfortunately later that day the lxd snap decided to automatically update. It updated properly on the 3 nodes which remained operational but of course the failed node could not update. Once the other nodes were upgraded the cluster refused to come up because the failed node wasn&#x27;t running the same version of lxd as the rest of the cluster. I mean technically it wasn&#x27;t running anything but as far as lxd was concerned it was running a differing version even though it was down.<p>I noticed the entire cluster was down because my Plex server ran on it and I couldn&#x27;t watch a movie when I tried later that evening. Luckily I was able to ssh in and determine the issue quickly. Force removing the failed node from the cluster got things going again.<p>Lxd was quickly replaced by K3S which is unfortunate because the lxd cluster better fit my needs, except reliability, and was much easier to configure&#x2F;manage.<p>Even for small platform edge K8S clusters I actual find microk8s much easier than K3S but that would put me back in snap upgrade hell.')
