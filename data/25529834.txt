Hopefully.. one day, someone will contact us with a project that allows us to build the first fantasy UI for a real-world SaaS product.<p>Your best bet is to build internal tools. Interfaces aimed at consumers have to be appealing to the broadest market possible, which severely restricts how creative you can be and how much you can expect your users to learn.
