They move to a new apartment&#x2F;condo every 2-3 years and don&#x27;t care about schools, community, public transport etc. Another set of friends were lucky enough to be able to purchase million and half dollar homes in Fremont&#x2F;South San Jose&#x2F;Milpitas&#x2F;Campbell and now that they have friends and their kids have friends, they are &quot;settled&quot; and don&#x27;t mind paying ridiculous mortgage for next 20ish years. They do complaint about having to wfh home from their garage since all rooms in their home are occupied with kids at home. My friends in SFBA who claim that there are many jobs opportunities in tech companies have not changed their jobs in ~5 years.')
