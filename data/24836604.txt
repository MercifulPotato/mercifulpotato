Generally, measures like unemployment are useful in determining trends. Note how most of the unemployment measures are correlated.<p>OTOH, it may be wrong (eg) over very long periods. If underlying behavioural changes happen (eg employment seeking behaviour, drifting of underemployment&#x2F;unemployment ratios) it may miss long term trends.<p>The problems start (almost immediately) when when the measure becomes the definition. Measures are tightly defined, objective and legible. That&#x27;s attractive. So, we start to define (eg) unemployment as &quot;that which IQ tests measure.&quot; This is totally off track, if the measures weaknesses are (they usually are) justified by arguing the measure is just for trend detection. Definition and trend detection are different purposes.<p>In any case, the only way to get a less superficial understanding to define the measure in terms of what it actually  measures, not what it&#x27;s trying to measure. &quot;people trying to find work&quot; is an actually useful thing to pay attention to. It just isn&#x27;t &quot;unemployment&quot; in the widest sense of the term.<p>Personally, I hate the &quot;index&#x2F;metric&quot; solution. This is chasing the rabbit down a hole. We can&#x27;t have a measure that perfectly maps to unemployment (or financial wellbeing, or whatever). Efforts to do so end up measuring something even more abstract and difficult to understand.<p>The alternative is to just use these measures as incomplete. We can look at &quot;job seeker&quot; rates, nonemployment rates, etc. No measure will tell us what&#x27;s really happening. That&#x27;s up to us human intellect to determine.')
