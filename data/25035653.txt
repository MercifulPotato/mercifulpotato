Of course those systems can and should be hardened, but arguing that it should be done in a standard way completely ignores the reality of the political system that we&#x27;re in. That&#x27;s like going to your boss and suggesting to completely rewrite your company codebase in X language because it&#x27;s more secure. Theoretically, it&#x27;s not a bad idea, but the reality is that it doesn&#x27;t work that way.')
