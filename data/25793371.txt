Haven&#x27;t had it for long enough to see wear issues, but I&#x27;m surprised how well it&#x27;s worked. Biggest annoyance is that it&#x27;s sensitive to being jostled. When it was just power, that didn&#x27;t matter so much, but when it&#x27;s connected to my docking station, it&#x27;s the same as yanking the cable. It&#x27;s staying, for now, but I have to be careful moving things around on my desk.<p>Edit to address sibling concern: It&#x27;s running a TB3 screen, so seems to be working for that...')
