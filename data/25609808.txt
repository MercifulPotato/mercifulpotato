Also, how is this problem dealt with during recess? Unless there’s someone monitoring them inside the bathroom or searching them to make sure they don’t bring any vaping products I don’t see how you can prevent someone from vaping inside a bathroom stall.<p>&gt; where I&#x27;ve spent my break cleaning up chewing gum, spilled drinks and crumbs from students sneaking snacks<p>Why can&#x27;t whoever made the mess be forced to clean it? That way the system would self-regulate. Those who enjoy their snacks cleanly can keep doing so, those who make a mess have to clean it up and have an incentive to not make a mess in the future if they want their snacks.<p>&gt; how many of you &quot;adults&quot; have had to sign a code-of-conduct agreement before being allowed admittance to a tech conference or hackathon?<p>&quot;Codes of conduct&quot; are virtue signalling to appeal to some vocal minorities but I have yet to see evidence of it actually solving the real problem. Someone who wants to behave appropriately doesn&#x27;t need one, and someone who wants to be a dick already intends to break the (unspoken) rules regardless of a CoC being in place.')
