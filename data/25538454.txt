In addition to supporting literate programming (&quot;code as literature&quot;) and exploratory programming (&quot;code as scientific notebook&quot;) in a live coding environment, Howard explains how notebooks can improve documentation, learning and sharing, testing, and deployment. And add-ins and tools, like Howard&#x27;s own nbdev, can help address what&#x27;s missing in Jupyter Notebook. As an example, Howard notes how fastdoc even enabled him to write and publish &quot;Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD using Jupyter Notebooks.&quot; Excellent, inspiring talk!<p>Jeremy Howard - Creating delightful libraries and books with nbdev and fastdoc | JupyterCon 2020\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HKt19-GsA1I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HKt19-GsA1I</a>')
