GP is saying that this is the number one problem in neighborhoods. Based on what I&#x27;m seeing in my neighborhood (SV), this is 100% true.<p>People are also stealing packages, but the monetary loss in those cases is much less than the cost of replacing or repairing vehicles that have been stolen or broken into.')
