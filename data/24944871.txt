The advantage is that both languages allow for a functional style and Racket is much faster than Python.<p>Racket is, almost like Clojure, highly interactive (though not completely so, it has a conceptual separation of compile time and run time), and on top of that, it can call easily into a C ABI, which Rust provides.  Both languages (Rust and Racket) are well-suited for writing pure functions returning immutable results which allows for a nice match in style. Calling across the language boundary is a bit slower than in the Python&#x2F;C case but it can achieve a decent speed-up. Racket&#x27;s places allow for parallel execution with almost separate memory images, and it also has green threads.  And Racket has batteries such as a GUI toolkit and image data types included which is really nice.')
