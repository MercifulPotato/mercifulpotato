Item(by='lacker', descendants=None, kids=[25565964, 25561858], score=None, time=1609173417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550240, text='From the perspective of this software engineer, Lean seems mostly superior to the other proof assistant languages. You can develop in a regular text editor, the source code is open, you don’t have any hacky “some expressions are a sublanguage in string constants” stuff, and most importantly the community is extremely responsive. Speed is the biggest problem; Lean 3 still has a very slow interpreter and it makes some things (in particular communicating out to an external specialized solver like the “hammer” tactics) too slow to be practical. If Lean 4 manages to improve speed as much as promised, and the 3 -&gt; 4 migration actually happens, I think it will become the all-around superior choice.')
