Presumably this means the address bar, which breaks TLS.<p>Looks like you got confused. I didn&#x27;t say that. You just assumed that.<p>&gt; SSH derives a big chunk of security from key caching.<p>No, it does not. It is pointless to fill DNS entries for hosts that are supposed to have their IPs hidden behind DDoS mitigation services like CloudFlare. The whole purpose of the exercise is to not leak the IP addresses.<p>You SSH into your servers via IP, the IP gets cached with the key. There is no difference compared to having a DNS entry, except for the fact that you do not leak the server IP.<p>&gt; If you’re using IPs you now can’t have an IP change<p>No one wants IP changes on externally facing hosts. You keep the IP static and if something happens with the server, you just reassign the IP.')
