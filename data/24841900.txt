What would you call that process?<p>&gt; In other words, the techniques praised in lesswrong writings dress up what is effectively bias shuffling, which results in the same problem of being unable to assess the predictors of outcomes, just now better hidden behind falsely confident figures instead of admission of uncertainty.<p>I’m asking how you can identify a truth-finding process that is not bias shuffling and what you would call it (since “rational” is now taboo).')
