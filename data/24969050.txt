The cost is also minimal compared to the developer time, and while we&#x27;re getting &quot;less for our money&quot;, because we only pay for the active time, it&#x27;s actually cheaper for us than Jenkins was just for hardware rental, let alone developer time managing Jenkins.<p>I can completely see how a different org with different constraints, different deployments, clouds, strategies, provisioning, distribution of engineers, etc, could come to the conclusion that you did – that BYO is better, but I think it does depend on so much.')
