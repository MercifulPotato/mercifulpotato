He failed to change things because he didn&#x27;t articulate a compelling enough reason for people to be fearful of what he revealed.<p>People feel that they are powerless to change this state of affairs and they are correct. Snowden told people it was happening, most people felt it was bad, but what they going to do? Stop using the internet? Elect someone that will shut down domestic surveillance? Throw away your phone? You might as well tell people to go live in a cave, eat lichen for food and lick the walls for water. People given no other option will accept what options remain. This even includes the option of facing certain death.')
