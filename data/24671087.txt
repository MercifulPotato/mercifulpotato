This isn&#x27;t a complaint that the bug exists, or a suggestion that you prioritise fixing it, or a support request asking for workarounds. It&#x27;s just a report that the bug exists. »<p>But I think actually writing that would come over as rather snotty. Maybe the right thing is to write a post somewhere on what I think is the right attitude for filing bug reports, and discreetly link to it.')
