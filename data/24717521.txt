Item(by='leto_ii', descendants=None, kids=[24717596], score=None, time=1602150571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717404, text='&gt; Right now, my leverage is &quot;give me my bonus or I&#x27;ll go elsewhere and the only other guy on this team can&#x27;t code or troubleshoot for shit and takes every nfl game day off sick&quot;<p>This attitude to me seems terribly short-sighted. Currently tech workers are privileged and can live with the illusion that they are not replaceable. The nature of capitalism however is to instrumentalize human beings and reduce them to what they can produce&#x2F;consume. Nobody in particular cares about how special you are. If at some point in the future your job becomes less valuable your individual leverage will evaporate. At that point it would be good to have a union to fall back on.')
