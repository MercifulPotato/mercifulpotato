So libraries will be installed to &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib and binaries to &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin...<p>Build systems, let you change such PREFIX, so you can build a program telling it to live under &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local, or any other root directory like &#x2F;opt&#x2F;myprog-version...<p>Then. if you build another program, that depends on the libraries of the previous program, you may need to tell where to locate such libraries if they are not in the default place, each program build flags may vary, but for example in ruby you can pass it to .&#x2F;configure --with-openssl-dir=&#x2F;opt&#x2F;myopenssl-X.Y')
