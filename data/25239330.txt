The huge benifit of bazel-like build systems isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s better then <i>a</i> languages build system, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s the best <i>every</i> language build system.<p>It&#x27;s consistent between all languages and supports a lot of functionality. For example the proto_library and grpc_library rules make building microservices extremely easy. You can build an entire service in like 3 lines of boilerplate.<p>It also makes it easy to do cross-language deps. For example a c library included into a Java library that uses native bindings to wrap it.')
