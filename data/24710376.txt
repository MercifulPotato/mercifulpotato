I don’t use Brave (I won’t use anything Chromium-based while it has such dangerously high market share), but I think that controversy was exaggerated. All they where doing was adding redundant metadata (already present in the useragent string), IUUC not tied to any identity other than their own (not just an “anonymized” identity, no unique user identifier at all) to get some non-privacy-violating profit. And the phrase “hijacking links” is quite misleading — they didn’t change any actual links on pages, only added affiliate codes to the suggested omnibar completions you could <i>choose</i> to accept.<p>(Edit:) DDG I would be careful about. I still use it but try not to recommend it without mentioning <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asciimoo&#x2F;searx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asciimoo&#x2F;searx</a> — which I think is worthy of trust, being Free&#x2F;Libre — because of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23708166" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23708166</a>.')
