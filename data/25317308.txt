It is very nearly a 50&#x2F;50 blend between value&#x2F;growth at the moment. Only ~25% of my portfolio represents investments explicitly for purposes of driving dividend income (REITs). I say 2.9% as a &quot;safe&quot; figure in context of investments that are more-or-less idle without all the stress (i.e. holding a bunch of TSLA is not always fun). In reality, my total portfolio is more than doubled YTD, but I wouldn&#x27;t publish that as a typical figure.')
