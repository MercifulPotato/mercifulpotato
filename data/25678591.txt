I agree with them completely.<p>There are a lot we can do though, without leaving the React ecosystem. (Which you probably shouldn&#x27;t because of React&#x27;s popularity)<p>1. Ugliness of createElement API and JSX:<p>There is always Hyperscript: github.com&#x2F;ohanhi&#x2F;hyperscript-helpers.<p>2. CRA:<p>CRA is a monstrosity all right, which becomes more obvious when one has the misfortune of ejecting it. But it&#x27;s not required at all. One can easily get away with a ~100 line Webpack config or with Parcel for simple scenarios. This is what is already happening, a lot of experienced users are avoiding CRA.<p>3. Hooks, fibers, suspense:<p>We don&#x27;t have to use them. We have HOCs for years which are simply the React version of the venerable decorator pattern so actually no one needs a silly abstraction such as hooks. And I don&#x27;t think fibers &amp; suspense are features that the average React user needs to use at all. Just forget about them. Until you really really need them, but you&#x27;ll know when this happens.<p>4. Global state and black magic:<p>Because of Redux&#x27; popularity, at some point a lot of developers started to believe that we should shift as much state as possible to a global data store. This resulted in a lot of unnecessary complication, pain and suffering in a lot of codebases. But of course this mindset is not to be blamed on Redux nor React itself. It is just the result of a poor understanding of state management, patterns established around this poor understanding, and copy paste culture. Global state is definitely not bad per se and not really threatening when it&#x27;s experienced hands working on it.')
