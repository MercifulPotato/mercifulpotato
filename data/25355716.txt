Some states can &quot;decertify&quot; police officers, mostly for committing a felony, which is a batshit standard.<p>The point of licensing is to bypass the CBA; the state can revoke a license --- for reasons other than &quot;failed an exam&quot; --- and having done so, the local department cannot retain the officer regardless of the results of labor arbitration.<p>This is something Illinois is working on right now, at the behest of the Lightfoot administration, though I haven&#x27;t seen much news on progress. It&#x27;s a big deal.')
