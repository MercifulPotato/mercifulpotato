Every vehicle I&#x27;ve been in has a large warning label on the sun visor that states that children under 13 (I think) shouldn&#x27;t sit in the front seat due to the danger caused by the airbag.<p>I have also seen some vans that allow you to disable the passenger airbag with the ignition key in a keyhole in the dashboard. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s safe for kids in that case though.')
