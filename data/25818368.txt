Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610946364, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817758, text='I find a big part of the problem is most kitchens are designed poorly without any attention to workflows. For example pot-&gt;sink-&gt;stove or dining table-&gt;sink-&gt;drying rack or vegetables from fridge-&gt;sink-&gt;cutting board-&gt;pot and often require back-and-forth motion to accomplish these things. No attention to where the user would place a trash can AND recycling can AND compost can. No attention to where the user would place a knife block that is right in front of a suitable space for cutting, with enough space for cutting. Sinks or fridges placed next to stoves with no attention to where one would store oil, vinegar, other cooking condiments, spatulas, and things. Sinks designed without space for a drying rack nearby. Sinks and faucets that are too shallow that you can&#x27;t wash a pot. Faucets that are always either too hot or too cold. Sharp-cornered hippie sinks that are hard to scrub down the corner. Counters designed so small and completely oblivious to the fact that everyone has at least a microwave and 3 other appliances and still need space to chop and work flour without making a mess.<p>If the space is designed well with close attention to workflows and storage and even a gram of attention paid to the UI&#x2F;UX of the kitchen, work would a LOT faster.')
