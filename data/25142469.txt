I tend to be pro-market on average but really it&#x27;s not the market I&#x27;m interested in so much as liberty. I also take a very expansive view of what the market entails; not just materialistic concerns but the full spectrum of human preferences. Does it always lead to a perfect outcome? Of course not. <i>No</i> system comprised of fallible and incompletely-informed human beings could possibly do that. It&#x27;s just better than all the alternatives.<p>All the human failings which prevent markets from achieving optimal results are also problems for the various political schemes that aim to regulate them, magnified by the introduction of force as a &quot;legitimate&quot; means of achieving the desired end state. (It&#x27;s ironic, for example, that people turn to governments to save them from monopolies—mostly government-<i>created</i> monopolies—when the government itself is the biggest monopoly of them all.)<p>In the end the real goal isn&#x27;t to make people &quot;happy&quot;—we could do that much more easily with drugs. Rather, it&#x27;s to ensure that people can live their lives the way that they choose, so that they can <i>seek</i> happiness, or purpose, or whatever else means the most to them. The fact that people make choices that (in someone else&#x27;s opinion) probably won&#x27;t make them happier is not sufficient justification for taking away their freedom to choose for themselves. I happen to think the moral, principled position also happens in this case to be the one that leads to the best outcomes for the most people from a purely materialistic point of view, but this is merely a happy coincidence; it would still be the right thing to do even if it resulted in abject poverty.')
