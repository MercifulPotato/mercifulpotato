The judiciary (similarly to politicians) are human people, and each individual&#x27;s interpretation of what is law will vary.<p>Probably the biggest example of the difficulty of enforcement is the Irish Apple case[0]. The European Commission carried out a two-year investigation that found Apple avoided paying â‚¬13 billion in taxes to the Irish state. The Irish state rejected the Commission&#x27;s findings and appealed the findings to the European General Court (EGC). And the EGC found in favour of the Irish state (and Apple).<p>Does this count as laws being enforced?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EU_illegal_state_aid_case_against_Apple_in_Ireland#Appeal_(2016%E2%80%932020)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EU_illegal_state_aid_case_agai...</a>')
