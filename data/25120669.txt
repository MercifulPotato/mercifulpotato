The relatively similar all cause does not imply that it would be the same people dying. There could instead people different people dying.<p>For example, there are much less people dying by automobile accidents (a leading cause of death for young people). In 2020, they could be replaced by very different types of death (COVID, Suicide, etc.)<p>That said, it certainly COULD be relatively similar people.
