We can&#x27;t pretend that they aren&#x27;t being sneaky about their finances.  China in particular has been notorious in their two-facedness presenting their economies as safe havens while covering up their underhandedness.  If they aren&#x27;t put on the spot and faced directly for what they are under their mask, they&#x27;ll continue to shapeshift and avert transparency into a system that disproportionately benefits them.  Economists have long predicted their economy is in a bubble, but because of the way they prop it up, they are able to inflate far longer than they would in a more transparent world, thus drawing investors into their falsely good looking economy while acquiring foreign assets that have real value with that extra purchasing power.')
