Also: I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic about Pritzker&#x27;s administration, at least in terms of actually getting things done in the state.<p>But examples of bad governance in Illinois would include:<p>* Scandalous public pension liabilities<p>* Patronage jobs at Metra run through speaker Madigan&#x27;s office<p>* ComEd being fined $200MM for a bribery scandal with Madigan&#x27;s office<p>* The financial debacle of the privatization of Chicago parking revenue<p>Illinois is one of just 8 states with a flat state income tax, which is something that needs to change so we can get our financial house in order, but won&#x27;t, because literally nobody trusts our state government. It&#x27;s hard to lay the blame for that on anything other than the state Democratic party.')
