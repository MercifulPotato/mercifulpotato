These are periodically checked to make sure nothing has been overwritten that shouldn&#x27;t be. You can find this code on my website, www.gamepipeline.org as part of the &quot;forge&quot; library.<p>The system tells me very precisely what has gone wrong with buffer over-runs, and it also make memory leaks and double frees trivial to find.<p>Visual studios debug mode does something similar with buffer overruns on the stack, but I tend not to put very many buffers on the stack so that much more rare as an issue.<p>If you want to go even more hardcore, windows has &quot;gflags&quot; that you can turn on to find overruns using memory protection.<p>LLVM also have the &quot;Checked C&quot; compiler that also finds these issues.<p>My own system is so good that, I haven&#x27;t used gflags in a few years and I also haven&#x27;t tested Checked C so I cant vouch for it, but there are loads of possibilities in this space that i hope to explore further in the future.')
