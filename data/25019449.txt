Denialism on the left about certain things is becoming rampant:<p>- Blacks commit far more crime than other racial groups. There are sociological explanations for this, but that is currently a fact, and one that people on the left do mental backflips to avoid acknowledging.<p>- Gender pay gap in most industries is small or non-existent once you adjust for experience and other factors.
