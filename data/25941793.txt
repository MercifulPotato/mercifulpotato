Feds or regulatory body will crack down, we&#x27;ll just accept another banned community that is &quot;a threat to our democracy&quot; and we&#x27;ll move on. I don&#x27;t think what is essentially financial de-regulation is a movement that&#x27;s going to pick up steam some time soon. There&#x27;s vagueness in securities laws and this will continue. Meanwhile banks will periodically be sued for tens of billions that will fill the coffers of attorney generals, justice departments and various state regulators [0]<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t that the whole point WSB is making?<p>Yes, partly. I think much of it is about having some fun and having a sense of community.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;big-banks-paid-110-billionin-mortgage-related-fines-where-did-the-money-go-1457557442" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;big-banks-paid-110-billionin-mo...</a>')
