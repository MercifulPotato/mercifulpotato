(I&#x27;m also asking for proof on Hall&#x27;s negative stance on deadlifts, since I can&#x27;t find anything about it)<p>To add, the best strength training programs I&#x27;ve tried use submaximal loading most if not all of the time, adding a further layer of safety: not only are you not pushing yourself past your limits with PEDs or insane training tonnage, you&#x27;re purposefully staying <i>below</i> your natural limits.<p>Keep deadlifting with exquisite form and reap the benefits!')
