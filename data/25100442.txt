In one chaper the author talks about the incredible boon that comes from heading towards boredom instead of away from it. He decided to take a night to just do nothing.<p>At first, it was uncomfortable, but then his whole world slowed down. He started noticing things he hadn&#x27;t noticed before: a particular color, a detail on a flower. It was like a different reality.<p>I use this idea of heading towards boredom to clear my own head. I find it incredibly helpful to sit in a dark room with no sounds and no goal for about 2 hours. After the initial discomfort (might last 20 minutes, might last an hour) my brain feels renewed and free. And the quality of my ideas goes way up.<p>I don&#x27;t do it to be more productive though. I do it because it helps me get to a better, more attuned experience of reality. Closer to joy, peace, and acceptance, and further from always thinking about what&#x27;s next.')
