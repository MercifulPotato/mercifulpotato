You can pretty easily imagine a world where newtons laws are different, but I&#x27;d argue it is impossible to imagine a world where 1 + 1 is not 2. However being impossible for us to imagine doesn&#x27;t mean that such worlds can&#x27;t exist, it would just have completely ridiculous consequences we can&#x27;t imagine, so those rules are a part of our universe and not a fundamental logical truth.')
