The other &quot;low carbon&quot; sources are similar, they have carbon emissions only because the rest of the economy that manufactures them produces carbon.<p>As for cost, you are contradicting yourself when you say it&#x27;s cheap (it&#x27;s not), and when you say that it&#x27;s expensive because of anti-nuclear activists. See, for example, France, whose new nuclear projects are not cost competitive despite having a strongly pro-nuclear regulatory situation.<p>As for the &quot;efficiency&quot; of hydrogen, the only efficiency that matters is economic efficiency, and all indications point to hydrogen storage of wind&#x2F;solar to be more economically efficient than nuclear. (And for the record, for energy efficiency both nuclear and hydrogen are about 50% efficient, but like I said the only efficiency that matters for deployment is cost efficiency.')
