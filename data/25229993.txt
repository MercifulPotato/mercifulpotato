Minimum bicycle weight in the Tour de France is 6.8kg (~15lb). It&#x27;s possible to make bicycles significantly lighter than this, but most manufacturers don&#x27;t because of the rules of the Tour.<p>I do recommend to anyone who hasn&#x27;t done it yet to take a moment and marvel at the technological accomplishment that is the bicycle. The car takes far too much credit but ultimately it can only work by burning fossil fuels. The bicycle, on the other hand, is a machine weighing less than 7kg, that is up to 99% efficient and enabled a human to travel 5x faster than walking with no extra energy required.<p>Adding an electric motor to a bicycle removes much of the elegance for me. But still better than cars when it comes to moving sacks of meat around, of course.')
