Within a short period of time, however, it became a favourite with Edo’s print-loving public. Within four decades, the print was heralded by modern artists and thinkers in Europe, and during the twentieth century its status as, arguably, the single most famous image in all Asian art was established. \nIn addition to The great wave’s sheer graphic beauty, there is a compelling compositional force in its contrast between wave and mountain. The horizon has been lowered to emphasise the height of the monstrous towering wave which stands in tense juxtaposition over the graceful lines of a diminutive Mt Fuji. \nThe dynamic composition creates a coexistence between human frailty and the power of nature. We see tiny fishermen huddled in their sleek crafts ride down one wave, dive straight into the next and endeavour to come out the other side. Every morning these boats, named oshiokuribune, transported fish to markets in Edo Bay from villages on the Bōsō Peninsula. The lifelike tentacles of the wave are captivating, and the undulating water allow us to share in the boatmen’s perilous situation.')
