Congrats on starting out on your own.<p>&gt;<i>However, I am still quite unsure how to actually get the ball rolling. My current game plan is to just brainstorm for a week or so and then start building the best idea I came up with during that week, then give myself a release deadline of one month for an MVP and see if I can raise some interest.</i><p>That mostly sounds sensible to me.<p>I recommend thinking more about the &quot;raise some interest&quot; part. There&#x27;s a common trap that indie founders frequently fall into (myself included) where you build an MVP but don&#x27;t think about marketing it until you&#x27;ve already built it. And then you realize there&#x27;s no plan for finding customers.<p>Once you build the MVP, how will you find customers? Can you skip to that part without even building the MVP?<p>One of the ideas I liked in the Jason Cohen video[0] I linked in the article how he built WP Engine. He wanted to build a product for WordPress consultants, so he just emailed consultants and offered to pay them their hourly rate if they&#x27;d jump on a call with him and answer questions about their pain points. He didn&#x27;t have any demo to show them, but people took his calls because he was showing that he valued their time (most accepted the calls and declined the money).<p>So, I think building an MVP is great, but it&#x27;s even better if you can talk to customers before you build anything and find out what problems you can solve for them. A great book for this is <i>The Mom Test</i> by Rob Fitzpatrick, for which I&#x27;ve published my notes.[1]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;book-reports&#x2F;the-mom-test&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;book-reports&#x2F;the-mom-test&#x2F;</a>')
