You will probably notice that those 4 friends have less body fat and are more toned than the other 6.  At that point, if a study came out saying that working out had no impact on body physique, you&#x27;d reflexively question the results.<p>That might sound ridiculous, but lots of people here grew up playing &quot;violent&quot; video games through the 90s-00s, and had large friend groups who did the same.  And it&#x27;s pretty likely that, for most of us, none of our friends ended up with violent or aggressive tendencies.<p>Anecdotes are not scientifically rigorous, but they aren&#x27;t completely useless either.  If violent video games caused measurable increases in aggressive behavior, people who were around a large cohort of people playing these games would notice this fact in action.  Just like they&#x27;d notice that friends who eat a lot of cake tend to be larger than the one who don&#x27;t.')
