Although in Keptn it is based on SRE best practices (such as service level indicators and service level objectives).<p>Another key differentiator is that Keptn takes care of operations as well. Being an event-based system Keptn retrieves (cloud) events and triggers other actions in response to them, such as counter action for Prometheus alerts or problem tickets from incident management system.<p>full disclosure: I am a Keptn contributor and maintainer.')
