Heck, even amplification means that a silent movie with a keyboardist or orchestra will sound better for everybody in the theater, not to mention saving the vocal cords of the intertitle card narrator (if applicable).<p>Conversion equipment is always improving as well. The Super-8 movies I had digitized 20 years ago should be reconverted again because they were ripped at 640x480, which was the style at the time. I&#x27;m not sure of the world of upsampling algorithms, but I bet those are improving as well.<p>Digitized media will never look or sound better than they do now, and that&#x27;s on consumer equipment. Ripping VHS with current hardware would undoubtedly result in a better image than 10 years ago.<p>Backing them up and preservation, on the other hand, is much easier with digital media.')
