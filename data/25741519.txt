First, the UDM is not discontinued- it&#x27;s for sale right now. Second, you don&#x27;t need a USG+key to do VLANs. You do need to run a Unifi controller, but you can self host that anywhere like on a RasPi or in a VM. You don&#x27;t need a USG to do the tagging and routing, either... the VLANs you set in the Unifi controller will work with any router&#x2F;gateway it&#x27;s just not all streamlined into the controller interface if you use a separate gateway. I know this because I do exactly that, I have a pfSense gateway and Unifi switches&#x2F;APs.')
