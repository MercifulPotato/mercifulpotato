Likely an economic-incentives-problem. The culture in <i>both business and consumers</i>. There always seem to be The Assholes who corrupt it all for everyone. It&#x27;s easy to point at businesses, but few talk about incidents of malfeasance from the other parties to the transactions. The guy who buys a circular saw from a big box store, uses it for a weekend project, then returns it. The woman who buys a dress, hides the price tag, wears it to a wedding, then returns it.<p>Building high-trust, high-ethics organizations at scale and identifying individuals for those organizations is hard, and I wish there was more written about it. It&#x27;s not a new problem, so I&#x27;d like to see the evolution of thought about it as well.')
