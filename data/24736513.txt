I personally think the decision could&#x27;ve been a bit more aggressive against gerrymandering but we do need some clear line to say &quot;If you&#x27;re beyond this you&#x27;re doing an illegal thing&quot; - and while we could close in on that line over time with a slow accumulation of precedent it&#x27;d be a lot cleaner to have a decent measure.')
