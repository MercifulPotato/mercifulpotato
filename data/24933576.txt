Media organizations are not interested truth or accuracy of their stories, but simply how many ads and subscriptions the stories can sell. And that&#x27;s not the say they are motivated by greed - even worse, they are often motivated by missionary-like zeal to promote a cause. So of course it would follow that they have no interest in publishing anything disagreeable to their readership.<p>However, Greenwald&#x27;s argument definitely should be how it works if a media organization cares about truth and open debate. In this case, it seems very hard to believe that a story -- written by a credible journalist, with a long track record, who literally founded the organization -- was garbage.<p>I think Glenn hoped to create a media entity that regarded truth as the measure of merit of a story vs. how well it promoted a cause and ads&#x2F;subscriptions. Now that the experiment has failed so obviously, good for him for moving on.')
