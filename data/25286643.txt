It works. It&#x27;s not arbitrary.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect of course, but it&#x27;s far better than allowing large companies to get a complete stranglehold.<p>It seems to me that if you want to claim some version of &quot;leave the marketplace alone and it will self correct&quot; then you have to make a pretty strong case. It&#x27;s not a self evident truth, history tells a different story.<p>Sometimes the marketplace takes care of itself, sure, but there have been lots of examples where it hasn&#x27;t. In those cases, when government has stepped in, the outcome has generally been positive (if sometimes short lived).')
