If anything, humility and an openness to learning will show you in the best light.<p>Your technical skills no longer matter? So someone without technical skills, but the humility and willingness to learn is what they are looking for? Is that why these companies want CS graduates? Is that why they run interviewees through technical quizzes?<p>How about technical skills are just as important, but also are humility and willingness to learn? How about they were always important? Since when were humility and willingness to learn not important in the tech industry? The guy just rehashed industry interview talking points that have been around forever. The only thing new in the articl is &quot;technical skills no longer matter. Which is nonsense.<p>Also, nothing more humble than bragging about getting offers from google, microsoft and stripe. That headline screams humility.')
