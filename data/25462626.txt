And I simply don&#x27;t understand your reticence to share private health information with strangers on the internet. &#x2F;s<p>Ok, so from what I understand, much of the fallout from a coronavirus infection in severe cases is resulting from an overreaction by the immune system. What I saw in the original paper you shared is that the most plausible mechanism would be increased propensity for isolation and mask wearing, but the IL-6 knockdown would be through CF <i>deactivating</i> elements of the immune system (immune signaling molecules).<p>The Nature paper suggests upregulation of inflammation, which seems implausible to me: &quot;<i>Activation of furin, which is increased in CF, together with the cellular damage induced by viroporins, might be expected to upregulate NLRP3 and cause inflammation</i>&quot;<p>The proposed mechanism in the Physio paper is as follows: &quot;<i>Our analysis revealed that ACE2 mRNA is elevated and TMPRSS2 mRNA is decreased in CF airway epithelial cells compared with non-CF cells. Increased ACE2 is predicted to enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to epithelial cells but would increase conversion of ANG II, which is proinflammatory, to angiotensin-1â€“7, which is anti-inflammatory. Thus, increased ACE2 would reduce inflammation and lung damage due to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased TMPRSS2 would reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells</i>&quot;<p>So, again, there isn&#x27;t hard evidence that this is happening at all, but here are a couple of proposed mechanisms that could potentially explain it if it is happening.<p>Also I skimmed these things, so grain of salt.')
