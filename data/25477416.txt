(I actually have a batch of CDs I need to re-rip.) But what&#x27;s there today seems to work pretty well separating what I have my own copies of vs. what I only have available via Apple Music.<p>Though maybe you&#x27;re saying something differently.<p>I think the music industry is perfectly happy to sell you music at $1&#x2F;song and even physical CDs if you like. It&#x27;s just that, for most people who don&#x27;t already have large curated collections, it apparently makes sense to subscribe for $10&#x2F;month rather than buy albums for $10. For me it makes sense to subscribe and occasionally also buy something to add to my owned collection.')
