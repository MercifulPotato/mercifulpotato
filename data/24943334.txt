The difference between Deepnote and MyBinder is that we keep the pool of Docker images as small as possible. That means they are always in cache. You can still write your own Dockerfile, but they are layered on our base image. MyBinder has a lot of work that needs to be done (pulling the image, sometimes building it, etc) which we thankfully mostly avoided.<p>Regarding the lock-in, it&#x27;s in our best interest to remain fully compatible. So yes, there&#x27;ll always be a way how to export your project and run it in plain Jupyter. The hope is the more advanced features (comments, output visualizations, different cell types) will appear in Jupyter over time as well, but it&#x27;s also up to Jupyter whether they want those features.')
