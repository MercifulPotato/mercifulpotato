Period.<p>We can check for duplicate votes. Submitting fraudulent ballots in quantities necessary to change the results while avoiding submitting duplicate ballots (which would be caught, as we saw with the Jill Stokke) would require either:<p>1. Extremely good data about who had voted and who had not.<p>OR<p>2. Some faction in the ballot-processing chain with the ability to secretly discard the legitimate ballots.<p>Is there evidence that either of these things happened?')
