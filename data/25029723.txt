On the other side, with multiple top tech companies being 100K+ employees, being at one long enough to lead a team or project is not that selective.<p>I do agree that competing based on compensation is generally foolish, with only exceptions like being funded by the top 1% of VCs who like to compete by overspending. Hence, 50% paycut.')
