Little experience that I do have is that people are first put on O2, then if their saturation remains low they increase the flow until they can increase no more. At that moment they are a candidate for a ventilator.<p>Maybe they &quot;relaxed&quot; the criteria after a while if ventilators showed bad outcomes but when people are maxed out on O2, there is little you can do.')
