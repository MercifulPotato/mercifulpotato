The Facebook account has received an automated block, and they&#x27;ve kept it blocked after a manual review which has asked for a photo of my face.<p>Now they have a photo of my face, my legal name and date of birth, my verified email address and phone number, and I cannot exercise any control over this data, only download it, which is obviously illegal under GDPR.<p>Facebook engineers from Wit.ai are ignoring my request for help and the app APIs remain operational, I just can&#x27;t log into the dashboard.<p>If you&#x27;re a developer who considers using Wit.ai, be careful. You could receive an automated block from Facebook and an overworked contractor will rubber-stamp the bot&#x27;s decision, while Wit.ai staff will ignore you.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wit-ai&#x2F;wit&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1946" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wit-ai&#x2F;wit&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1946</a>')
