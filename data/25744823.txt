Unless there&#x27;s multiple of these hiveminds, in that case it would be more like a bunch of &quot;super&quot; humans. The next evolution, maybe.<p>There are many cases where people&#x27;s personality changes, sometimes drastically. Their friends and relatives don&#x27;t recognize them anymore (brain damage, severe depression, drug abuse), or they don&#x27;t recognize anyone around (amnesia). Does that stop them from being human? I think most people agree they&#x27;re different, but still very much human.')
