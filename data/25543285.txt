A blast furnace is a well balanced chemical reaction where the coke serves two purposes; a source of carbon monoxide for turning ore in iron (Fe2O3(s) + 3 CO(g) =&gt; 2 Fe(s) + 3 CO2(g), very exothermic, good for turning the iron &#x2F; steel into a liquid alloy), and a source of carbon for turning the iron into steel. All in one vessel and in one process no less. I guess you could do the first step using peroxide to strip the oxygen from the iron, but the second step in the same vessel at the same time?<p>Fe2o3 + 3H2O2 =&gt; 2 Fe + 3 H2O, somewhat exothermic (if my rusty memory of enthalpy calculations are correct), not sure of the activation energy or need for catalysts).<p>[EDIT] also forgot the peroxide reaction would probably require external heat to over come the latent energy required to turn the H2O into super heated steam so that you could melt the iron &#x2F; steel. This would probably boil off a large chunk of the peroxide as well, so it might need to be done in a contained pressure vessel, which would probably affect the speed of the iron ore reduction.')
