While I’ve had silly issues with my normal bank (like inability to close an account due to “technical reasons”), interacting with revolut has been stellar.<p>Customer support, features roll out, chargebacks etc - all way better experience than the local banks.<p>They singlehandedly forced all the banks in my country to implement apple pay &#x2F; google wallet. For years nobody bothered, the moment Revolut entered the market, with apple pay support, the banks scrambled to add it themselves.<p>One time I even had my card stolen while traveling abroad - got a new card within two days, global delivery. I was very pleasantly surprised.<p>But I also understand the risks and don’t really use them for long term asset management for now. Just as a front for all of my expenses - their analytics are just awesome.')
