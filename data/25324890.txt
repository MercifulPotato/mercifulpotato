I personally think that science should have more open access, and I assume that many who work at these payment processors share my sentiment. But I think payment processors want to avoid legal liability — legal fees and settlements (or even criminal charges) are expensive.<p>&gt; When is a slippery slope a fallacy and when is it not?<p>Wikipedia has a section on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slippery_slope#Non-fallacious_usage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slippery_slope#Non-fallacious_...</a><p>In my opinion, slippery slope is a fallacy when there is not a clear demarcation. If the US government says &quot;we need to torture in exigent situations&quot; I worry about slippery slope because it&#x27;s easy for the definition of &quot;exigent&quot; to change when convenient. On the other hand, if the US government said &quot;we use torture for people who have been in contact with ISIS and have been convicted of murder,&quot; then the criteria are provable facts that create a clear line. I would still disagree with the use of torture, but my disagreement would be on ethical grounds, not that there is a slippery slope.<p>If payment processors say &quot;we won&#x27;t process payments for platforms who knowingly host content that advocates for violence against a race of people&quot; — then it&#x27;s not a slippery slope. When a line is clearly demarcated, there is a mechanism for changes in the policy to be examined (and just because a policy changes that doesn&#x27;t mean that there is a slippery slope; sometimes changes are justified!).<p>One could argue that the line could be capriciously moved; however, I would want some sort of evidence or justification that it might be.')
