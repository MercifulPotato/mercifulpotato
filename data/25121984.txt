Even their supporters call it a &quot;backdoor&quot; government.<p>The former PM who stole billions and was found guilty of all charges was sentenced to 12 years in prison yet still sits in Parliament while getting friendly media interviews, he gave a speech on the budget just the other day representing all of the backbench.<p>I always find the South China Sea discussions interesting because I&#x27;d love to hear who people actually think deserves ownership of it?<p>The Philippines is run by a proud mass murdering nutjob, Vietnam is China-lite, Brunei just tried to roll out the death penalty for gay people. Malaysia is steadily gaining more extreme Islamists in power who bizarrely blame the Jews for everything that goes wrong like it&#x27;s a country run by 4chan.<p>Who exactly deserves all that oil and fish? It&#x27;s none of the above in my opinion.')
