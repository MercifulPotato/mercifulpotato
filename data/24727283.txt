They were comparing <i>binary</i> SHA-1 hashes in RSA signatures with strncmp.<p>They also weren&#x27;t checking padding, so you didn&#x27;t have to use a real signature with a 00 byte in a convenient place (though I did find one), but rather could just use an all-00 signature, because performing the RSA computation on zero yields zero.')
