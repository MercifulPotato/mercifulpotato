Personally I think having a 1:1 mapping to the C API is reasonable enough as a first target. It should make porting code easy and referencing the official documentation is probably easiest this way.<p>No matter how many heuristics they apply to make a somewhat more idiomatic mapping, it&#x27;ll never feel right until it&#x27;s manually designed to fit with Rust conventions. So I&#x27;m okay with it as it is now and can hope for a much thicker abstraction in the future.')
