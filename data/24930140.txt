In that context, searchability is more important that good organizing.<p>I have that sort of hybrid approach.  My &quot;main&quot; doc is a TODO Journal where I list my todos for that day (often copied from the prior day).  The journal maintains a record of what I&#x27;ve done every day since I started two years ago - each new day is set at the top of the doc.  Many of the line items are themselves links to other documents (all in markdown), which are themselves a mix of project notes and TODO lists.<p>I use Typora to edit, and WinSCP to encrypt on a remote drive that&#x27;s backed up each night.')
