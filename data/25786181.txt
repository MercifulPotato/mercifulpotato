After years of trying to find time I’ve committed to getting into the shop for at least a few minutes every day.<p>I’m starting with a simple single dovetail box. No lid.<p>Bought some quarter inch thins that are ready to go so I didn’t have to worry about surfacing the stock beforehand.<p>I spent 25 minutes in the shop tonight cutting the second pin. So far both are a bit loose, and I went past a line but they don’t look like a rabid beaver went after them so I’m happy!<p>Hopefully I can string together a couple easy wins and build some more complex things later in the year.')
