Optimizing IO performance makes it perform better, while optimizing CPU performance makes it <i>feel</i> better to use.<p>Arguably, making tools feel better to use is more important than raw performance. When you&#x27;re doing a no-op build, the difference between 100 milliseconds and 500 is large, and the difference between 10ms and 100 is enormous.')
