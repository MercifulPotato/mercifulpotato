Go over €4&#x2F;kg and you&#x27;ll get a full blown revolution, complete with a fully functional guillotine.<p>In my local supermarket 500g of bucatini De Cecco come for €.99, which is around $1.22. I understand that pasta in considered a specialty on the other side of the pond, but it is still basically just (semolina) flour and water, and no matter how fancy it could be, it&#x27;s outrageous to pay that much for something mass produced.')
