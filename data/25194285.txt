For example, how does one doctor in Germany attribute a death to smoking vs. a doctor in the US?<p>The reason why I bring this up is I know of at least one metric where the definitions being used are quite disparate: child mortality. The US is very inclusive in counting pre-mature births as infant mortality whereas a lot of other countries would conclude these were not viable births and thus are not counted in the statistic.')
