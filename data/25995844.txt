The idea is to have a lightweight syntax to record times in plain text, and to be able to run evaluations on the data.<p>I’m happy so far how the basic approach came out, and I’d appreciate some feedback and thoughts (especially on the file format, since that’s the central idea that everything else builds on).<p>For anyone interested, I have also written up some of the backstory behind the project on my blog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jotaen.net&#x2F;9zRPA&#x2F;klog-time-tracking-plain-textfiles&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jotaen.net&#x2F;9zRPA&#x2F;klog-time-tracking-plain-textfi...</a>')
