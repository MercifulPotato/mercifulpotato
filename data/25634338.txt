That means that they prefer engagement that creates a) outrage and b) jokes, rather than engagement that leads to positive change.</i><p><i>In this disregard for actual political success, they reveal their own privilege, as itâ€™s only the privileged who could ever have so little regard for actual, material progress. As long as they are allowed to co-opt the movement for social justice for their own personal aggrandizement, the world will not improve, not for women, people of color, gay and transgender people, or the poor.</i>')
