The 1m doses of pfizer given out so far haven&#x27;t gone to socialites and rich, they&#x27;ve gone to states for sub distribution in a hospital and semi-public regulated health system. They might be private providers, they&#x27;re subject to policy.<p>When AZ arrives in bulk it will be used in Manhattan&#x27;s hospitals unless some politics about IPR intrude, which is not impossible but it has nothing to to with real efficacy or scientific reasoning. It&#x27;s politics and lobbying.')
