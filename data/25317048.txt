It&#x27;s also built around very nice sets of standards[1], which means you don&#x27;t need to use the WebThings Gateway or the WebThings Thing UI. For example there&#x27;s a web based 3D ui using AFrame[2]. to demo it&#x27;s use, there is a fake&#x2F;demo standalone webserver pretending to be a solar roof[3]. Not high production, but being able to hack out a WebThings standard ui or device at a lightning pace is extremely impressive.<p>A lot of folk are well served by the monolith, but long term, having everything bound up in a single technology stack, having to live with every choice Home Assistant has made, is extremely unappealing to me personally.<p>I&#x27;ve started moving my ZWave stuff over to WebThings. I&#x27;d like to add my LiFX equipment too. Previously I had just been using some Node.js scripts I&#x27;d authored myself to control these devices &amp; to record energy consumption. It was a fun project, and I had been doing some kind of similar but not as good decoupling work like WebThings does, but I&#x27;m looking forward to having an API-first means of doing this work, and especially excited to see semantic web &#x2F; jsonld baked in from the start.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iot.mozilla.org&#x2F;wot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iot.mozilla.org&#x2F;wot&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rzr&#x2F;aframe-webthing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rzr&#x2F;aframe-webthing</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rzr&#x2F;aframe-smart-home" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rzr&#x2F;aframe-smart-home</a>')
