Just look at modern plants. Chlorophyll is immensely inefficient because it only filters the green part of light. A tree literally misses out on 80% of the energy provided by the sun. We did have purple photosynthesis for a quite a while but either competition or something else wiped them away minus some remaining bacteria families.<p>Or look at ATP, the power currency of all lifeforms we know off minus virii. Almost all bigger lifeforms converted to mitochondrial production but then you have things like slime mold that doesn&#x27;t for some reason and plants which have both mitochondria and photosynthesis. The entire ATP system is a mess because it has it&#x27;s fingers in every other process. Impossible to optimize because any change just kills the cell. If that is designed, it&#x27;s garbage.')
