Item(by='dkarl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611005202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25826428, text='&gt; Even houses always go over time and money and that is fairly straight forward.<p>This is an incredibly important point.  I was &quot;raised&quot; in commercial software at a time when there was a lot of condescension internally towards ourselves as an industry because we couldn&#x27;t do estimation and planning, and building was the favorite comparison.  A $100 million building couldn&#x27;t run late or over budget.  That would be unimaginable, and it doesn&#x27;t happen because those people are too serious and professional to let it happen, not like us unserious, immature software doofuses.  Turns out that was a complete lie, but at one time it warped the profession, because it made people believe the answers already existed, right around the corner, something you would figure out pretty soon just like last year you didn&#x27;t know regular expressions and now you did.<p>The problem with that was that when somebody walked in with a button-down shirt, oozing confidence and saying they knew exactly how to consistently deliver software on time and bug-free, those people weren&#x27;t laughed out of the room.  Elaborate heavyweight processes, and their &quot;lightweight&quot; (hah!) cousins, could sell themselves as proven, established solutions.  We could believe that bullshit because we had been fed the lie that other industries had conquered these problems.')
