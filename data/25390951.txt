You need to keep the suction side under low pressure otherwise it&#x27;d just stop boiling the refrigerant.<p>&gt;My deep-freezer could have an ultra-chill zone that runs at night.<p>That&#x27;d be making it much less efficient so even if you can get away with some load shifting here you&#x27;d be increasing the load substantially in order to do so. Also this would cause large repeated temperature swings for everything inside, might not be too big of an issue once it&#x27;s already frozen but still, undesireable.<p>&gt;My dryer could run in slow-mode if I turn it on at a dumb time.<p>Your dryer could be replaced by a much more efficient design such as a heat pump dryer or a mechanical steam compression dryer.<p>&gt;My water heater (even a gas one has a 250w powered vent) could ultra-heat during off-peak.<p>Safety devices make this a complete non-starter. A mixing device to lower the output water temperature can fail and probably eventually would fail stuck all the way hot making this a substantial burn hazard. Even ignoring this, all water heaters have a temperature and pressure relief valve and increasing the water temperature to e.g. 200 degrees instead of 140 substantially reduces the safety margin you have between normal operating conditions and catastrophic failure of the tank (a sizeable explosion). Also you&#x27;re not really gaining a lot here, you could just use a standard water heater timer to turn it off during peak hours and rely on storage capacity. Increasing the setpoint from 140 to 210 assuming ambient cold water temperature of 70 degrees only doubles your hot water equivalent capacity. I suspect it would be cheaper to increase the tank size and not have to deal with the more challenging operating conditions. Also, again, a much better solution is just widespread adoption of heat pump water heaters. For most homes you don&#x27;t need the higher output of a resistive water heater and even if you did every heat pump water heater I&#x27;ve seen still comes with resistive heating as well if it can&#x27;t keep up with demand. The decrease in energy bills pays for itself over the lifespan of the appliance.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve always wanted to see a practical combined heating and refrigeration system for a home that could tie in a fridge, HVAC, hot water heater, etc via CO2 refrigerant.')
