Even if I chose to pay for visits upfront and in cash, there were still 3+ month long waiting lists from other providers.<p>I&#x27;ve also learned from friends who have family members with substance abuse issues that there are 6 or more month long waiting lists for even out-patient rehab, and for doctors that specialize in treating substance abuse. Addiction is often deadly, so it&#x27;s pretty urgent to treat.')
