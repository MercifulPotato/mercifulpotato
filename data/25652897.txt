Try speaking with the skip-level manager or higher to see if you get some attention. At the very least, I would ask for days off to compensate for a bad rotation.\nIs fixing root cause prioritized? If you are just adding more alerts and not prioritizing fixing underlying issues, that&#x27;s another red flag. Try to see if you and your team members can get your management to prioritize this. Having a group of people asking for this can be more effective than just one person.\nIf you have enough leverage, push back on new feature work until fixing oncall problems becomes a priority. \nIf all of this fails, leave - there are any number of places where oncall is not as much of a burden and&#x2F;or you are compensated for your time.\nGood luck!')
