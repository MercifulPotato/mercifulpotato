Religious conversion. Ambedkar was a visionary who himself converted out of Hindu religion and gave up his &#x27;caste&#x27;.\nCaste is essentially the same as feudalism, but unlike other regions of the world where feudalism was a societal concept, it became a religious one in India. Buddhism for example is an Indian religion but Buddha was explicitly against the concept of caste-by-birth. Abrahamic religions are also devoid of the concept of caste.<p>So whenever there are any caste issues, it&#x27;s always two Hindus involved. Upper caste hindus don&#x27;t probe the caste of a person if they hear a Christian&#x2F;Muslim&#x2F;Buddhist name because they know that it won&#x27;t exist.<p>Because of how easy it is to give up caste, lower castes have been doing religious conversions in India in large numbers. The so called upper caste , only make up 30% of Hindu population and if all lower castes were to convert then Hinduism would become a minority in India. To prevent this mass exodus, various states of India have been coming up with anti-conversion laws which make it really hard for people to convert. Though I really don&#x27;t understand why lower caste dalits in the US continue to stay Hindu, when they could just change their religion and avoid the whole caste discussion altogether.')
