It is the same content as your virtual mmhmm camera, but it comes across as a presentation, in higher resolution so the other participants can read your slides.<p>It is also very easy to find in apps like Meet when you use the &quot;Present Now&quot; function, because the window title is all-caps &quot;SHARE THIS&quot;. :)<p>(The window doesn&#x27;t appear on the screen, but it does appear in apps that let you present â€” I have tried it with Meet and Zoom.)')
