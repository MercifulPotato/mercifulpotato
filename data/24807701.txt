What I would like to see on top of IndexDB is an SQL database.<p>So you can run SQL queries on the client against your IndexDB storage. SQL is such an awesome language to work with data. No matter which frameworks, languages or libraries become popular or go out of fashion, I am sure I will maintain my SQL queries for decades.')
