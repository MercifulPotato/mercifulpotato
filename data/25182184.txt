Maybe you can elucidate. How can a <i>bicycle</i> cost $3-5K? What&#x27;s in it that costs so much? This is not a US-only phenomenon either, I just checked e.g. UK Bikester store and the prices are pretty nutty there as well. It&#x27;s just a few pieces of metal welded together by robots in China, how can it be $5K?')
