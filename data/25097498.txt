I&#x27;m working hard and taking significant risks. I achieved all my technical goals this year; some which seemed almost impossible, but financially-speaking, I keep getting poorer. The smarter I get, the harder I work, the poorer I get.<p>I&#x27;m at a point where I&#x27;ve identified all the things that are holding me back. I know exactly what&#x27;s going on in the economy and society and so I can make sense of my own situation - But I can&#x27;t think of a way to pull myself out of it without engaging in behavior that I consider unethical.<p>I feel like everyone in society is becoming progressively more selfish over time. It&#x27;s become impossible to make new friends because relationships have become incredibly shallow, financialized and transactional. I don&#x27;t even see the point of making friends anymore because it just feels like everyone is acting. People just don&#x27;t meet my minimum standards to qualify for friendship these days.')
