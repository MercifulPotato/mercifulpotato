I grew up in a village and people often plant them in their yard. Imagine seeing a 2 meters stalk filled to the brim with bananas. There were also this wild bananas with red fruits as big as forearm with seeds as big as bb pellets. Too bad they aren&#x27;t sold anywhere, it&#x27;s all cavendish these days.')
