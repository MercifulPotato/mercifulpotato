It allowed everyone in the President&#x27;s orbit to say &quot;See? No collusion&quot;, knowing that the media would amplify it. Everyone who was already inclined to believe the President would rest assured that this whole thing was a Democratic witchhunt. And when the real report came out later they would disregard it.<p>Of course when even the redacted report came out, it had some key differences with the summary that Barr wrote:<p>&quot;The New York Times reported instances in which the Barr letter omitted information and quoted sentence fragments out of context in ways that significantly altered the findings in the report, including:<p>Omission of words and a full sentence that twice suggested there was knowing and complicit behavior between the Trump campaign and Russians that stopped short of direct coordination, which may constitute conspiracy.&quot;[2]<p>It wasn&#x27;t just a politically motivated probe. Just because evidence &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; could not be found doesn&#x27;t mean the crime never happened. And it certainly doesn&#x27;t mean looking into it was &quot;pysops&quot; or &quot;political hysteria&quot; or &quot;Trump derangement syndrome&quot;.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mueller_report#Mueller&#x27;s_reaction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mueller_report#Mueller&#x27;s_react...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mueller_report#Redacted_report_findings_compared_to_Barr_letter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mueller_report#Redacted_report...</a>')
