And browsers already disallow or warn against submitting passwords over HTTP, is there a problem to fix there? Browsers disabled old versions of TLS, you don&#x27;t harm anyone by supporting them (except for bit rot of that old code). There are also sites with zealous TLS settings, they support only sha384 cypher suites and nothing else at all.')
