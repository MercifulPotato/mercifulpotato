Item(by='daniel-s', descendants=None, kids=[24838942], score=None, time=1603207360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24838116, text='Your definition places every single company in the world in the category of monopolist and is therefore absurd.<p>Every single company sells a commodity or service different to their competitors.<p>For example, McDonald&#x27;s sells burgers, as do Burger King. It&#x27;s arbitrary (and therefore not something that one could determine rationally) where the line is drawn about what will be considered a product or service. If you want to draw the line at Burger there is no monopoly. If you want to draw he line at Big Mac then McDonald&#x27;s has a 100% monopoly. Is the line Big Mac specifically, burgers, food?<p>No matter the company and what it sells, you will always be able to come up with a definition of their product narrow or wide enough to find that they sell 100% of that thing when you want to.<p>An example: Epic&#x27;s complaints about the app stores. Apple has a monopoly on app stores running on iPhones, but not on mobile devices, not on consumer computer devices, not on computer-based gaming devices, not on entertainment services generally. They could never stop people playing Fortnite, but you could always call Apple a monopolist if you chose your definition appropriately.<p>Ultimately, the decision is arbitrary and up to the discretion of a bureaucrat. In the absence of a rational method to determine monopolies the decision becomes one of who the bureaucrat decides to shake down.')
