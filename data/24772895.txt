You also have access to lots of nature and hiking within a reasonable drive of the city, but that only works if you have a car or trust a rental company to disinfect thoroughly.<p>The hard bit is the live+work space.  I was incredibly lucky that I moved to a larger place right before the shelter-in-place order hit (from a loft to a condo with walls and doors!), but I know a lot of people who have been working on dining tables and sub-optimal improvised desks for the past seven months.  If you live in a loft-style place with another person, the lack of personal space can really get to you.')
