But I would argue that &quot;gaming&quot; has evolved a little since.  Gamers now also want to stream.  They want to record.  They want alt-tab to a video chat.  They want to play one game while Steam is downloading updates for several others.  Having extra unused cores can be useful in such situations.  There is a use case for threadripper in gaming.<p>There are also a few games (Factorio) where ram limitations can bottleneck before cpu&#x2F;gpu limitations, where Threadripper&#x27;s extra memory channels can really help.')
