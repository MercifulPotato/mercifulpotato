You have to hope you&#x27;re a better fighter, if you&#x27;re not you will be pummeled. The benefit of running is that very quickly you will reach other people, so you don&#x27;t have to run very far. With fighting it could continue for a long time and you might get fatigued before the bully. When I took Taekwondo, my instructor said the best thing to do if you&#x27;re about to get into a fight is run.<p>How many scenarios at school are there were 2 kids are alone and no one can see them or is in earshot? One technique that might be good, is to teach kids who are worried about being bullied that they should try to stay in a group, or within earshot of others, so they can call for help if they get attacked. And to be aware of surroundings and the environment so that they always have an escape route, they don&#x27;t get stuck in a corner. Avoiding being stuck in a corner could also help if you&#x27;re fighting, it gives you more maneuverability. This advice would help weak kids too, not just strong kids.<p>&gt;Incidents without proof generally result in no action from the school due to that lack of proof, so the bully will continue tormenting you.<p>What if you create a diary with times and dates of each incident?<p>Also, what if you can record proof? Start an audio recorder (and inform the bully if you&#x27;re in an all-party consent state).')
