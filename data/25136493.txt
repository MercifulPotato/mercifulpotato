In the normal world, shipping your software internationally is something of a cost (like filing VAT in all the countries). And even though Stripe has made it way easier to do billing, a small company still would need some servers to do updates, customer service, etc. These things have a cost in time, people, and development.<p>For an Epic-sized business these things are somewhat small. These costs go <i>down</i> as a percentage of size, not up. So it&#x27;s almost as if Apple is saying that &quot;bigness&quot; can only happen as a consequence of being on their platform, which I think most people would disagree with.<p>The attractive thing here is that it is now in Apple&#x27;s interest to &quot;grow&quot; a bunch of indie developers into bigger companies.')
