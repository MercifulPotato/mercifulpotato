I enjoyed the theory the most. Trees, Graphs, Algorithmic Complexity and Artificial Intelligence are my deepest interests and I have studied the theory of them in depth. It is just that the way how the knowledge is transferred and especially how it is examined and marked is sadly often not goal orientated. I am happy that I spent a lot of time on my CS education in university, I just see no point in &quot;finishing&quot; it (getting the &quot;special&quot; graduation paper).')
