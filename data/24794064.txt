What I realized today though while reading this story, is that my DNS account is backed by this same GMail account. What if I&#x27;m attacked and someone locks out my DNS account at the same time they take the sort of criminal actions in my account that that would get Google to shut it down? I could lose my domain and all my email forever. I think I&#x27;m moving to Fastmail.')
