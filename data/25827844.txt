I see a lot of people who might <i>think</i> they are, but they&#x27;re not. They don&#x27;t wear their masks properly, or they wear a loose weave cloth bandana or scarf instead of an actual mask. They don&#x27;t actually social distance--for example, I routinely see people in the checkout line at the supermarket not even making use of the 6-feet-apart markings that the store has put on the floor. They don&#x27;t avoid crowds. They don&#x27;t minimize the time they spend in indoor spaces that aren&#x27;t their home.<p>In other words, you don&#x27;t need a hazmat suit to mitigate the risk. But you <i>do</i> need to pay attention to detail and understand what properly following the guidelines actually means.')
