My new understanding, still somewhat shaky (partly because I don&#x27;t have a recent enough version of GHC to play with these):<p>Something passed into a function as a linear argument is considered to be &quot;used&quot; as many times as the result is consumed.  So if we try to use either resulting `DArray` more than once (or forget to use one of them) we will have used the original `DArray` more than once (or forgotten to use it, ... or both).  As you point out, that can&#x27;t be done because we&#x27;re inside the callback (although I&#x27;d followed that bit originally).<p>And that&#x27;s why we have `Unrestricted` - for returning results we can reuse (or needn&#x27;t use) while still consuming the arguments exactly once.')
