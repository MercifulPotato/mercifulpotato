The i3 API is really easy to hack on as well, which makes creating a specialized workflow really easy. I was working on a project that was hosted on AWS + k8s and had 3 different enviorments: dev&#x2F;uat&#x2F;prod. I added a tiny script in my .zshrc that would check the workspace name on startup and automatically configure kubectl and a bunch of other things to match the workspace name. So every terminal I opened in that workspace was automatically configured for that enviorment.<p>That was fine for one project, but I had to maintain a fair few projects so I ended up having to create groups of workspaces. I used this patch: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;woodensquares&#x2F;c1afc4fb56b4d9d21fa261fb4b28b092" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;woodensquares&#x2F;c1afc4fb56b4d9d21fa261...</a> that lets you hide workspaces from the bar if the ended with a prefix(I used _boop because I&#x27;m a child). So then all workspaces names become &lt;group_num&gt;&lt;ws_num&gt;:&lt;name&gt;_boop apart from the active group, which is just &lt;ws_num&gt;:&lt;name&gt;. If you are in group 1 and switch to group 3, 1:dev would get renamed to 11:dev_boop and 31:name_boop would get renamed to 1:name and get automatically selected.<p>I also have a &quot;scratch&quot; workspace that is always visible regardless of group, I called it &quot;i&quot;. Since it doesn&#x27;t start with a number, it doesn&#x27;t get affected by the workspace groups script and is always visible. I usually just stick irc there and my music player so I can access it regardless of which group&#x2F;project I am working on.<p>I&#x27;m still waiting for this proposal to go through: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;i3&#x2F;i3&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3818" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;i3&#x2F;i3&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3818</a> so that I don&#x27;t need to use a custom build of i3.<p>I hacked it all together in one afternoon and it&#x27;s been working ever since. Before this I really struggled to context switch between all the different projects I was working on&#x2F;supporting. This made it much more managable and got me a bunch of praise for how quickly I can fix problems&#x2F;answer questions. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to do my job without this setup anymore.')
