You play against world class defenders and goalkeepers.  It&#x27;s exhausting because you have to play your top game, every time.<p>Now, one day you decide to try out goalkeeper.  You get to face world class competition because of your status as a striker.<p>Two possible results:<p>1. You get discouraged and don&#x27;t play the off positions.  You only maximize.  Maybe you get burned out because you never relax.<p>2. You do switch back and forth between things you are good&#x2F;not good at.  Your skill averages out and you play easy matches where you carry your team, alternated with impossible matches where you drag your team down.<p>I know a lot of pros will have secondary accounts for things like this.  Sometimes it gets viewed as sandbagging (and sometimes it is).')
