At that point if you are the first person at that price level you will be first in line when someone tries to sell at $9.98. Otherwise you will be last in line even if the person in front of you put their order in by mail a month ago.<p>Respectfully that you need these concepts explained to you means you don’t know even the basics of how this works so holding a vehement position on it is a bad look.<p>It’s akin to someone hearing that udp is a lossy protocol and railing about it existing at all.')
