Been using my Thinkpad W510 with i3 non-stop since 2010 and it&#x27;s still working like a charm. For the past months, though, I&#x27;ve had to use a Dell XPS 13 for work. Now that I&#x27;ve equipped it with i3, as well, it&#x27;s merely using 3.5W while I&#x27;m doing ordinary computer work and some coding, meaning that I can get 15 hours of battery life <i>easily</i>, and often even 20h. Absolutely mind-blowing.')
