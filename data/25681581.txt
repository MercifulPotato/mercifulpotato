Interrupting a political process is not a coup. Protesting an election result is not a coup. Trespassing in the Capital building is not a coup. Posing for selfies and stealing Peliso’s lecturn is not a coup. And doing all 4 of these things at once is not a coup.<p>What it is? Mostly? <i>Just extremely embarrassing</i> for the people in power and the people who were supposed to protect them.<p>Calling it a coup mostly just covers for the raging embarrassment of being owned by Half Naked Viking Man.')
