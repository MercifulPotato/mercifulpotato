It looks at space in isolation rather than space time as a whole, and provides no intuition as to why objects traveling at different speeds follow different trajectories.<p>FWIW I think that in general it is better to just teach people that gravity is an acceleration in classical spacetime (as opposed to a force or curvature). It is simply too hard to create intuition for laymen around minkowskian spacetime, and even harder for curved minkowskian spacetime.')
