The new iPhones have been so underwhelming and so highly priced that I haven&#x27;t felt the need or want to upgrade.<p>Now previously this year, I dropped my phone and the glass broke - but it still works. So I am on the verge of upgrading, but iPhone 12 still doesn&#x27;t really... make me want to upgrade - if I can put it like that.<p>So I am rolling with a cracked screen iPhone 6S+ until I can find the motivation to upgrade. Maybe my battery life is becoming one and the problem with charging.')
