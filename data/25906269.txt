When a candidate declares in advance of an election that he can only lose if there is fraud, you can be sure he will act in bad faith if he loses.<p>Incredulity was all he needed to claim fraud - the numerous conspiracy theories explaining the fraud would inevitably surface after the fact. If it&#x27;s not Dominion voting machines, it&#x27;s dead voters, boxes of ballots showing up, and hand wavy claims of the opposition being in charge of the counting and abusing that role.')
