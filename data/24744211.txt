I set out with the intention of getting into the habit of being creative instead of consuming only to realize I Was putting myself under more pressure.<p>I have to say though that simply doodling on a Synth and enjoying the sounds, playing an instrument without trying to make a song, can be very relaxing and satisfying. Especially when you are a beginner at it. Otherwise you might be trying too hard to create something meaningful, destroying the pleasure in the process.<p>So my advice would be not to attempt to create, but to simply indulge in the act and enjoy the flow.')
