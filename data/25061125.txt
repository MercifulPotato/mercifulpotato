What a disappointment.<p>I started saving my photos with Google for two reasons:\n- I’m an iPhone user and didn’t want a single company to have access to all my assets,\n- it was free and this compensated for the discomfort of using a non-native app.<p>Without the second argument it makes total sense to look at other, more privacy-oriented providers. Since Apple tries to rebrand itself this way, I would expect more former customers to go there.')
