These improvements you see on Linux have been over 8 years in the works, Stadia has only been around for a year.<p>I would also assume that by getting devs to port their games to Linux to run on Stadia, the contribution may be more indirect. You&#x27;ll get more game studios contributing to the stack, even if Stadia themselves aren&#x27;t yet.')
