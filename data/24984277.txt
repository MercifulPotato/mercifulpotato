It&#x27;s about forbidding breaking DRM, which can have cases that have nothing to do with copyright (i.e nothing is infringed by breaking it).<p>So whatever was authorized for copyright, can&#x27;t just automatically legitimize DMCA 1201 which is an overreaching prohibition (which is ironic, since what makes DRM itself unethical is that it&#x27;s an overreaching preemptive policing).<p>If DMCA 1201 just forbade breaking DRM for copyright infringement, then it could be different. But it&#x27;s not doing that, so it has to be repealed.<p><i>&gt; the WIPO Copyright Treaty&#x27;s undemocratic negotiation process is immaterial to constitutional questions.</i><p>This is important for showing the corrupt nature of both DRM proponents and policy around DRM. It is undemocratic to use treaties as a backdoor to control legislative process. It&#x27;s simply corruption. And if it&#x27;s the nature of treaties to be undemocratic, then there should be even a stronger to push against using them to subvert legislation.')
