Maybe I have a selective memory, but I&#x27;m remembering threads from those couple years before and after Susan Fowler and Uber&#x27;s culture implosion. It felt like there was a shift in how the whole industry felt about brilliant assholes around then (thank god).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18000698" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18000698</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18083859" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18083859</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16508921" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16508921</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8415603" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8415603</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2372096" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2372096</a><p>I think the threads in articles specifically about Linus are better comparisons to this, rather than articles about computing that involve him. But, hey, folk like Torvalds and Gebru both really rub me the wrong way, so it&#x27;s reasonable that I might be selectively remembering threads where HN said I&#x27;m right and that he&#x27;s an asshole (and I did a lazy googling of &quot;linus torvalds asshole site:news.ycombinator.com&quot; which is biased too), so who knows.')
