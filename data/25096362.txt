But thinking in terms of pages seems like a very useful abstraction to me. I can&#x27;t keep the whole application state in my head at once, so I want to be able to look at a small part of the app and know that I don&#x27;t need to think about anything else right now. (It maybe won&#x27;t be &quot;literally just this page&quot;, but &quot;this page plus a small number of well defined mechanisms for bringing data in and out of it&quot;.) I wouldn&#x27;t want to give that up, and I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d split the state if not by page (or at least something similar, like &quot;groups of closely related pages&quot;).<p>If my model logic is happy to be modified by any page, and if there&#x27;s a bug in my model logic, then I have no idea where to look.')
