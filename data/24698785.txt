I&#x27;d argue most bugs are there because the cost of a bug is less than the cost of developer time it&#x27;s take to prevent such bugs. There are industries where the cost of a bug is very high, but mostly bugs are like unemploymency rates: it&#x27;s almost never economically feasible to get them down to zero.')
