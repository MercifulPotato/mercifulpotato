It&#x27;s just human nature. I come from a third world country where bribery and corruption is a way of life and everyone just accepts it. When I moved to the US I thought that problem doesn&#x27;t exist since it&#x27;s a developed country and things seem to function smoothly. It took me a few years to realize how mistaken I was. Corruption and bribery just happen in a more &quot;legal&quot; (ex: lobbying), &quot;organized&quot; and &quot;clean&quot; manner :)')
