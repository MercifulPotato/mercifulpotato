The grid is sized for peak loads - that moment between 5 and 7 when everyone in the city gets home, turns the heating on and starts cooking.<p>That means rolling out demand response charging - not technically hard, but absolutely necessary before electric cars are too ubiquitous. We&#x27;ll probably also find that in normal use most cars don&#x27;t drive much on a given day, so they&#x27;re not needing to draw full power all night to charge.<p>The charging infrastructure for those without a driveway is still a big question (one to which the answer isn&#x27;t lampposts - there&#x27;s at least a 7:1 ratio of cars to lampposts where I live).')
