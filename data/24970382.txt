Item(by='modeless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604336930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969011, text='&gt; You&#x27;re going to need to explain this one.<p>The porting effort for a native app using 3D graphics APIs to run on all platforms is simply enormous, and completely out of the question for small demos like this one or really anything but the most profitable apps (and even many of those choose to use Unity or another cross platform framework rather than bear the cost themselves). Not only do the platforms differ in their supported APIs, they all have different bugs and quirks. In contrast, it is trivial to write a WebGL app with no framework and run it on practically any platform. Compatibility is dramatically higher.<p>&gt; A 20mb app takes the same amount of time to download whether it&#x27;s a zip file or a WebGL app<p>This is demonstrably false if you count the time that matters, which is time from intent to use the app to actually using the app. Just time installing and launching a 20mb app from the Play Store or iOS app store or Steam or even plain zip file (though in reality most apps require an installer) vs. loading a 20 MB web page. Also count the number of clicks required, and as a bonus count the permissions you need to feel comfortable granting for the app to run. It&#x27;s partially technical and partially due to platform conventions, but the difference is not small.<p>&gt; you can&#x27;t run a WebGL app on any (non-jailbroken) game console<p>This is false. Xbox supports WebGL. So does Oculus Quest. You are right that PlayStation and Switch don&#x27;t though, I was wrong about that (though PlayStation does use WebGL internally, and Switch has a webview that supports WebGL, just not a user accessible browser app). Yes, Tesla&#x27;s web browser supports WebGL, as do Samsung and LG and Sony smart TVs and fridges and tons of other similar devices.')
