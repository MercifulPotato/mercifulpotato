Since that project I&#x27;ve built a gate, a few planter boxes, fence repairs, a table with the scrap wood and a few other minor things.  Enjoyment aside, my cost savings including the value of my vocational time would be reason enough but like you said I have specific cases that can&#x27;t be bought off a shelf.  \nIt is also difficult to get skilled labour to perform small jobs where I live so it is almost a necessity at this time.')
