There are two errors that the tails need to deal with, voter shifts that are missed by polling and black swan events that completely upend the table.  I think that the 528 model lumps a lot of the long tail into the second category, which then basically becomes a &quot;let&#x27;s throw out most of the rules and make wild guesses&quot; territory.  There is so little worthwhile information in those tails I am really surprised that this is the focus of the disagreement.')
