However I have some random ideas :<p>- there is a lot of work to be done, and balanced coder can be considered as taking a place of a full-time coder<p>- companies when cooperating talk about full time equivalent. So it may be hard for some of such companies to change contracts with their clients to include balanced time equivalent<p>- some cultures promote quantity over quality. It means the aim is to onboard as many devs as possible to gain more profits. Because they earn per hour of work not per project<p>- some projects are poorly managed, so every dev has to be available all the time to be able to get all info needed and also share info with other devs<p>So this is my guess. But I think the idea is great and in many ways beneficial. I&#x27;d market it as a way to hire 10x developers who do more in 4 days than others in a month. That it is a great platform to seek for such developers who care deeply about their life balance. Also, maybe startups would be better to adopt to the concept.')
