Suppose someone owns you a certain amount of gold according to an agreement, but it turns out they can&#x27;t actually deliver the gold. Then there&#x27;s no point in refusing a settlement in legal tender and taking that person to court, because the court will then value the debt in legal tender and force you to accept the legal tender anyway.')
