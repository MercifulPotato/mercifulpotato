We&#x27;ve historically had a lot of CPUs or multi-cpu machines that were good for running &quot;embarassingly parallel&quot; loads but wasted capacity for general purpouse use, a bit like this one! More hw threads or cores has traditionally not been good news from software POV.<p>This kind of machine is nice to look at from afar but for most apps trying to get anywhere near a 64 fold speedup on your application on this would mean scrapping the code base and doing 1 failed rewrite, followed by 1 marginally successful one, taking up ruinous amounts of calendar time and engineering resources.<p>But of course it&#x27;s diferent now than in 2005, because today we can&#x27;t do any better.')
