It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen on TV.<p>It is true that these tend to be shorter and more focused presentations than series like Connections. I&#x27;m not sure I see anything inherently wrong with that. It&#x27;s also true that they don&#x27;t score always hit it out of the park for every &quot;episode&quot; they produce (unlike much the more collaborative processes that would have led to each episode of Connections). But I&#x27;m not sure I see much a problem with that either.')
