With the goal to document everything you can see in a repo so beginners can understand and catch up with structure, conventions and understand algorithms and common problems IRL. Imperfections and errors are part of the game and need to be explained as well, and because of that infrequent snapshots are sufficient.<p>Something to overcome tutorial hell and lower the threshold for participation in FOSS projects.')
