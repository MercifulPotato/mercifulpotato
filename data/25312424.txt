Yes, i agree with the <i>most</i> crime being like this, and especially almost all or maybe all violent crime, but quite some crime is completely rational. I would commit a crime if it provided a clear benefit outweighing the risks, it&#x27;s OK to do - it&#x27;s government&#x27;s job to organise laws and enforcement system in a way the set of &quot;rational&quot; committable crimes is minimised.')
