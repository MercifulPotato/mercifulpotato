How many other perf tests did they throw away before taking this one because it showed so well? I guess we&#x27;ll see the real-world benchmarks when people get their hands on them.<p>Geekbench is not a _great_ benchmark, but it&#x27;s common enough that we could use it to roughly compare.<p>EDIT: Apparently there are Geekbench results that are unofficial that suggest it&#x27;s faster than current MBPs, but we&#x27;ll have to see.')
