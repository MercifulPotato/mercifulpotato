So its hard to see how this would &quot;blunt&quot; 1201 at all.<p>The recent high-profile situations have blurred the lines between the takedown provisions and the anticircumvention ones, especially as they just get listed in a &quot;dmca&quot; repository on Github, and the post even mentions this in the case of the Widevine takedowns, but the little technicalities do in fact matter here.')
