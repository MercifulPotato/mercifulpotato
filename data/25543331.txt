For example, a state dropping bombs on a civilian population (<i>nation-state, war-crime</i>) satisfies the above requirement but doing the same to enemy soldiers (<i>nation-state, warfare</i>) does not. Same with a private group blowing up a bank (<i>ngo, crime</i>).<p>b: tuple <i>(target, reacting-agency)</i><p>Goal is to use terror in the target to induce the reacting-agency in responding in a desired manner. If there is no reacting-agency (and thus no goal) it is not terrorism; it is merely pathological.')
