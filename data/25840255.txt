They&#x27;re different.<p>Good child labor: When I was in high school, I had a (slightly illegal) job programming. It was awesome! (My employer, as a footnote, didn&#x27;t want to break laws, and was not exploitative in any way; but circumstances were complex). I&#x27;m firmly convinced we&#x27;d all be better off if kids started having at least part-time jobs in middle school.<p>&quot;Good&quot; child labor: Yes, families in very poor countries need kids to work to eat food. Kids work in the fields. It&#x27;s necessary. In India, I saw kids making stone statues for export. It was how families were able to put food on the table. I wouldn&#x27;t call it good, but it was definitely better than the alternative (which I also saw). It&#x27;s a rapidly shrinking portion of the world. People often don&#x27;t realize how far we&#x27;ve come towards eliminating abject poverty, but it still exists. And with abject poverty, everyone works. It&#x27;s a solvable problem, and it&#x27;s being solved, but it has not yet been solved. Work is also often better than no-school in parts of the world where access to education is limited.<p>Bad child labor: Forced. Slavery. Sweatshops. Etc. Most anything involving a factory.<p>So, yes, we are too quick to judge. On the other hand, I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re too quick to judge Apple.')
