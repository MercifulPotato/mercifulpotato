I found this video incredibly illuminating on that point (I honestly thought we were still under the limit before watching it, not way past it already):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qPb_0JZ6-Rc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qPb_0JZ6-Rc</a><p>Extinction may be a bit extreme, humans might be able to survive somehow, but the vast majority will not.<p>Here&#x27;s one article that discusses the possibility of human extinction. Key quote: &quot;I don’t want to claim that we can’t survive the loss of many, many species. We’ve already proved that we actually can. We’re very adaptable.
