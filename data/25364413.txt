So I went to explain the issue to the department head because he was the owner of the application. (As an ASC I answer to, and represent, the security division so I can talk to the owners of apps that I support regardless of the hierarchy) I didn&#x27;t go to complain. I went to explain the problem and give him options and my recommendation.<p>He told me that we have a real-time backup system so he didn&#x27;t think it was worth fixing. I then asked if we ever ran tests of that system and if we had documentation on how to restore from it. We don&#x27;t. This is for financial trading application handling billions of dollars. Being down for even a few hours could be catastrophic.<p>The big man spoke. I don&#x27;t agree with the outcome, but I&#x27;m not the boss. So that was the end of it (except for in discussions like this on here). I left for another team because there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to be the security champion for a system with that level of risk. And thank God you weren&#x27;t my manager or I would have been fired under your #2 scenario.<p>On a side note, just because a small number of people are complaining doesn&#x27;t mean their opinions are invalid. Minorities are often disenfranchised due to this thinking.')
