Item(by='giantg2', descendants=None, kids=[25365201], score=None, time=1607545971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363625, text='My specific instance was that I was the application security champion for a critical application application that had a SQL injection vulnerability (with full schema owner privileges!), but lower-level management wasn&#x27;t making it a priority and didn&#x27;t even assign any resources to remediate the issue. So I went to explain the issue to the department head because he was the owner of the application. As an ASC I answer to, and represent, the security division so I can talk to the owners of apps that I support regardless of the hierarchy. I think he didn&#x27;t understand that dynamic, as I typically see managers breaking company policy and not caring (I&#x27;m smart enough to keep my mouth shut on those issues). I didn&#x27;t go to complain. I went to explain the problem and give him options and my recommendation.<p>He told me that we have a real-time backup system so he didn&#x27;t think it was worth fixing. I then asked if we ever ran tests of that system and if we had documentation on how to restore from it. We don&#x27;t. This is for financial trading application handling billions of dollars. Being down for even a few hours could be catastrophic.<p>The big man spoke. I don&#x27;t agree with the outcome, but I&#x27;m not the boss. So that was the end of it (except for in discussions like this on here). I left for another team because there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to be the security champion for a system with that level of risk. And thank God you weren&#x27;t my manager or I would have been fired under your #2 scenario.<p>On a side note, just because a small number of people are complaining doesn&#x27;t mean their opinions are invalid. Minorities are often disenfranchised due to this thinking. Also, managers may not know all the policies for the company and may be violating them.<p>For a real life example combining these, company policy states that a person be evaluated against the standard and recieve a rating that way. Some departments mandate that if a manager pick a higher than average rating for someone, then they must pick someone else to balance it out with a lower rating. This would only affect 10% of the population and the number unjustly affected would be lower than that. So the other 90% recieved good rating, so why would they complain? The objective way I know that I was unjustly rated was because I had a manager friend who told me what happened in the meeting and said it was wrong.')
