Item(by='chopin24', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611620333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910440, text='Thanks for the recommendation on The Transparent Society. I haven&#x27;t read it, but certainly will.<p>The idea that the surveillance tools are &quot;put in the hands of masses&quot; neglects the part where the &quot;masses&quot; includes corporations that do it better, because they have the ability to pay handsomely thousands of people to make it effective. So rather than accept the defeatist position -- &quot;We are powerless to stop technology,&quot; even though surveillance capitalism is a choice, and one that we don&#x27;t have to accept -- we can choose meaningful laws which restrict those actions. We can choose meaningful laws which change the economic imperatives so that corporations don&#x27;t profit from tracking and shaping human behavior. Will it be perfect? Absolutely not. Is defeat inevitable? Perhaps. But sitting on the sidelines and <i>choosing not to shape that future</i> because of some sense of foregone inevitability.... that cannot be the future, unless we believe that those now with the ability to shape it (and someone will -- Google, Facebook, or someone else) deserve to have that right without being challenged.<p>I cannot accept that. I will not be gaslit into believing that I&#x27;m &#x27;too concerned&#x27; or &#x27;reading too much into it&#x27;. This does not have to be our future.')
