They are under no obligation to determine the source&#x27;s motive. And they are free to coordinate with a political campaign, they have the freedom of assembly as well as of the press.<p>The Roger Stone indictment was for obstruction of an official proceeding, false statements, and witness tampering. His discussions about Wikileaks weren&#x27;t illegal, lying about them was.<p>&gt;Speculation no one can answer, ignored.<p>What? You&#x27;re the one claiming the DNC leaks prove they are a Russian agent. I don&#x27;t agree, but I understand that argument. Then stretching it to include &quot;Assange&#x27;s official relationship with Russian military intelligence years before he hid in the Ecuadorian embassy&quot; makes no sense to me.<p>&gt;. If you suspect someone of espionage and they are already sitting in prison of sex crime charges, you have no reason to expose the methods and sources you used to catch said person.<p>I am listening to what you are saying, selective enforcement of laws absolutely violates your right to a fair trial. Without exposing their methods,  we have no idea of those methods were constitutionally sound. They may not have any reason that benefits themselves, but I don&#x27;t care.<p>Further, Snowden isn&#x27;t behind bars. Why didn&#x27;t they expose their methods and prevent him leaving Hong Kong rather than block his passport while layovered in Russia?<p>&gt;Funny, both Assange and Snowden fled their respective &quot;fair trails&quot; to hide from justice.<p>As Assange&#x27;s extradition hearing and the numerous whistleblower trials over the past fifty years have shown, they had no expectation of a fair trial. Quoting Daniel Ellsberg about his case<p>&gt;(my) lawyer, exasperated, said he &#x27;had never heard of a case where a defendant was not permitted to tell the jury why he did what he did.&#x27; The judge responded: &#x27;Well, you&#x27;re hearing one now&#x27;. And so it has been with every subsequent whistleblower under indictment.')
