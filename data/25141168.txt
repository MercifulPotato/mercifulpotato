I&#x27;m a little confused on how this is different from a college with a co-op programme (at least in that, students get paid) - and moreover I genuinely am a bit turned off by the fact that the &quot;fellowship&quot; is unpaid. That really kind of makes no sense to me - it&#x27;s emphasised elsewhere on this thread by Lambda staff that the fellows will be able to contribute to the company. However, they are not being paid. Like, I&#x27;m unable to wrap my head around this - it&#x27;s a fundamental rule of economics - you render a service for someone and you get paid in return..')
