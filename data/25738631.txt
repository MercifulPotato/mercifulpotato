If you&#x27;re not a multihomed AS, you can&#x27;t even begin to offer what Cloudflare offers.<p>&gt; But, the more of your stack you have under your exclusive physical control the better.<p>Where&#x27;s the cutoff? Lay your own fiber to your own datacenters? At some point economy dictates that you rent. And with Parler, I&#x27;d assume that that point comes sooner than later. I mean I don&#x27;t know their funding situation, but I find it reasonable to assume that if they&#x27;d built a NOC first they wouldn&#x27;t have gotten off the ground at all.')
