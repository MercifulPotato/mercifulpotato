But the Romans got their maths from the Greeks, who got much of theirs from the Egyptians and Mesopotamians.<p>Zero, with &quot;Arabic&quot; numbering, certainly originated in Northern India. Was it &quot;Hindu&quot;? The people credited with inventing it certainly were. But they may have learned much from the Harappans, whose work is today wholly unknown.<p>Persians and Egyptians, many of them Muslim, created a great deal of new mathematics, building upon older works. They also  invented, in all its details, what we now call science. It was introduced to Europe on the back of a book, Optics, by Al-Haytham. The earliest European scientists freely admitted their debt to him.<p>Appreciation for higher learning in the medieval Islamic world was no more universal than in Renaissance Europe, or in our modern world, but it was honored in pockets, for just barely enough centuries to catch on in similarly restricted pockets of Europe.<p>Is modern science Christian? Not if you believe many Christians. But many of the people who built science atop translations from Arabic were very seriously Christian.<p>Higher learning is always anomalous wherever it blossoms, and always treated with suspicion by many in both church and government everywhere. It doesn&#x27;t belong to any culture or people. We can honor anyone, anywhere, who fostered it, whatever their ancestors&#x27; or descendents&#x27; failings.')
