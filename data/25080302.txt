This speeds up rendering a lot but also means rendering caustics will need a huge amount of samples because the probability of seeing light from a camera through glass is very low. Bi-directional path tracing fixes some of these problems.<p>So it can be done but always at a cost (rendering times).<p>In Blender I have done this a couple of times and even used different IORs for the RGB colors to get real world results.')
