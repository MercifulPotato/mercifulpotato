It&#x27;s a function of the kernel, which needs to know the binary format in order to load the executable. The dynamic linker is invoked at a later phase of execution, and in the case of the ELF file it does that by reading the dynamic linker&#x27;s name from the PT_INTERP entry in the Dynamic table stored in the PT_DYNAMIC segment. By default, if the kernel doesn&#x27;t recognize the ELF magic (first 4 bytes in the file are `\\0x7fELF`), or can&#x27;t load the dynamic linker specified in the PT_INTERP entry (eg. wrong architecture), it will launch &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh as the interpreter and feed the loaded file to it assuming it&#x27;s a text file containing a shell script.<p>If the kernel has the bin_fmt mod loaded, it can also recognize other binary formats before falling back to &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh.')
