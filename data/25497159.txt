Nothing fuzzy.</i><p>It is a rule engine, with fuzzy rules.<p>The advantage is that it&#x27;s easy to express vague rules in a clear way: &quot;if the rice is too hot, stop the heater&quot;, vs &quot;if sensor a &gt; 0.44 and sensor b &lt; 3.19 and sensor c &gt;=  0.33 ...&quot;.<p>It disentangles the rules operating on linguistic variables from the functions which express those values.')
