Perhaps in our genes to <i>forever</i> feel cast out of the garden of eden and strive to get back there.<p>Happiness is an internal state without an objective measure. Worse we don&#x27;t know what makes us happy. Too little wealth ==&gt; unhappy. Too much wealth ==&gt; unhappy (maybe) but don&#x27;t see many giving it up.<p>I think I would be miserable without the internet, social media but I am happiest chopping vegetables and washing dishes. Maybe we all just need to go and wash some dishes.')
