The stations were definitely in the not so great parts of town. If you were there after dark, it just did not feel safe.<p>Of course, you rode it because it was cheap vs. your other options. Eventually, I got wise to the slightly pricier competitor in the area and started using that. I have to admit that now I would not bat an eye at spending the extra $25 on the ride, but back then it felt like a luxury.')
