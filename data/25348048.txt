I&#x27;ve read countless threads on HN and that seems to always be the final lesson. There are lower risk but less &quot;idealistic&quot; licenses such as Apache, and higher risk but also ideal licenses such as GPL.<p>Especially relevant to GPL, it ends up being counterproductive, as the license is a hardcore protection of <i>the users&#x27; rights</i>, at the expense of the project owner&#x27;s rights. See the debate caused by Octotree [1], [2].<p>It&#x27;s a pity because the way I see it, GPL is the ideal way to go. But if you need to pay the bills with software you write, it is also one of the worst open source choices out there.<p>(A)GPL is then relegated to either 100% vocational non-commercial code that one writes as a side project, or to big entities that for some reason write GPL code that is not part of their main business.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;slides.com&#x2F;adamretter&#x2F;are-we-still-open-source" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;slides.com&#x2F;adamretter&#x2F;are-we-still-open-source</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24953821" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24953821</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;christianbundy&#x2F;octotree&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;christianbundy&#x2F;octotree&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1</a>')
