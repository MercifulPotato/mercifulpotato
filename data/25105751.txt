Look at Ukraine, for example: majority of its population lives under what in the US would count as harsh poverty. Average wage outside of Kiev is around $2500 a year (a year, not a month), and even if you adjust it for purchasing power, it still buys you less than $10k does in US. And that’s <i>average</i>: most people survive on less than that, some even on half that.<p>However, crime in Ukraine is lower than in US, and it’s <i>significantly</i> lower than in US cities. While its infrastructure’s state reflects the income levels, it’s not atrocious, and it’s certainly better than what US would end up with if it was only spending figures comparable to Ukraine. Certainly, you don’t have rotting garbage piling up everywhere on the sides of the street, like in the OP photos.<p>It’s not poverty that results in what happens in Gypsy ghettos. It’s the culture.')
