For a list (2, 4, 6), the function is applied to the first number and the &quot;inverse&quot; function (though it&#x27;s really not) on the last number of the list, with an argument of b=2. I must be missing something in the argument -- I&#x27;m wondering, why the choice of b=2? And was the function not applied to the number 4?<p>Edit:<p>I believe the author was trying to show (albeit incorrectly) the generalization of an arithmetic mean using f(x) = ax + b, with a = 1 and b = 2 (not f(a,b) as stated; plus the inverse function was applied incorrectly at the element level). The f-mean (Mf) is defined as:<p>Mf(x₁,...,xₙ) = f⁻¹( (1&#x2F;n) ∑ₖⁿ f(xₖ) )<p>where the function f is injective and continuous. Different choices of f result in different means. This wikipedia article provides relevant details on the f-mean.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quasi-arithmetic_mean" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quasi-arithmetic_mean</a>')
