Always 3rd (or worse) level references  because the source material wasn&#x27;t clickbaity enough. Often shared with comments like &quot;not sure if this is true but it really makes you think&quot; or other ways of feigning ignorance about what was just said while still saying it.<p>Isn&#x27;t there anything good being done by any leaders worth sharing instead of how one found a year old article or tweet that they managed to turn into a &quot;hot take&quot; comment? Or progress on actual efforts instead? Is this thought the real silent majority or is all anyone&#x27;s ever interesting in shitting on whatever &lt;other guy&gt; says?')
