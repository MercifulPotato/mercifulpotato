Item(by='z2', descendants=None, kids=[24767043], score=None, time=1602605268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24766333, text='I totally agree with this analogy, though maybe to add some nuance (or pedantry), I&#x27;d claim that to start learning Chinese, you need to pick a modern dialect (probably Mandarin), which is like choosing Spanish over Portuguese or Catalan. Then, learning Japanese or Korean (or Vietnamese) is like learning a nearby but non-Romance language that was heavily influenced by Latin or Romance languages, like English. Knowing Spanish will let you appreciate the similarities with English, but you&#x27;d still need to delve into historical Spanish (or French) to really see the connections.<p>Chinese is a pretty old and continuous language, so at the advanced level, learners could delve into Classical Chinese, which is truly analogous to Latin, and was also a dominant lingua franca in written form across East Asia. Pieces of Classical Chinese are &#x27;alive&#x27; in everyday use, kind of like how Latin is &#x27;alive&#x27; in the Romance languages through general and obvious similarities, or specific vocabulary, (e.g. &quot;quid pro quo&quot;, &quot;ad hominem&quot;). But Classical Chinese is radically different from any dialect of today&#x27;s vernacular Chinese.<p>In any case, the similarities and overlap definitely make learning between CJK(V) easier!')
