We&#x27;re always baffled at the neuroticism of America&#x27;s obsession with identity politics and tribalism, especially as it relates to race and culture.<p>In my country for example we have six distinct races&#x2F;ethnicities, from indigenous to post-colonial. When either has a celebration or period of cultural remembrance, we openly dress, cook, and celebrate in the same manner. The concept of &quot;cultural appropriation&quot; is nothing but hubris in our minds.<p>Perhaps we&#x27;re more fundamentally bonded due to our shared &quot;fragmented&quot; heritage, as V.S. Naipaul frequently expounded upon. Perhaps we&#x27;re just not victims of inept ideological monoliths that are perpetrated by a radical left and radical right as it is in the US (along with the forced illusion of binary if not zero-sum choices).<p>Either way, we understand that racism is inescapable in some small measure but we try our best not to elevate it above reason and certainly not above national unity (or pride for that matter). Caribbean people are both welcoming of foreign cultures and curious in our exploration of the same. We wouldn&#x27;t, couldn&#x27;t, have it any other way.')
