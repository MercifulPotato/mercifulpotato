We have something to talk about.<p>What these studies show, is that given a set of pictures with faces removed, college age women will point to the pictures of guys who go to the gym when asked to say which one is more attractive to them.<p>Sure, I can get behind that.  As a bisexual male, I also kind of get it.  People who are in shape are sexier, duh.<p>Without even digging into the pitiful sample sizes (n=61, n=131) or the fact that these studies were conducted on an <i>incredibly</i> limited and not at all random subset of the population (college age, at <i>one particular college</i>).  The conclusions this article comes to and the ones that you have come to are fundamentally different.<p>This paper is drawing conclusions about specific, visual sexual attractiveness, fixed for all other concerns - ceterus parabus, if you will.  It <i>assumes</i> that all other things are equal.<p>The conclusions you have so quickly come to, are based on the assertion that all other things <i>are</i> equal.  They are not.  There is a complex system of other sociological cues and interpersonal relationships that signal whether you do or don&#x27;t want to be with someone.<p>Think of all the other things you, as a male, might find sexy about someone.  Are they into video games?  Do they like the same music as you?  Are they successful in business &#x2F; art &#x2F; a particular &#x27;scene&#x27;?  Are they <i>smart</i>?  Are they bold?  Are they funny?<p>What you have done, in essence, is to assume that <i>women are simple, and easily understood</i>.  I would argue that this is patently ludicrous.<p>Merry christmas.')
