And this gets to the top of the charts because Apple makes more money from it!<p>These are the instances where the 30% commission (or even the recently announced 15% commission for those earning less than $1M in revenue a year) seems like extortion. Apple really needs to step up on app reviews in terms of false positives (banning legitimate apps for frivolous reasons and reinstating them after social media uproar) and false negatives (allowing scam apps and clones to thrive while hurting the original apps).<p>Hopefully the threats of regulation can’t manifest soon enough for this to get better for the developers and the users.

On the other side of the equation you have two parties making a lot of money for low effort — the crooks and Apple.
