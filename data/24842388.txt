Simply had none.<p>Masks have their place, but they aren&#x27;t &quot;be-all and end-all&quot; of policy. In fact, if all you do is mask, they don&#x27;t work very well. You need to pair them with social distancing and other measures.<p>At the time we locked-down though, most public health agencies, including WHO, was not recommending masking for the public. We locked down because we didn&#x27;t know how bad the virus was. Numbers like 3-5% infection mortality rate were being thrown around (which was scary). It wasn&#x27;t because of lack of PPE.')
