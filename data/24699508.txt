While true that tests can be wrong. It is unlikely that 100% of the people I know who have had it hav had negative tests. I personally don&#x27;t know anyone who&#x27;s had it and had a positive test. I know 2-3 that claim they&#x27;ve had it but test negative. Again this is extremely unlikely. We are in denial that other infectious diseases are scary and that it&#x27;s not just covid.')
