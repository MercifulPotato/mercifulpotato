Making use safe and reducing its stigma makes people safer when they do use. It doesn’t increase use or attract new users. Drugs aren’t an app, they don’t need to attract an audience. The audience is already there. The actual facts show that making use safe is key to making the drug that exists either way socially safe, by making recovery a personal process not a public justification of existence process.')
