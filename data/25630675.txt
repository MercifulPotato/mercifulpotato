They make sure that shareholders and employees get input into the highest levels of leadership, ensuring that shareholders can&#x27;t force decisions that benefit shareholders at the detriment of employees.<p>Finally Google looks like the perfect place for a union. Any company that rewards senior leadership for sexual harassment clearly doesn&#x27;t consider it&#x27;s employees important, and those employees should absolutely make it clear who generates most of the value in a company, and ensure they&#x27;re treated fairly.')
