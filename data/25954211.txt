Probably the hedge funds shorted even more as the bet was sure: block them from buying and the stock surely won&#x27;t go up!<p>- Good news: the situation in monitored and &quot;limited&quot; trading will be allowed tomorrow...probably enough to make people dump the stock and let the hedge fund managers cover their naked shorts.<p>Let&#x27;s hope the retailers will not get scared off, hold their ground and push the hedge funds into gamma squeeze!')
