Stayed one day and got the rest of my money back. Another place had a bad mouse infestation, this was dealt with by the owner but it was still pretty shocking as I have never lived or stayed in a place that had a single mouse my entire life.<p>Goods - Right before the pandemic hit had a really good string of excellent airbnbs that were all cancelled last minute, the thing with airbnb is, great places are always booked, we just got lucky as people were scared and stopped traveling(early march).<p>Ugly - Alot of owners now are pulling a perfectly legal scam of listing a place at a certain price point and then charging an extremely high cleaning fee. When booking it, you are then shocked by the extreme fees, one place (5 days stay) was charging $400 for their cleaning fee.<p>Takeaways - If you do your own cooking and don&#x27;t mind cleaning up airbnb is great for you. As a parent its great as I don&#x27;t have to deal with a hotel lobby or elevators(I always book standalone houses). As for price its roughly even with hotels, a few years back it was typically 40-50% cheaper.')
