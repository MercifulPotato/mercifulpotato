People are often optimizing for code reusability, code quality, ease of debugging and other advantages of some heavyweight frameworks rather than raw load time.  Often this is the right call as engineering is a cost centre. Where it goes wrong is when things get too slow and too bloated to the point you&#x27;re actually having people abandon the site before load but most of the major frameworks used properly don&#x27;t offer that extreme a tradeoff.  I also have no idea what % of these sites have reached that level.')
