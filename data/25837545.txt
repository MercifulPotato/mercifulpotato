GitHub repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webartifex&#x2F;intro-to-python<p>I incorporated many of the constructive criticism and am currently recording a video lecture series on YouTube: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PL-2JV1G3J10kRUPgP7EwLhyeN5lOZW2kH<p>I guess that a lot of people without a CS background would find these resources valuable and am open for further feedback.<p>If you have any &quot;non-tech&quot; friends who want to learn to code, please feel free to direct them to my course.<p>Stay healthy everybody!')
