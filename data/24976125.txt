Think of Voltly as a NETFLIX for EV content. Here&#x27;s our sizzle reel:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qpQq9FlqQ_I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qpQq9FlqQ_I</a><p>Voltly is a VOD&#x2F;Live TV channel for EV related content including shows, documentaries, music, news, reviews, sports, podcasts, manufacturer videos and live product launch events. Voltly is currently on ROKU.<p>With Voltly, you can enjoy instant access to premium quality streaming videos about electric vehicles including cars, trucks, motorcycles, airplanes, etc â€“ if it moves on electricity, we&#x27;ve got it on Voltly &#x27;The EV Channel&#x27;.<p>Voltly also features the largest collection of EV content online with over 600 unique videos, and is the only TV channel catering exclusively to the EV community.<p>A little background me.\nFor the past 5 years, I have been a writing and creating content for my EV news blog TheVoltly.com and it&#x27;s social media pages. Through this time, I have seen the EV community online grow far beyond it&#x27;s niche beginnings mostly due to the innovations brought about by Tesla and Elon Musk.<p>EV&#x27;s are a way of life for me and after seeing our California Governor decree that all new cars sold in the state from 2035 onwards must be electric, I felt it was time the EV community had a home on TV. I am also a person of color working to create media for and about the tech industry.<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.<p>Thanks!\n- Riz.')
