Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606879626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25272605, text='Jackie Gleason arranged and produced a number of easy listening albums. Yes, the How Sweet It Is guy! This one is my favorite:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Music-Lovers-Jackie-Gleason-2012-07-31&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00Y40EGK2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Music-Lovers-Jackie-Gleason-2012-07-3...</a><p>but really, all of his work is good. You&#x27;re in for a treat if you&#x27;ve never heard his music before.<p>P.S. The CD sounds wrong, I suspect some monkey business went on in the remastering studio. Get the vinyl version. Besides, these tunes just sound better with the needle drop, rumble and crackle of the old vinyl.')
