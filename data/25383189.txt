If that is not true, seriously bad consequences (like hyper inflation) occur. Proponents say “well the US can borrow in its own currency, we don’t have to worry about that”. Real problem is that without monetary discipline, there eventually does becomes a point where other countries DO stop using your currency as a reserve currency, and they do stop being willing to make loans in your currency. And that point is not well known. And is most likely to happen when your country is already in crisis. So formally relying on printing money to pay for things remains a hugely risky endeavor in my mind.<p>* I’ll note that the limited proponents of modern monetary theory I’ve heard of do not advocate for the elimination of taxes or unlimited printing or money. Thier argument is that the deficit is meaningless of itself, we should reduce the deficit (via  taxation) if inflation has gone outside a target range and increase the deficit if it has gone under the target range.')
