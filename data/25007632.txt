Slightly different.<p>&gt; <i>ID requirements are often imposed with the explicit intention of reducing voter turnout among the poor</i><p>Implicit, maybe, but do we have anyone on record saying they want voter ID to raise the median income of the average voter? Or that they don&#x27;t want poor people to vote so we&#x27;re going to make you bring in a driver&#x27;s license?<p>I buy that this is a side effect&#x2F;consequence of voter ID, but not that it&#x27;s explicit.<p>&gt; <i>there is allegedly a large swath of Americans who don&#x27;t have valid identification and can&#x27;t get it easily</i><p>Maybe, but like someone else said in many European jurisdictions you are required to show ID, it costs you money to get it, and you have a process to get it that takes time.<p>&gt; <i>the offices which produce identity documents for people who don&#x27;t drive might only be open twelve days a year and are located in areas that are not accessible by public transit</i><p>I&#x27;m definitely calling BS on only being able to get a non-driver state ID one day every month, and <i>most</i> of the US is not accessible by public transit. We are not as densely populated as Europe and expecting a nationwide public transit network that reaches 100% (or even 50%, honestly) of our citizens is unrealistic.<p>&gt; <i>For people at the bottom of the American income inequality pyramid, getting documentation might be something they can&#x27;t afford</i><p>This I actually agree with, and this[0; PDF] is actually a great breakdown of costs associated with getting an ID. It&#x27;s absolutely a biased source the number are accurate and you can ignore the politicizing narrative.<p>I agree that the good faith solution is making identification free for anyone who can actually prove their identity and needs the financial assistance. It&#x27;s hard to argue against VID <i>if</i> anyone who can prove their identity gets an ID if they want it.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharedprosperityphila.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;Revised-ID-Waiver-Appendices-5.15.15.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharedprosperityphila.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;Revised-ID-Waiver...</a>')
