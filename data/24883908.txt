Item(by='lemthro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603601397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875630, text='I havent been clinically diagnosed and as its manageable I doubt its anything serious, but occasionally I suffer from some &quot;light&quot; health issues around anxiety, anger, very visible changes in longer lasting temperament etc. Heavier mental health issues are above avg in my family.<p>I found that the initial setup and early stage of our startup was a rollercoaster but not really a trigger. I guess it was because I had already framed the failure in my head and even when the expense was way more than planned and Id lost the bulk of my savings I still had my initial, though wobbly, frame to fall back on (had a month or two in salary and could likely find a regular job, kids weren&#x27;t gonna starve).<p>Ironically it was when we got larger, well funded and more secure that it become more difficult for me. As the larger you grow the more time you spend dealing with people-stuff. The solution seemed to match general founder-advice when scaling. Hire good people, build process, delegate etc.<p>A caveat though, ive always been the type of person to thrive in situations adverse to me, but not social situations. I would probably have a worse time in a large corporate if I was psychologically invested in its success.')
