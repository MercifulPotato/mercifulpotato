Canadian consumers don&#x27;t really realize this however because of the various brand names - Independent City Market, No Frills, Fortino&#x27;s etc..<p>The amount of control Loblaw has over the market is astounding.<p>Try finding pasta sauce at a Loblaw owned store. There will be 1-2 non house brands, the rest are all Loblaw owned brands.<p>Or walk into a Wal Mart and check the price of coffee. Significantly more expensive than Loblaw because Wal Mart Canada doesn&#x27;t have the purchasing power the Westons have.<p>Fairly typical in Canada. Duopoloies &#x2F; Oligopolies across most large industries that are heavily protected by the government (banking, telecom, air travel, grocery, insurance)')
