Often verbalized, very public. Microsoft&#x27;s USP is the complete integrated enterprise ecosystem that will work with whatever else you have, too. That&#x27;s what they call the &quot;intelligent cloud&quot;.<p>So your contacts app knows just which contacts to highlight&#x2F;suggest based on your org chart (active directory), communication history (outlook, teams), and subject matter (documents&#x2F;SharePoint&#x2F;teams message history&#x2F;etc etc). And it&#x27;s all subject to centralized authentication, access, and audit controls.<p>The integration goes into the azure products, too. Your kubernetes RBAC can be based on AAD, so your running containers have an identity that could access Teams and email of you want. Your serverless functions, ML toolkits, etc etc run with their own AAD identities, too. Oh and of course monitoring integrates with their world leading business intelligence tools, including Excel.<p>This is all there already. Azure DevOps does exactly what you describe:<p>&gt; you can communicate, plan, build, track and deploy all on the Microsoft stack itâ€™ll be very compelling product for businesses and very difficult for any competitor to compete.<p>And those features are coming to GitHub Enterprise, so you can do it with the developer product you already know and like. And of course, with tight integration to do it from your IDE if you like.')
