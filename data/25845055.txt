Reading that issue, the content seems to be:<p>1: jwz says if you add accessibility features to a text box, make sure they don&#x27;t have any bugs that can kill a process, since that will break screen lockers<p>2: Cinnamon adds a buggy accessibility feature to a text box that lets you crash the screen locker<p>3: Github user clefebvre says something along the lines of &quot;why is jwz being so negative &gt;:(&quot;<p>Well... you did exactly what he told you not to do. If you&#x27;re going to add accessibility features to a text box, you need to not screw it up. If you screw it up, then it breaks the screen locker for every user in the world, including the 99% of people who will never use the accessibility features.<p>If you make an obvious, stupid mistake, people will make fun of you. Complaining that people are making fun of you won&#x27;t do much. Try, instead, to not make the obvious stupid mistake?<p>From the issue:<p>&gt;With that said, I have on message for JWZ. Don&#x27;t be that guy. It&#x27;s too easy to just tell people no to cross the street. Work with us on building that safest path.<p>Huh? What? He wrote xscreensaver 20 years ago. He&#x27;s supposed to fix buggy code written by other people until he dies?<p>Why is it his responsibility to fix your code? The distro extended his program, the extension broke. You can either ignore the problem, remove the extension, or fix the extension. None of these things sounds like xscreensaver&#x27;s problem!')
