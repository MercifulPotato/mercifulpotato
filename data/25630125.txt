That made the menu bar narrower. The widgets in the menu bar on the left side just don&#x27;t appear when the frontmost app&#x27;s menu is too wide.<p>Since I use iStat Menus for this purpose, which puts (in my configuration) 6 different widgets there, and have several others as well, lots of icons were simply inaccessible.<p>That is one argument for Pluto&#x27;s approach here.')
