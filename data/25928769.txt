It also means that my hands float, so I can reach keys that require some lateral motion, which means that keys like TYU&#x2F;GH&#x2F;VBN are crossover keys for me -- I might hit them with either hand.<p>So the obvious design for me would be to have a split keyboard that has those keys on both sides. Why choose a split? Just duplicate the keys!')
