One kind urges you to be more permissive; the other kind urges you to be more strict.<p>In Zion National Park, there&#x27;s a trail called Angel&#x27;s Landing.  You wind up climbing this ridge, with a 1000-foot dropoff on one side, and a 500-foot dropoff on the other side.  Parenting is like that.  There&#x27;s a cliff on the side of being too permissive.  You read a book warning you about that.  So you back well away from that cliff.  But there&#x27;s a cliff on the <i>other</i> side, too, and you become to strict by trying to not be too permissive.<p>Worse, if your natural bent (or upbringing, or whatever) is toward being too strict, then a book that warns about being too permissive resonates more with you than one that warns about being too strict, <i>even though the second kind is the one that you really need to hear</i>.<p>So, yeah.  Beware becoming a parent of only one book.')
