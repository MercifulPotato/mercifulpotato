Satellites can&#x27;t. A better analogy would be if once they entered their lane, cars would have to travel down it at their maximum speed, without being able to steer, or brake. Under those constraints, I, uh, wouldn&#x27;t get into a car.<p>Cars are also not phased if they run over a loose bolt. The same can&#x27;t be said for satellites.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t do it yet with satellites.<p>Basic orbital mechanics indicates that we won&#x27;t ever be able to clean up Kessler-syndrome space debris in a remotely-economical manner. There&#x27;d be too much of it, and it would travel at vastly disjoint orbits.<p>Orbit changes are extremely expensive.')
