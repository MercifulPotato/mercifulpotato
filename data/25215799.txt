I remember desperately searching for solutions so I could have unix at home and not always rely on the university SunOS&#x2F;HP-UX&#x2F;AIX machines.<p>SCO was one player in this space. I can&#x27;t remember the other one I was considering.. In the end they were all too expensive for poor-student-me so didn&#x27;t use any of them and kept using the lab SunOS boxes via 2400bps dialup from home until Linux appeared on the scene.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Santa_Cruz_Operation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Santa_Cruz_Operation</a>')
