Therefore these viruses can facilely jump over hills in the gradient descent of optimization; but keep in mind optimization is not just a one-factor thing.  If you are interested in this the keyword is &quot;viral metagenome&quot;<p>An E to K mutation converts a surface negative charge to a surface positive charge.  So if your antibodies were expecting a negative charge and therefore putting positive charges near that place when they attach to the virus, the polarity on the mutant has now shifted and the antibodies will be repelled from the mutant virus.')
