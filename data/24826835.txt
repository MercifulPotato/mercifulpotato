Designing a new enzyme at the molecular level is basically still not a thing that humans have figured out how to do. Her approach was revolutionary in the same way that the invention of a telescope was revolutionary to physics. You could try and say it was some grand synthesis of optics and astronomy, but that&#x27;s a hell of a stretch, they&#x27;re both physics. Evolution is just biology, and directed evolution is bioengineering. If you wanted to claim that Arnold invented modern bioengineering and laid the framework for synthetic biology, I could buy that. Just like the telescope laid the foundation for modern astronomy. But saying it&#x27;s a perspective from an unrelated field doesn&#x27;t make sense when it&#x27;s one of the foundational defining cornerstones of this field.')
