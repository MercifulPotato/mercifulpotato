The author mentions this at the bottom. He claims 1sec delay. Last month I benchmarked it on new-ish hardware at 560ms, or 290ms if you disable namespaces (and so disable isolation).<p>I wanted to also benchmark bocker[1] (docker written in bash) for a baseline comparison, but it no longer runs and I threw in the towel after ~30 mins of tinkering.<p>Anyways, if you run something like `curl | jq | grep | less` you could be waiting a fair bit for all those containers to start. Package managers are pretty good these days. I think I can trust it to install `jq` properly.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;p8952&#x2F;bocker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;p8952&#x2F;bocker</a>')
