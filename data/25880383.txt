If the work itself espouses hate then that is a different matter. It is also a different matter when talking about the author themselves, then yes, we must consider all aspects of their life before putting them on a pedestal, or pulling them down from one.<p>But when discussing the novel itself, the author should be immaterial, as far as possible. Otherwise these kind of spurious connections can lead to absurd stuff like targetting her descendents, or anyone with the same name for that matter.')
