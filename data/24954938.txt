The state of the language is one thing, the state of the ecosystem surrounding the language is another.<p>Anecdotally speaking, the vast majority of PHP projects I&#x27;ve been exposed to have been horrific precisely because there&#x27;s a laissez-faire or &quot;get the job done at any cost&quot; attitude to software development that&#x27;s uniquely prevelant in these communities (this exists in all languages, but in my experience it&#x27;s way worse and way more normalized within the PHP silo). The language improving will only be positive for new projects that are started today, or that have been maintained by dilligent and empathetic engineers. Often teams are not as united on this front as they should be.<p>I think using almost any other comparable language in 2020 (Python 3, Go, Typescript) is a better solution than starting a new project in PHP these days. I suspect the real reason many still reach for PHP first is because it is &quot;easy&quot; and PHP developers are ostensibly cheap and easy to replace. It&#x27;s a false economy.')
