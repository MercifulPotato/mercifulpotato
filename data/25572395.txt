My progression was:<p>1. Avid day hiker (10-16 mile hikes every weekend, 5-8k ft gain)<p>2. Car camping in Ojai (near Los Angeles). Drive in, setup your tent, chill, sleep, leave next morning.<p>3. Backpacking around LA on the trails from step 1<p>4. Thru-hiked PCT<p>5. Mountaineering &#x2F; alpine climbing<p>Lots of people do the PCT with little hiking experience and are fine though. It&#x27;s just walking, and there are tons of people to help you.')
