It&#x27;s definitely helpful to iterate on some UI ideas and prototype. Once you want to do anything complicated that involves any sort of logic, it becomes very clunky since you&#x27;re trying to write JS in a tiny web-based code editor box. Refractors (e.g. changing a variable name or deleting a query) is kind of a nightmare since I can&#x27;t just search for it&#x27;s usage. I also wish it had support for a lightweight DB out of box instead of requiring one to always be present. Finally, it seems components have kind of inconsistent capabilities, like being able to trigger a query on certain events that you would expect, which limits their usefulness.<p>Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s helpful but has a ways to go before being a useful replacement for most internal app use cases. It&#x27;s certainly promising though and hopefully this round of investment helps round off some of these rough spots in the product.')
