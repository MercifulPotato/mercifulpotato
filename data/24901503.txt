Item(by='unphased', descendants=None, kids=[24912122], score=None, time=1603746888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900823, text='I&#x27;m planning to create a (probably written in Vulkan, so it will be ambitious...) project where I want to leverage modern 3D graphics for displaying potentially very large graphs in an intuitive &amp; interactive way. I&#x27;m trying to target use cases such as note taking and mind-mapping as well as code browsing and git repo browsing as I see many potential ways to create visualization capability (via unification) across the multiple abstraction layers (many of which involve graph structures). E.g., git tree is a DAG, and the nodes on there are source file trees themselves. We could view a list of GitHub PRs on a repo as a list of nodes which point into locations within the repo&#x27;s git tree. It&#x27;s turtles all the way down, since source files can themselves be decomposed into ASTs, and those yet further into syntactical trees.<p>I imagine that with common workflows (one of which I just proposed) without the barrier of context switching could be a big win. At a certain zoom level I&#x27;m envisioning being able to directly <i>see</i> which portions of source are touched by the different PRs for example.<p>Another example of this is in applying this toward file browsing and the management of backups (i&#x27;ll want to sprinkle tree differencing visualization in there).')
