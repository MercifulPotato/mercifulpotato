Those billions in spending to pay for something that might be worth $0 is worth it because it&#x27;s likely at least some of the vaccines will be safe and effective.<p>Sometimes things start out as unprofitable and then only later, because of those dollars invested, become profitable. Space, for example. Government investments in solar power have also been super important.<p>Or, more relevant to Hacker News, how about ARPANET being funded by the military, and then later that funding going to the National Science Foundation? Eventually, of course, it got privatized.')
