Not only does it make it more difficult to talk to and help change their opinion, it further polarizes use. Sure, I will readily admit that some people are just being obstinate and stupid, but when you have the places you get your news from feeding you misinformation, or worse, feeding you facts, but not all the facts, or the details get lost in transit (e.g. the cdc not recommending masks and then recommending masks), it&#x27;s not hard to see how some things become ideas.<p>We can&#x27;t help correct misconceptions if we believe they&#x27;re driven solely by stupidity.')
