At least to me.<p>The thing that&#x27;s drawing me, now far more strongly, to publishing via the store is that although vexing problems exist, this looks like the most transparent platform to my eyes because the developer community is surfacing the issues and not burying problems with FUD and MVP-speak.

Yes it does temporary wonders for concentration. I never took my full dose which was the minimum adult dose and broke regime regularly for at least two weeks a time and I don&#x27;t even know how to describe the 8 months of &quot;hell&quot; because they were just too messed up. Gabapentin probably has amazing off label potential but now it&#x27;s scheduled forget about intelligent prescribing.<p>[1] deep into the data structures for a advertising scheduler with fun like network flow limits (since we discussed on Shannon, if this is enough to tickle you I&#x27;d love to hear from you, I&#x27;ve got man decades in this needing fresh eyes.<p>[1] gross percentage fees wreck trading advertising simply.

I didn&#x27;t hear anything similar until in 2018 the former chairman of Mediacom the UKs biggest buyer pull the exact same figure out of thin air.<p>[3] the recent highly acclaimed book &quot;Manslaughter On Madison Avenue&quot; explains how the problems that made me light out for the territory in 1995 remain not only not fixed but not even addressed. Briefly I felt terrible pangs for trying to help the agencies who threw vexatious criminal copyright breach torts in the High Court at us within days of opening. Then I realised that anyone who can tell the problems just ran for the hills. Only being a partnership let us survive. A limited company requires professional counsel.
