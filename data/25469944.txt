But I actually tried to go a few years ago initially and their admissions and communication process was such a disaster I gave up.<p>I went back later and literally had to force them to let me enroll. When I finally complained to my mentor about the admissions process being like pulling teeth she simply said &quot;We want to make sure students are motivated before we enroll them&quot;. I am not sure I buy that response, but that&#x27;s what she told me.<p>I agree, it is a joke.')
