If you have a business, and you make no &quot;profit&quot; because you reinvest every dollar of gross income back into the company, then it makes sense to be taxed much less by doing so.<p>Additionally it is a misunderstanding that Amazon &quot;doesn&#x27;t pay tax.&quot; I looked into this myself after seeing all the hatred to Amazon about it, and they actually pay many types of tax and in high amounts. Everyone simply fixates on the taxes they are able to minimize.<p>Every large company does their best to maximize profits and minimize losses for whatever reason. It is soulless but that is how companies function and is sensible from a certain perspective. I think they should also be &quot;human&quot; and not merely logical, but from a strictly logical viewpoint it makes sense to treat employees as disposable tools and get as many tax cuts as you can.<p>What consequences? I think almost everyone knows Amazon is evil and heartless, but most of us continue to use Amazon to buy things anyway because they have the things we want at low costs.')
