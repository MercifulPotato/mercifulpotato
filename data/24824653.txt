Even of uniform density, the mass would not the at the core, only the center of mass would be. Most of the mass is actually closer to the surface. I&#x27;m no physicist, but I&#x27;d imagine that would have quite some impact[0] on any trajectory that crosses the surface.<p>And for any ball thrown at human speeds, I&#x27;d expect Earth&#x27;s gravity would be much closer to a uniform gravitational field than one from a point mass.<p>[0] Pun not originally intended but I&#x27;m quite happy with it now.')
