There are 100 people.<p>Imagine the village ages out and you have 90 old people, and 10 middle-aged people. There&#x27;s not enough people harvesting grain to feed everyone. There&#x27;s not enough workers to maintain the roads. The life-savings everyone accumulated under the balanced population gets spent squabbling for the limited food at inflated prices. The water and roads fall apart with no one to maintain them. Life gets worse, not better. Unless there is war, famine or pestilence, usually reductions in population will be unbalanced by nature.')
