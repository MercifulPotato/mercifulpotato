And we didn&#x27;t co-evolve with grains much. We domesticated them fairly recently.<p>Unlike many other toxins plants put in their seeds to protect them, gluten doesn&#x27;t seem to have been made just for defense. They just came up with a protein to feed their embryos... and turns out it was also toxic to herbivores. Of course, herbivores which co-evolved with these plants evolved ways to digest gluten... but when humans adopted it, we ran into problems.<p>The good thing is most of these problems can be avoided by not eating what plants don&#x27;t want us to eat.')
