This was wholly intentional, to sabotage health-and-safety conscious Democratic local governments, and force them into the Sophie&#x27;s choice of mass unemployment or mass death among their constituents (local GOP leaders, for the most part, of course didn&#x27;t actually care about mass death OR mass employment, since their constituency is the handful of billionaires who fund the whole party and right-wing ideological apparatus; so they were able to further sabotage the health-and-safety efforts by simply refusing to implement any).<p>The state and local governments that shutdown did the right thing - they put the health and safety of their populations first. The federal government failed them by defaulting on <i>its</i> obligations. It did this intentionally.')
