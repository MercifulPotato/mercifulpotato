The network configuration has &quot;ports&quot; sections, such as<p><pre><code>  ports:\n    - &quot;8080:80&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhich (assuming some other network configurations) means that whatever answers to port 80 in the container can be reached at port 8080 of the host running Docker.<p>Simple syntax and straightforward semantics, but port numbers are integers: why strings? Because, as the Docker manual warns, YAML is clever.<p>&gt;  When mapping ports in the HOST:CONTAINER format, you may experience erroneous results when using a container port lower than 60, because YAML parses numbers in the format xx:yy as a base-60 value. For this reason, we recommend always explicitly specifying your port mappings as strings.')
