And look at the spacing&#x2F;padding of each button in the white header. Two buttons with lots of padding, an ugly truncated title (despite removing the separate titlebar, the header is overall taller than the previous one and there is now no room for the title because the space it used has been traded for whitespace), the four evenly spaced buttons, then one button with irregular spacing that doesn&#x27;t match any of the others, and then another button that is too close to the search box and looks like it&#x27;s vertically aligned slighly lower compared to the others. Just looks like a mess to me.')
