You can move in direction around it (while still moving towards it at the same time). And you can move in the previously time now just space.<p>Delaying your fall is precisely the same as trying to avoid tomorrow by moving around. Moving away from the center is like moving back in time. No matter how you move in the spatial dimensions you can’t do it.<p>With the exception of faster than light travel. That allows you to move away from the center, and it also allows you to avoid tomorrow. It’s pretty much the same as time traveling in general relativity.')
