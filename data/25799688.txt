I wouldn&#x27;t trust their shit ever. Perhaps it seems more secure than self built stuff but it really isn&#x27;t. The same idiots you think won&#x27;t build their own infrastructure correctly are also building the pieces of the cloud you so cherish.<p>I&#x27;ll agree that it is more likely the cloud providers have more logging and monitoring in place though, and that can make a big difference. On the other hand, cloud providers get far more attacks.<p>I disagree that hosting and doing everything yourself is not more secure. It absolutely is, especially if you use your own non-standard setup and work hard to prevent easy analysis of your setup.<p>Example:\nIf you host your own server and only server static web files with no interactivity... and only expose port 443... it is possible to pretty much guarantee the server cannot be hacked and at best could be DDOSed. Obviously hardening measures would be necessary too, and taking care to not expose anything besides pure static file serving, but that can be done with relative ease.<p>If you use a cloud provider, the attack surface is HUGE. All of them have extensive APIs, with so many possible places where there could be a vuln discovered.<p>I think it is absolutely incorrect that using a public cloud service is more secure; there are simply too many bells whistles gears bolts shims and everything else.')
