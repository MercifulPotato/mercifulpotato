Let me defend the thresholds.<p>The point of this bill is to require beneficial ownership disclosure for shell companies. Legal ownership of an entity is one thing. The beneficial owner is the human who ultimately owns and controls the entity [1].<p>Tracing the beneficial owners of economically-active entities (<i>i.e.</i> not shell companies [2]) is expensive. Imagine doing this for Apple. You would need to look through every ETF that holds it to its mutual fund owners to their pension fund owners to their holding companies to their pensioners. That is a multimillion dollar exercise, largely useless and reasonably opposed. This expense in its extreme stopped similar legislation in the past. As a result, someone from Russia could create a BVI company that opens a Delaware LLC and gain near-total transactional anonymity.<p>This bill tries to exempt economically active entities. The thresholds are easy to identify, reducing paperwork, while low with respect to most companies. (Small businesses have simple ownership structures and a small number of beneficial owners.) The bill is <i>not</i> a general anti-money laundering bill. If you have employees and revenues, you are engaging in sophisticated money laundering. If you have a thousand shell entities, you are doing something else (and more common).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beneficial_ownership" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beneficial_ownership</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shell_corporation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shell_corporation</a>')
