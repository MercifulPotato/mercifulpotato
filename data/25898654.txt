But it&#x27;s not different in a way that I see any coherent argument makes UBI <i>more</i> prone to being turned into a transfer from the wealthier bare-minority to the poorer bare-minority through democratic process. (Classically, that threat is an argument against democracy generally, recently it&#x27;s been retooled as an argument against UBI; in both forms its a narrative appealing to the assumed ignorance and venality of the masses that doesn&#x27;t seem to have much support in actual behavior of real democratic systems.)')
