I like Sci Hub, but it didn&#x27;t create a lot of the value it provides - it does that on the $ of a lot of other actors.<p>Even arxiv was getting flooded with crap and had to do some gatekeeping. Sci hub gets a huge benefit from the publishing industry at keeping out a flood of crap and pseudo science nonsense that floods most places that don&#x27;t have such a process.')
