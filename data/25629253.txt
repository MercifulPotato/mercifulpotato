This creates its own problems as well, especially in countries like Korea that are extremely homogeneous.<p>Realistically the global population cannot keep growing so we&#x27;ll need to adapt to stagnant and potentially decreasing (at least for some time) population at some point.<p>So IMHO the best long term answer for countries facing this now is to accept it and to start changing paradigms and the economy instead of trying to keep on growing the population.')
