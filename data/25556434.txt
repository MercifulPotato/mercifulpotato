No, they do not <i>need</i> to be re-written, but the new versions are often substantially more usable and newcomers enjoy that. Such is the nature of life. Things change. Accept that and you&#x27;ll be happier.<p>Your attitude might win some points with other fight-the-tide-till-my-last-dying-breath types, but it reads to me as &quot;It is the children who are wrong!&quot;<p>I worked with a guy who had the same attitude about always using kubectl over the gui because it was &quot;faster&quot;.
