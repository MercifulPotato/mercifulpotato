Especially in all attempts within the last 30 years?<p>Nuclear has long had a reputation as a tech that could bankrupt a utility, which is why utilities stopped building it in the 1980s.<p>In the mid-2000s, in an attempt to revitalize the industry, we had an attempt to build nuclear in highly supportive communities with high levels of support from the Nuclear Regulatory Committee.<p>This attempt ended in yet more financial disaster. South Carolina residents pay an average of $20&#x2F;month on their electricity bill for a failed project that will never produce energy (Vogtle). In order to convince the utility to take on the massive financial risk of a nuclear construction project, the nuclear industry pushed through a special bill in the state legislature that lets the utility charge ratepayers whether or not a nuclear construction project completes.<p>The UK started attempts at building nuclear at the same time, and though it started construction at Hinckley C, a project far behind schedule and far over budget, it has not even been able to find somebody to build at Wylfa. Hitachi pulled out.<p>Similarly, France, who is often an example of &quot;good nuclear,&quot; is abandoning new nuclear because their attempts at building again have all ended in financial disaster and blown schedules.<p>Chernobyl, TMI, and Fukushima are not the nuclear failures that scare those who would build it. It&#x27;s the financial risk that scares away investors, and it should scare us all. Dumping such high capital costs in a 50-year investment, at a time when alternatives are dropping in cost exponentially, is just foolish. It&#x27;s like buying 50 years of lock-in to 386 Intel processors in 1990. Just foolish.')
