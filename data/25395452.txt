There absolutely was a PPE shortage at the time, and there absolutely was new information coming in about the efficacy of wearing non N95 masks. That&#x27;s a lot of attribution to malice or incompetence for such a dynamic situation that shaped up in such a relatively short amount of time..<p>Meanwhile the current admin had their last maskless rally what, just in the past week or so?')
