It&#x27;s surprising to think any gamer let alone an employee at a game studio (let alone a studio where whale hunting is the dominant business model) would think this is a new phenomenon and be confused in any way about what happens next. But anyway, nothing happens -- the servers shut down, the game is no more, no one gets sued. I don&#x27;t even have to go find the EULA to be sure that it contains a clause about waiving class action rights in case anyone wanted to try. FarmVille isn&#x27;t the first game and won&#x27;t be the last game to do this. If anything, it&#x27;s rather refreshing to see a non-gacha game in the long chain of shutdowns.')
