When you create abstractions, more verbose documentation and design is needed to share the ideas. Anyone using this in the future needs to understand your abstractions and there&#x27;s a cognitive cost of dealing with it.<p>You reduce this cost when you explain everything well, give examples, show use cases, etc. When you don&#x27;t provide this sort of verbose documentation, you might as well have made it a large sequential program because it likely would have been easier for the next person to understand.')
