In theory, a Bayesian who uses the prior 2^-K(x) over all strings x should, with sufficient life experience, come up with good estimates, in a certain sense.<p>I&#x27;ll have to think about this example more carefully when fulfilling my promise of writing about how this theory relates to everyday decision-making. Thanks for pointing out a potential weakness :)')
