The most cogent definition of “Immoral” or argument that someone is “Immoral” would be contrasting how the subject’s definition of “Good” differs from your own or the common view. Very few people go out seeking to do evil. Most seek to do good, but by their own definition (which can be selfish, misguided, or outright vile). Some simply don’t care; Their absence of moral judgement (amorality) can lead to many immoral actions when their desires come into contact with others interests, but for the most part society is organized to promote the idea that your own best interests are best served by acting in the common good. If this sounds circular - It is. There’s no definition of morality from axiom[1].<p>Studies are (where possible) Double-Blind for a reason. The judgement of a researcher obviously affects study design. The goals of a researcher affect the way data is interpreted and presented in subtle and non-subtle ways.  That’s not to mention the possibility of academic misconduct or outright fraud, which is axiomatically related to poor moral behavior.<p>[1] In actuality, there are many, but most have obvious flaws and contradictions.')
