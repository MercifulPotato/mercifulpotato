Trying to act like just because they aren&#x27;t all a scam doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a systemic problem of waste that still needs to be addressed, and there are plenty of examples in even recent history that prove this point. More than just waste, the intention to fill good ol boy pockets <i>in priority</i> over getting the job done has significantly weakened the function of the projects, for example, the national security implications of abandoning thinthread that William Binney and Thomas Drake talk about... as just one in a myriad of examples. Virginia didn&#x27;t have multiple counties become the new primary growth centers of millionares because of fair and balanced bids... and anyone pretending otherwise doesn&#x27;t know how DC works.')
