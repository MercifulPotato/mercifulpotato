He believed that I lied to my insurance company and hid some pre-existing condition.<p>this is the same kind of situation in Denmark, I&#x27;ve lived most of my life outside of Denmark, after I cam back in my early 40s I went to the Doctor and said innocently &quot;well I guess I&#x27;m getting to that age now where I should have an annual checkup.&quot; There was no explaining the concept to him.')
