R is introspective, and some reckless people (like myself) will mess with functions&#x27; guts in a few scripts.  Replacing the `%&gt;%` function with a syntax symbol will break those scripts.  Even with scripts that don&#x27;t metaphorically shove their hands down the garbage disposal, programmers might&#x27;ve relied on certain behaviors of the magrittr pipe.<p>The R Core team is very cautious about breaking anything, including universally acknowledged terrible defaults (I never thought `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` would ever go away).  They know the majority of R programmers are not experts in programming.  These users just want to write a script, debug it, and then use it for years with complete trust in the results.')
