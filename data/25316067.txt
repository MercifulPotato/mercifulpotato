They tend to be too anxious not to be.<p>Personally, I guess I&#x27;m an anxious person _sometimes_ ( can panic attack but tend to forget about it if I don&#x27;t think about it ) and it doesn&#x27;t make me act dishonest or an asshole.  Not even saying I&#x27;ve never been an asshole, but stabbing someone in the back just isn&#x27;t my style and goes against my working class Scottish stoic upbringing.  As does being openly anxious, it&#x27;s not something I tell folks.')
