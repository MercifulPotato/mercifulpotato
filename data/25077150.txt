Ideas are submitted anonymously so they aren&#x27;t measured on who submitted them. When an idea is approved, we reveal the author. When that same author submits an idea in the future we weigh it a bit higher than someone who has had no approvals... so the system allows for a democratic selection of ideas (votes) or a meritocratic selection (approval history).<p>I&#x27;d love feedback on what this community thinks of the idea, implementation etc. Thanks in advance!')
