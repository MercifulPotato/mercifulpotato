Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=[25553806], score=None, time=1609092554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25552566, text='&gt;<i>you can clearly see that the satellites are visible from the ground (the photo from Germany)</i><p>No, you&#x27;ve misunderstood (in numerous ways, but this is a specific one you&#x27;ve cited). That photo you linked is of a satellite &quot;train&quot;, which is a <i>temporary</i> state of satellites after deployment as they take themselves the rest of the way to final deployment orbits. At that point they&#x27;ll be both spread out and the albedo will be vastly lowered because SpaceX has already made design alterations to the sats so that in their operational alignment towards Earth they are far less reflective. They&#x27;re not going to interfere with the sky from the naked eye, nor even for general photography, even from low light pollution rural areas vs typical urban ones.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that you&#x27;re almost a parody of &quot;entitled, dismissive urbanite&quot;. Even in the developed world, tens to hundreds of millions of people have crappy DSL at <i>best</i>. Outside of the developed world that rises to billions. Marine and aircraft stand to make enormous gains as well. The demand for Starlink is clear and well founded, and you do your argument zero favors by trying to hand wave it away (unless you just mean to rant to no constructive end).')
