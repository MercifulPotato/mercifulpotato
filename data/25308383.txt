Your employer can fire you at any time and technically doesn&#x27;t need a reason. Typically, &quot;terminated with cause&quot; is a specific thing where they fire you and give a specific reason (e.g. stealing) that might have bearing on whether you receive unemployment benefits, accrued vacation, etc. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that they fired her in that way and that she was just plain-old-fired (there&#x27;s a reason for it, but not legal <i>cause</i>).')
