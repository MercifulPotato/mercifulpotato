The album was built so there was a plastic sheet in front of the photos, to hold them in place &#x2F; protect them. Well, that sheet ended up ripping bits out of the photos, and it&#x27;s glossy enough that I can&#x27;t scan the photos through it. Be careful with assumptions of how long physical products last.<p>Also, books used to be printed on better paper; modern cheap books will not last as long as the old ones did. I have a couple of collector&#x27;s edition books printed on acid-free paper...')
