Small changes that seem less relevant to people with low product interest.<p>Meanwhile these features stack year on year til you have vastly better products over time.<p>This improvement isn&#x27;t marketing departments. They might spin the improvements to stories and messages but the changes come as continual engeneering improvement in products. Go see a 15 year old phone and imagine we&#x27;d stopped adding little improvements there vs today&#x27;s phones. They work but they are clearly inferior products.')
