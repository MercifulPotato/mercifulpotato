However, it not exactly magic either, and to extent it really relies on the effectiveness of your display&#x27;s local dimming and maximum brightness.<p>If you&#x27;re running your display at 50% brightness, then yeah... it&#x27;s got &quot;more brightness to spare&quot; when it&#x27;s time to render those extra brighter-than-bright areas.<p>If you&#x27;re running your display at max 100% brightness already then... well, there&#x27;s nowhere to go from there.<p>I briefly played around with my 2018 iPad Pro, which has an EDR display. I watched the Apple TV movie &quot;Greyhound&quot; with Tom Hanks. That movie appears to have been shot as something of a demo for HDR rendering. Lots of shots inside the dark, cramped ships, with INTENSELY bright light coming in thru the windows.<p>Watching it on the iPad, the windows were WAY brighter than the rest of the ship interior. But, I could still see everything in the ship interior. It wasn&#x27;t lost in the shadows. Watching it on my nice Dell IPS monitor, it looked totally different. The portholes were brighter than the ship interior, but not by much. It just looked like a normal movie.<p>It was a very convincing demo. However, perhaps hilariously, I thought it looked better in non-HDR on my Dell. Nonetheless, it was an impressive tech demo.')
