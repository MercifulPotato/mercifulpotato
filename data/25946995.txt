I realize that&#x27;s not your view, but it&#x27;s a plenty common view.<p>Further, not everyone who wants to keep politics and business separate even agrees on what mixing politics and business means.<p>Is it politics for a company to go out of its way to make bathrooms explicitly gender-neutral, put pronouns in staff directories, encourage even people who are not trans to indicate their pronouns so that trans people don&#x27;t feel singled out by doing so, discipline people for persistent or intentional use of the wrong pronouns in the workplace, and cover common trans needs like hormone replacement therapy in the company health insurance plan?<p>Many people on the right of the US political spectrum would call that politics. Many other people conclude that some good workers happen to be trans and would feel more comfortable working at such employers than at ones with traditional attitudes toward them, meaning that these changes have the apolitical good business consequence of maximizing the ability of the company to attract and retain workers.<p>Does one have to inquire into the motivation of the employer for adopting these policies to decide if they&#x27;re mixing politics or business, or just engaging in business?<p>Lots of subjectivity even on moral rights questions like this.<p>Though, I will say that my use of the word &quot;enforce&quot; is really only applicable to legal rights, not moral rights, outside of some kind of dystopian enforcement of what people are allowed to think.')
