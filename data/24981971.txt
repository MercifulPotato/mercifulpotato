Bill works, buys their food, pays their rent, pays their bills, does the housework, and pays Jill&#x27;s way through medical school. Bill and Jill have no assets, because all the money went into Jill&#x27;s education.<p>Jill graduates, becomes a doctor, starts making mountains of money, meets a pretty intern, and divorces Bill.<p>Does Jill owe Bill anything?<p>It&#x27;s the same situation as with childcare. Bill put more into maintaining the marriage&#x2F;child than Jill did. Jill benefited&#x2F;was harmed less during the marriage. Bill deserves compensation after the fact.<p>Had the fruits of his labours gone into a savings account, he&#x27;d receive at least half of it on divorce. Instead, they went into developing Jill&#x27;s earnings potential - so he&#x27;s entitled to a share of it. Likewise, if instead of paying with money, he paid with childcare that was damaging to <i>his</i> career.')
