Item(by='zinekeller', descendants=None, kids=[25768270, 25769463], score=None, time=1610571132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767666, text='Noted and changed.<p>&gt; MS wants to take control away from users and owners, so uses such language.<p>I wanted to clarify this issue in logner detail but obviously outside of enterprise settings (which the owner does not trust the user).<p>Now, I&#x27;m writing to HN here, which really likes its freedoms (and I also want it). But the general pattern nowadays is that people value the consistency over customisability. The success of locked-down iPhone and Android is a great example: sure <i>some</i> users wants to run other software on the device but the simple truth is vast majority of users prefers to trust Apple or Google to do their job properly as their main goal is not to run a computer but rather to do their own business (similar to how a company often contracts its electricity, water, network connectivity, waste management and others).<p>On a similar vein, the newer versions of Windows will run with the secure boot option enabled (which will ensure that the system is as intended by Microsoft). Again, <i>some</i> people wants the system to be easily modifiable, and in that case there are ways to lower the guardrails to allow you to a certain extent. But the vast majority of users trusts Microsoft to manage the system and let them just do work.<p>TLDR: Some users view a computer as something to tinker upon but most users see it as a tool to be used.')
