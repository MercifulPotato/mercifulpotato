Sounds like you&#x27;re in grad school right now, yeah? I know differential geometry is not exactly the same as differential topology, but I remember taking differential topology in grad school.  I was always amused that we never actually evaluated any integrals that didn&#x27;t come out to a very simple number (generally 0).<p>If I were writing this as a web page, though, I would definitely include a few graphs to explain the calculus concepts.  The amount of calculus you need here is pretty intuitive once you draw a couple of pictures.')
