Companies often have to outsource their head-hunting because so many of them are so bad at it, and entire companies have been created (e.g. TripleByte) because other companies can&#x27;t figure out how to properly measure talent.<p>And arguably, the main reason in the first place that managers hire so many people they are OK letting go later on is because their managers (one level up) aren&#x27;t able to properly observe it happening, on account of the measurement being so poor. If the measurement is that poor, you&#x27;re basically guaranteed to have hired lots of great people who won&#x27;t have the opportunity to flourish.')
