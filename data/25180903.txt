Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606077928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25180559, text='&gt; My parents, being highly educated and well off financially themselves, put enormous pressure on us to do well in school.<p>Sorry, this is BS. I come from a competitive family. My parents put enormous pressure on me to do well in school, too. <i>Pressure I could not handle.</i> They wanted me to do 2 years in 1 to save 2k EUR on travel costs. I failed. If they had a tad bit more savings and listened better to me, I believe I would&#x27;ve succeeded. I&#x27;m good now, after a long struggle, but I should&#x27;ve learned a trait at age 12 instead. Not everyone is meant to take a traditional, higher education road to success. Not even when they have a high SAT score, or rich parents. Mine were average wealthy, though I had a chronically ill father. My cousins had no ill parent, and I suspect this is why they lack a general compassion for human beings in need.')
