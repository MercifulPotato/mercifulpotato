A few years ago I’d have assumed those kinds of source were painting an accurate picture, but if you dig deeper you’ll discover they are misleading.<p>A few sources you might care to examine are Gun Culture 2.0, and Open source defense.  Both are written by liberal leaning people.<p>Your list of what the majority of gun owners support is what I said people support - background checks.  You have expanded it to 4 points.<p>But if you dig into the research, you’ll find that when the issue is explained, the support becomes more equivocal.<p>At least you agree that it’s <i>not that effective</i>.<p>You claim it’s top of mind for a large part of Biden’s base - black people.  I’m quite skeptical about that.  Black people are currently the fastest growing demographic of gun owners.  They are also going to be the targets of new gun laws - not the beneficiaries.<p>Gun control means armed police taking guns from black people at gunpoint, and black people being criminalized.<p>Are you really saying <i>that</i> is top of mind for black people?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;handwaving-freakoutery&#x2F;guns-guide-to-liberals-podcast-1-racism-and-gun-control-9a26c45d613" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;handwaving-freakoutery&#x2F;guns-guide-to-libe...</a><p>More importantly, even if you are right, you are making my point for me.<p>My point is that if Biden didn’t have a strong gun control agenda, he would be more palatable to rural Americans and conservatives who don’t actually like Trump.<p>Are you suggesting that Biden would lose black votes to Trump if he dialed back the gun control policy?<p>That sounds completely implausible.<p>It’s not effective policy, and it works to keep moderate Republicans and rural Americans away from Biden.')
