When I&#x27;m researching something I frequently do a site:news.ycombinator.com search on DuckDuckGo to see what HN users have to say about the topic. I&#x27;ve been doing this for a long time, only recently I decided to get over my fear of participating in the internet and created an account to comment now and then when I have something to say.<p>And I can see how participating too much can be unhealthy. It&#x27;s easy to start obsessively refreshing, searching for something new. It&#x27;s easy to get drawn into silly arguments that don&#x27;t really matter, or lengthy discussions of semantics that don&#x27;t really help uncover some new truth. But the benefit of the back-catalog cannot exist if there aren&#x27;t people who share their wisdom, so I hope enough people continue to contribute.')
