Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25657520], score=None, time=1609919728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655481, text='&gt; Does anyone know if pro&#x2F;business accounts with Google GSuite have better privacy than free accounts?<p>Officially, I&#x27;m sure they claim that G-Suite data is not used for any advertising purposes. However, just like I wouldn&#x27;t trust an alcoholic with guarding a warehouse full of booze, I wouldn&#x27;t trust this promise especially considering they intentionally violate the GDPR with a misleading, obnoxious and non-compliant consent form for EU visitors.<p>Furthermore, even if we assume G-Suite data itself is not used, what about general data collected by Google services? For example, a lot of their properties have Google Analytics included - does being logged in a G-Suite account automatically opt you out? What about YouTube (when logging into a G-Suite account you briefly get a redirect to accounts.youtube.com presumably to set a session cookie)? Etc. Given that Google is an advertising company, I can see it being easy for them to collect data they shouldn&#x27;t, even because of an oversight (such as forgetting a &quot;if account.is_g_suite&quot; check, or legacy code predating G-Suite) as opposed to any malicious intent.<p>Not using Google means you don&#x27;t have to interact with Google <i>at all</i> unless you explicitly want to and aren&#x27;t exposed to any of the aforementioned risks.')
