People seek out suffering. &quot;If the Plague Was Today&quot; would make a great comedy. Against the backdrop of imagining black holes, mining asteroids, maneuvering instruments inside the Sun, and developing neurological medicine with genetics, a plague starts a block away from a communist bioweapons lab by a bat, no wait, a armadillo. Why? Communists eat them for supernatural powers.<p>Leading into a heated national election, go on and explain Marxism is just not a lie, but an error that even school children don&#x27;t make. They translated Hegel wrong.<p>Rich need to get richer. Poor, who actually consume more than the rich, loot and burn because of too many or not enough drugs.<p>How do you stop the Plague? Wash your hands. Sneeze into your sleeve. And stop picking up the cheapest piece of ass from your local dive bar. A day after the compromised president is elected, the Plague is cured by a controlled auto-immune deficiency to the entire world.<p>What are the morals of the story, boys and girls?<p>1. Politics does nothing except make people angry, briefly ruining their lives and those directly around them.<p>2. Life isn&#x27;t arbitrary. If anything, our ambition is so great we turned our existence into our origin.<p>3. A command economy is much like running an engine with no back pressure or shooting a cannon off a canoe.<p>4. For whatever reason, the future belongs to one Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson. Guy&#x27;s unstoppable, like the friggin&#x27; Terminator.')
