If the mods that allow me to run Doom on it could also be used by others to run pirated content is another matter that should not be my problem, but the device manufacturer&#x27;s to patch and implement better security on their hardware and software and only go after those who are proven to be involved in piracy, not after the tool makers.<p>If a burglar uses a B0sch powertool to break into my house, should I go after B0sch for making tools that allow criminals to engage in illegal activities?')
