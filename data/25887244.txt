We don&#x27;t use namespaced containers at all at Fly.io, and run everything inside of jailed Firecrackers. But we get enormous value out of container tooling, and the most common and simplest way of deploying something to Fly is simply to have our tooling push a Docker image over to Fly&#x27;s repo.<p>I think containers have been largely a force for good. They&#x27;re not as much a force for good as some might claim, but that&#x27;s a different argument than that they were a waste of time.')
