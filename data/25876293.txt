Design is an iterative process that requires feedback loops with the manufacturing teams (including testing and packaging, which may or may not be a part of the fab).<p>Just an example, the design has to be altered to maximize yields. You don&#x27;t know what the yields are like or what to alter in the design until you make a few chips and test them, which means you need to design the test harnesses, tape out a prototype, and get both to where they need to be. And then try again.<p>If the testing, fab, and design people&#x2F;materials are in different places you have to move things and people around as a part of the process.<p>It&#x27;s just an expensive endeavor that&#x27;s difficult conceptually and logistically, with a lot of institutional knowledge required.')
