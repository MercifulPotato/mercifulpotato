Just one minor clarification:<p>&gt; <i>Maybe read the paper … before assuming that it doesn&#x27;t work</i><p>I don’t assume that. In fact, I <i>know</i> that using ML <i>works</i> on many problems in genetics. What I’m less convinced by is that we can expect a <i>breakthrough</i> due to ML any time soon, partly because conventional techniques (including ML) already have a handle on some current problems in genetics, and because there isn’t really a specific (or flashy) hard, algorithmic problem like there is in structural biology. Rather, there’s lots of stuff where I expect to see steady incremental improvement. In fact, in Wikipedia’s list of unsolved biological problems [1] there isn’t a single one that I’d characterise specifically as a question from the field of genetics (as a geneticist, that’s slightly depressing).<p>But my question was even more innocent than that: I’m not even <i>that</i> sceptical, I’m just not aware of anything and genuinely wanted an answer. And the paper you’ve posted might provide just that, so go and do my research now.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_unsolved_problems_in_biology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_unsolved_problems_in_b...</a>')
