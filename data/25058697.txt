The fact that the stipend might be considerable more money in their home country, does not necessarily mean that in PPP terms - phd grads are better off than say, a &#x27;developed country&#x27; individual.<p>If you moved to a developed country with higher living standard costs with higher salary than your home country. Even though, you earned considerably more than your home country; the money might be nothing more than minimum wage in your new place of residence.<p>Comparing developed country humans to developing country humans&#x27;s expectations just adds more fuel to the assumption that people from poor countries are happy to work for less.
