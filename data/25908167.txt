They primarily showed ads, but also had a camera pointed at you, so you&#x27;d be watching an ad and then it would switch to showing your face. The camera also tilted and would begin tilting down. It would get your heart racing, but it only tilted down a few degrees before it tilted back up so it never showed your dangley bits.')
