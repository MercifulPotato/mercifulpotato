No one wants to tune into a noir PI show and watch struggles to pay the bills and roommate drama. And don&#x27;t be ridiculous, there are tons of shows that show people living in shitty conditions.<p>The articles premise is that TV drama, shows people struggling to pay rent while living in palatial apartments. They do so, not because all TV producers and writers are crazy classists, but because it&#x27;s much easier to fit a film crew and studio lighting into a large apartment than your average real-sized Manhattan studio.<p>Writers understand this and lampshade it by giving various excuses, for example in Friends the large apartment was an inheritance from one rich-girls&#x27; grandparents, or in Jessica Jones, the building is falling apart and in a bad neighborhood so she gets a deal on rent because her presence keeps away undesirables. However, the article rightly claims this is classist. That&#x27;s true in a &#x27;fridge logic&#x27;[1] sense, but you have to suspend your disbelief if you actually want to watch the show.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;pmwiki.php&#x2F;Main&#x2F;FridgeLogic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;pmwiki.php&#x2F;Main&#x2F;FridgeLogic</a>')
