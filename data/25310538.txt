Getting the experience can only happen in time I direct. I have scope to use F# at work but still fear that choice is not the best for the company I work for. Yes I will love the tooling and right now I&#x27;m there but it won&#x27;t always be that way. They won&#x27;t be able to find contractors to make changes in the future. I have to give them solutions they can run with in the future or they will be forever regretting me once I&#x27;m gone.')
