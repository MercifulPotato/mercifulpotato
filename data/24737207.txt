Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[24737225], score=None, time=1602314866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737165, text='&quot;Completely unbuffered&quot; is almost unattainable in practice, so I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a reasonable inference. About the best you can do in general is not do any buffering yourself, and usually explicitly bypass whatever buffering is going on at the next level of abstraction down. Ensuring you&#x27;ve cut out <i>all</i> buffering in the entire IO stack takes real effort.')
