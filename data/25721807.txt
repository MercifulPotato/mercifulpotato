KKK members have been silenced by most businesses.<p>Is it theoretically possible that someone at Twitter or FB could decide that Democrats were the only acceptable party and try to silence everyone else?<p>Yes, that is possible, but it also possible that they will continue to apply the policies the same way going forward. If I didn&#x27;t like a change they made political or otherwise I would quit, just like I quit digg years ago.')
