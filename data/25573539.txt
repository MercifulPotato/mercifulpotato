The animations look so fake. I think the issue is that they&#x27;re aggressively smoothing the motion since mechanical systems don&#x27;t have the ability to accelerate &amp; jerk as fast as biological systems. Cheap mocap animation has the same problem because the frame rate of the capture system is too low. They interpolate between captured keyframes which results in the wrong velocities in the end.')
