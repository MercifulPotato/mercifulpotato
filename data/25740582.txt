Physics used to go by the name of &quot;natural philosophy&quot;, for instance.<p>Personally, I do associate the word with a meaning closer to &quot;attitude&quot; under certain circumstances. Stoicism and the contemporary Epicurianism are practical philosophies (attitudes) for living an ordinary life, not grandiose frameworks of thought.')
