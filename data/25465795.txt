Now we can write whatever is on our mind in the search box, even with typos, and 95% of the time, we get exactly what we are looking for.<p>I feel like this part has actually gotten worse in the last few years. No matter what I search for it&#x27;s very rarely the thing I&#x27;m actually looking for, at least on google. Most of the time it&#x27;s SEO&#x27;ed to hell in order to sell me stuff, and google will happily cut out half of my query just in order to show me promoted results. Like, when I search for &quot;C# programming &lt;name of class&gt;&quot; why is the &lt;name of class&gt; cut out and the entire first page of results is just paid programming courses???? That&#x27;s a lot worse than it was just 5 years ago. We&#x27;re going back on usability just to extract more money.')
