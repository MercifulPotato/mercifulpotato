Docking stations only go so far as high resolution monitor&#x2F;power passthrough and for those of use who end up using those features daily, our machines look like they were blessed by the flying spaghettis monster. 2-3 more USB-c ports would be a boon.  Even freeing up one extra with a maglock power connector would be lovely.<p>I catch my Bride doing her photography workflow on her old, replaced macbook because it has the sdcard handy, she won&#x27;t mess with the rat&#x27;s nest in her office, and lord knows where the half a dozen dongles went.')
