I was in a programming bootcamp there was someone in my cohort on a temporary visa to the US. He managed to stay in a decently expensive area near our bootcamp, paid the bootcamp fee, and other cost of living. We asked him how, he said he was selling bitcoin to fund it. He sold it at $500 each.<p>If I calculated correctly he probably sold more than 20 bitcoin lol. He could retire now if he kept it.<p>Imagine how he feels right now, lol. But as long as he made profit, that&#x27;s all that matters. Hindsight always 20&#x2F;20')
