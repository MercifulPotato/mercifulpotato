For example, while it&#x27;s true that there is no ifconfig by default in Ubuntu (it&#x27;s provided by a package called net-tools), one can read this:<p>&gt; In 2009, Red Hat decided to deprecate ifconfig as the default command line network interface management utility, because the “net-tools” package (which provides ifconfig) did not support InfiniBand addresses (commonly used interconnect in high-performance computing applications).<p>So, many of the things that make Ubuntu look like a new OS to you, were actually decisions made by RedHat years ago, and they will also be present in newer RHEL versions.')
