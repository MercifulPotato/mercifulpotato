Deplatforming people over truly just opinions or mannerisms is a temporary win.<p>When people <i>know</i> their opinions are generally considered reprehensible, they hide them. I can agree with that.<p>But if those opinions are successfully hidden or pushed underground, and the next generation is <i>predominantly</i> exposed to positive values, the world <i>does</i> become more progressive. Individuals change only a small amount, you&#x27;re right, but <i>society</i> does change for the better over time.<p>It&#x27;s when echo-chambers of intolerance exist that attitudes of intolerance and selfishness can be amplified and push the world in the wrong direction.')
