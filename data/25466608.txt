Item(by='Pamar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608296318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465416, text='This is a common problem when you receive csv from someone working in a different country: comma is a decimal separator in some cases (e.g.: Germany) so Excel will automatically switch to semicolon for separators.\nSo now your colleague in the UK office (or even someone who simply prefers using Windows in with US locale, or, as in my case, got a UK laptop because the German keyboards has some layout differences to what they consider &quot;normal&quot;...) double clicks on the &quot;German&quot; .csv... Excel will show (most of the time) every line as a single FIELD.<p>So you have to close it and use Data Import.<p>We just moved to the latest version of Office 365 at the job and it still works like this (even if the import action can usually figure out that semicolon is the separator without me having to manually specify it...).')
