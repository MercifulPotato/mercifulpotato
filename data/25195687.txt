Lithium iron phosphate batteries don&#x27;t go into thermal runaway and will not blow up from the &quot;nail test&quot;, where a nail is driven into the battery. It&#x27;s a safer chemistry, but lower energy density. It found a niche in pro hand power tools for a while, but even there, lost out.<p>BYD is trying to turn that around. They always liked lithium iron phosphate technology, and now they&#x27;re going back to it, with a new design, the &quot;blade battery&quot;[1] More KWH per cubic meter, even if KWH per kilogram isn&#x27;t much higher. Also, no nickel or cobalt, so the materials cost is lower.<p>This could be interesting for fixed applications. If it sits in your garage, or on a concrete pad at a power station, you don&#x27;t care too much about how much it weighs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dIt5z4wT9RE?t=616" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dIt5z4wT9RE?t=616</a>')
