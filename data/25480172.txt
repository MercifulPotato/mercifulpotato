Commerce is inherently visible (because it necessarily involves other people).  What you own is private.<p>The cost of even figuring out your net worth is substantial and would still be borne by people nowhere near the threshold... in fact, in the case of this bill <i>everyone</i> is required to report their assets to the state.
