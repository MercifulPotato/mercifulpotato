Every day you read the news try to take a look through and find a negative story. I guarantee you the day will never come.<p>It absolutely blows my mind that people can say something like &quot;CNN is relatively unbiased&quot;, and yet nearly 100% of every (political) story follows the same pattern: In the last four years I don&#x27;t remember a single CNN headline that was positive of Trump. Of course you can say that he&#x27;s a complete screw up that never once in four years did a single positive thing, but if you&#x27;re honest with yourself, you know that&#x27;s not true. The same way that in the next four years they won&#x27;t publish a single negative article about Biden, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s a saint that never once did anything that could be reported on negatively. That people can&#x27;t see how insanely biased these sources are really blows my mind. The proof is there for you to see - how many months or years will it take before you see a single negative story about Biden?')
