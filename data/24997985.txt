Most recipes involve boiling the mixture for around an hour, and you want to reach boiling quickly. If your heat pump is only at 120C you would need a lot of surface area which makes cleaning difficult.  On top of this reaching 120C via heat pump is inefficient and the heat pump ends up being expensive.')
