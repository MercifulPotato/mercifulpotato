Since the Linux kernel is GPLed (v2, I believe?), does this mean that the number of GPL requests related to products&#x27; operating systems is likely to increase, since groups using this extensibility will be writing code covered by the GPL which might actually be of value to other people? Or does the way io_uring and eBPF are implemented isolate the code in such a way that the extensions through their frameworks such that the GPL license won&#x27;t affect them?')
