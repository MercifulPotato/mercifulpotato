If its a database library, then ok, maybe it can stick to a subset of database features that works across all supported databases, but in that case, testing against these databases is no longer a &quot;Forcing Function&quot;, but a core part of the libraries test suite to ensure correctness.<p>The same goes for platform code, really. If you are advertising your platform to work with databases X, Y and Z, then you really need to be testing against those and not just as a Forcing Function to see if any brittleness crept in, but as a core part of ensuring your platform does as advertised.')
