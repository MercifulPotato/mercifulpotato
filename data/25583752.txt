(turns out, it gave people heart attacks).<p>Not only have AZ lied about their test plans (claiming that the two differing dose was deliberate in the first press releases), lied about who was at fault with dosing errors (they insisted that the Italians where at fault), &quot;pooled&quot; results with different populations to try and make a argument they were not testing for (which critically didn&#x27;t include people over 55) - they just managed to get the UK to approve a dosing strategy that they never even tested.<p>It&#x27;s a pandemic - and the UK has invested a lot in both loves and national prestige in this vaccine. But the shortcuts here may come back to haunt. Or it may be what stops this disease in it&#x27;s tracks.<p>it&#x27;s a hell of a gamble either way..')
