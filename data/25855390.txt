I often workout specific muscle groups and cycle through different exercises to target each, so this tool very nicely aligns with that. The videos are a great touch to help me make sure I have proper form. And overall seems to entirely avoid &quot;broscience.&quot;<p>One feature request: list what complementary muscles each exercise targets (e.g. list &quot;triceps&quot; when displaying dips as a chest exercise).
