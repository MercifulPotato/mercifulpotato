And Apple&#x27;s gross margins have been in the 30-35% range for many years. This isn&#x27;t a shareholder issue. They are by far the most profitable computer&#x2F;gadget manufacturer around.<p><i>So it was reasonable for them to expect to beat Intel&#x27;s 14nm++++++ with TSMC&#x27;s 5nm, but what happens now that AMD is no longer dead and is using TSMC too?</i><p>No matter what AMD does in the short term, they&#x27;re not going to beat the performance per watt of the M1, let alone the graphics, the Neural Engine and the rest of components of Apple&#x27;s SoC. It&#x27;s not just 14nm vs. 5nm; it&#x27;s also ARM’s architecture vs. x86-64.<p>Apple has scaled A series production for more than a decade and nobody has caught them yet in iPhone&#x2F;iPad performance. There were 64-bit iPhones for at least a year before Qualcomm and other ARM licensees could catch up.<p>There&#x27;s no evidence or reason to believe it&#x27;ll be any different with the M series in laptops and desktops.')
