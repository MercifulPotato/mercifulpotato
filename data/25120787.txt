After that, life is heaven for you because you now have access to all the convenience of the myriad e-commerce websites and apps.<p>Any other visitors would have tough time getting train tickets, booking accommodations, renting bicycles, hell, even buying from vending machines or automated convenience stores, because people really don&#x27;t use cash anymore, but the system is really only designed for domestic users without much thought for short-term visitors and tourists.')
