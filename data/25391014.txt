It doesn&#x27;t guarantee your speech a right to have instant reach to millions of people. Facebook &quot;censoring&quot; someone is no different than a newspaper in the 20th century deciding to not publish your letter, or a book publisher refusing to publish your book, or a store owner removing your graffiti from their window. You had a right in 20th century to say anything you want to whomever you wanted. If you wanted to reach a ton of people at the same time, you either built that reach manually or you had to convince someone (TV, radio, book publisher) to help you. And it is the same today. You can say whatever you want to a friend, coworker, family member. And you can also say whatever you want to every citizen in the USA. But you&#x27;re not guaranteed a right of any company to help you in that endeavor. If Facebook, Youtube, Amazon, Paypal don&#x27;t want to help you in reaching people it is their right to do so. Youtube blocked you? Make your own website. Amazon doesn&#x27;t want to sell your book? Print it yourself.<p>Claiming that Facebook or Twitter deleting someone&#x27;s content is censorship because you have a right for your speech to have a huge reach would mean that there was no free speech anytime in history, except for a brief period of time when social media appeared before they started &quot;censoring&quot;')
