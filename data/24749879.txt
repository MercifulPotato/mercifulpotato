Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[24750109, 24750098], score=None, time=1602457505, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24749799, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t know why the Justice Department is rushing a case on search dominance, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t make sense to target Chrome.<p>Because Google has an abusive search monopoly that harms consumers by providing a shitty experience and there are very few alternatives. First they built their monopoly, through a combination of producing an exceptional product and then gradually building moats around it; then once it was entrenched they started squeezing out competitors in their results (eating the ecosystem) and providing an ever worsening service as they focused on maximizing revenue extraction at the cost of service quality.<p>Google is providing a mediocre service by their own early (and correct) definition. They&#x27;re aggressively violating numerous things they spelled out as hallmarks of bad search engines in the beginning of the company. Their product sucks by their own words.<p>Google has a browser monopoly and it has been integral to providing a moat for their search monopoly (which is one of the reasons they did it; as with Android). It absolutely makes sense to target that gigantic moat protecting their search monopoly. The search monopoly requires the moats to survive long-term at this point, since their search service is getting worse by the year. Peel off the moats shielding it from competition and the search engine either has to improve considerably, or competition will start eating its market share.<p>IE, Edge, Firefox and Opera are all de facto dead. The only browsers remaining that have a user base of significant size are Chrome and Safari mobile. It&#x27;s not enough competition to only have two companies (both trillion dollar companies at that) providing the browsers for nearly all Internet users globally.')
