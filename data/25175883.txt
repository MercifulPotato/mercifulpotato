I would want to run this on ~100 files in a folder.<p>This takes a few lines of calls to imagemagick&#x2F;gm or ~10 lines of python + Pillow.<p>Do you have any resources how to do this in GIMP?<p>After googling for a good while, I could not for the life of me figure out how to even get started with this.<p>I don&#x27;t want to write an extension for GIMP - I want to use GIMP like I would an image manipulation library.')
