Overall, I&#x27;ve submitted 100+ AI&#x2F;ML submissions to date.  Generally, FDA has been really focused on locked algorithms even though there has been some guidance lately stating the the new Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP) will provide some allowance for iterations without submitting new 510ks. I will say that a number of companies are slightly tuning their algorithms without FDA resubmission within the confines of the FDA Guidance &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;regulatory-information&#x2F;search-fda-guidance-documents&#x2F;deciding-when-submit-510k-software-change-existing-device" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;regulatory-information&#x2F;search-fda-guidan...</a>&quot;.
