The code will never free you from the burden of having to specific exactly what you want.<p>In my mind it&#x27;s less about freeing the user from specificity, but just changing the language under which that specificity happen. Honestly it&#x27;s just syntax! Imagine something like:<p>&gt; open file on disk at &quot;&#x2F;some&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;a&#x2F;file&quot; into $my_file_handle. read contents of file handle $my_file_handle into new variable $contents. print $contents to standard output.<p>Imagine every sentence just being a textual template for a function invocation, with context in-between functions (state) being preserved and managed implicitly with the use of variable names &amp; prose. signatures for the functions required would be something like:<p>- open_file (path: string): file_handle<p>- read_bytes(fh: file_handle): string<p>- print(s: string): void<p>We already have functions like this and compose them in ways that the text suggests -- it&#x27;s more about just adding a different way to group and recall up the composed functionality.')
