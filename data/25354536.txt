If it takes state-level resources to breach their systems, then they can just announce and put out an open prize for anybody who can breach their systems that pays out less than state-level resources. If it actually takes state-level resources to breach their systems, but pays out less than that, then it would be unprofitable for people to claim their prize and provide pretty good evidence for their security. However, if somebody does claim the prize, then we can reasonably assume that their security level is less than the prize as it is profitable for somebody to claim the prize despite the unknown level of risk involved in a blind uncontracted penetration test.<p>So, what do we all think would be a level of resources that only a state could support? I think we can just start somewhere pretty low like $1,000,000,000. Fortune 500 companies and many criminal organizations could reasonably afford that, but the total number of organizations is still pretty limited, so it is probably a good lower bound. I do not think we can go much lower because if we drop down to $100,000,000 then even FireEye, which is not a Fortune 500 company, could theoretically fund such a venture with its revenue of $890,000,000.<p>Okay, so starting with &quot;only a state&quot; resource level of $1,000,000,000, we should probably divide it by 10 to make it highly unlikely people will do it just to prove they can even if it is unprofitable to get the prize. That leaves us with a simple open prize of $100,000,000 for the first person to demonstrate that they can breach their systems. If nobody claims the prize, then it is highly likely that this attack would take a state-level actor. If somebody does claim the prize, then it is probably doable by somebody who is not a state-level actor. This would provide an unbiased answer about the truth of their implications. If they think such a prize is too high, then they can just set it to a lower X that will give us an unbiased answer to the question: &quot;Does it take more than X resources to breach their systems?&quot;')
