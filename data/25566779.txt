Item(by='jcrawfordor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609216673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563822, text='I asked a flight school instructor about a part 107 license a while back and his response was &quot;you want one? say the word and you&#x27;ll have it by lunch.&quot; The only requirement is passing a written exam which he said was very easy compared to the private pilot exam.<p>The hardest thing about getting the part 107 license might actually be getting the identification form signed, since it needs to be done by an official. If you take the exam at a flight school they&#x27;ll probably offer to have a CFI do it for you (for a fee I&#x27;m sure), but if you take the exam at a non-flight-specific testing center you might have to make a trip to a FSDO or call a CFI and see if they&#x27;ll do it. It would help with the accessibility of the 107 license if they got rid of the somewhat arcane proof of identity rules inherited from other pilot&#x27;s licenses.')
