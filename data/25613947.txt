In Manhattan, for example, you fairly frequently hear about restaurants that seem to be popular and busy all the time closing because they couldn&#x27;t keep up with rent increases. And yet it&#x27;s also somehow full of corner stores, gift shops, laundromats, pizza places, Chinese restaurants, lunch buffets, etc. etc. that no one ever seems to go into and have 2 stars on Yelp, but are still there year after year.<p>I figured that in some cases it could be a family that owns the building or a sweetheart lease deal or whatever, but there are just so many that it doesn&#x27;t seem to add up.')
