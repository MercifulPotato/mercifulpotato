Item(by='saagarjha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611908630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954958, text='Security researchers sometime publish informative blog posts from time to time that don&#x27;t deal with a specific vulnerability; this is one of them. Of course, being Project Zero usually these deep dives often turn up a bug or two (for example, this document on Apple&#x27;s PAC implementation, which is probably one of the best resources describing it, stumbles upon a bug fixed by Apple while it was being written: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleprojectzero.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;examining-pointer-authentication-on.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleprojectzero.blogspot.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;examining-poi...</a>), but this case it does seem like they just happened to not find anything. Whether that is because they couldn&#x27;t probe very deeply due to the complete rewrite, or because the new architecture and use of a memory safe language upped the bar a bit (or a combination of both) is not clear but the thing I wanted to say here is that these blog posts are useful regardless of whether there is an exploit PoC attached. People may not want to write them, but they certainly stand on their own as good reference material.')
