On the remaining devices Apple doesn&#x27;t let you run software Apple has blacklisted.</i><p>It&#x27;s not like Apple forced you to buy a Mac or an iPhone. If anything you have to go out of your way to get one, because you see some appeal in them - as otherwise they&#x27;re more expensive, with limited model choice, less bang for the buck, and a minority market share wise compared to most PC&#x2F;Android stuff.<p>So, perhaps those buying them know what they&#x27;re doing? Walled garden (aka &quot;curation&quot;) for many is part of the appeal.')
