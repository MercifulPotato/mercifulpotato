And yet in every debate on this subject some people will claim that they are running Linux without experiencing any of these problems. They can&#x27;t all be lying can they? So what gives?<p>I believe it all comes down to selecting the right hardware. The way I&#x27;ve been trying Linux was to install it on some machine I had lying around (mostly Acer, Asus, MacBook, no-name towers). Apparently, that&#x27;s not how it works.<p>I remember back in 1990s and early 2000s it was hit and miss whether or not Linux would install on a particular machine. Then over time things improved and you could install it on almost any machine.<p>Some Linux enthusiasts celebrated this achievement by claiming loudly that Linux now &quot;just works&quot;. They couldn&#x27;t possibly have done a greater disservice to the desktop Linux movement, because that&#x27;s just not true.<p>It doesn&#x27;t just work. It just installs. And then it&#x27;s crushingly disappointing on most machines.<p>My next Linux attempt will be on one of those known good hardware configurations. Anything else is just a waste of time.')
