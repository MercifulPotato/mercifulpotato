Sounds like we need to do some real life space tests! Maybe we can get something going with a central weight and a tether so the test pod can rotate around it at high speeds.<p>Also, I recall there being studies into changing how the inner ear is reacting to movement. Maybe someday space goers will have implants to calm the inner ear against coriolis.')
