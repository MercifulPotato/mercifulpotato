This is different from, say, the C++ standards committee which is a combo of compiler &amp; std library developers (i.e. implementors!), enthusiasts, and some who are best referred to as &quot;users&quot;.<p>Not a criticism of the USBIF* just pointing out the motivations to underline your point.<p>* BTW I have plenty of criticism, this just happens not to be an example.')
