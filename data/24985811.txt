I personally love them for their amazing convenience and they&#x27;re also incredibly compact relative to cars or even bikes.<p>&gt; If the business plan doesn&#x27;t work out, who cleans up the satellites?<p>Cleaning up is essentially free as long as the satellites are still operational: just command them to deorbit. Orbits are low enough that the fuel required to deorbit is comparable to a few months of station-keeping.')
