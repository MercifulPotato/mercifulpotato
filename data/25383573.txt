How about Easy Anti-Cheat? Go to their page at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.easy.ac&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.easy.ac&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;</a>. Guess who develops it?<p>Their <i>store</i> does not install or require this. Specific applications require it for online play (and generally only for online play...)<p>Microsoft does not ban this behavior on any storefront, AFAIK. Having a single storefront would not change this.<p>&gt; Hypothetical monopolistic practices really? Because I vividly Facebook skirting App Store security policies to make users install a privacy invading VPN app, which they also used to gather data on competitors[1].<p>Amusingly this occurred under the current iOS app restrictions, which clearly didn&#x27;t prevent this.<p>An argument could be made for certain high-risk extension point access (such as VPN) could be limited independently of general apps, but the fact that there&#x27;s a bad VPN app is a silly excuse for restricting the install of simple applications.<p>The app sandbox should provide plenty of protection, and if the <i>user</i> opts to give apps permissions, that&#x27;s on their choice. I really don&#x27;t think users are going to install an app store that requires the usage of a sketchy VPN app ...<p>If this were the case, surely it would exist already on android :-)<p>&gt; But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s fine because people have alternatives to Facebook. Or perhaps not[2].<p>[2]: is exactly why we don&#x27;t need to leave Apple&#x27;s monopoly in place to &quot;defeat other monopolies&quot; ... we have other tools for that. Let users (and their representatives etc.) decide.')
