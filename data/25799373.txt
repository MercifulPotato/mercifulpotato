The Java language designers aren’t stupid, and I’m sure they’ve read the complaints, but it still is almost universally agreed upon to be a broken feature of the language.<p>It’s almost never clear if “language feature X” is a good idea until it’s been implemented and battle-tested.  If I have a new idea on how to build something in a compiler and I’m not sure if it’s a good idea, are you saying that the best path forward would be for me to make a PR to javac instead of building a proof of concept language?')
