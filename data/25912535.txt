Decisions that do not rest on the merits, however, are not bound by res judicata because the claims were not properly heard. Thus, these claims may be brought forth in a subsequent case, <i>excluding dismissals due to a failure to state a claim.</i><p>In addition, from <i>Federated Department Stores, Inc. v. Moitie</i> [0]:<p>&gt; The dismissal for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is a &quot;judgment on the merits.&quot; See Angel v. Bullington, 330 U. S. 183, 330 U. S. 190 (1947); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.
