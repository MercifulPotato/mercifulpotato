I think Cortex-M3 has a 3 stage pipeline, obviously I would not expect the 0.01$ chinese ones to have one.<p>It&#x27;s worth saying here, that a big ooo CPU is pipelines differently to a small&#x2F;old risc processor - even amongst discussions about compiler optimizations people still use terminology like pipeline stall, when a modern CPU has a pipeline that handles fetching an instruction window, finding dependencies, doing register renaming and execution, that pipeline is not like an old IF-&gt;IF-&gt;EX-&gt;MEM-&gt;WB - it won&#x27;t stall in the same way a pentium 5 did. The execution pipes themselves have a more familiar structure.')
