Clearly, it isn&#x27;t.<p>There are people I know from mailing lists and newsgroups and fora who are my acquaintances, even though we&#x27;ve never met in meatspace. I have cried over their deaths and been happy at news of their joys.<p>There are people I remember from tens of years and thousands of miles away, whom I hear from more regularly because of social media networks. That&#x27;s nice. It&#x27;s low effort for me, it&#x27;s low effort for them, and we all get more out of it than we put in.<p>If what you mean by the word &quot;friend&quot; is, someone who will answer your call in the middle of the night and bring over a shovel and a tarp -- I have only a few of those. Those relationships take more work, and are not fully sustained by social media, though they may be partially supported by it.')
