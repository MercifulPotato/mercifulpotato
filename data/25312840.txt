Something is seriously wrong if we don&#x27;t value efficiency.  Having many separate retail shops creates massive inefficiencies, especially for commodity products.<p>Amazon can get most products to my house at near lowest market rates in a day or two.  Sometimes the same day.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t Amazon, it&#x27;s our reaction to this newfound efficiency.  We&#x27;re eventually going to end up in a place where having humans doing most work is objectively worse than having robots do it.<p>What we&#x27;re doing now can&#x27;t sustain, but going back to a pre-Amazon model of retail is not a viable path forward.<p>Also, working retail sucks.  We should be glad when it dies entirely.')
