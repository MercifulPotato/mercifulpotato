Try to learn something new at your job every day. If you go several weeks without learning anything new, start looking for another job. Even if you&#x27;re only a few months into your current one, doesn&#x27;t matter. The job market is great, and you can spin it in a positive way. I&#x27;ve been asked about it in interviews, and my answer is that I work hard to make a positive impact every day I work somewhere, and to ensure that even if I work somewhere just one day, they are glad to have hired me.<p>While you&#x27;re doing this, start looking for a problem that you want to solve. This is typically born out of your own pain point, or someone close to you. Start working on it, and looking for a way to solve it in a way that is beneficial to you. Typically, this means providing support for your software in return for something else, either money or barter.<p>Do not allow yourself to invest emotionally into your money work, because, as you have seen above, it is disappointing. Remember the college course strategy above, and don&#x27;t allow yourself to be upset by work bullshit.<p>While you&#x27;re doing all this, minimize your lifestyle expenses and save your money. This will provide you with runway when you&#x27;re ready to lift off your startup, while at the same time extending the length of runway each dollar provides.<p>Good luck! Based on how you described yourself, I believe without a doubt you have what it takes to achieve happiness in this field.<p>BTW, I noticed your other post about textfile-driven development, and I am working on just such a project. I use SQLite for an accessible index, but I insist on human-readable text for both config and data for the base. You can learn more about it via my profile.')
