Item(by='jedberg', descendants=None, kids=[25200995], score=None, time=1606239394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197065, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of unused echos, chromecasts, etc.<p>At this point I already have so many devices in my house it won&#x27;t matter if I add more.  I gave up my privacy for convince a long time ago.  Let me know if you&#x27;d like me to take those off your hands. :)<p>&gt; Shopping at 3 different online retailers vs 1 isn&#x27;t that much of an added inconvenience<p>I&#x27;ve tried ordering direct from the manufacturer.  It&#x27;s true that authenticity is higher, but everything else is worse.  Do I have to pay shipping?  How much will be it?  I need to put in my credit card again, will it be safe?  Will I get any cash back on my purchase?   With Amazon, I already know, shipping is free, my 5% cash back card will be default and is secure.  It literally takes me a less than 20 seconds to buy something on Amazon if I already know what I want.<p>&gt; Who is working in an amazon warehouse right now and actually having a good time of it?<p>I know one person who works at an Amazon warehouse.  She says it&#x27;s the best job she&#x27;s ever had.  She&#x27;s extremely grateful to be working right now in a good job with a flexible schedule, because she&#x27;s a single mom in nursing school.  Anecdata of course, she&#x27;s just one person.  But in my sample set of 1, there is 100% satisfaction.')
