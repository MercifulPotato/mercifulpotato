Something like a few days of 2&quot; per day, then a decent dusting every night, would be excellent. With many of us looking for nice outdoor activities during COVID times, thus far it&#x27;s been an awful winter.<p>We got a bit of snow, then some rain, and all the packed snow on trails and paths where people walk, hike, run, and bike have become sheets of ice. Snow is great for outdoor winter stuff, but ice is really hard to deal with.')
