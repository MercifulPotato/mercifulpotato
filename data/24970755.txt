I found streaming (and restreaming) RTP fairly straightforward but annoying to setup with gst-launch (there seems to be no simple option to get an SDP file out, apparently you are meant to lovingly handcraft one from the debug log).<p>But I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to stream RTSP, especially not in a way that would preserve NTP timestamp information when restreaming (for synchronization with other streams). There is gst-rtsp-server, but as far as I can tell the idea is that you use it as a library to build your own custom server code.<p>Is there a simple way I was missing?')
