I honestly can’t identify with your comments in the slightest. The <i>only</i> part of math that I <i>ever</i> learned by memorization was addition and multiplication tables in elementary school. Every subsequent revelation was based on pure understanding - zero repetition required. Up to what level of math have you studied? I honestly can’t imagine anyone thinking they’re good at undergrad-level math if they do it by memorization rather than understanding.')
