I&#x27;m actually having trouble identifying myself to the government right now, because I lost my records in a recent move.  It&#x27;s a real problem, but ultimately I found a workaround in meatspace.  That is, the workaround grants me access... but there&#x27;s an unresolved issue: whoever&#x27;s got that box of my records has everything they need to steal my identity.  Is &quot;the blockchain&quot; going to prevent situations like this? Replace &quot;lose a box of records&quot; with data loss and&#x2F;or exfiltration and you&#x27;re in the same situation except perhaps that the &quot;better mousetrap&quot; will prevent the meatspace workaround from functioning.')
