I&#x27;m about 35 and I&#x27;ve been depressed for the past 20 years. I now have a relatively high paying job in a startup working remotely from a house I own in a forest. That was my dream, and it&#x27;s great when I think about it.<p>But I live alone and I have no friends IRL. I&#x27;ve been practicing social distancing way before it was cool, and like most people it&#x27;s affecting me. I&#x27;ve been alone without friends or lovers in major cities for most of my life before so the isolation with or without people around is not new.<p>Before covid I used to go to a few festivals or camps every year and do environmental activism regularly, and that&#x27;d keep the loneliness at bay, although the connections with the people I&#x27;d meet were superficial and short lived.<p>Being into environmental activism means that I don&#x27;t see the current world situation in a very positive way to say the least. And my job, while high paying, offer no meaning at all to my life. But it pays for everything else and that&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve traveled without money for a couple of years before and it was great, but I prefer the security money give me in the capitalist society I&#x27;m trapped in.<p>I think about suicide a lot, but I&#x27;d never do it because of how it&#x27;d affect my parents and sibling, they are great and don&#x27;t deserve that. I also like to live a life of contemplation in the forest and hacking stuff and following new scientific discoveries, it&#x27;s just the craving for intimacy and companionship that ruins everything. Maybe when I get older I&#x27;ll learn to fully let got of it, it&#x27;s already a bit easier that a decade ago.<p>I guess the answer is probably to talk about all of that to a therapist, but I&#x27;ve been trying for years to make myself see one without success for now.')
