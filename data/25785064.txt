They&#x27;re typically managed and written by engineering firms, who hire other scientist and specialists as needed for contributions.<p>They almost universally have an archeological survey as a component, to ensure no major or unknown sites are accidentally bulldozed.<p>They&#x27;re required for almost any government project, as well as many&#x2F;most large scale private projects.<p>There are variations based on type of project and scale, but it serves as the document used by government officials to review a project before it&#x27;s permitted.<p>Not just an office or two, but dozens, or even hundreds of offices. Responses are given with official govt input, including requested changes. But often it&#x27;s simply a letter waiving topical or geographic jurisdiction, or simply a letter of no objection.<p>Once approved, it&#x27;s all but a green light to proceed, politically.<p>Which is why you sue if you know what it&#x27;s going to say, and don&#x27;t like it.')
