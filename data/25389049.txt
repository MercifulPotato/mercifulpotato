The Turing Machine was a landmark achievement useful for reasoning about the limits of computation, but where is it today?  Have you tried building anything out of a Turing machine (assuming you had infinite tape)?  It&#x27;s basically Brainfuck.  Church&#x27;s Lambda Calculus predates it and is still useful.')
