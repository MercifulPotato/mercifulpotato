Everyone&#x27;s different, but for me self-awareness was the key. Mindfulness and breathing exercises (very close to the same thing unless you get deep into MM) are both about processing your various physical and mental reactions. That makes them especially applicable towards breaking vicious cycles like the one I&#x27;d gotten in, where I was freaked out in part because of the symptoms so it became self-perpetuating.<p>I don&#x27;t want to paint these as silver bullets. I still deal with my anxiety disorder on a regular basis. I just feel more able to look at it in third person a little to defuse some of the worst bits.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m always hesitant when someone uses the word advice, so I gave a vaguer reply than I needed to. I won&#x27;t give advice but will give a little more detail.<p>Looking at the original list, the specific ones there I also have tried to improve with varying success are stoic philosophy, nutrition and fitness. But I&#x27;ll also add sleep, since of them, sleep has had the most immediate effect that I&#x27;ve noticed. However, there&#x27;s a chicken&#x2F;egg thing there if you&#x27;re too uncomfortable to sleep. I used a short course of sleep meds, but those have their own risks so YMMV.<p>Stoic philosophy is good to aspire to, but it&#x27;s more end goal than technique IMO. It&#x27;s a good thought yardstick, though, for what you &quot;should&quot; be feeling if you can step outside yourself a little.')
