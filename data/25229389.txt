Item(by='yakubin', descendants=None, kids=[25232969], score=None, time=1606490875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228984, text='<i>&gt; Why did Chez and Racket embrace R6RS, a standard widely rejected by the rest of the Scheme community?</i><p>Why wouldn&#x27;t they? The usual rationale for rejecting R6RS is that it&#x27;s somehow &quot;too big&quot;. But Racket already has a library whose size blows R6RS out of the water. So this rationale is irrelevant in this context. Also, Chez Scheme is an implementation detail. R6RS is only one of many languages that you may use through Racket.<p>And what is this &quot;Scheme community&quot; that rejected R6RS? It&#x27;s always been my impression that it was rejected by authors of toy implementations. Is there actually any data on what portion of people who use Scheme (as opposed to write another implementation of it) reject R6RS?')
