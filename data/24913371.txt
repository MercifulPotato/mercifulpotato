It&#x27;s a task humans are bad at and machines are good at, so just giving it to machines makes more sense, modulo unions.<p>London Underground hasn&#x27;t had guards for decades at this point, and the Docklands Light Railway hasn&#x27;t even had drivers (there is a member of staff who is trained to be <i>able</i> to drive it on every train, but they are usually doing other things) since its creation. If they&#x27;re misaligning often enough for it to be possible for New York to be statistically better I haven&#x27;t seen anything about it after repeatedly asking.')
