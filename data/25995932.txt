This can get tedious as the number of listings get large and needing to share them multiple times a day.<p>My S.O would often complain about this, and I took a look online to see if there is any software that automates this.\nNot surprisingly, there were bunch of chrome extensions that allowed auto-sharing. What was surprising to me was, they were all subscription-paid services, with some trial.<p>Why is something so simple to develop gate-kept as paid services?<p>This frustrated me enough to do some research and make my own chrome extension that auto shares the closet, including an auto-load function that was missing(but highly needed) from all the other extensions.<p>So here is my own completely free auto share extension. Spread the love to all the Poshmark vendors! No more paying for this ridiculously simple program.<p>Link:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Keon-Kim-0&#x2F;Poshmark-Auto-Share&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;README.md')
