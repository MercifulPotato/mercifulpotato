Hell, the ads aren&#x27;t even targeted to a specific user, only to the audience of a paper or TV network.<p>Yet, when I open a paper or turn on the TV, there are plenty of paid advertisements. Why would the web need to be any different ?<p>Don&#x27;t charge for clicks, just charge for showing the ad. Don&#x27;t target ads based on personal data collected from users, target them based on the content of the page they&#x27;re shown on. You know, just like TV and print ads have always done.')
