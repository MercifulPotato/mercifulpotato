It seems to do better with language bindings too. GTK being a C API seems to make it a lot easier to auto-generate bindings for any language with an FFI. Qt, being both primarily a C++ API, and also with the custom preprocessor and signal&#x2F;slot nonsense seems like it&#x27;s much harder to make sensible bindings for.')
