Now I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m convinced that people are ready for it.\nI&#x27;ve invested significant effort in working and having a job, and, I wouldn&#x27;t have have done that if I knew I could have still &quot;gotten by&quot; without, I&#x27;d definitely not be where I am today without that outside pressure to _not_fail_. I&#x27;d be probably dead or at least morbidly obese from doing nothing but sitting and watching TV&#x2F;playing videogames.<p>I&#x27;m actually more in favor of entirely removing any economic support, that people can use to buy what they _want_, I&#x27;d much rather give people what they _need_ to survive, anything beyond that (tobacco, alcohol, entertainment, fashion clothing, cars, etc..) should be the privilege earned by working.')
