Children frequently demonstrate the same behavior. Laugh at the kid with X problem until you have a problem yourself, and now you dislike bullies.<p>Growing older and realizing <i>in general</i> that things you did when you were younger are bad is fine and dandy, and indeed is &quot;growing up&quot;.<p>But only deciding things are bad when they personally effect you has nothing to do with growing older and is not a good look. It&#x27;s just selfish myopia.<p>Being an adult with a consistent moral framework is about being able to say &quot;this is right or wrong&quot;, <i>regardless</i> of if it effects you personally or not. If you only notice something is bad when it happens to you, then that&#x27;s basically what kids do automatically.')
