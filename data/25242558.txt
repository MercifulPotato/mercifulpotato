Higher wages only inflate consumer prices when they are across the board without a corresponding productivity (wealth) increase.<p>Higher wages from one company force the others to compete, and attracts workers from other fields or unemployment, so has two contrasting effects, as  what was formerly a general labor pool splits into a more highly trained group, that retains or increases its pay, and a lower paid group due to the influx of applicants.<p>Amazon retail, considered as a whole, is not a loss leader. The nature of its business adds a peculiar wrinkle to this because its growth pushes consumer prices down further than other wage-raising businesses would, even if they were in fact paying excess wages for no reason indefinitely.')
