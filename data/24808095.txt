It&#x27;s hell to configure if you don&#x27;t have the skill.<p>-  Sharepoint? Again. If you&#x27;re a small business or nonprofit, you&#x27;ve gotta hire or train someone before this is a serious conversation.<p>I would in no way suggest that an enterprise can run on Excel with centralized data and multiple users. And that&#x27;s where I believe a lot of criticism of Excel is unfair: the comparisons are not apples to apples.<p>And let&#x27;s be honest. EVERYTHING comes with a level of human error.<p>-  Enterprise level databases can get so big that the corrupt data in them can be impossible to cleanse.<p>-  Reports made by SQL people are often flawed.<p>Over my 7 years in an international company I discovered report after report that didn&#x27;t accurately match business rules or they were based on loads of incomplete records, duplicates, inconsistencies, incorrect math, etc.<p>How about fixing the reports? Often the decision was &quot;no.&quot; Fixing the reports wasn&#x27;t something a department head wanted to pay a consultant for.<p>Eventually, I had the DBA stop sending me reports. I started exporting the raw data into Excel and made my own reports.<p>-  Brand new reports can be impossible to get if they don&#x27;t justify the cost of a consultant to create the report. (Ah, but there&#x27;s Excel.)<p>-  Databases get hacked and they crash.<p>So. Where&#x27;s the tool that&#x27;s perfect, free and easy to use?\nIt doesn&#x27;t exist.')
