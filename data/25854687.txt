Before someone brings up Fedora, RHEL exercises ultimate control over that too. Think about that, RHEL owns the trademark to Fedora. Feel free to browse their board too.<p>You can argue that Ubuntu provides a counter model to RHEL where only services and select products require a subscription but the OS is otherwise free.')
