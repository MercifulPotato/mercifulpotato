Wealth of people under the age of 40 as a percentage of total wealth has gone from 19 percent to 9 percent in the last 30 years and this is effectively a form of revolution<p>How much of this is just the costs of college spiraling out of control combined with a larger number of people going to college?  I graduated with 60k more in debt than my father from the same school 30 years later.<p>Also do people really care about age dependent income inequality?  Because in time everyone under 40 will eventually be over 40.')
