Sure, I spend less on transport - but on the other hand, the transport system sees less wear and tear (just an example).<p>I spend less on restaurant foods, but I spend more on groceries. So while one part is losing, another is gaining.<p>Obviously these are not - or even anywhere near - a 1:1 ratio. The money I save on fuel, is not spent 100% on something else. But it&#x27;s not like everything I save from WFH goes directly to my savings account - there are things I spend more money on now.<p>The largest saving, IMO, comes from the commute itself. The time saved is fabulous - and really makes you think how much time is wasted on commuting. 2 x 15 mins a day for roughly 240 days, that&#x27;s 120 hours...or 3 full 40-hour weeks! And 15 mins is pretty damn nice to begin with, imagine those that have to commute 1-2 hours every day.')
