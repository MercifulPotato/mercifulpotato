Item(by='fxtentacle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605096860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057476, text='From what I&#x27;ve seen, quite a lot of layers are effectively copies of the original image with global processing applied, e.g. different color temperature, blur, bloom, flare, hdr tone mapping, high-pass filter, local contrast equalization. And then those layers are being blended together using opacity masks.<p>For a model photo shoot retouch, you&#x27;d usually have copy layers with fine skin details (to be overlaid on top) and below that you have layers with more rough skin texture which you blur.<p>Also, quite a lot of them have rim lighting pointed on by using a copy of the image with remapped colors.<p>Then there&#x27;s fake bokeh, local glow for warmth, liquify, etc.<p>So I would assume that the final file has 10 layers, all of which are roughly 8000x6000px, stored in RGB as float (cause you need negative values) and blended together with alpha masks. And I&#x27;d estimate that the average layer affects 80%+ of all pixels. So you effectively need to keep all of that in memory, because once you modify one of the lower layers (e.g. blur a wrinkle out of the skin) you&#x27;ll need all the higher layers for compositing the final visible pixel value.')
