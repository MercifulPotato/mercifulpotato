Doesn&#x27;t this imply that they will need to do extra work in the future to move those &#x2F;64 customers to &#x2F;56 or &#x2F;48 ?)<p>&gt; An alternative is to reserve a &#x2F;48 for residential customers, but actually assign them just the first &#x2F;56. If subsequently required, they can then be upgraded to the required prefix size without the need to renumber, or the spare prefixes can be used for new customers if it is not possible to obtain a new allocation from your RIR (which should not happen according to current IPv6 policies).')
