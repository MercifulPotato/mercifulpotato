If you wanted to travel across the country, the fuel tank would have to be dramatically larger, and then you&#x27;d have something very much like the rocket equation&#x27;s exponential mass to ∆v relationship (except here it would be mass to distance traveled) as you have to carry more fuel just because the other fuel is weighing you down. As a result, eventually your fuel tank would be close to the entire mass of your car, and you might actually even require a two-stage vehicle, with your car detaching from a large tanker halfway across the country to finish the trip.<p>And good luck getting back.')
