I imagine that it might be possible to write a program that does this for me, but I only have a high school-level understanding of genetics.<p>Can you recommend any resources for me to consult to try to accomplish this? Or do you think it would be too difficult for someone outside your field to attempt?<p>I see you mentioned that 23andMe data doesn&#x27;t expose this result directly, but it seems like it might be in the full data export. If that&#x27;s not the case, I suppose there&#x27;s not much of an option.')
