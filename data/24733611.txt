The vast majority of websites are running third-party ad networks, not first-party.<p>1. Even first-party ad networks often track and fingerprint users without consent, and may even share the data they have with other websites. This has personally happened to me, specifically in which eBay and Amazon serve their own first-party ads, but shared data about my searches, purchases, and clicks with other platforms. Even though it may have been a part of their ToS to do that, I consider that type of cross-business sharing of user data, without a clear opt-in&#x2F;opt-out option presented to the user, to be a malicious term and effectively user bullying by monopolies in e-commerce.')
