Item(by='hilbert42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605511823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108797, text='I love visiting Italy, and it&#x27;s great to visit a country where the drivers—and everyone—have attitude.<p>However, when you come from a nanny state with Namby-pamby road rules like I do, it takes a bit of getting used to driving in Italy. The last time I had to drive from Genoa to Rome I was overtaken so often I thought I&#x27;d be better off with a low-flying jet despite driving at about as fast as my cheap rental car would go!<p>Mind you, that spirit it doesn&#x27;t always bode well for the locals. Once in Firenze at a 90° T intersection with the road that follows the bank of the Arno, I saw that the traffic lights were out and stuck on red, so traffic couldn&#x27;t veer off down the intersecting road.<p>Not to be outdone, mopeds and small cars just mounted the sidewalk and bypassed the red lights altogether (by going down the sidewalk they technically weren&#x27;t going though the red lights (now that&#x27;s good lateral thinking that would never happen where I come from).<p>Unfortunately, there was a huge ditch in the sidewalk some 10&#x2F;15 metres down from the intersection that wasn&#x27;t easily seen when one turned the corner.  The result was that this enormous hole (almost a sinkhole in size) was full of busted mopeds and small cars!<p>Nevertheless, I give them 10&#x2F;10 for ingenuity.  ;-)<p><i>BTW, I saw this news report about the police using a Lamborghini to transport a donor organ.  There didn&#x27;t seem anything unusual about the story (for Italy anyway) and Lamborghini had donated the car to police some time back specifically for purposes like that. Seems they did AOK and I hope the patient is doing well.</i>')
