It&#x27;s ridiculous to isolate Scandinavia.<p>the population density, demographics, intergenerational living, and healthcare are vastly different between Scandinavia and the rest of Europe.<p>For example, Sweden has a density of 25&#x2F;km2, while Belgium has 383&#x2F;km2. The Stockholm county, the worst hit, has less population density than Lombardy (360&#x2F;km2 vs 420&#x2F;km2), while Lombardy has more inhabitants than the whole of Sweden. \nYou can easily see how population density relates closely with the intensity of the epidemic[0]. See also household size[1]<p>The one _really_ doing well is Germany.<p>But as I said: Sweden&#x27;s choice may have been perfectly good for Sweden! It just doesn&#x27;t translate as-is to all countries, because each country is different.<p>Anyway, the problem was never the survival rate, but the overloading of ICU, if that is less likely to happen you&#x27;d do very well to not have a lockdown, but this was not and is not the case everywhere.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;web&#x2F;products-eurostat-news&#x2F;-&#x2F;DDN-20170406-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;web&#x2F;products-eurostat-news&#x2F;-&#x2F;D...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php?title=File:Single-person_households,_by_NUTS_level_3_region,_2011_(%25_share_of_all_households)_PITEU17.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;eurostat&#x2F;statistics-explained&#x2F;index.php...</a>')
