Amazon, Google, Microsoft start building their own chips for their own clouds. The most efficient chip could translate into the cheapest cloud, or the fastest one at the same price. Their choice.<p>2. There will be N somewhat compatible ARM chips, that is to say they are somewhat incompatible. Remember the home computing landscape of the 80s &#x2F; early 90s but also the diversity in server architectures and OSes.<p>3. At least Microsoft is likely to sell their chips to third parties (they used to sell their software). Probably Amazon and Google have reasons to sell their chips too (Google -&gt; Chromebooks)<p>4. Some of those chips will end up in development laptops and desktops.<p>5. If you want to develop for AWS you&#x27;ll be safer to have a laptop with an Amazon chip, if you want to develop for Google Cloud a Google Chip, for Azure a Microsoft chip. This is not unheard of because if you want to develop for iOS you must have Apple hardware since 10+ years ago.<p>6. The chip manufacturer that wins the war for the developers&#x27; machines wins the war for the cloud, because it won&#x27;t be possible for (let&#x27;s say) Google to compete with (let&#x27;s say) Amazon if Google has to buy chips from Amazon because 90% of the developers have a laptop with an Amazon chip.<p>Or we&#x27;ll end up with 5 different laptops (unlikely) or one that connects to a remote desktop running in the appropriate cloud with the correct chip. That laptop could be a Mac or anything else, something powerful or a thin client.<p>So: fragmentation and then remote desktops? Back to mainframe &#x2F; time sharing?')
