Scott Myers has a talk where he pokes fun at the &quot;guaranteed O(N log N)&quot; sort of a linked list, where the guarantee is in number of comparisons and not the (very large) number of pointer chases.<p>Why describe at the type level the difference between a backwards pointer chase and a pointer decrement? The hope is: if you know at compile time that your iterator is efficient in this way, you can pick a more specialized algorithm, say, quicksort instead of mergesort. C++ really does enable this at the type level through template specialization. In practice the STL collections haven&#x27;t lived up to this, and I think the iterator tags are mostly deadweight.')
