The government&#x27;s statistics office is calculating average only based on reports from businesses with &gt;10 employees (IIRC). This excludes a couple millions of microbusinesses and of course the biggest employer in the country, aka the state itself (millions of teachers, policemen, soldiers, all the paper-pushers in various parts of bureaucracy etc. etc. are not included). The computed national averages are good for comparing year-to-year salary growths, but they&#x27;re not informative w.r.t. absolute salary levels.')
