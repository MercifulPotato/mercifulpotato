Obviously if the device is owned by the company then the company is well within its rights to control what functionality is available (just as a solo user is within their rights to control what the device is doing at all times). This is a bug where the device is somehow being tricked into thinking this functionality has been disabled by its owner, when in reality it has not been.<p>There are also legitimate reasons for blocking the disabling of location services. If I have devices with proprietary applications or access to proprietary data sitting in a secured room, I want to make sure nobody can take that device out of the room, and if they do, the device should enter some sort of lockdown or sleep mode so as to prevent the leaking of sensitive information. This is a legitimate feature that would make sense to implement on commercial (not consumer) devices. That the OS ships with the ability to disable disabling location services is not an indictment on the OS - it is only an indictment if the OS does so without your permission.')
