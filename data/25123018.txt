Trying to build a system that works with the natural effects of markets is much easier than creating a system that works against market forces.<p>Look at the Ticketmaster experience for popular concerts and sports tickets. Waiting rooms and bugs and software workarounds&#x2F;hacks, all because it’s a raffle for tickets being sold below what the free market price would be.<p>This does not appear to be a primarily <i>technical</i> problem. If these tickets sell out in 10 minutes, creating a better technical solution to let them sell out in 2 minutes isn’t actually improving anything meaningful.')
