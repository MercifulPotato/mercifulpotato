For example #lisp, #emacs, ##math, r&#x2F;lisp, r&#x2F;emacs, and r&#x2F;math have great communities with friendly attitude.<p>Stack Overflow operates at a much larger scale and compared to Stack Overflow, these communities are definitely much smaller but I see that as an advantage. The quality of discussions is often pretty good. Off-topic friendly banter occurs once in a while when the channels are quiet. With a good percentage of the members composed of regulars in these channels, they are still able to maintain a sense of community.')
