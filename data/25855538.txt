Item(by='scruple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611204586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25855408, text='&gt; Fresno has a really rich history with regards to water development and I don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t get more press for that. I also liked the bus system there.<p>&gt; Meanwhile, Fresno is the butt of jokes in movies and otherwise mostly gets ignored.<p>I&#x27;ve never cared for the disparaging attitude that many Californians have towards Fresno and the rest of the Central Valley, either, but then I am not a California native, either. At the same time, I&#x27;m also definitely guilty of ignoring the place and it&#x27;s history. I honestly only know where it is on the map as a pit stop before going into the Sierras and Yosemite.<p>I placed a hold on a copy of <i>Salt Dreams</i> with the library. I&#x27;m really looking forward to reading it. The only books I really had any awareness of around this topic were Cadillac Desert and a couple of others that I vaguely recall ever reading.')
