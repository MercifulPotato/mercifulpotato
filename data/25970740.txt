You&#x27;d be at 66% capacity, so fuel consumption will be higher. Bring 20 gallons of fuel?<p>If you go solar, figure you have 6 hours of usable daylight, you&#x27;d need seven rooftop sized panels (330 watts each) to supply 2kw for those 6 hours, so you need battery capacity for the remaining 18 hours, or 36 kWh. That&#x27;s a sizable battery. You&#x27;d need 36 of these:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jackery.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;explorer-1000-portable-power-station" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jackery.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;explorer-1000-portable-powe...</a><p>(That&#x27;s obviously impractical so you&#x27;d have to custom build a solution.)<p>I don&#x27;t know... I&#x27;d go with a generator and gasoline. Much cheaper, more compact, and available off the shelf.<p>Maybe you can get Rivian to lend you a truck for PR purposes. It has four on-board 120v outlets and a 105-180 kWh battery.')
