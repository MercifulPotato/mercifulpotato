Extracting the fraction of a percent concentration of carbon in the atmosphere is not feasible.<p>Hydrogen is one of the inputs for the sabatier process, so if the lower energy density by unit of volume isn&#x27;t a concern it makes more sense to just use the hydrogen directly.<p>The reality, though, is that none of the proposed energy storage solutions are easier than just building nuclear power plants. France already generates most of it&#x27;s electricity from nuclear power. Belgium recently surpassed 50% nuclear power generation. It&#x27;s more feasible to just avoid the unsolved energy storage problem altogether.')
