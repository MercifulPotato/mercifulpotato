It&#x27;s that the old approach of not-very-synchronised shell scripts is very fragile and sometimes arrived to via trial and error. And many services carry their own custom implementation of those.<p>For example mysqld_safe is there pretty much to handle things that systemd can do, but initd can&#x27;t. Some other services have custom wait-logic to make sure dependencies are ready, which is covered by service readiness notification in systemd (see just yesterday <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25845143" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25845143</a>). Many services do custom pidfile handling (see the fun implementation in openssh init file - your pidfile path better not have `=` in it) just because initd has no idea of services.<p>Basically every service I&#x27;ve seen which has more than a single line in start and stop functions in broken is at least one subtle way. (and close to every single status function - no, existence of the pidfile and that pid running an undefined process is not the same as service functioning) Systemd provides 99% of what those init scripts try to achieve as simple configuration and if something&#x27;s missing you can still fall back to executing a script instead.')
