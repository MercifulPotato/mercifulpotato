And if you stop it it&#x27;s like a bakeries oven, when you want to turn it on again it will not be ready in to produce in time for when you need it.<p>That&#x27;s another side to projects like the F-35 that people on HN usually don&#x27;t pay attention to. This programs not only &quot;create&quot; those jobs but they also keep the infrastructure and &quot;machine&quot; running that can design and build this very powerful weapons. The US had air superiority because of its technology for a while and if all that infrastructure and people just start doing something else, in like 5&#x2F;10 years then the capacity to build this machines is dead, and it would take 10&#x2F;15 years to get it back up and running.')
