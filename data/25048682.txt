I&#x27;ve turned down interview opportunities at both Facebook and Google because the roles on offer were not roles I was interested in doing. In the past I&#x27;ve broken off Google&#x27;s interview process because the glacial pace they were moving at just was not worth it to me.<p>I earn well, so granted I&#x27;m not turning down as much as some would, but to drag out a tired old saying, I work to live, I don&#x27;t live to work. I have plenty of things I want to do - some of them I can do in the right job, many I can&#x27;t.<p>Of course one of the luxuries of already earning well is that the multiple of my current salary it&#x27;d take to convince me to take a job I don&#x27;t actively love the sound of is far higher that it otherwise would be.')
