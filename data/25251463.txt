Item(by='enkimute', descendants=None, kids=[25251809, 25251798], score=None, time=1606721030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25250912, text='Ok, standard 4x4 matrices also implement a projective (aka d+1) model. (the &#x27;w&#x27; coordinate is just the projective coordinate). So no difference with GA in that respect.<p>Setting up a unified transformation hierarchy is actually very easy, and again not really different from how you would approach it with matrices. (plus, its more performant). Simply swap the matrix with the appropriate versor.<p>Which (versors or matrices) are appropriate depends on the symmetry group you are interested in :<p>Orthogonal Group (just rotations : distance + origin preserving) in d dimensions -&gt; use the geometric algebra R_d. (classically : complex numbers, quaternions)<p>Lorentz Group (rotations + boosts : spacetime distance + origin preserving) in d space dimensions and 1 time dimension -&gt; use the geometric algebra R_{d,1}. (classically : Lorentz transformations)<p>Euclidean Group (translations + rotations : distance preserving) in d dimensions -&gt; use the geometric algebra R_{d,0,1}. (classically : planar quaternions, dual quaternions)<p>Conformal Group (translations + rotations + dilations : angle preserving) -&gt; use the geometric algebra R_{d+1,1}. (classically : linear fractional transformations)<p>General Linear Group (translations + rotations + sheering + ... : preserves parallelism&#x2F;incidence) : use d+1 x d+1 matrices.<p>Working in a symmetry group that is &#x27;to big&#x27; comes at a cost - both in algorithmic complexity as well as numerical precision. If you only want translations&#x2F;rotations, but are using matrices you&#x27;ll have to resort to things like Gramm-Shmidt or SVD to re-orthogonalize your matrices after doing numerical calculations. (you have to project it back to the solution manifold in math terms - this is almost never trivial and often impossible).<p>(for those interested, I explain this in-depth in my GAME2020 talk : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ichOiuBoBoQ&amp;ab_channel=Bivector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ichOiuBoBoQ&amp;ab_channel=Bivec...</a> )')
