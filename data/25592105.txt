Of course if you&#x27;re talking about the Earth-Sun distance you are taking one of them as the reference. If you&#x27;re in a different frame, then you should do the math for it.<p>But I think at the surface of the sun (if you could stand there naturally) the time&#x2F;distance is still around 8min (happy if someone does the math) - Note that the statement says 8min, not 480.000s which would be metrologically wrong.')
