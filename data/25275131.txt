When you describe &#x27;...split it into a list of elements by commas...&#x27; style problems you are describing un-normalised data. SQL is explicitly designed to deal with <i>normalised</i> data, so it isn&#x27;t a fault if it struggles.<p>NULL is unpleasant to deal with, but it is unavoidable - sometimes the value of data isn&#x27;t known and the database has to represent that somehow.<p>But I&#x27;m with you on getting out of SQL quickly as the code gets longer. It is a bad language and it is better to be working in something else.')
