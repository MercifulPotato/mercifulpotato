Simply hang it up, scan it, and upload as many images as you want. Then, when you or your guests scan it again they can explore your art in a digital medium. You can change this art anytime you want as your tastes change.<p>Alternatively, if you don&#x27;t want to showcase art on your Qrtsy, you can display text with full markdown support. This is great for leaving secret messages to your guests or displaying house rules for Airbnbs. You can also setup your Qrtsy to redirect to a URL of your choice, which is great for showing off your portfolio, linking to your favorite songs, or Rickrolling your guests.<p>Check it out and let me know what you think!\nQrtsy\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qrtsy.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qrtsy.co</a>')
