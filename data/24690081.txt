Randomly looking at the justifications for some of the top high school athletics programs in California:<p>&quot;Honor, Glory and Love... the school is dedicated to the development of the whole person: spiritual, intellectual, physical, emotional and aesthetic&quot;<p>&quot;students learn lifelong lessons in teamwork, discipline and leadership&quot;<p>&quot;We encourage the development of team collaboration, communication, and characteristics that foster empathy, tolerance, personal growth and positive citizenship.&quot;<p>I mean, it&#x27;s all bullshit. Or at least, people aren&#x27;t buying expensive houses in good school districts just so their kids can learn the value of teamwork. But if you take athletics&#x27; programs words at face value, winning and metrics aren&#x27;t the primary objective.<p>Specialized high schools are intended to build impressive application packets for college, which in turn is meant to get access to elite jobs and social opportunities. Indeed, that&#x27;s one of the major reasons parents even try to get their kids into sports! One of the easiest ways into an elite university is to become an above average athlete in an obscure sport (this is the go-to approach for well-off but academically mediocre white people, actually). And so the admissions process for these high schools is geared toward facilitating that objective.<p>TJ provided a pathway for academically gifted first generation Asian immigrants to achieve social mobility. And with this new process, many won&#x27;t have access to TJ, to mostly be replaced with mediocre white kids (and a couple more token underrepresented minorities).')
