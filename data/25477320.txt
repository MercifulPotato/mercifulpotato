I didn&#x27;t walk several hundred miles in 4 days. 4 days was just the time of my stop ;) \nthe journey &#x2F; hike was planned to last for 2 months. there is a lot of distance you can cover if you plan to walk 20-30&#x2F;km a day. altitude, weather etc doesn&#x27;t make it any easier. I wrote about it here in case you&#x27;re interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22256055" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22256055</a><p>&gt; hopefully they were dairy rather than meat breeds.<p>dairy cattle, this is the setting I&#x27;m describing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alpine_transhumance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alpine_transhumance</a> ... you have usually some hut in the middle of nowhere often above the tree line with a &quot;Halter&quot; (keeper) looking after lifestock. Their job is to count the animals every day and make sure they haven&#x27;t left the territory. The number of animals depends on how many farmers they have who give them the animals during the summer. These places usually also offer a shelter to hikers and mountaineers and are very common in the Alps. For me it was a great way to spend a few days to rest my legs and look after body hygiene (normally slept in the woods or any shelter I could build or find)<p>&gt; I&#x27;m trying to guess your age<p>I&#x27;m pretty much your age.')
