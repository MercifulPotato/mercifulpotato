Item(by='jsmith45', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608056931, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431471, text='My understanding is as follows:<p>If you are able to answer &quot;Is email address[or other collected data] ________ associated the user whose database row has primary key _______?&quot; then that is considered being tied to the account, and thus tied to the identity. If you are using email address as a user id, then it is very much tied to the user&#x27;s account on your service.<p>For tying to device, this could be based on reading the devices serial number somehow, using the Id for Advertisers, or just generating a unique random identifier at install time, and use that to distinguish records. So if you can answer &quot;What is the race of the user with random install id _______&quot; then for apples purposes you have tied race to device and thus to identity.<p>Basically unless anonymized nearly all data that you collect will be considered by Apple to be identity tied, unless you don&#x27;t have user accounts, and don&#x27;t include some form of device identifier with the data. It is literally impossible to have any form of user account without at least having one thing &quot;tied to user identity&quot;. Even if you use &quot;sign in with apple&quot; and do not collect the anonymized email address they provide, you will have at least &quot;user id&quot; (the &quot;sub&quot; token from apple) and probably also &quot;Other User Content&quot;.<p>For example, an otherwise offline game might collect the time taken to beat each level without any device identifying information to allow the developer to understand if levels were harder than expected. In that case you have collection of &quot;Product Interaction&quot; data that is not identity tied.')
