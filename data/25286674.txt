I hadn’t resigned—I had asked for simple conditions first and said I would respond when I’m back from vacation. But I guess she decided for me :) that’s the lawyer speak.<p>&gt; I said here are the conditions. If you can meet them great I’ll take my name off this paper, if not then I can work on a last date. Then she sent an email to my direct reports saying she has accepted my resignation. So that is google for you folks. You saw it happen right here.<p>In the email she posted, it seems that they &quot;accelerated the timeline&quot; for her termination because &quot;certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager&quot;, i.e. a <i>separate email</i> from her conditions email.<p>It seems like she was ready to leave if they didn&#x27;t meet her conditions, and that this would habe been a reasonable outcome for her. However, it bothers me that they wouldn&#x27;t even come to the table about the non-condition email.<p>Like OK, &quot;inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager&quot;. That&#x27;s some weak shit. It had better be something pretty fucking severe for them to fire her immediately and not, I don&#x27;t know, do some planning around transitioning her projects? Work out what to do with the team she herself managed? Be given the grace of leaving on a good note that an engineer of her caliber deserves?<p>This stinks like a convenient excuse to shoo an AI ethics researcher asking some inconvenient questions out the door.')
