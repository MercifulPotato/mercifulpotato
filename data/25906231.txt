I made a little less than that when I lived in the Midwest, and it was enough to buy a $125,000 duplex (mortgage came out to ~25% of my monthly wages), pay the bills, and still go out and have fun a couple nights a week.  I made retirement contributions, but I wasn&#x27;t maxing out my 401k contributions or anything.<p>I would say for much of the US, that&#x27;s about where life becomes comfortable if you&#x27;re single (can&#x27;t comment on with kids, I&#x27;ve never done a budget with them).  Bills aren&#x27;t a worry if you don&#x27;t make poorly planned large purchases, you can afford a decent place to live, and you&#x27;ve got some money left over at the end of the month to save or work on a hobby or whatever.<p>This is obviously not true in the hot cities, though.  I think $75k is under the poverty line if you have children in the Bay Area.')
