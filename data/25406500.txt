Item(by='p0d', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1607867138, title='Ask HN: Just Sack Me', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='As a very conscientious worker I think I have learned an important life lesson over the last 30 years of work. A coping mechanism which says, &quot;just sack me&quot;. This translates as I am doing the best I can. That I have realised others will take advantage of my good will. As others sit around and twiddle their thumbs I will be given more work.<p>My question is can anyone frame &quot;just sack me&quot; in a better way? I imagine I am expressing something important in not a very articulate way. In a way which sounds like stick it to the man. I would like to help others who are struggling in their work with what I have learned without sounding so negative.')
