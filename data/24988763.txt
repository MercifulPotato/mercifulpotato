If the question is &quot;Who is polluting the world and need to stop&quot; then countryâ€™s annual CO2 emissions is the single most relevant graph since that is where the pollution is right now coming from.<p>If one is to ask &quot;whom&#x27;s individual citizen way of living is contributing most&quot; we would look at per capita C02. If the question is &quot;Who is at risk of increasing their pollution&quot; you would look at living standards and growth rates. If you ask &quot;Who has the beast means to invest into climate change preventing technology&quot; you would look at GDP. If you ask &quot;where in the production chain pollution is created&quot; then looking at trade gives that. If the question is whom is to be blamed historically for getting us into this situation then the historical global cumulative CO2 graph shows that, through I am a bit skeptical that it actually gives a correct picture since ww1 and ww2 were very central in ushering us into the age of fossil fuels.')
