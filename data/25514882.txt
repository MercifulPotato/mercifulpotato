AES-256 is very solid, but using it correctly can be hard. Apple knows what they are doing but they are still human.<p>For example if this is a lock screen bypass (and not a bypass of say the start up process before the key is entered), maybe some memory corruption issue allows you to bypass the password check. Or another example, many people use short numeric pins to encrypt their phones. Apple then does a lot of complex stuff to take that and turn it into a high entropy key. Maybe this is an exploit in that part, allowing for a bruteforce attack.<p>These are all just wild gueses, i have no idea what these capabilities are or for that matter, i dont really know very much about how iphone FDE works.')
