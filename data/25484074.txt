A visualization algorithm is overlayed on top of a satellite image to show that the system can at least detect front surfaces. The professor has also built other hobbyist high-frequency systems before, including demonstrating through-wall capabilities for some of them. This PDF (others on his site) has some good examples of what the environment looks like with a camera, and what you get when you process some SAR data with matlab into a 2D image: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;glcharvat.com&#x2F;website%20pdfs&#x2F;Charvat_MIT_Haystack_DIY_SAR.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;glcharvat.com&#x2F;website%20pdfs&#x2F;Charvat_MIT_Haystack_DIY...</a>')
