I’d hoped to install them into a mini-pc NVR. The form-factor doesn’t appear to lend itself to the reliability drive manufacturers target for this class of drive. They’re optimized for high write speeds and very high write loads. You can of course use consumer laptop drives in a NAS, but write speeds will be lower and reliability may suffer.')
