Do you have any evidence that the rate of immigration is &quot;too high&quot; to sustain social cohesion in Canada? I would suggest that as you&#x27;re the one that introduced it the burden of proof is on you.<p>&gt; Some of us would like it to stay that way, and we understand that bringing in a whole bunch of people to undercut the price of labour while eroding our hard-fought social capital is not the way to do that.<p>The immigration rate of 1% per year has been the same since 1992 and I see no evidence of inequality increasing in conjunction with immigration. Do you have evidence? And once again, dramatically increasing wages by cutting off immigration <i>increases</i> income inequality. The GINI has remained a consistent .33 from the late 1990s through the present day, in spite of 1% per annum immigration.<p>You&#x27;re going to need to back your case if you want to sway my mind.')
