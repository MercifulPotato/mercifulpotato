I spoke to Steve before they launched their App Store -- we were happy to see them open up the platform and provide an official SDK, which was our goal with Installer.app.<p>I think Apple should either charge considerably less than they do for distribution via their App Stores (that is, even less than 15%) or allow competition. Even more importantly, they need to allow installation of apps via links without requiring an App Store altogether.<p>They also need to provide wider access to low level APIs (with user confirmation), instead of dumbing it down for developers while keeping all the powerful APIs to themselves.')
