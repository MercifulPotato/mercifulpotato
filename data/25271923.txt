Sure, we got started real quick, that was nice. I argued early on that we need to be careful of not getting locked in to AWS in case we need to jump away once we have some customer growth, but everyone else thought that was silly.<p>Fast forward two years and our AWS bill was about $2500 per year per customer. Revenue per customer, certainly nowhere near that. Burning VC money gets you far but only so far. Yes we ran out of money.')
