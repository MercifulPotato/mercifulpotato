How long before someone is taken to court for an un-PC remark which they made in the [supposed] privacy of their own home, but which was then picked up by their Alexa, transcribed at Amazon HQ and then reported to the authorities as a &quot;hate crime&quot;?<p>I know using the phrase &quot;virtue signalling&quot; tends to merit a bucket load of downvotes here on HN. But I really do think we&#x27;ve arrived at a farcical situation in the West [especially in Europe] where legislators are falling over themselves to draft ever more idiotic laws intended to show how much more &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; they are than the next guy.<p>With, ironically, the consequence that these same laws are actually making society less free and more controlled, as people are becoming too frightened to express opinions that don&#x27;t conform, for fear of being branded a bigot &#x2F; racist &#x2F; sexist&#x2F; &lt;alphabetti-spaghetti&gt;phobe<p>Ironic that so few people in the West can see that we&#x27;re mirroring exactly the same kind of &#x27;dissenting viewpoint not tolerated&#x27; society that we used to deride the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for and continue to condemn China for today.')
