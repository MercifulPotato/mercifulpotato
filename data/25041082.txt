Don&#x27;t expect Amazon to fix it.<p>The only &quot;fix&quot; is competition. Companies rarely improve without competition. The moment a competitor starts eating their lunch, things will get fixed pronto.<p>Reminds me of that apocryphal Henry Ford story, that he sent his engineers to the local junk yards to see which parts of his car hadn&#x27;t failed, and wanted to know <i>why</i> they were making something that was outlasting the car. Amazon would rather spend money on conquering new markets than fixing the one they dominate by a wide margin.')
