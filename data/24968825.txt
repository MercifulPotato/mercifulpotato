They&#x27;re really great if you need well-priced, no-hassle infrastructure. As others have already mentioned, they may not have some of the higher-level features that AWS comes with, but if you don&#x27;t need these, then there&#x27;s no reason to be paying more for it.<p>I&#x27;m really fascinated by their approach to building datacenters, which seems to include taking over disused industrial sites and converting them for datacenter use. For example, their datacenter just outside of Montreal is on the site of an old aluminum smelter [0]. In this case, I&#x27;m sure the proximity to plentiful and cheap hydroelectric power nearby (as would have been beneficial for aluminum smelting in the past) was a major factor in the choice of location as well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baxtel.com&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;ovh-beauharnois-quebec-bhs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baxtel.com&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;ovh-beauharnois-quebec-bhs</a>')
