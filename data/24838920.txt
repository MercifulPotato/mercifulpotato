I haven&#x27;t seen this mentality nearly as much in folks that are bootstrapping without the &quot;extreme growth&quot; required by VCs.<p>And, although PG is in the Silicon Valley bubble (where only cool things happen, and it&#x27;s the hub of cool in tech, duh), the advice he has is fairly general.  In the board game creator community there&#x27;s a lot of advice on making things that fail and making things that don&#x27;t sell &quot;for the fun of making the thing,&quot; because let&#x27;s face it... most of your shit doesn&#x27;t sell and never has any market value, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less useful or instructive.<p>TL;DR: Being okay with &quot;failure&quot; is a major part of any profession or hobby, and isn&#x27;t intrinsic to Silicon Valley or VC backed startups...')
