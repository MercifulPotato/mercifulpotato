I will be graduating within the next two months with a BS in Computer Science, and I worked as a web developer for over three years when I was younger. My current internship has given me experience in the Python, Java, and C&#x2F;C++ languages, while allowing me to work with Docker, Ansible, Gitlab (w&#x2F; CI&#x2F;CD), and other technologies, and I&#x27;m always willing to learn the stack necessary for a job.')
