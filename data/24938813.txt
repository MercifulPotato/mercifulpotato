However, it&#x27;s clear from your response this morning that you are unwilling to engage in a productive editorial process on this article&quot; That kind of full stop to the conversation is exactly what gets people to understand they don&#x27;t have a say and don&#x27;t have someone who will even listen. I&#x27;d say quitting over this kind of journalistic integrity is extremely noble. How could they even request he not post his article elsewhere when he is allowed to do so. We&#x27;re talking about the guy who released Edward Snowden leaks basically building the Intercept in the process and now with the overwhelming evidence that the &#x27;laptop&#x27; stuff is true as he detailed, they all of a sudden are opposed to information leaks and claiming it&#x27;s &quot;Russia&quot; when the photos and videos from the laptop are obviously proof that the laptop was in fact Hunter Biden&#x27;s. If i was dismissed so easily about something that is integral to my profession I&#x27;d be pissed too.')
