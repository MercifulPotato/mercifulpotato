This is trivially proven by the fact that alot of people lose their sense of smell after a covid infection. Even mostly asymptomatic people have reported this.<p>&quot;It’s not uncommon for upper respiratory infections such as the common cold or flu to affect our senses of smell and taste. In fact, it’s estimated that a temporary loss of smell happens in over 60 percent of colds and sinus infections.&quot;<p>This is why self-reporting is a different ball-game, I (used) to not consider myself &#x27;sick&#x27; and symptomatic if I had a minor flu or cold. One can most definitely report &#x27;not being ill&#x27; from coronavirus and suffer residual symptoms.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;coronavirus-loss-of-taste-loss-of-smell#an-early-symptom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;coronavirus-loss-of-taste-...</a>')
