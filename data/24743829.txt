So, if you feed them some extra light the image quality gets a lot better.<p>OTOH, take a 10 year old DSLR, flip it to video mode and compare the results when you don&#x27;t have the lights amped up to max.<p>Webcams are one of those areas where 7-8 years ago I was wondering why all the webcams were still USB2. For something like video you _REALLY_ want the extra bandwidth. Sure lots of peoples home connections aren&#x27;t going to be able to feed the 250Mbit or so that is possible with a USB2 webcam, but in many cases your GPU&#x2F;etc is probably much more capable of doing a good job with a random codec than whatever $.50c codec happens to be integrated on the webcam itself. So run a reasonable bandwidth to the PC and let it cleanup&#x2F;compress the image. Rather than having the camera compress it to mpeg2, drop 1&#x2F;2 the clarity, then have your PC decompress it and re-compress it with a more modern codec.')
