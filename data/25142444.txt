I was one of the original authors of OpenEMR back in high school. I&#x27;m still good friends with at least one of the other authors. We&#x27;re always stunned to see OpenEMR in the news, and watching it creep up on HackerNew today has been fun.<p>I&#x27;ve always been curious why OpenEMR seemed to dominate in the OSS space after we walked away from it. I can only theorize that the code was more approachable than other projects (PHP), and that the GPL kept the work from being captured by any one business. I can&#x27;t imagine that the code was the best, I&#x27;m painfully aware of how poor the security practices must have been in hindsight.<p>You&#x27;ve given me the chance to ask a question I never knew who to ask: Why, back in 2003 (just after we stopped giving the project attention), was OpenEMR the project you decided to spend time on? What made it the attractive thing to invest in?<p>If you can tell me I&#x27;ll bottle that elixir and pour it into every OSS effort I work on today.')
