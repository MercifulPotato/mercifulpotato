The cramped seats where no position is comfortable. Knowing that every movement I make to try to get comfortable is bothering the person next to me. Getting sweaty because of how high the heaters are running. Trying to sleep while every seat, empty or not, has bright flashing advertisements that no one bothers to turn off(they don&#x27;t exactly make it obvious how to). And when you do have a tight connection, everyone ahead of you on the plane goes so incredibly slow.')
