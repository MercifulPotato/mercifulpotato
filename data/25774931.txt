There was no C compiler at all for that machine, and if there would be, working with it would be a lot more hassle than a Forth REPL.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;floooh.github.io&#x2F;tiny8bit&#x2F;z1013.html?type=z1013_64&amp;file=z1013&#x2F;z1013_forth.z80" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;floooh.github.io&#x2F;tiny8bit&#x2F;z1013.html?type=z1013_64&amp;f...</a><p>What&#x27;s the appeal today, I don&#x27;t know.
