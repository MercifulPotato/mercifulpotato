The first 2&#x2F;3 of the book is meh - uninteresting characters, motivations, a bit above average setting. Then it really takes off and you see the writer hasn&#x27;t been wasting your time.<p>Also The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe. It&#x27;s much slower paced and more about the mood and immersion.')
