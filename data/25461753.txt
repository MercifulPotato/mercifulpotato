Like the feeling of accomplishment that you get in re-deriving a famous theorem yourself. It&#x27;s not groundbreaking or novel, but it unlocks a much deeper understanding for why we need GPUs at all.<p>You can take a look at the humble repo I used to both learn C++ and explore 3D rendering [1]. If by some chance you are interested in learning more about how this stuff works, I highly encourage you to check out TheCherno&#x27;s youtube channel [2]. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of his newer stuff (Hazel engine), but his older series implemented 3D graphics from scratch in Java. Taught me a huge amount about how this stuff works and really ignited my interest in programming.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TimelyToga&#x2F;tlotk&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;engine&#x2F;graphics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TimelyToga&#x2F;tlotk&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;engine&#x2F;g...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iH1xpfOBN6M&amp;list=PL656DADE0DA25ADBB&amp;ab_channel=TheCherno" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iH1xpfOBN6M&amp;list=PL656DADE0D...</a>')
