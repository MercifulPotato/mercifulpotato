I have to admit, I honestly don&#x27;t know if&#x2F;how things might be regulated (if at all) for works of literary art (with historical&#x2F;cultural significance).<p>AFAIK, with buildings these regulations (now) exists because they didn&#x27;t in the past. People got really upset with other people just demolishing what they held dear, public outcry as a result and eventually regulations too. But in this situation the destruction is often driven by space being a scarce commodity (especially in cities).<p>I doubt that books often get destroyed to make way for new ones (barring a few criminal&#x2F;extremist authoritarian regimes), so it might never have reached a point where enough people got upset about it and demand regulation.<p>But now I am curious though, if there are indeed regulations for these kind of works. If there are, that would essentially render my original opinion null and void.<p>Still, I would prefer it that way, rather than know that these works will end up in the hands of the financially powerful private hands. For I have little faith in that lot and their antics.')
