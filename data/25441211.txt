The &quot;international spy agency&quot; scenario is using custom hardware listening to side channel noise <i>from an untouched computer</i>. That&#x27;s stuff like decoding screen images from EMI from VGA&#x2F;HDMI cables, or getting crypto keys from EMI from a CPU running standard code. That&#x27;s what the whole TEMPEST thing was about decades ago. Those demos are interesting. We also use them in device security research, e.g. power or EMI analysis to extract crypto keys from a secure SoC.<p>This guy just puts malware on the airgapped computer to force it to broadcast its secrets in the slowest, simplest, easiest to pick up way through some channel. That is not hard.<p>His entire clickbait operation is basically predicated on the fact that people confuse these two scenarios, while they are two completely different things.')
