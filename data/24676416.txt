Intel Macs.<p>The &quot;Apple is going to lock down the Mac just like the iPhone&quot; narrative has been with us since, well, the iPhone. But despite the alarm at tighter security measures in more recent versions of macOS, that hasn&#x27;t happened yet -- and if a Secret Nefarious Lockdown Plan (tm) was going to come to fruition, the year that they shifted CPU hardware <i>and</i> radically redesigned the operating system&#x27;s UX would sure as heck seem to be The Perfect Moment. And it still hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns and all that, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason to think Apple is going to make it any harder to run different operating systems on Apple Silicon hardware than they do on Intel hardware. (Of course, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason to think they&#x27;ll make it <i>easier,</i> either.)')
