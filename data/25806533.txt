I think that if you do some thing in code that results in unintended behavior, then that&#x27;s a bug that should be communicated to the developer during development.<p>A buffer over-run isn&#x27;t a bug, its the symptom of a a bug in the arithmetic that computes how to access the buffer. The way to fix that is to communicate and address the bug during development, not to try to mitigate the symptom at run time.<p>I am a C programmer, and to me buffer over-runs are a rare class of bugs, and a class of bugs that are (at least on the heap, and often on the stack) trivial to find and fix with the tools i have.')
