Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611807354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936832, text='My spouse was an elected official in California, and we had to fill out Form 700; diversified mutual funds didn&#x27;t need to be disclosed as  long as they met the definitions (at least 100 investors, at least 15 issuers, not a sector fund). Of course, Form 700 doesn&#x27;t apply to federal officials elected to represent California; but a similar disclosure requirement &#x2F; duty to avoid apparent conflict of interest would be nice at the federal level.<p>It should be pretty simple for most elected officials to dump their publicly traded stock and get into a diversified mutual fund before they start campaigning and while they hold office. For those who have concentrated holdings that are hard to dump, they could put it into a blind trust or whatever. Office holders really shouldn&#x27;t be making a lot of trades; equity based compensation aside (either of their spouse or if they&#x27;re a part time officer where those still exist, and have a part time job with equity based compensation)')
