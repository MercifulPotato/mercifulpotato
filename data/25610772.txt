There are already repercussions for arriving to school late which is what prevents the morning traffic jam from being a problem. Someone shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to leave at all just because they would be late if they don&#x27;t come back in time to park. I don&#x27;t even understand how that could sound convincing to you.<p>That&#x27;s just the type of thinking that gives us zero tolerance policies.')
