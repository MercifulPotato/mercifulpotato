Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604365162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24964469, text='&gt;I thought IPv6 also supported subnets, DHCP, and static configuration, just like IPv4?<p>It does support all of those.<p>Dagger2&#x27;s comment already explained the benefit of using &#x2F;64 as a subnet size. I want to clarify that when I was talking earlier about getting a &#x2F;60 or larger from your ISP, the point was that a &#x2F;60 can be divided into sixteen &#x2F;64 subnets. So you do have multiple subnets. The only subnet division you should avoid is dividing smaller than a &#x2F;64.<p>It&#x27;s not <i>impossible</i> to work with subnets smaller than &#x2F;64, as long as you enable NDP proxying like I said. Eg some guides for setting up IPv6 for Docker containers, where the host doesn&#x27;t have a delegated prefix and thus cannot be a sub-router, tell you to assign a &#x2F;1xx to Docker and enable NDP proxying between NICs in the kernel. The nicer way, which I used to use in my homelab, is to delegate a &#x2F;64 to your Docker host so that it can be a sub-router, and assign the whole &#x2F;64 to Docker to assign IPs from. This of course requires that my main homelab router gets a bigger block than a &#x2F;64 from my ISP. (My &quot;ISP&quot; was a tunnelbroker tunnel, and thus I got a &#x2F;48.)<p>&gt;Long ago, I recall an ISP that charged extra for more than one active device.<p>Well yes, if you absolutely must use an ISP that only gives you a &#x2F;128, and you must use more than one device, then you&#x27;ll need to set up NAT66, or any of the various IP tunnels to an external server, and forego having universally routable addresses on your devices.')
