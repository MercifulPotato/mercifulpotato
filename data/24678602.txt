There are tv shows of brits getting asked to pick asperges or strawberries and they give up after a day or so. Waiters, garbage collectors, fruit picker etc; you cannot pay most native dutch to do that unless they own the business.<p>And ofcourse we are not making enough kids in most countries, including NL so we need it.')
