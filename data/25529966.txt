I&#x27;ve run a few, albeit very small, campaigns on FB.  I set up targetting (occupation and geography) and I would get people outside of my target &#x27;liking&#x27; my ad.  I&#x27;d reach out anyways to ask if they are interested in my product and they would never respond.  I oftened wondered if they were just fake&#x2F;bot accounts to make it look like my ads were getting attention.  I&#x27;m glad some company has taken them to court to determine what is really going on.')
