The nature of weapon technology transforms the way society works.<p>In the era of sword and shield, for example, combat effectiveness is hugely dependent on raw upper body strength. That means that strong healthy men rule all domains, while women, children, any men not in top physical shape are helpless before them.<p>In the modern era of mechanized weapons, personal size and physical ability are much less relevant. There&#x27;s a much greater ability for small groups to make their opinions felt. Victory in large battles tends to go to whoever has the best tech and greatest quantity of it. It&#x27;s probably a better world overall.<p>The real question is, exactly how will any &quot;killbots&quot; work, and what effect will they have on society? Maybe they&#x27;ll be super-expensive and centrally controlled, and nobody better dare to move against whoever ends up in charge of them. Maybe they&#x27;ll be cheap and plentiful, so anyone with a grudge will be even more able to cause chaos. Maybe something else we can&#x27;t imagine yet. I have a feeling we&#x27;ll find out eventually, one way or another.')
