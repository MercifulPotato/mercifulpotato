So in my opinion, its in the same weight class as the flu, but if you have such a problem with it, that&#x27;s why I qualified the statement as I said it, depending on what your threshold is.<p>Keep in mind, the flu at the end of 2019 going into 2020 was a particularly bad flu.  the mortality rate of those going to the hospital was around 6% according to the CDC.<p>it would not be 100 times worse than the flu.  we have so much data on covid19 now, and nothing has really changed since the cruise ships, which was basically a free experiment for the world that has been promptly ignored over and over.')
