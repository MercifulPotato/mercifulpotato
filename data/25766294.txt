They should be bound by a contract subject to some form of arbitration. At this point those platforms have become the defacto public square imho. They can&#x27;t lash out on a banning spree and subject public political figures to the memoryhole without some form of legitimate debate.<p>Again, Facebook has carried multiple live streams of shootings- YouTube has carried plenty of abusive videos and videos supporting violence and terrorism.<p>From a political perspective they are setting themselves up for attack with this response. Like, still waiting on details but Ron Paul got kicked off of Facebook. How in the heck did that goofy little ol dude incite this?<p>I also am beginning to notice that with every major act of terrorism in the past couple of years, may God help you if the lunitics used your platform and you were not Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Twitter. If you were one of those three you will just claim oopsie and move on. If you were a small platform then the entire weight of the corporate oligarchy will come down on you while never picking up a mirror.<p>I also think Fox news and CNN should be held accountable for their radicalization of both sides- hear me out. You have one half of this country that is convinced Trump was literally Hitler, not only that he also was elected by election manipulation via Russia. You have the other half of the country, that lives in a reality where the election has been stolen from them and they&#x27;re being censored on all major forms of media. They believe the election was stolen by the Chinese.<p>At some point the media has to be held accountable. Fear porn may sell, but it has a damned high cost.<p>Please understand I love this community, hacker news is one of the few places I can make a statement like this and expect reasonable and civil responses. And a no way should anyone take what I&#x27;m saying personally, I feel the system is broken- I don&#x27;t think we can survive as a nation with a fractured worldview perpetuated by a 24&#x2F;7 news cycle amplified by short-sighted memes and microblogs.')
