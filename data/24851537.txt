It&#x27;s hard to get funding and investors aren&#x27;t usually stupid. You&#x27;ll have people that&#x27;ll make you jump through hoops and do their due diligence. But then once in a while, there&#x27;ll be something that&#x27;ll just be a mind boggling disaster that somehow breaks through against all norms. Stuff like Theranos or Nikola.<p>Sidenote: There are so many important OSS projects that basically get little to no funding while things like Quibi burn millions if not billions in the dumbest way possible.')
