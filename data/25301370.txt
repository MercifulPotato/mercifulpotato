Item(by='refurb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607083225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294149, text='It might be a matter of &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot;.  If you look up prior FDA violations, you&#x27;ll see the FDA get pretty ticked about not clearly laying out the safety risks of a medication - as such, using language such as &quot;our drug is safe&quot; would go directly against that.<p>The FDA is incredibly strict when it comes to advertising.  I remember reading about one violation where the ad had a tagline for an ADHD medication &quot;So you can concentrate on the important things&quot; and showed a picture of a child studying.  The FDA said &quot;the image implies that your medication will improve the ability of a child to study and you have submitted no data to the FDA to support this claim&quot;.')
