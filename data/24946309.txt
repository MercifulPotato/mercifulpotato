How do we expand them beyond industrial developer tools, &amp; make them more user tools?!<p>I think one of the missing pieces on DIY&#x2F;user serverless is that there&#x27;s not a lot of connectivity. Systems like node-red have integration points for all kinds of systems, whereas serverless tech tends to have a more concentrate developer-oriented focus for it&#x27;s connectivity, taking events off queues and via http endpoints.<p>We&#x27;re only just starting to bring more focus onto the messaging bus underpinning serverless. Knative Eventing, for example, is one of the contenders, which defines a pluggable architecture for what events are, where they come from, how to write more. That way you could start extending the system, having events come in for your light switch, or your weather sensor, or your car&#x27;s location or what not, adapting whatever protocols or systems you might have.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knative.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;eventing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knative.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;eventing&#x2F;</a>')
