This theory has been tested many times before.<p>The problem comes when 1% decided that these ugly old high-rises were ruining the view from their million pound townhouse.<p>The council respond to these perfectly reasonable complaints by cladding the ugly building in some nice cladding, sourced from the lowest bidder, with little consideration for how it would affect the safety of these properties.<p>The council gets to feel good about spending money improving low cost housing; the companies producing and fitting the cladding are happy to take the money; and the only people who suffer are mostly poor immigrants. Basically a win all around.')
