At least on the AirPods Pro, there appears to be no real positional tracking.<p>Try this.  Watch something on, say, an iPad with spatial audio enabled.   Turning your head left and right moves the audio so it appears to be coming from the iPad.  Works great.  Then turn your head, and keep it turned for a few seconds.  The audio will gradually slide to where your nose is pointing, and will <i>not stay anchored to the device</i> for long.<p>It seems to me it&#x27;s assuming that if your head is still, you must be looking directly at the screen, and recalibrates. The position estimates seem to be computed using accelerometers and not absolute positional tracking.   Alternatively, it is actually tracking absolute positions but assumes that you want a &quot;centered&quot; audio experience even though the iPad is to your side.  I think the former explanation is more plausible.<p>Also, try moving laterally to the iPad, so that you are no longer looking directly at the iPad.  It will still keep your audio entered.')
