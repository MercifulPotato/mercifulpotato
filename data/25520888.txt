You can have rigor around your value&#x2F;culture fit questions. In our process, we require strong reasons for both yes and no decisions (especially for culture fit). If an interviewer says no &quot;because X&quot; we look for similar signal to have shown up in other parts of the loop (performed by different people). If only one interviewer sees a signal, we are careful to analyze it for bias.')
