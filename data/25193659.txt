Went from weekly headeaches taking handfull of paracetamol&#x2F;ibuprofen to none in years. some other i&#x27;m taking now works for 90% .<p>Apparently beta blockers are well known for this, as a neurologist told me a few weeks ago. No clue why it was never mentioned when searching treatment. I found out myself also only after having to take it due to high BP.<p>Still looking for something that works for a relative, tried almost everything, including triptans and vitamin B2 (which I havent seen mentioned yet). Maybe mushrooms would be something to try next.')
