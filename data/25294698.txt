AVX-512 on Ice Lake (client) however is quite good and causes very little throttling versus its sustained speeds (e.g. my Ice Lake laptop @ 3.6GHz or whatever it is). Ultimately you have to do benchmarking yourself and if you care about inferences&#x2F;sec you&#x27;ll have to think about this stuff.<p>That said, AVX2 support would also be cool simply because it&#x27;s more readily available to use on more platforms, not just my laptop...')
