Over the planned mission duration the satellites wouldn&#x27;t have drifted apart too much, and even without thrusters there&#x27;s tricks you can use to tweak orbital periods to keep them lined up. Even that is a moot point, since for F6 they didn&#x27;t need to be lined up, a cluster was acceptable.<p>The main problem came from the 4th F in F6, fractionated. The goal was to create a <i>heterogenous</i> network of satellites, built by a whole litany of manufacturers without even a common bus. That ended up being a solution in search of a problem. It made integration way more complex, which was exacerbated by the number of independent participants. The project spent a lot of time working on shared SDKs that would work across the constellation. In practice, there weren&#x27;t really enough benefits over homogeneous constellations to make all the extra effort worthwhile. Instead of having 5 satellites with cameras beam their images to another satellite that determines which images are cloudy, it&#x27;s easier to just have each satellite running identical code so it can figure out for itself which images are cloudy.')
