No, and I support Amazon’s right to “nope” out of anything they want.<p>But in the current context of the rush to also prevent open Trump support in other areas like payment processing, and the way the media is hellbent on trying to inextricably link Trump support with terrorism, it should be apparent that there’s a larger effort in play here, that feels highly politically motivated.<p>What bothers me at this point isn’t whether Amazon has the legal right to do this (they do).<p>What bothers me somewhat is that there is a clear chilling effect that is intended across the board for a huge portion of the country.<p>What bothers me even more, is that so many intelligent, well intentioned people are practically giddy about it.<p>We don’t all have to agree politically in any capacity, but I would at least hope we would have enough empathy to judge this in the context in which any reasonable person would see this on the other side, and be willing to advocate, at the very least, that we do this carefully and with respect for our fellow neighbors.
