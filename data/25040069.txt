People have been trying to get gamedev done in Haskell for like a decade with virtually nothing to show for. The LambdaCube 3D guys have been working on it for ~8 years and last I&#x27;ve seen they couldn&#x27;t even get quake 3 graphics to render smoothly.I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable development in recent times, so I don&#x27;t expect that to change in the next few years.<p>The only thing I could realistically see happening anytime soon would be people using it as a scripting language for Godot, but I&#x27;m not convinced that working with the Godot abstractions won&#x27;t rob you off most of the gains you make by using Haskell.')
