I disagree with much of it. I ask you to bear with me as I explain myself. The subject of race is inherently political, and, specifically with regards to Egyptians, mired in decades of bad faith. Much of early Egyptology was dedicated to &quot;proving&quot; that Ancient Egyptians weren&#x27;t &quot;black.&quot; This is, of course, impossible; &quot;blackness&quot; is not a objectively-defined designation. It&#x27;s a contextually-driven decision by observers and the self.<p>So, again, the most interesting question becomes not of whether or not Egyptians were black - by the modern definition of blackness (<i>itself predicated in part on notions of separating African populations</i>), they weren&#x27;t, nor where they white, or Middle Eastern, or Levantine. The most interesting question is why the assertion that they weren&#x27;t black is so vociferous. That&#x27;s the character of the parent and several of its replies, not clear-eyed curiosity. They represent a conclusion, not an investigation.<p>It&#x27;s in this light - in observing this echo chamber - that I felt the need to protest, and I feel justified in doing so. Humor me and assume, for a moment, that &quot;Egyptians were not black,&quot; being rooted in a pre-geneology, anthropology-nascent scientific understanding, is itself a political assertion. What does the rest of this discussion look like, then? How, in your default perspective, is it <i>not</i> political? Because of the genetic studies cited? What do those studies actually say, and what about the model you&#x27;ve built around them is actually an intellectual leap?<p>That&#x27;s the conversation I want to have. Not, &quot;Oh boy ain&#x27;t my Negro Studies professor dumb?&quot;.')
