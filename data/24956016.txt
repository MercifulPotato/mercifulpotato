Item(by='memling', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604186164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954078, text='&gt; That&#x27;s the moment when, suddenly, 1) the antagonist molests a child or rapes a woman, and is killed with glee, or 2) the hero gets the upper hand on the antagonist but decides morally and bravely not to kill them, then turns their back on the antagonist for no reason; the ungrateful antagonist immediately takes the opportunity to dishonorably kill the hero from behind, but is killed by a sidekick, secondary character, or act of God in the nick of time, leaving the hero pure.<p>Could start that way.  I think it&#x27;s <i>Thomas Covenant</i> that works like this?  An interesting contrast to the point, perhaps.')
