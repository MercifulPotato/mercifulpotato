A lot of people want to be &quot;good people&quot;. They don&#x27;t understand how the definitions of words have changed and what they&#x27;re really signing up for. &quot;Anti-racisim&quot; sounds great - what reasonable, moral person wants to be racist? But you begin to read the text and you start to see it isn&#x27;t what you think it is. That it isn&#x27;t anything like what we&#x27;ve been working towards in terms of civil rights and equality.<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;Progressivism&quot; is the right word. There&#x27;s not a good name for this philosophy yet other than derogative terms like &quot;woke&quot;. Social Justice maybe but I find it unjust. I&#x27;ve seen &quot;therapeutic totalitarianism&quot; as one candidate.')
