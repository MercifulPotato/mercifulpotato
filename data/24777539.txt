I actually did it that way on purpose.  Reason being is that in multiplayer, you get points clicking around the blurry shape.  So, competitive function with multiple players, and there&#x27;s a risk of misclicking in the rush and nailing a mine.<p>I do however have an update coming up (sigh after this ... month ... eventually) which will address what you just said, and also try to make sure your first click always hits a hole.  But not sure how it&#x27;ll turn out just yet.  I&#x27;m a romantic when it comes to random number generators so I didn&#x27;t want to mess with a pre-generated board just to create a hole.  Plan is to shift the entire board by X,Y tiles from where you click, and as you can imagine geometry of irregular shapes is a bit tricky.')
