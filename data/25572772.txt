There&#x27;s a non-zero chance of transmitter failure, or a &quot;flyaway&quot;, where the drone basically enters full-power to the rotors and just goes whatever direction it happens to be pointed in.<p>In such a situation, it could easily cause a car accident, or crash through the window of a tall building, or worst-case scenario - which these laws are very much trying to prevent - it could end up in the engine of a plane coming in to land and endangering the hundreds of people on board.<p>If this drone was urgently delivering an organ for a transplant across the city, and flown by a professional operator with clearance from local airspace authorities, as well as multiple redundant systems to prevent catastrophic failure - then it&#x27;s definitely worth the risk. But obviously that&#x27;s not the case here, this was an amateur playing with a toy in order to make a youtube video. As such, it should only be allowed in the lowest risk environments - like big empty fields far away from people and airports.')
