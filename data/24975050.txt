It&#x27;s about people and business.<p>One, for microservices created by the companies themselves, those bascically grow out of their org chart. It is well known that organizations ship their org chart, and this is no exception. Person A wants to become a manager to make more money and ascend the societal hierarchy. Person A&#x27;s manager wants to grow their fiefdom and have more people under them (which is the only true measure of one&#x27;s worth as a manager, as far longer term career is concerned), so the person A proposes to their manager that they use &quot;best practices&quot; and carve off a &quot;microservice&quot;. Their manager happily obliges, because they don&#x27;t know anything about distributed systems and consistency. Person A gets promoted. Now person B wants to become a manager to make more money and have their fiefdom... The end result is you have a nightmarish maze of microservices where a single simple monolithic binary would do a better job at one quarter the dev cost. You also have a very deep and branchy org chart, which is the preferred state for the management, since it lets them justify (and increase) their pay.<p>Two, for cloud microservices, they offer a simple way to create recurring, extremely sticky revenue.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that microservices are useless - they are useful sometimes. It&#x27;s just that &quot;nobody ever got fired for moving to AWS&quot;, and when the incentive structure does not encourage more robust engineering and&#x2F;or cost savings, your money won&#x27;t be spent wisely, because nobody gives a shit about that.<p>As with any people problem, the only way to push back against this is by making the desired state the lowest energy state. This can be done several different ways, none of which have anything to do with engineering arguments, at least not if you want it be be effective against such very human things as greed and desire for social status.')
