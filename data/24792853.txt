Which is why there is so much pedestrian safety built into so many cities. You don’t need to know <i>why</i> that car is plowing full-speed into a pedestrian-filled NYC sidewalk (terrorism, medical emergency, human error, etc) because no matter what those failures are prevented the same way: giant blocks of concrete making it impossible for a car to get onto the sidewalk. Likewise with driving too fast, driving too slow, failing to stop, stopping unnecessarily, etc.<p>Any way an AI-driven car can fail, humans have been failing in the same way for a hundred years. <i>Cars</i>, by virtue of their incredibly limited mobility, can only fail in so many different ways. It’s not like a Tesla with autopilot can suddenly jump over barriers or drive sideways.')
