Your subjective experience of continuous consciousness doesn&#x27;t really exist - this is most notable under general anesthetic (even people who report dreams - don&#x27;t have them - you dream in the moments you&#x27;re awakening, not while you&#x27;re under). Sleep is the same - you only dream in the minutes of the morning, not through the night - not through deep sleep.<p>How would a copy know the difference? You lie down on a bed, are put under, and wake up - the copy having been made. How do you know you&#x27;re not the copy? How do you know which one woke up?')
