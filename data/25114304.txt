Imagine the headlines “Celebrity X account hacked, here are the emails, cryptographically verified by Google”<p>Of course, informed people will know that anybody could have faked them, but I would guess normal people would be fooled. In addition, there is no way to say the emails are definitely fake. At least now, we can tell between actual leaked emails and fake emails.')
