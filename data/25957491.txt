The future scenarios &#x27;priced in&#x27; to that company now are several degrees beyond ludicrous.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m missing the point at all, which to me is:  massive swaths of the entire market are super irrational right now, and have been for a while, with no end in sight.<p>&gt; no one, least of all me, can predict future stock prices<p>This seems more true to me today than it ever has been. \n After all the shit I&#x27;ve seen happen with stocks in the past few years (2020 especially), things I used to consider impossible I no longer do.  None of this makes any sense any more.  I don&#x27;t really have the stomach for it, honestly, the whole thing makes me nauseous.  But if I want my meager savings to do anything other than lose value, I still have to try to evaluate what&#x27;s going on to weigh my choices.')
