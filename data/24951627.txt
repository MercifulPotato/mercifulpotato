It might not occur to me that of all the jobs he could have landed, these just happened to be big money deals in China and Ukraine, where Joe Biden was active in foreign policy - negotiating trade deals and firing financial fraud prosecutors - that seemed to involve a lot of free money for the Biden family. It might not strike me as corrupt, and I might not notice that the press are clinically uninterested in finding out more, or even asking the Bidens to clear things up.')
