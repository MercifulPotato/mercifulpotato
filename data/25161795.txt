Everyone already has a philosophy (and a religion), though many people don&#x27;t know it, and some would deny it.  The question isn&#x27;t whether to have a philosophy but which philosophy to have.<p>EDIT:  since some have asked what I meant by &quot;everyone already has...a religion,&quot; I meant that even something like atheism is a religion.  It has a story of the origin of the universe, various accounts for why and how you should live your life, and an eschatology (where the universe is headed).  Many atheists think they don&#x27;t have a religion because they don&#x27;t worship a <i>personal</i> God, when in reality atheism holds that the universe itself is functionally an impersonal, all-ordering deity.<p>In my experience, many atheists also seem to proselytize with a religious fervor as well (famously, Dawkins et al.).')
