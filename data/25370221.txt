It sounds as though the county could have prevailed if they had been able to demonstrate that closing outdoor dining kept people home in a way that prevented cases, relative to closing other businesses.<p>Why any more proof than an &quot;it&#x27;s simple&quot; shrug is required apparently has to do with the limits of emergency powers. They are apparently not able to make any arbitrary pronouncements.<p>If the county was right that closing outdoor restaurants in particular was one of the more important measures to rule, then they have cost lives--or will cost lives if the state&#x27;s measures expire--by failing to successfully argue the case. They knew that this was coming their way.')
