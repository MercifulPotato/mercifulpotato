And I thought I saw somewhere ext4 was changed to be fine until sometime around 2160 due to seconds granularity.  I wonder how much this is a function of &quot;never break user space.&quot; ?<p>The BSDs have no problem with breaking user space, Net&#x2F;OpenBSD has been using 64bit time_t for a while.  And starting with 6.8 OpenBSD&#x27;s default file system uses 64bit timestamps.<p>With that said, I think Linux&#x27;s &quot;never break user space&quot; is one of the main reasons Linux is so dominant.  And that is making the time_t work harder to complete.')
