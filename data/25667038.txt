They&#x27;ve been subpoenaed before and the only information they could provide was the date a phone number registered and the last day it contacted their servers. That&#x27;s it!<p>I do agree that moving to another centralized service is not the optimal option, but seeing the amount of effort they put into ensuring all new features ensure your privacy instills a lot of confidence in their service.<p>Long-term I&#x27;m personally rooting for either Element, Briar, or Session, but also realize they are not quite ready for mainstream and even when they are, they may be out of reach for grandma.<p>in the short term I&#x27;ve migrated most of my family friends, including my grandma, to Signal and have had zero complaints. It works more or less like WhatsApp but pretty much guarantees your privacy, which I appreciate.')
