I replaced my 2TB HDD with a 2TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus in a M.2 PCIE 3.0 x4 riser card.<p>Unfortunately when I switched from the GTX 980 to the RTX 2060 Super all PCIE 3.0 lanes were being used (ASRock Z77 Extreme 6) so had to put the riser card into a PCIE 2.0 slots which means I am not getting the full performance.')
