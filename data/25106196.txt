My guess is that there&#x27;s some sort of bug with either the new firmware or the firmware update processâ€¦ as opposed to EFI state somehow being corrupted while updating unrelated parts of the OS (which is what happened in your link).<p>These days, Windows automatically installs firmware updates as well.  The old PC status quo, where most users would never receive firmware updates at all, does have the advantage of avoiding issues like this.
