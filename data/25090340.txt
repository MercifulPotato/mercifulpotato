When I have been able to visit other countries, I have been in the habit of learning at least three verbal cues: &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;Thank you&quot;, and &quot;Sorry&quot;.<p>The first two are often the same word or phrase, in asking for help or offering thanks. The third sound is usually when bumping into someone in a crowd, or in response to getting in someone&#x27;s way. Or apologizing when it&#x27;s taking a bit longer for me to understand a particular situation.<p>I have not traveled in Africa or Southeast Asia, so very likely that I am missing the point here. But I don&#x27;t intend to take on the power to heal the whole world when I say &quot;Sorry&quot; with sincerity. I&#x27;m just trying to avoid becoming more of a problem.')
