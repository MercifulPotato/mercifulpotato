Is it going to influence whether or not you go out and vote? If not, what is the point of it?<p>What value does something like fivethirtyeight add to our democracy, if any? Is this motivation the same as that of diving deep into baseball stats or Star Wars starship engineering, just like “nerding out” for its own sake?<p>Contrast the voter who never looks at any of these polls with one who keeps up with them daily.
