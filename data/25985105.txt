Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612149116, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25983638, text='I&#x27;m not an expert, but my understanding is that this isn&#x27;t like a tug-of-war where if there are more people betting short than long then the shorts win.  It&#x27;s asymmetrical.  There are a finite number of shares and if enough people are willing to hold them at a certain price, then that will be its price.  Someone with infinite money can&#x27;t force the price to drop.  (At least not through normal &quot;market&quot; means that don&#x27;t involve fraud, theft, coercion, changing the rules, or violence.)<p>Imagine there&#x27;s an auction for a one-of-a-kind Stradivarius violin, and it&#x27;s bid up to a million dollars.  Maybe you&#x27;re a violin expert and know that it&#x27;s only worth a hundred thousand dollars.  But if at least two people are willing to bid it up to a million dollars, then there isn&#x27;t a bidding strategy to cause the violin to sell for less than a million dollars.<p>Theoretically you could maybe claim to own an identical violin and be willing to sell it for two hundred thousand dollars, but if you don&#x27;t actually have one it&#x27;s a lie, and if people take you up on the offer but the price doesn&#x27;t go down, you&#x27;re on the hook for it.  Which means you&#x27;ll have to buy the violin at whatever price the person who wins the auction thinks it&#x27;s worth, or default on your commitment.')
