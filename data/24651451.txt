Over the years new versions of HDMI keep coming out with higher bandwidth to support higher resolutions. But there&#x27;s no way to look at a cable and tell what HDMI version it supports. These days HDMI 2.0 is minimal but you want HDMI 2.1 if you want to support HDR10 or anything over 4K@60. There&#x27;s also a bunch of side features in HDMI (like CEC) that are not reliably implemented.')
