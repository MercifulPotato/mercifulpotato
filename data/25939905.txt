Item(by='opk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611825817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936426, text='&gt; Aside: Iâ€™d also like to see a command line shell which runs outside the terminal emulator rather than inside it.<p>So how would that work over something like ssh or even a serial terminal. And you&#x27;d have a shell containing a lot of very platform specific code. That really breaks everything. I&#x27;d prefer to see well thought out evolutions to the ANSI escape sequence standards that solve real problems. The proposal on the original post does that for keys. Other things like bracketed paste and support for more than a few colours have seen some adoption. Some good ideas get less attention like having a stack for titlebar changes. Some things that weren&#x27;t a great idea security-wise have been dropped (key redefinitions, retrieving the title).<p>One of the problems is that the concept behind termcap and terminfo doesn&#x27;t really scale or allow for innovations. As a user of rxvt-unicode I often suffer the frustration of it being unrecognised on bare OS installs. But I respect the fact that it doesn&#x27;t just claim to be xterm while emulating it imperfectly like many.')
