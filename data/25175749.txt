They get linked on HN somewhat often, and for good reason - they manage to balance being detailed and informative on technical subject matter while still being interesting and readable.<p>The New Yorker and The Economist have already been mentioned but are worth mentioning again.<p>Le Monde Diplomatique has some great material.
