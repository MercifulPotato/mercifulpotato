Hypotheses as I understand them:<p>- You will offer a freemium model<p>- You don&#x27;t have early users<p>- You want to get users to test your product and offer feedback<p>Lauching does not seem to be blocked with the pricing model given that you&#x27;re offering a freemium, so I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t worry about this for now: launch and learn. One assumption I&#x27;m making is that you can support many users as in the effect of an additional user is marginal. Why does it matter? It is not our case, since our product enables users to do compute intensive machine learning jobs through collaborative notebooks with automatic model tracking and deployment. This is why we&#x27;re going with an &quot;early access&quot; type of offering and Slack channels to stay in touch with users and help them.<p>If an additional user doesn&#x27;t imply a hefty price in compute&#x2F;storage and you don&#x27;t have to worry about Poisson distribution, then I&#x27;d say just launch it.<p>Again, this is my input given a set of hypotheses I&#x27;m making about what your product does. I may be wrong and you&#x27;re welcome to correct.')
