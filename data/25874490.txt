They are more efficient at cold temperatures.  When the sun is up, colder air tends to have fewer clouds and having the sun lower on the horizon means static panels can be pointed more efficiently.  Shorter trees mean housed generally have a better view of the horizon&#x2F;sky&#x2F;sun.  And snow on the ground acts as a reflector, increasing the light hitting the panels.  So long as you are below the actual arctic circle, there is a place for panels even in winter.')
