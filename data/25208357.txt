In the same test with 4K RED RAW there were some shuttering on the first playback but subsequent playback were smooth, which I guessed it was a result of swap being moved back into a RAM.<p>My guess would be they&#x27;ve done a lot of optimization on swap, making swapping less of an performance penalty (as ridiculous as it sounds, I guess they could even use Neural Engine to determine what should be put back into RAM at any given moment to maximize responsiveness.)<p>macOS has been doing memory compression since Mavericks using WKdm algorithm, but they also support Hybrid Mode[1] on ARM&#x2F;ARM64 using both WKdm and a variant of LZ4 for quite some time (WKdm compress much faster than LZ4). I wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if M1 has some optimization for LZ4. So far I haven&#x27;t seen anybody tested it.<p>It might be interesting to test M1 Macs with vm_compressor=2 (compression with no swap) or vm_compressor=8 (no compression, no swap)[2] and see how it runs. I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a way to change bootargs on M1 Macs, though.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apple&#x2F;darwin-xnu&#x2F;blob&#x2F;a449c6a3b8014d9406c2ddbdc81795da24aa7443&#x2F;osfmk&#x2F;vm&#x2F;vm_compressor_algorithms.c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apple&#x2F;darwin-xnu&#x2F;blob&#x2F;a449c6a3b8014d9406c...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apple&#x2F;darwin-xnu&#x2F;blob&#x2F;a449c6a3b8014d9406c2ddbdc81795da24aa7443&#x2F;osfmk&#x2F;vm&#x2F;vm_pageout.h#L575-L581" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apple&#x2F;darwin-xnu&#x2F;blob&#x2F;a449c6a3b8014d9406c...</a>')
