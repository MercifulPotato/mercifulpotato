Not to mention text-based Lynx, Links, w3m, curl, and wget.<p>If there is one person out there still using one of these browsers, for whatever reason, I want them to still be able to access my site, rather than telling them to take a hike.<p>I think it&#x27;s rude, ablist, exclusionist, arrogant, just plain <i>bad</i> to demand the user switch browsers just to access my resource, akin to telling a wheelchair user to take a hike, or making a road incompatible with a certain car.<p>I don&#x27;t think that for low-interest pages with text and information, HTTPS has more disadvantages than advantages.<p>I think the Web has taken a turn for the worse, but it&#x27;s not too late to turn it around and make it free and accessible again.<p>I&#x27;m committed to put in work and research to bring about this turnaround. Honestly speaking, it&#x27;s not that hard once you start trying. It&#x27;s just a matter of keeping your HTML simple and light, feature-checking all your JavaScript, making fallbacks for nojs, favoring older tags over newer, ignoring some bullshit standards, and a bit of tweaking here and there.<p>If a near-idiot like myself working alone can build a web-based forum software which does all this, then I find it hard to believe that a company like Google couldn&#x27;t do it.<p>And, in fact, while tricking everyone else to drop HTTP support and ignore non-Chrome browsers, Google continues to offer at least rudimentary support for Search for just about every browser I mentioned above.')
