Item(by='rectang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612122572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25981766, text='&gt; Can a MIT project be relicensed?<p>Among more sophisticated users I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s disagreement on this point.  The answer is &quot;no&quot;, if by &quot;relicense&quot; you mean &quot;remove the MIT license and put in something else&quot;.  You can never legitimately remove the MIT license from a file unless you&#x27;re the copyright holder or their authorized agent.<p>Where there&#x27;s less than total agreement is whether the MIT license may be <i>subsumed</i> by another license — e.g. the Apache License 2.0 — when an MIT licensed work is bundled within a package.  Can you claim that the complete package is available &quot;under the Apache License 2.0&quot;, omitting the fact that the licenses are actually polyglot?<p>The answer to that question seems to be &quot;everybody does that&quot; and &quot;in practice, the legal risk seems to approach zero&quot;, but in theory should two licenses ever prove to have incompatible provisions then things could get sticky in a court case.')
