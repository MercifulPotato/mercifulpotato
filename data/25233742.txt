Before moving there, we considered &quot;just trying it&quot; by renting an airbnb. But we figured that there is not much difference between &quot;just trying it&quot; and actually moving there because we were only two back then. And our company was just us + our desktop computers. So we did move, but we kind of forgot we were in test-mode in the process.<p>Budget definitely is not the issue to move places, but visa&#x2F;covid&#x2F;taxes are. It might also make my french tax non-resident status harder to get if I&#x27;m moving all over the place. But as you said, my top priority now is getting better.')
