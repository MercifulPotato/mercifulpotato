Of course it&#x27;s impossible to know the actual average number for any given developer but we often get developers estimating Pernosco saved hours, occasionally days, or occasionally the bug couldn&#x27;t have been solved any other way. So I just tried to make a conservative guess.<p>&gt; How likely is it that a given bug will be solved with Pernosco?<p>There&#x27;s no way to put a number on this but I think it&#x27;s unusual to not eventually figure it out with rr or Pernosco (but Pernosco will be faster) if conditions under the user&#x27;s control are met: the recording really captures the bug you care about, it&#x27;s in code in a language we support, and the debuginfo and sources are right.<p>&gt; What do I do if I pay and only realize after that the session wasn&#x27;t helpful?<p>&quot;Sorry&quot;. Hopefully the reasons it wasn&#x27;t helpful are mostly under your control and the benefits average out in your favour.')
