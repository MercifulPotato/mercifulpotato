Even if GameStop stock would trade at zero, the company still exists until it runs out of money and declares bankruptcy, which is independent of its stock price.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s not really saving any jobs, since GameStop employees (excluding higher ranked employees) probably don&#x27;t have any part of their compensation that&#x27;s stock based.<p>Toys R Us was a leveraged buyout, which is definitely a much more ethically dubious strategy, and that can cause jobs to be lost. This won&#x27;t cause any jobs at GameStop to be lost, although there probably will be some unhappy traders and people left holding bags of GameStop stock.')
