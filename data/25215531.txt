It was a group of very smart, somewhat cynical folks who really just concentrated on getting shit done.  There wasn&#x27;t a hierarchy or a career path.  You were just a Senior Engineer charging by the hour.  Things did get a bit weird when the owner hired a salesman to run the place for a while and he started over-promising and spending too much on marketing, but that problem sorted itself out fairly quickly.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware of any significant politics between us(account management, which I would say are sales, PMs, and the owner of the company) and the customers.  There were political struggles inside big customers(i.e. DirecTV) when a VP would have to justify paying us, but that&#x27;s not really something we got involved in.  There were arguments over billing rates and such, but I wouldn&#x27;t call that &#x27;politics&#x27; it&#x27;s just doing business.  I consider &#x27;politics&#x27; to be things like dog and pony shows, massaging peoples egos, playing one faction against each other, etc.  There wasn&#x27;t any of that.')
