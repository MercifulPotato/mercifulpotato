I &quot;grew up&quot; on the internet where most of my peers would have been <i>furious</i> at twitter for this, and yet here, now, it seems like the pro-fee-speech perspective is the one that is going to get me in trouble for having.<p>The culture has really shifted <i>drastically</i> in the last 10-15 years.<p>Twitter <i>could have</i> been this incredible place where you had democratization of information.  Tons of politicians and important public figures are there, and you, a normal person, can interact with them.  I have my gripes with twitter, I hate the way they &quot;tweak&quot; the feed to optimize for rage and hatred (but I think as long as you know its there, you can ignore it), but the core <i>idea</i> is so cool.  Unfortunately I think we&#x27;re way past dead now.<p>The world is a worse place because of twitter.  There is more hatred, more confusion, more disinformation, and more normalization of the suppression of &quot;wrong&quot; ideas.  This is not the world that we all though we were making.')
