Further, this isn&#x27;t just ID, but a whole range of info around that ID.<p>As example, by law in my jurisdiction, I am legally obliged to keep medical info, address, and other info up to date for my license.<p>I believe breaches of government ID must be held to a far higher standard than a lost credit card.  IMO equifax goes into that slot, for it falls into the &quot;cannot escape&quot; category.<p>As an example, I have never used airbnb, due to their mandatory ID requirements, regardless of their claims uploaded ID is deleted after vetting.  After all, Equifax&#x27;s compromise went on for almost a year, and in such a case each upload, waiting to be vetted, could be copied before deletion.<p>So I use alternative services, like VRBO, or Craigslist even.  I have choice, options, and am not compelled by law to use any of these services.<p>As soon as I am compelled, by the threat of violence (arrest, etc) to do a thing, you&#x27;d better perform the utmost in due diligence.<p>And maybe, not give entire databases to others, for profit?')
