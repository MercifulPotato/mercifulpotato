It is not. A European college being happy to see a fellow European on a international team is not the same as a two people associating with caste.<p>Caste is a system designed based on the &quot;division of laborers&quot;, not labor(very important distinguishing) to promote privilege by birth and monopoly of education to some and denial to the rest. By &quot;division of laborers&quot; i mean if a person is born in a non priestly caste they will be denied education and its impossible to change caste. This was the case until the Britishers arrived to india and you see majority of the indians are first graduates in the family now because of denial of education to their forefathers.<p>This is the reason caste system must not be encouraged at all.')
