Tbh, I thought it&#x27;d go the opposite way - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend having a baby during lockouts. You have to ask family to break rules just to get some occasional rest bite and we&#x27;ve had very little in the way of government or community support - my wife goes to 1 baby class a week, with reduced capacity, social distancing and masks. Being a father is great, but it would have been nice to start outside a pandemic.')
