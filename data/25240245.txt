However fetishizing grit is a <i>terrible</i> guiding principal for public policy.<p>Having grown up in the US, I think this is one of the biggest reasons for the deep dysfunction we have seen there in the past few decades.  The value for &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot;, and almost religious belief in meritocracy places the blame for failure on the shoulders of the individual in the eyes of society, and helps to create an environment where courts and legislators can dismantle safety nets, and fail to support the population in times of collective crisis.<p>In times like we are living through, where there are a great many forces beyond the control of the average citizen which have the power to utterly wipe them out financially, it can be actively harmful to tell people that each individual is the master of their own destiny.  We can and should expect and contribute to a collective good as well.')
