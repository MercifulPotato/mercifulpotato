Moreover, I&#x27;m pretty sure TPB has gone down here and there, probably for weeks at a time. I don&#x27;t think Parler&#x27;s problems threat model is that bad; just maybe don&#x27;t depend on companies that are liable to peer pressure. In the worst case you just get hosting from someone who isn&#x27;t going to dump you because of social pressure (even going out of country if you must).')
