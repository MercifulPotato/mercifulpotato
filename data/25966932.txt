You could cordon off a chunk of RAM to act as a second screen buffer, render to it, and then toggle  the screen buffer during screen retrace to get a very fast (60hz, er 30hz, I guess) &quot;flip animation&quot;.<p>As I recall from my brief experiment, you could get a pseudo 50% gray where the corresponding pixels on the two buffers were opposites (one buffer with a black pixel, the other with white).')
