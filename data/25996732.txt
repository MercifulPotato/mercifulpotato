It feels like much of the same.<p>In my grade school all of the girls had a crush on one or two guys even the less pretty ones.  No one had a chance.  High school was similiar.  Going to rock concerts changed that as I started to meet girls with similiar interests.  Going to a concert would automatically give me a leg up because we were now part of a social circle.  Later on in life I would go to a karoke bar and just the act of showing up a few times on the same day for a few weeks puts you in a social circle with others who do the same.<p>I don&#x27;t know if things have changed all that much aside from the amount of people online. I use to meet girls from bbses &#x2F; the early social media sites.  The differences is they were smaller and you felt like part of a social circle.<p>Today I would advise to try to go to social meetups like photography in the park groups.. try to join a smaller group.<p>In the end the girls from my elementary school grew up and married.  Everyone married similiar to them.  If they are overweight so are there husbands.  If they were an 8 their husbands would be an 8.  If they are a 4 their husbands are a 4.  They general look like each other.<p>My guess is the girls from your primary school will end up with someone similiar to them and so will you.')
