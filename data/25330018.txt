To help with collecting metrics?!<p>I view it as a clear antipattern (since the history within a branch can be valuable later if you need to cherry-pick apart a feature or find a bug with git-bisect) and have asked superiors in numerous places why they require it, and the response is usually a vague mention of “it cleans things up” and “history isn’t important”. It feels like the kind of practice that was mentioned on a screencast and just got cargo-culted, but I have to think it originally had <i>some</i> purpose.')
