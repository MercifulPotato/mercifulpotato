With me, it is predominantly about the utter unusability of the error messages. C++ has postprocessors you can use to get your 20 page STL errors down to a few lines just by reversing the expansion the compiler did to show you mere mortal something that you might recognize as your code instead of template-cthulhu.<p>Haskell has such situations as well, but usually far less verbose. Getting something to typecheck because you wrote down something incompatible uninferable still sucks. But far less than C++.')
