I&#x27;ll have some of whatever the reviewers on this manuscript were smoking.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;The interpretation of the \n95% confidence intervals is that the &quot;true&quot; mass ingested for each food source and total mass will \nbe within the ranges calculated (Table 7). However, this depends critically on the shape of the \nuniform distribution chosen and the assumed 50% relative uncertainty in number of particles and \nmass of particles. This uncertainty was chosen arbitrarily to help in understanding the sensitivity \nof the mass ingested to errors in the estimates reported.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>This is literally pulling numbers put of thin air, since no actual numbers exist. The upper limit of error propagation from a <i>completely arbitrary estimate</i>, which turns into three full orders of magnitude or uncertainty, then gets reported as &quot;fact&quot; by news outlets...<p>I&#x27;ve said it before, the science of microplastics today is where chemistry was in the 17th century. The people working in this field seem to have very limited understanding of basic math, physics and chemistry. Either step up and do shit properly, or go home. This is just embarassing.')
