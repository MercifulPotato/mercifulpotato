Current auto capacity is 2x units sold in 2020 (Fremont + Shanghai). By the end of 2021, will be 3x (+Berlin). By the end of 2022, should be 4-5x with Texas and expansions at the earlier factories. Tesla will be producing the Cyber Truck, Semi tractor and updated Roadster, though the unit leader should be Model Y(?).<p>Historic sales growth is somewhat behind capacity growth. 2017 ended at about $12B. 2020 is tracking to maybe $32B. That&#x27;s around 40% annual sales growth. Let&#x27;s call 2.5 million cars $125B in sales. At 40%, Tesla needs around 4 years to get to the $125B level. Essentially, the back of my envelope says long buyers today will need to hold for 4 years to see a profit based on some semblance of fundamentals.<p>Stock prices for high-growth companies can be fluffy for a long time. I absolutely agree that current levels are in the realm of absurdly ridiculous, but as long as the underlying economy doesn&#x27;t crater, the exuberants can be irrational for quite a long time. Can they hold out for 4 years?')
