That kid is <i>creating content</i>. Children under the age of 13 certainly shouldn&#x27;t be on TikTok but that&#x27;s not the parent&#x27;s fault, that&#x27;s the platform&#x27;s.<p>Preventing your children from accessing social media is taking away their support network. If you&#x27;re as strict as you say - and refusing to let your son take his phone out of the house <i>is</i> strict - he&#x27;s certainly not going to trust you because _you don&#x27;t trust him_. Your job as a parent is to let your kids grow, not to put these kids of boundaries on them. Let them look up to you for advice, not look to you every five minutes to see if what they&#x27;re doing is allowed. If you were parenting well you wouldn&#x27;t need to put more than a couple rules on your kids because they&#x27;d be good people anyway. They won&#x27;t have those kids of rules on them as adults.<p>There are two people I know in real life with parents more strict than mine (and my parents aren&#x27;t as strict as you); one of them has grown to develop anger issues and the other has such little life experience that it&#x27;s sometimes hard to talk to them (&quot;what&#x27;s X?&quot;, &quot;what&#x27;s Y?&quot;).')
