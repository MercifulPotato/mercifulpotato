I have a file called “dummy.zip” with and empty file in it that lives in the terraform repo and that zip goes in to S3 on initial apply then CI pushes the built zip to S3 and calls the lambda update command via the CLI.<p>I’ve not yet had to juggle changes to the live lambda but I put in the bits to make it stamp out an alias so I can start using specific aliases to ensure new versions don’t automatically get picked up by downstream invocations. All of that has yet to be put in to practice for real.')
