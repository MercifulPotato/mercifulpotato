Paul Getty once mused[1]:<p>&gt; If you owe the bank $100 that&#x27;s your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that&#x27;s the bank&#x27;s problem.<p>Crappy situation for OP and his startup, but I find the part about reading up on bankruptcy to be a bit premature.<p>Perhaps not the most ethical choice, but what stops OP from just not paying the bill, and finding a different cloud provider? Obviously they&#x27;ll want to not repeat the &quot;experiment&quot;, but seriously... there&#x27;s no mechanism at Google to stop a new client from running up a near-$100k bill in a single day?<p>That&#x27;s absurd, and should be a learning lesson for Google more than this startup. Some malicious actor could apparently consume hundreds of thousands of dollars of Google resources and &quot;get away&quot; with it.<p>Wait and see what happens, then deal with it - would be sane advice.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brainyquote.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;j_paul_getty_129274" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brainyquote.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;j_paul_getty_129274</a>')
