They are not a socialistic public good, they are a capitalistic company whose goal is to make themselves profit. It is not their job to make you money. Capitalism works because trade is not a zero sum game, so it is normally possible that everyone profits. Here we seem to have hit the normal edge case where one company may refuse to participate if they would not profit (including the loss to their reputation and the future earnings potential it buys, etc).
