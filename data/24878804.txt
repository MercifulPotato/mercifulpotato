Things never stop changing.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many years we will be on this increased remote thing.  Hopefully for some time.<p>But imagine a few years from now when there is no pandemic.  Say someone creates a futuristic smart city with good density, lots of parks, and 100% autonomous cars.  In that situation you may find that working from home becomes uncool.<p>Or another totally different possibility.  Virtual and augmented reality become so good that whether you are actually in your home or not does not really determine much about your working situation.
