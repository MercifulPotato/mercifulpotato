Why should we want to go in the opposite direction?<p>The line between gambling and investing is very very fuzzy. We’ve even seen recent stories of people gaming literal lotteries to tilt the scales towards a win. You cannot ban a tool that one person uses for gambling without also banning others who use that same tool for investing. I’m sorry but I’d rather have those tools than have them taken away because someone else is irresponsible with them.')
