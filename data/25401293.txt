They weren&#x27;t really interested in &quot;education&quot;.<p>Then I co-founded Cloud Academy with three other friends, to teach people about AWS (and later, Azure and GCP). A few years later in 2019, QA Learning bought it for a good sum. I was heavily involved since the beginning and right until the end, but never got to a proper full-time status. The full-time founders deserve most of the credit.<p>And now, finally, AWS seems to recognize the true value of education. The best hook ever for a cloud product.<p>If you are high up at GCP or Azure and want to compete against AWS on education, message me. I have plenty of ways to help you.')
