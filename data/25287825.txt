If we all choose to give up a little luxury we could have a huge impact. But if we leave that up to personal choice then anyone can choose to emit more carbon and reap the benefits of doing so.<p>There&#x27;s also the question of limiting the carbon emmissions of corporations. When emitting carbon is free most companies will choose to emit more if it helps their profit margins. And expecting those companies to limit emissions in exchange for goodwill is a bit naive.')
