The author was not claiming that everyone lives in harmony and no one is prejudiced against those anyone else.<p>The point is that, if you look at official stats and see &quot;98% Japanese&quot;, that ignores the fact that many of those people aren&#x27;t ethnically Japanese, because the stats talk about citizenship, not ethnicity.<p>I think that comment actually <i>proves</i> the author&#x27;s point, that there are many categories outside ethnically Japanese, and people there disagree on what it means to &quot;be Japanese&quot;, lending credence to the idea that Japan is not a homogeneous society.')
