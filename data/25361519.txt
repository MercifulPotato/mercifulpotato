S3-compatible storage at backblaze B2 is $0.005&#x2F;GB-month and I&#x27;ll see if I can manage a vdev made out of a huge nbd disk.  Topical to the article, backblaze has piles of RAID6 and appears to be happy with it.<p>Another thought has been to find a ZFS-friend in another part of the world and exchange snapshots.  Inline encryption makes that a little more viable now.<p>Right now I&#x27;m sending incremental snapshots to AWS Glacier and have another local box mirroring the data (mostly to fully verify the snapshots before sending them to Glacier).')
