I&#x27;m betting you didn&#x27;t mistrust non-mask-wearers pre-covid even though I&#x27;m sure several millions have died in the US alone since early 1920s because people with the flu or other contagious diseases didn&#x27;t wear a mask and went to work sick, etc. You just didn&#x27;t notice because it happened at a rate that didn&#x27;t overload hospitals.<p>&gt; If they can&#x27;t even take a basic precaution during a deadly pandemic then their judgement seems dangerously impaired.<p>Well imagine all of your news sources downplay covid and even when you get it yourself it&#x27;s not as bad as the hysteria led you to believe - just some mild flulike symptoms and loss of smell and taste. You start to mistrust all of the zealots forcing you destroy the economy^, handicap an entire generation of students, destroy the mental wellbeing of many millions, in order to extend the lives of the elderly and immunocompromised by a few years. It&#x27;s hard to put the blame 100% on the anti-masker. Plus, just because someone isn&#x27;t wearing a mask doesn&#x27;t automatically make them an anti-masker. I don&#x27;t wear a mask when social distancing is possible, for example (like when going on runs).<p>^ Yes I know stock market is at all time high right now, but you can&#x27;t just keep running an economy on printed money. If you aren&#x27;t actually producing, soon all that paper you&#x27;ve printed will become a lot less valuable (&quot;inflation&quot;) and the bubble will burst and you&#x27;ll see what a <i>real</i> crisis looks like.')
