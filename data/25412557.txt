The US had periods of time  with virtually no regulations. Rivers caught on fire, people were maimed and died of industrial accidents at much higher rates, water was unsafe to drink, ect. The countries now without much regulation are usually poor, dirty and dangerous. I want to live in a safe, clean, healthy environment.<p>I agree with you on the tariffs. China should not be able to outcompete us because they pollute and use slave labor. Force them to compete on fair terms.')
