They&#x27;re a necessary but not a sufficient condition for protecting the interests of workers. A union is only as good as its membership. If union members think they can just pay their union dues and expect the benefits to magically accrue, that&#x27;s not going to happen. Union members have to take a very active part in governance of their union, and immediately remove any union leaders who start to show signs of corruption. Complacency is the enemy. As soon as unions become &quot;hierarchical&quot;, it&#x27;s game over, and the union is no better than the management it was designed to fight against.')
