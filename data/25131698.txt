For example, no complaints about this sentence:<p>&gt; The poets breach the digestives by moatbutt every Thur.<p>And if I change the sentence to:<p>&gt; The poets breach the digestives by moatbutt every Thurs.<p>it tells me my reading level has changed from 7th to 8th grade despite Thurs being a much more common shortening of &quot;Thursday&quot; than &quot;Thur&quot;, which is nonsense.
