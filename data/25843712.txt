Because from 2007 -&gt; 2019 US nominal GDP is up 50% and the M2 was up 102%. I don&#x27;t think this argument that keeping price inflation contained to assets rather than consumer goods justifies calling it a period of growth. Someone is collecting all this money and it doesn&#x27;t look like it is people who earn wages.<p>The US debt&#x2F;GDP ratios have also crossed lines where there isn&#x27;t even room to pretend they are going to come down again voluntarily. US debt to GDP is out of control.<p>The US doesn&#x27;t look like it is coming out of a long period of growth. If that were true it is surprising how much trouble it is having covering its bills, and giving money to already wealthy asset owners isn&#x27;t helping.')
