The supremacist using it in court room is using it entirely within the context of the original joke. Within the context of the joke, that is, but not within the joke. He&#x27;s using it knowingly. The original joke is &quot;get people to see the OK gesture as a racist symbol, so that people are then pranked in situations in which someone who fell for the hoax embarasses himself by calling out someone else who uses the gesture in the usual way and has no idea about the hoax. Hardy har har, hoo hoo.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not a white supremacist or neo-nazi. Can I put a swastika on my jacket, such that everyone understands it&#x27;s not a symbol of nazism, because I&#x27;m not a confirmed nazi, not standing in a court room for crimes connected with my ideology?<p>You have to start a war and kill at least a few hundred thousand people before you get to hijack a common hand gesture for your ideology.')
