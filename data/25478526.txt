Everyone could be taxed at the same rate and the &#x27;rich&#x27; would still pay the most in tax dollars. The only reason ever given for why the &#x27;rich&#x27; should pay a  higher tax rate is &#x27;because they can afford to.&#x27;  Which then leads to tax code legislative loopholes to try to offset the excess taxation and then  more resentment when those loopholes are used to shelter income.')
