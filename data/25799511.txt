But the ACLU is populated by old timers.  And from time to time they have vacillated so has the EFF.  The EFF tried hard to placate Twitter and Facebook banning accounts on account that they are public companies and they could do as they pleased with regard to speech.<p>That&#x27;s not arguing for freedom.  That&#x27;s playing politics.<p>Now Twitter feels free to ban things like Sci-Hub.  And who knows who&#x27;s next.  That&#x27;s the thing, if you don&#x27;t stand for your principles, because you disagree with someone&#x27;s politics, then you don&#x27;t have principles, or at least not the right principles to defend the primary principle you are set up to defend.<p>It&#x27;s like saying you believe in due process upholding the law, but then a murderer comes around and you say, nope, sorry, I cannot defend murderer in court.  If that&#x27;s your stance, then you actually don&#x27;t believe in due process and the law.')
