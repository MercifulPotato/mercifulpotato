Using them as a reference for something being related to <i>far-right individuals and conspiracy theorists, and for hosting hateful material</i> makes the claim less believable. This does not mean BitChute does not harbour such material - given the fact that BitChute does not censor content it is likely to be present, just like it is likely for it to harbour <i>far-left individuals and conspiracy theorists</i> - but SPLC calling something bad just means they disagree with whatever the something does.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;the-southern-poverty-law-center-has-lost-all-credibility&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;21&#x2F;22ab7d60-756d-11e8-9780-b1dd6a09b549_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;the-southern-poverty...</a><p><pre><code>     There are many other sources, just search for them</code></pre>')
