If I were an OEM and wanted to sell in MA, I had an easy way to get data that would be able to stay proprietary to me and my network of dealers so long as I transmitted that data wirelessly.<p>I probably agree with you on the continuous data transmission point wrt desirability overall, but given that your car is going to do it anyway, I want that data to not be locked in the OEM garden. This removes that major advantage to using wireless transmission to work around this.')
