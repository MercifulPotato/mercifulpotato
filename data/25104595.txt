These group allegiances also act to politicize things that were previously entirely apolitical, simply through propagation.<p>The Internet, like the advent of pulp publishing, the cinema, and radio before it in the Weimar Republic, has enabled a fantastic amount of stimulus and incoherent messaging that can be directly, without any kind of curation, accessed directly by younger people. This easily leads to a state of &quot;hyperreality&quot;[^5] if you&#x27;re a leftist neo-Marxist or Bezmenov&#x27;s &quot;demoralization&quot;[^6] if you&#x27;re a rightist neo-Fascist. The particular emphasis differs between the two concepts, but the fundamental point of both is that an individual can no longer determine what is actually real and what isn&#x27;t (i.e. societal gaslighting[^7], which creates a sense of alienation and impotence that creates learned helplessness[^8]). This trend has really been ascendant for the last twenty years or so in youth culture.<p>This entire package overall creates a sense of cultural rootlessness amongst youth segments across all demographics. Note the simultaneous rise of &quot;normie&quot; and &quot;cishet privilege&quot; as insults towards majority culture in the background Internet cultural milleux by fundamentally opposing groups. The mass capitalization of culture has destroyed any sense of historical or cultural context for young people and the overall cultural and economic downturn since 2008 has also prevented their own integration into society in meaningful ways as individuals. They are plagued by impostor syndrome[^9] if they&#x27;re inside groups and are plagued by fear of missing out[^10] if they&#x27;re not. This psychological inferiority applies in every realm of their lives. They are buffeted from everywhere with contradictory messages. They are told by every form of media that they are inferior to an ever-shifting ideal. They are told that to exist socially as functional adults, they need to meet now-impossible cultural expectations--they need to be attractive, have lots of money, own houses, have high paying jobs, have great experiences <i>all the time</i>, etc.<p><i>Fight Club</i> was really prescient in nailing that emerging pathos:<p>&gt; Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who&#x27;ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables â€“ slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don&#x27;t need. We&#x27;re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We&#x27;ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we&#x27;d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won&#x27;t. And we&#x27;re slowly learning that fact. And we&#x27;re very, very pissed off.')
