The selector syntax is fairly nice and concise and the cascade of properties works as one would expect (most of the time).  I doubt CSS would benefit from throwing some SGML at it, because CSS is fundamentally just a list of selector-property pairs and not a mixed-content document.<p>The real problem with CSS is two-fold:  first, the users of CSS have turned the class= attribute of HTML into an awful ad-hoc inline styling language (with the requisite awful and nightmarish stylesheets).  And second, there is a huge amount of legacy cruft because it took 20 years of evolution for us to finally figure out a sane document layout model.<p>The non-Turing-completeness of CSS has a very very useful attribute:  given a parsed stylesheet (a styling tree where selectors are nodes and properties are leaves) it is possible to annotate an HTML document with the correct style properties in a single forward pass without backtracking!  That&#x27;s because everything in CSS is done strictly in accordance with document order.  It&#x27;s not possible for an element to change the styling applied to any elements that precede it in the document.')
