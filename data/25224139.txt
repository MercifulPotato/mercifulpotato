The caller submits a buffer for read and continues to do whatever.  When the network card receives the data, it puts them in the caller&#x27;s buffer.  The caller is notified via a callback when the data is ready.  All these were fitted in a few K&#x27;s of memory in a DOS TSR.<p>All the DOS games at the time used IPX for network play for a reason.
