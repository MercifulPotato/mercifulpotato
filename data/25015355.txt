If I&#x27;m organization XYZ and I&#x27;m hosting something on XYZ&#x27;s infrastructure, then it is self-hosting.<p>One would think the name makes it obvious, but maybe the term has been skewed like many other terms today.<p>The closest one can come to self-hosting today is hosting it yourself, not hosting it on others infrastructure.')
