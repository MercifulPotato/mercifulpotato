Potential &quot;yay&quot; and &quot;nay&quot; votes are both term-limited, so the &quot;inexperience&quot; should cancel out?<p>Your analysis seems to think that legislation is just pushing &quot;yay&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; buttons, and that discussion of experience simply is about people having the skill to find the correct button. (Though inexperience there wouldn&#x27;t cancel out, either, even with a 50&#x2F;50 split in intended votes, it would lead to reduced predictability.)<p>Legislators do more than push &quot;yay&quot; and &quot;nay&quot; buttons on packages that are assembled completely outside of their control, though.')
