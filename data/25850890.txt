With Taiwan being an island, any prospects of invasion are going to be bloody. Successful marine invasion are surprisingly rare in history. Usually, they are only successful because the defender could not set up a defense, or the attacker committed overwhelming resources. However, Taiwan&#x27;s strategic position (it guards access to the mainland from the ocean) and the ideological accomplishment of having tied up this loose end might make it worth it. And in the event Taiwanese economy and its importance declines, it could become harder for the US to justify defending it.')
