This in turn has made a lot of other small things in my life easier.<p>The claims may be overblown and some of the science dubious - but being able to reclaim some additional control over my brain has, to me, been worth the &quot;risk&quot; of trying breathing in a funny manner once a day.<p>A friend of mine tried it after being curious about my experiences for months, and immediately sent me a text message saying thanks.<p>I think perhaps it hasn&#x27;t seen mass adoption because most people face some kind of psychological barrier in trying it either from fear, or seeing it as quackery and a waste of time. Coupled with mainstream medicine being reluctant to recommend something with relatively little supporting evidence (I guess). While Wim himself has succeeded in making money from it, it is also something that is difficult to patent and sell - unlike a pill (no big-phrama conspiracies here - just money is always a motivator)')
