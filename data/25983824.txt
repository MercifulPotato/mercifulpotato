They can change their policies to do literally anything with that data anytime they like. Apple deciding what is good for me is something I neither need nor want.<p>Apple don&#x27;t pay tax, they do pay lobbying and political donations while courting the favour of politicians. That&#x27;s a problem in my eyes. Apple have a huge interest in downplaying it. Do you really think they won&#x27;t? They could do that quite thoroughly without the people at apple who see it differently to me even noticiing they were doing it.
