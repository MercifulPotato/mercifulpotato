It&#x27;s a bit more verbose and unintuitive to think about sometimes with long-ass property names, too many ways to do the same thing, a bit too low level etc.<p>Tailwind simplifies them and make those things more readable as well as visible. Combine that with postcss, you get ton of functionality via plugins.<p>You can use tailwind in any project. The end result is pretty minimal after purging unlike bootstrap or traditional CSS frameworks.
