No matter how locked down the Apple platform becomes, Facebook still knows exactly who my friends are, where I&#x27;m posting pictures from, what brands I&#x27;ve engaged with, that I really like outdoorsy pictures on Instagram. I&#x27;m fine with this, I&#x27;m engaging with Facebook and I expect them to use that data to target ads at me.<p>What these changes in iOS affect is their ability to track me across my apps via the advertiser ID when I explicitly take steps to avoid being tracked (alternate email addresses, not entering my phone number).<p>How can anyone defend Facebook&#x27;s need to know everything I do on my phone despite me taking reasonable* steps to hide that information?<p>* I feel the need to point out that my &quot;reasonable&quot; steps are for a moderately savvy user of technology. I&#x27;d guess that the vast majority of internet users aren&#x27;t aware that Facebook knows everything you on almost any site you sign into with the same email address.')
