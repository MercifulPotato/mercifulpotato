The goal is higher clocks. The enemies are stability and heat. Undervolting reduces heat but the impact on stability depends on the silicon lottery. For mobile chipsets, undervolting at the same clocks is a nice performance uplift because of the reduced heat (on a system that undoubtedly does not have the best heat dissipation.)<p>Overvolting is also useful for overclocking; at a point it can help increase stability. But generally I think you want to hit a point at which you are getting the highest clocks with the lowest voltage that is still stable.')
