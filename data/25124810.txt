The Ashley Madison thing is an excellent example, if anyone would commit suicide over having details of that nature leaked they certainly wouldn&#x27;t admit to having anything of the sort on their conscience when discussing the matter with friends or family.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a tricky situation because as has been noted upthread, the best practical way to maintain privacy is to simulate the ambient data noise. So in a sense, loudly proclaiming one has nothing to hide is the best strategy for keeping one&#x27;s own privacy secure, but at the expense of everyone else&#x27;s.<p>I don&#x27;t get into these conversations much, but if I do perhaps I should try out the response: &quot;I don&#x27;t have anything to hide either, but I know a lot of my fellow citizens value their privacy. So I&#x27;m willing to advocate for it even though I know it will lead to more scrutiny on myself. Anyone who&#x27;s afraid of that extra scrutiny is suspect! What are you really hiding!?&quot;')
