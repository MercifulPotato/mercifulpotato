There is very little data on how well the vaccines actually prevent the spread of illness - often called sterilizing immunity(1) - most of the trials simply weren&#x27;t doing the extensive PCR testing required to measure that.<p>There&#x27;s a good chance they do in fact reduce the spread of COVID-19 too in a significant way, as many vaccines achieve that. But some don&#x27;t.<p>The second issue, is that we don&#x27;t have enough data yet to know if the vaccines prevent severe COVID-19, let alone deaths, in the people most at risk. That at least we&#x27;ll probably find out soon from the UK.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;changing-america&#x2F;well-being&#x2F;prevention-cures&#x2F;501677-what-is-sterilizing-immunity-and-do-we-need-it" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;changing-america&#x2F;well-being&#x2F;prevention-c...</a>')
