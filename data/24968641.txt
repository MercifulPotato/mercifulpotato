Unfortunately, it looks like ALPC never got exposed via Win32.<p>Windows TCP sockets are definitely their own thing, which is pretty unfortunate, but Windows exposes a number of other kernel abstractions as handles - processes, mutexes, shared memory sections, events, timers, &amp;c; “Wait for either this particular process to exit or this timer to expire” is trivial. At the time I worked on it, it was one of the features I really preferred about Windows over Unix.')
