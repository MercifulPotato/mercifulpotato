Item(by='cmurf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611690057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25917221, text='Yes, but behaving like grownups no longer activates enough Republican voters to win presidential elections with a clear majority. 1996 to 2020, only in 2004 did the Republican candidate get a majority of the votes.<p>Over that time period, Republican primary voters have evicted moderate Republicans in the House, and have started to successfully evict them from the Senate. The state GOP twitter accounts for Arizona, Oregon, and Hawaii have continued to peddle conspiracy theories, post-January 6. Arizona GOP have censured three Republicans for insufficient fealty to Trump: the widow of Sen. John McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake, and the current governor. Senators Toomey, Portman, and Burr, all Republicans, are not running for re-election. It&#x27;s not due to partisanship between Republicans and Democrats, but within the Republican party. They are all moderate Trump supporters, but that&#x27;s not good enough now. Senators report a significant pressure campaign, very angry Republican constituents insisting upon a Trump acquittal no matter what, even including death threats. The pressure campaign is probably working, as evidenced by jurors claiming<p>Trump himself attacked Republicans, who wouldn&#x27;t help him overturn the election, far worse than Democrats who were never part of the fold in the first place. The impeachment trial and conviction vote will demonstrate the degree to which the Republican party is really the Trump party, perhaps most especially the party of Trumpian primary voters.')
