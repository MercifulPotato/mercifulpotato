There are no &quot;if only I had X&quot; needs, and many &quot;If only I had more hours to use my X&quot;. I reached that point when there were too few hours and &quot;enough&quot; to fill those hours, long ago.<p>I realize things can change though. If I were to suddenly be divorced for example, I&#x27;d probably value having a much higher paying job suddenly (at the expense of less free time, more stress, less interesting work etc), to be able afford life.')
