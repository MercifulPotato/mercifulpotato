A definition does not have “stages”<p>It&#x27;s really difficult to understand your confusion here. &quot;Definition&quot; is referring the the act of defining, not the formal statement that results from that process. Are you reading it as the latter?<p>Every product I have ever worked on had definition stages. How else does the formal definition come into being?')
