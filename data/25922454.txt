The funds that are shorting this deserve to be liquidated for being so foolish. At best you can only double your money with thirsting , unless you keep adding to your short. Losses however are unlimited. Too many people think that they can make a fortune shorting, like in 2008. But the reason why a movie was made about those guys is because success at shorting is so rare and difficult that when someone does it successfully , it is big deal. No one makes movies about people who buy and hold stocks.')
