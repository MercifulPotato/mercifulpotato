Item(by='Tarsul', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608211748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25450860, text='naa, the reason mickey is not as public as he was when he came out is because he became boring and he was overtaken by donald etc. I&#x27;ve followed the game devolopement of Epic Mickey where Warren Specter (producer&#x2F;director, also of deus ex-fame) had a lot to say about the history of mickey and his take was that in the beginning Mickey was very mischievous but somehow that changed over the years and he basically became boring and all the interesting traits - in the sense of storytelling or character development - where found in other characters (and once mickey had found his boring persona, writers weren&#x27;t quite allowed to give him back his mischievousness). Mickey became nothing more than an icon.')
