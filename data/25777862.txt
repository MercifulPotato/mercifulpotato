I don&#x27;t speak for Fitbit, but now that the deal is closed I can share my own opinions and ask my own questions.<p>What makes you think Google wants Apple to have the only good smart watch? That would be the main effect of sunsetting Fitbit.<p>Nest still exists after their 2014 acquisition by Google, and Nest is not as important to any other part of Google as Fitbit is to Android. Why would they be more inclined to sunset Fitbit?')
