It&#x27;s why Artifacts are default private or set up for easy sharing only among close friends, family, or colleagues.<p>Now if people want to share their interview more widely, they are of course welcome to do so, but I 100% agree with you that I think what we are building looses a lot if the assumption is that Artifacts are created for primarily public consumption, etc.<p>It&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll be paying close attention to going forward. Thank you very much for the astute comment.')
