They have tools, and libraries, and shims to integrate with other tools.  They need evangelism.  They grow with community involvement.  As far as I know, no one has ever released a new language that was perfect in its initial release - there has always been feedback and syntax quirks that get addressed in future versions.<p>If a &quot;0.1&quot; compiler with warts was out there for people to play with and improve on, I&#x27;d have faith.  But if you can&#x27;t get a demo that you&#x27;re willing to share within 5+ years, then I have very little faith you&#x27;ll ever release anything, and absolutely zero faith that you&#x27;ll be able to compromise your mental idea of perfection enough to build a thriving community around a product.')
