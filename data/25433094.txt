So, when making purchases in different e-commerce sites it&#x27;s obvious they want my email to handle all buying&#x2F;paying&#x2F;delivering communication. It made me think that what they really want is some ID in a form of email so that those online stores can use it to talk to me about one particular subject: purchase of those particular things.<p>Is there a service&#x2F;app&#x2F;whatever that will create for me short-lived email which will be destroyed after purchase is finished? I know Apple did something similar when logging in using Apple account. It would be ideal to have list of those short lived emails in some form of app and be able to track history of what happened with each of those ids.')
