Mesa needs support for specific GPUs because it needs to be able to generate code that can be run on those architectures. In this way it is similar to adding support for a particular architecture in a C compiler. I believe that for open source GPU drivers, Mesa is the piece that is used to provide OpenGL support as part of that driver, whereas with proprietary drivers, OpenGL support is provided by other software.<p>I&#x27;m sure this drastically oversimplifies the situation, so please correct &#x2F; fill in what I&#x27;m missing, but I believe this will answer the OP&#x27;s question.')
