Item(by='sangnoir', descendants=None, kids=[25605398, 25602421, 25602922, 25602269], score=None, time=1609482920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25599757, text='&gt; One more reason for me why payment system of the future must be permissionless. Like, you know, bitcoin<p>That&#x27;s not possible with a public ledger and current state of analysis - instead of proactive cancellation of the transaction on the legacy banking system, you&#x27;ll get a delayed reaction from the authorities. When you file your tax return you&#x27;ll get a notice to explain transaction ID 0x...34 to a certain banned individual. So it will be about as &quot;permissionless&quot; as tax-fraud: you will only be able to get away with it for a while, and I don&#x27;t doubt there will be future analytical tools (and laws) that will make tracing payments even easier. It is politically untenable for bitcoin payments to be opaque when &quot;Funding Terrorism&quot; is a high-priority security issue.')
