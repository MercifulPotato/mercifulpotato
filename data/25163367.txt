I was given a flouroquinolone antibiotic about 8 years ago and it really had a huge negative impact on my health. It resulted in chronic pain and some neurological issues. Neurological issues where instant, but pain took a few months to start. Even though the current research and drug information align with most of my symptoms doctors refuse to even entertain the idea. I have been to Mayo, Rush, Northshore, etc. Out of 40+ doctors one confirmed it and 2nd agrees it is possible.<p>I have met numerous people over the year receiving diagnosis of fibro, CFS, tendonitis without any reports from doctors to the FDA. Most negative reports are made by patients who researched it. This is extremely dangerous. I have met pharmacist who suffered from the same problems but still their colleagues would label them crazy.<p>I will let others test the vaccine in the real world before taking it myself.')
