So they really are a different category of document entirely.<p>Our expertise is in experienced developers&#x27; resumes - two or more years of experience, up to 35+ years&#x27; experience. It&#x27;s a different process, with different hiring teams at a company, and different resume product entirely from new graduates&#x27;.<p>So, unfortunately, for now, the answer is that we have no plans to add student resumes.')
