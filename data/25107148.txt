Are appropriate indexes in place? Does the query make inappropriate JOINs?<p>No, in the proposal, we have backend engineer(s) to advise and assist frontend engineers. Having appropriate indices and JOINs doesn&#x27;t mean you have a layer that doesn&#x27;t add business value. And when it does add value, write it!<p>&gt; schema changes now mean that you need to update your front end code. This means guaranteed hard downtime, because you can&#x27;t control what JS folks are running in the browser.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I understood you, but you can just force a refresh in the browser.<p>&gt; you also need to make sure that queries aren&#x27;t designed to intentionally DoS your DB.<p>That&#x27;s a valid point I didn&#x27;t think of.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a lot wrong with the ideas presented here.<p>It&#x27;s hard to take your criticism seriously when many of your reactions are a result of your own misunderstanding of the proposal.')
