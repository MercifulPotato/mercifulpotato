What&#x27;s your point? That those are funny names? No one gives a damn what they&#x27;re called, and I fail to see what the problem is with running a psychiatry or living in a housing community. Do you also hate on ophthalmologists that run their own firms and college students living in community dorms too? Or what about all those monks and nuns that live in group housing and also practice medicine? Nothing about either of those things  implies any amount of instability, or lack of adjustment.<p>&gt; are his opinions on all the countless fields and topics he writes about (in implied expert capacity) worth listening to?<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is arguing that Scott is necessarily an expert of many of the subjects he covers, least of all himself. I think he&#x27;s made it abundantly clear over the years that this is a side gig for him that he does for fun, and do broaden his understanding of the world. Even if he isn&#x27;t an &quot;expert&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t mean he can&#x27;t still do research and blog about it. Do you think that no one should ever talk or write about anything that they are not a world-class expert in? Cause that sounds really, really boring, and also basically impossible. From the first post on his new blog[0]:<p>&gt; And finally, the highlight of my last blog was its loyal and active readership, who constantly corrected my errors, resolved my lingering questions, and inspired most of &quot;my&quot; best ideas.<p>To me, this doesn&#x27;t sound like something a world-class expert would be saying. But hey, I&#x27;m not an expert on experts, so my opinion is invalid, right?<p>It&#x27;s not my intent to convince you to like him, but I think you are exactly the type of person Scott had in mind when he wrote his first ever SSC post about emphasizing charity over absurdity[1]. It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t like Scott&#x27;s writing, and it&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s worth listening to, but I just hope you slow down and try to genuinely understand why people might like his writing, and focus on those reasons for your argument instead of leaving an inflammatory comment making only very surface-level arguments. I would very much like to practice charity as well and genuinely understand why you don&#x27;t like his writing, but when your argument boils down to &quot;he&#x27;s a neckbeard blogger who has opinions about many things&quot;, you&#x27;re not giving me much to work with.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;youre-probably-wondering-why-ive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;youre-probably-wonderi...</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;12&#x2F;youre-probably-wondering-why-ive-called-you-here-today&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;12&#x2F;youre-probably-wonderi...</a>')
