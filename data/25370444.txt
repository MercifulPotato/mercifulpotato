Philosophy suffers from the same bias that promoted a geocentric view of the solar system. The idea that humanity and human thought and human culture is central.<p>I believe this is where most of the disdain comes from. Yes philosophy has a lot to say about logic and science but then you get stuff like the philosophy of religion, education and of art which are purely human concepts unique to us.... similar to how the mating habits of the chimpanzee are unique to the chimpanzee it&#x27;s easy to see a category error with philosophy.<p>There is a dichotomy here and philosophy does not respect it, science and logic apply to both the human and the chimpanzee (whether the chimpanzee chooses to understand it or not) but art and religion and mating behavior do not cross this divide and is unique to each species. This is the main issue with philosophy, by placing the philosophy of religion on the same level as the philosophy of logic it is saying that human centric concepts are no different then universal concepts and that humans are the center of the universe.')
