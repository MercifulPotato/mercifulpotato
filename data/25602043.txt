For example, the NYT is really good at predicting when there&#x27;s going to be a high-profile WH resignation or firing come up. It&#x27;s not like I was going to get that information from original research or critical thinking. But again, unless you&#x27;re a big player, what are you going to do with the inside scoop on world events?<p>Arguably, if you did really care about these things, then the degree to which any source provides signal is the degree to which you will tolerate noise.')
