E pills often have 20-30% MDA, caffeine, amphetamine or meth in them.<p>Also equating dopamine release with addiction is also not very precise. There are different dopamine systems in the brain. Usually it&#x27;s assumed the addiction potential of MDMA rather stemming from the frequent over-exciting experiences dulling every day life. People are chasing the intense party life vastly enhanced by drugs, not exactly the drugs themselves. Many MDMA addicts limit their consume to the weekend and suffer through the boringness of work week; usually it doesn&#x27;t spiral out of control like with other drugs. For most people it&#x27;s not a every day kind of stimulant drug like cocaine, amphetamine or meth.')
