I&#x27;ve gone from a player who can&#x27;t beat the computer on level 1 (estimated ELO 800 LOL) to winning 50% of matches on level 3 (est. ELO 1400). Still pretty poor, but so is my study effort. And I&#x27;m OK with it.<p>My colleague from another time zone struggled to recommend a book for my level and kinda laughed (albeit politely). But now we can play a quick game in our work breaks online. Thank You Lichess! <i>canned applause</i><p>Edit: DO THE PUZZLES!!! (sorry, tired)')
