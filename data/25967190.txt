Yeah Pascal UNIX compilers were quite bad.<p>When I got into university, I had my first set of Pascal classes on UNIX.<p>Coming from a background of multiple Turbo Pascal versions, I was on TPW for Windows 3.x by then, I was dismayed having to do university assignments in P2C, using original ISO Pascal (it wasn&#x27;t even capable of the ISO Extended version).<p>So no wonder that Pascal on UNIX hardly got any love.<p>I think only HP-UX and VMS Pascal variants were actually relatively good.')
