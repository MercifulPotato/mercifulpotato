The difference is that EV require completely new supply chain.<p>Demand for Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel is growing like crazy and that takes time. Battery factories are very hard to build, supply of chemical engineers are very hard to find. More time then what was required for the IPhone.<p>While I am a believer in 3-wheelers, that is not the IPhone moment. The simply fact is, the lifetime cost is better then a gas car. With gas cars being a legacy technology your resale value will be destroyed.<p>In a few years buying gas cars will seem silly.<p>I think you let what you like to see influence your view on this. The killer app is simply cars that are like cars we have but better because they are EV.')
