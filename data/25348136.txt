It has to be added to the budget when needed. Subscriptions don’t have that problem as the company can update without paying anything new and can keep the payments in the budget as a recurring expense.<p>Both sides have their benefits, so to say one is worse than the other seems not right. It’d be nice if there was an <i>option</i> on which model you chose (for example, $5k&#x2F;seat for perpetual single version or $300&#x2F;month&#x2F;seat for subscription), but alas, that’s not available.<p>&gt; And I do not. Software updates are a huge pain in the ass for almost no benefit to me<p>Ah, but there is a benefit that you just don’t see: bug and security fixes. Your boss isn’t going to be happy if your company is hacked because your IT department didn’t want to spend effort updating (assuming that’s in the budget).<p>This obviously ignores 0-days, but there’s not much a downstream user can do there.')
