Is it ok to have a 5% mortality rate at a factory in Alabama if they pay a 60% tariff? Should U.S. companies be allowed to just pay fees to become exempt from FDA&#x2F;EPA&#x2F;OSHA&#x2F;etc. rules?<p>People keep talking about environmental regulation, but I&#x27;d say that they alone do not account even for a few percents of all problems hampering US manufacturing.<p>Same is for labour rates, US labour rates in non-flyover states are already lower than in South China...<p>Seeing people keep talking about that, and fail to see way bigger elephants in the room.')
