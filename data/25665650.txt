Stock generally is a bet on the future value of the company. That value is derived from the business itself (revenues, costs, new business markets, etc). If a company isn&#x27;t actually taking in any revenue, what&#x27;s it paying payroll with? The alt coin they created and trading amongst third parties? Are they taking a cut of this? Or just constantly selling more of their coin reserves once it appreciates?<p>Generally even loss-leading plays that try to create a huge community before monetization still have plans to monetize that community. I asked how this is different from a pyramid scheme&#x2F;Ponzi scheme. I don&#x27;t feel like you actually addressed this point. How will ShapeShift make money on connecting these users in a way that doesn&#x27;t require following KYC rules?')
