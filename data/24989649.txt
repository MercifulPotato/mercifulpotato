It also creates a huge economic opportunity for violent cartels&#x2F;criminal organizations which can destabilize entire regions. Furthermore it does almost nothing to reduce the supply or availability of illegal drugs - we’ve been fighting a war on cocaine for 50 years and cocaine has never been more readily available or cheaper. The only thing criminal prohibition of drugs has accomplished is an explosion of the prison population making America the country with the highest level of incarceration in the world.<p>The war on drugs causes more death and damage than drugs. The only way out is for the government to legalize, regulate and tax drugs just like alcohol and cannabis. If heroin were sold at a pharmacy there would be laws against selling to minors... dealers today will sell to anyone.')
