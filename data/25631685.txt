And while China may threaten western, or rather US hegemony it isn&#x27;t an existential threat to the USA or EU in that China is unlikely to try to invade and &#x2F; or nuke Western Europe or USA in the same way the USSR did at various points. I&#x27;m not saying that China isn&#x27;t a threat to the USA&#x27;s position of hegemonic super power but that&#x27;s a very different claim.')
