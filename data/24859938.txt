The whole &quot;death by police hands&quot; is a made up non existing threat to law abiding citizen. And the whole LGBTASDFQWERTY once was about equal rights. Equal rights means you show up at work and do your job or you get fired regardless of you gender and political happenings.\nImagine if the supreme court would be talking about the right to bear arms.\nNo matter your views on that topic its in no way relevant for showing up at work and do you job. How you handle that in you free time is up to you but at work this would be completely irrelevant even if you work in a gun factory.')
