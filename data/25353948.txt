Now the only light is produced by they actual content, so the contrast can remain high.<p>Though, I also am annoyed that I can&#x27;t turn down the brightness on my macbook&#x2F;iphone even more (e.g. in a pitch black room). That is one thing that has indeed forced me to use a dark theme when I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily have thought of it.')
