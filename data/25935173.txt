You need to describe the motion of the cold air against the warmer system to get a meaningful phrase.<p>Being able to set a river on fire is not terribly unusual for a polluted river. I remember about ten years ago I posted up at the schuylkill, waited for an oily patch, and was able to set it on fire for about 5 seconds. These oily patches are uncommon. I have no clue where the oil came from but with the schuylkill it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess. The patch itself is necessary for lighting the river on fire; you can&#x27;t just set fire to an arbitrary section of river.')
