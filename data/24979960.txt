ML traditionally doesn&#x27;t have dynamic dispatch, so it uses the static mechanism of building a map type specialized to a given key type. The value type is completely generic, though.<p>I said &#x27;traditionally&#x27; above because OCaml actually has dynamic dispatch now; it has a powerful and feature-complete OOP implementation, <i>and</i> a way to pass around modules at runtime as first-class objects. And in fact people take advantage of these capabilities to build more &#x27;modern&#x27; APIs. But I would argue that the functor approach is one of, if not the best, overall.')
