There is a stupid rule that nobody likes. People make an effort to follow it despite hating it. When they see someone breaking the rule they feel that it&#x27;s very unfair because of the effort they are making, so they report it to make it fairer. Either everyone should follow the rule or it shouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>But in doing so they have become what they hated. They are now actively helping maintain and rooting for the stupid rule instead of fighting against it.')
