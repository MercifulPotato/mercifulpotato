Rust in particular makes good use of it.<p>But it’s one thing I miss the most not writing Erlang&#x2F;Elixir for a living... so far. It makes functions and data handling into these clean trees instead of conditionals (not to start a language flamewar but boo Golangs conditional obsession which seems to be the polar opposite in many ways for error handling, or at least it used to be I haven’t tried it recently).<p>There’s a lot to like and learn from in Erlang. Static typing will give it wider adoption IMO. And I’m happy to see so many developers working on it.')
