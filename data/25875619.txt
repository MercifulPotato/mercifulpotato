Around 10% actually spend any time messing with the tooling. Sure, when you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing and you&#x27;re working on a smaller project, you can get bogged down with the tooling aspect. But in every job I&#x27;ve worked with a healthy engineering culture, the tooling side of web dev is invisible to most of the devs to the point where they wouldn&#x27;t know how to make a config change if they wanted. They just build shit.')
