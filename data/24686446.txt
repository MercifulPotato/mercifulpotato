Suddenly a state which was previously invalid is valid, or a part of system that only needed one kind of input needs 4 different inputs from separate parts of your code. Have fun basically rewriting your program.<p>That&#x27;s IMHO the main motivation between differences in functional and OO programming - how close to the requirements you want to design your code.')
