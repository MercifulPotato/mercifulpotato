Didn&#x27;t the regulators have enough time to assess the irregularities earlier? A $30 billion IPO plan couldn&#x27;t have been made public without the regulators giving at least some in-principle approval, and I&#x27;m sure Jack Ma knows how to navigate the bureaucracy&#x2F;politics in China before he would make such plans public.
