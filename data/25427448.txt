And really doesn&#x27;t have the ability to mark threads as real-time that will stick. I&#x27;ve worked on Android game ports and done audio stack work, the whole thing is a shitshow and barely functions as documented. What their support team recommends in one version is quickly broken by hacks done by chip vendors and random bugs added to OS versions. Nobody at Google even tests basic scheduler behavior such that an extra 40ms can sneak in completely unnoticed. I&#x27;ve seen stuff far worse than this, they once broke their own cert test and nobody noticed for half a year.')
