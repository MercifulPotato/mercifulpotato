I understand people not liking this behavior, but that&#x27;s a reason to stop using Google, not to form this antitrust response. Additionally, it always seems to me that actions like Google&#x27;s are fine until a company becomes to big, at which point it is suddenly decided that it is unfair. Why do we even care about fairness now? Nothing about the resources one has at one&#x27;s disposal ever seems fair in business. It all seems very arbitrary.')
