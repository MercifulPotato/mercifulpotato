You are investing in today while intentionally ignoring tomorrow.<p>Well, Wikipedia [0] seems to disagree.<p>&gt;Value investing is an investment paradigm that involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis.<p>By this logic investing into stocks with verifiable growth is the way to go. Apple is basically the poster child of value investing. It&#x27;s a company that is making lots of money and keeps growing because it releases new profitable products year by year.<p>For some reason there is this belief that &quot;value investing&quot; = &quot;boomer doesn&#x27;t know stocks can grow&quot;. Yeah, one obviously has to think that those who engage in value investing are stupid, otherwise one would have to acknowledge that the stocks one is investing in have zero reason to grow as fast as they did, except that everyone else is also blindly buying them (which is dangerous circular reasoning and causes bubbles that pop once we run out of people who refuse to open their eyes).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Value_investing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Value_investing</a>')
