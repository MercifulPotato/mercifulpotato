Sweden doubled their ICU capacity in a few weeks without much difficulty back in March. So it&#x27;s normal for ICU to run near &quot;capacity&quot; because it&#x27;d be kind of wasteful if it didn&#x27;t.<p>Remember also that &quot;COVID patient&quot; means &quot;patient who tested positive for COVID&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s the primary thing wrong with them. Hospitals are super-spreading sites, lots of patients turn up for something uninfected and pick up COVID in hospital. So the stats have to be interpreted carefully, even if you accept the premise that poor planning in the hospital system is justification to tell people they can&#x27;t go outside. Also consider that COVID spreads inside, not out!')
