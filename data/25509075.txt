I have the 70-200&#x2F;2.8 as well and had the 100-400 mk 1 years ago. The 100-400 mk I isn&#x27;t a patch on either quality-wise but I gather the mk 2 is significantly better so not sure how it compares.<p>Where the 400DO perhaps really shines is paired with a 1.4x TC - it&#x27;s much more handleable than a 600&#x2F;4 and paired with a decent body gets results as good as bodies 10 years ago would have got with the 600&#x2F;4.')
