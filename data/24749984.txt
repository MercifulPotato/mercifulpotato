Pollution is basically a cost, it&#x27;s just that right now someone else besides the polluter will end up paying that cost sometime in the future. I think it would be a good thing if we could convert pollution to a cost that we get taxed on now, which is what a global carbon tax wants to achieve. That way you have to pay for what you pollute. It would definitely be a step in the right direction and perhaps the cost of nuclear would not be so great if all these externalities are taken into account. To be clear though. Just as I would like to see a carbon tax, I would also like to see nuclear paying actual risk premiums so that we can have a level playing field when choosing an energy source based on its LCOE or any similar criteria.')
