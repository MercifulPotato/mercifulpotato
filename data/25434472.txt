The classified (and, statistically speaking, rubber stamp) FISA court issues demands under the authority claimed by FISA Amendments Act (FAA) section 702, which is designed to target foreign surveillance subjects and thus under current public understandings would not require a warrant (&quot;because foreign&quot;).  FISA surveillance orders are not warrants and do not require probable cause and are not subjected to any unclassified oversight.<p>However, the FISA court has a special, secret interpretation of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) that they believe entitles them to use it to spy on <i>everyone</i> without a warrant as soon as the data enters or leaves the US, even if the communication is by and between solely US persons.  Edward Snowden gave this as the reason he came forward about the PRISM program (PRISM being the internal, classified NSA codename for FAA702 data collection).<p>The large tech companies process so many of these warrantless FISA spying orders each year that they have special interfaces for the FBI&#x2F;IC to request and download the data.  This is what was meant by the reporting that said &quot;direct from the servers&quot; [of tech companies].<p>They don&#x27;t have root on the machines, but they have programmatic access to download data for <i>any user</i> without a warrant.  It may or may not require an approval click on the service provider side, but, in any case, that doesn&#x27;t much matter.<p>&gt; <i>Itâ€™s entirely possible that they never actually do perform geolocation on the log data, and that they scrub or anonymize IP addresses before storing them longer term. They state that they use such practices in general.</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether they run geolocation on the IP logs; logging the IPs is collecting a coarse tracklog regardless of whether they store it as such or not.<p><i>Second try: Please stop calling me a liar, and I&#x27;d appreciate it if you&#x27;d stop replying to every single one of my comments on this topic to cross-examine me, which is explicitly against the site rules.  I&#x27;m not going to engage with you any further; I request the same from you.</i>')
