I don&#x27;t think the laggy feeling on most elevators is actually due to regulation, though - the elevators in my current apartment building are <i>wicked fast</i>, and it was built &lt;10 years ago in SF so almost certainly code compliant.<p>- They&#x27;re thrown at speed to exactly the right position, no separate leveling stage.<p>- Door opening is violently fast, as you mention.<p>- If you&#x27;re stopping at a destination entered in error, you can press the door close button while the doors are opening and they will turn right back around. (Presumably disabled if someone has also called the elevator from that floor).<p>- If called to a floor and no one is there (no one crosses the threshold) the destination entered from that floor is canceled.<p>- The doors close almost immediately after someone gets in or out. (This might be an ADA thing; you can request more patience from the system by pressing the wheelchair button on the destination dispatch keypad while entering your floor).<p>Really the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the poor accuracy on the touchscreen keypads in the elevator lobbies. Also there&#x27;s no &quot;enter&quot; so if the second digit of your floor number doesn&#x27;t register fast enough, you will also be stopping at the first digit. Ugh. Just give me real buttons. But overall it&#x27;s a great system.<p>I also discovered a novel &quot;slow elevator&quot; pathology in college - a trickle of people arriving at the lobby level and pressing the call button would hold the elevator there indefinitely. It is frustrating when you&#x27;re 3 seconds from an elevator that closes its doors and departs, but this is actually necessary! If it waited for everyone it would never get off the ground.')
