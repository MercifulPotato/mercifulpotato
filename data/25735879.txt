The incentives are just so broken due to ease of patching, a need&#x2F;desire for cash after a drawn out dev process, and a general disrespect for their customers.<p>I think releasing a &quot;broken&quot; game in the form of &quot;early access&quot; from smaller studios can be good in terms of iterative and community development, but also that can be abused too. These bigger studios really don&#x27;t have as much of an excuse in my opinion.<p>The only solution I see is to stop pre-ordering games and don&#x27;t reward studios that do this, but easier said than done.')
