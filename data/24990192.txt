Extradition treaties complicate this a bit more, but extradition still has to go through local laws, local law enforcement, local government and far from everyone would get extradited left and right if there is an agreement.<p>The biggest thing a counter-notice could do (if it&#x27;s even possible) is reveal one&#x27;s identity and only if Microsoft&#x2F;Github tries to verify it, which would be bad, because it could be used for harassment. But the author is obviously Russian, not sure if he lives in Russia, but if he does, they definitely won&#x27;t be able to get him in Russia, only harass him.')
