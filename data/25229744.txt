Everything I am seeing an hearing about housing cost in the US related to land, labor and lumber. Cost per sqft is crazy high and getting higher, builders would be able to build more but there just isn&#x27;t enough highly qualified labor in the US, and the shutdown is preventing lumber from being milled. We cannot do anything about Covid lumber shortage or the land shortage but we can do something about the Labor shortage.  When I was in high school, there were shop classes, and home building classes that focused on the building trades. These classes were in the processed of being phased out to focus on students going to college and STEM. The US education system needs to focus on being an on ramp for College and Trade-schools and stop selling on students short.')
