Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll fix them though. It only means that If I think I&#x27;ll end up in a scenario where that applies (or I&#x27;m bored one day) I will fix it.<p>Also, your project is better off for having the bug reported, even if it&#x27;s never fixed. Known bugs are less of a problem than unknown bugs, especially if clearly documented. With legacy systems, it might even be impractical to fix the bug, as other code may rely on the original buggy behaviour.')
