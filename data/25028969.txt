In the specific recent case of the Vienna shooter, he had been in prison for trying to join ISIS, he had gone to Slovakia to try to buy ammunition for a Kalashnikov AK-47 and the Austrian authorities were warned.<p>They had all the necessary information to know that guy presented a risk and they didn&#x27;t act on it. What makes you think that having more information in the form of unencrypted chats would have helped the authorities?<p>The question on banning encryption always comes back, but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any cogent argument for why it would really help the police stop crime. And, what would stop criminals from using an illegal chat app that uses encryption? Or from using their own code words? This kind of law will only reduce the rights of the innocent majority while doing very little to stop criminals.')
