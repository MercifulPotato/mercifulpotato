You have to manually go through and clear the brush in the understory, or else the fire will be so hot it will burn down large trees.<p>Once you&#x27;ve cleared much of the small woody brush, etc that causes these fires to be absolutely massive, regular fires  will typically be much more mild and continue helping keep the forest understory clear without requiring much manual labor.<p>It really is pretty effective, but it does require lots of little fires quite frequently.')
