These people aren&#x27;t against new housing per se, they are just rabidly anti-developer. They spend so much time delaying projects by trying to get developers to increase the amount of below-market rate housing in their new developments that the developer eventually just gives up because the whole process takes so long and the potential profits dwindle down to nothing.')
