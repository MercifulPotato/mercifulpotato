You cannot expect that people will go on a regular basis to charge stations and spend an hour to charge their car. You cannot also have a reasonable expectation that employers will install a charger per employee, or that employees will gamble every day to see if there is a charger open at work.<p>An EV cannot be your single car given the 2 main constraints:\n1. Slow charging (&gt;&gt;5&#x27;)\n2. Lack of charging networks<p>#2 can be fixed with investments. #1 needs a technological advance that is not clear that will be commercially available soon.<p>I did not mention cost at all in the above comment, which is maybe the biggest factor currently limiting adoption, but I assume that eventually economies of scale will aleviate this.')
