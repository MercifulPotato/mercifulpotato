At least as of a few years ago, they deployed C++ indexing and querying nodes on customer machines. They&#x27;ve spent a great deal of time to accommodate the peculiarities of enterprise customers, old compilers, etc.  One might imagine that a &quot;build once run anywhere&quot; platform would benefit them, but they&#x27;ve found a business model where they were able to work around the peculiarities and still be profitable.<p>So while there&#x27;s probably some interesting historical reasons that explain why there&#x27;s no &quot;JVM for C++&quot;, Splunk is a good example of a modern technical &#x2F; business model where conquering platform fragmentation was feasible.')
