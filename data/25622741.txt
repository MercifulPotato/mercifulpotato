Even a single copy of the textures to freeze an iteration would be thousands in expensive disk space.<p>I know it doesn&#x27;t makes sense to tell your clients that what they are doing is nonsense, but if I saw something like that going on, the first thing I would do is chase down why it happened.  Massive waste like that is extremely problematic while needing to make a sharper texture for some tiny piece that gets close to the camera is not a big deal.')
