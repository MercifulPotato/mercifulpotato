One model and explanation of this phenomena is Newton&#x27;s Law of Gravity used within the framework of Newton&#x27;s dynamics (or laws of motion). The Law claims that gravity is a force, with a very specific formula we are all aware of.<p>If you ignore Newton&#x27;s third law (about action-reaction pairs) for the gravitational phenomena of small bodies near a planet, and assume that the planet doesn&#x27;t move at all, then we call the force on the small body its weight.<p>Now, returning to your question, in daily lingo, physicists use the word gravity to refer to the phenomena, the force law, or the weight. You have ascertain from context. In summary, gravity is a force is a perfectly valid  and understandable statement within the slang of physics.')
