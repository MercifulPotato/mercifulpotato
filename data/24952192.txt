After downloading the Bitcoin client just run gettxoutsetinfo<p>You can try to guess how many dollars have been printed or how many bars of gold exist.<p>If you view Bitcoin as a payment network like VISA then obviously there are many things the network needs to improve but if you view it as a savings technology then it&#x27;s the best one that&#x27;s ever been created. I never understood how &quot;But Can I buy Starbucks with Bitcoin&quot; became a meme, I don&#x27;t expect to be able to buy Starbucks with Apple stock.<p>Claims that Bitcoin burns useless energy or doesn&#x27;t have feature X completely miss the point. Avoiding capital controls like in Lebanon, protecting yourself from hyperinflation due to corrupt governments with a printing press like Venezuela are Bitcoin&#x27;s killer features.<p>It&#x27;s common to view hyperinflation as something unique to corrupt countries but that&#x27;s only because CPI is a dishonest way to aggregate inflation data. Inflation is a vector NOT a real number, any asset that people care about has become generally unaffordable i.e: housing, education, healthcare.<p>BS crypto vendors are looking for the next big application of blockchain technology when inflation protection and avoiding capital controls are arguably the most impactful innovation since the internet. Bitcoin and Time are the only 2 scarce assets that exist in this world.')
