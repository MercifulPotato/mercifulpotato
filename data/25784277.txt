Then you can search over those and correlate arbitrary metadata across them, e.g. search for some regex that across github issues only where it is referenced elsewhere on HN&#x2F;SO.<p>Primarily interesting for exploring&#x2F;querying across structured documents in complex ways that you can&#x27;t anticipate before-hand.')
