It&#x27;s a platform that allows people to leverage the power of the majority to change the little (or big) things in their space.  We created AyeTap because technology has changed everything except the most important thing we do as free people: how we govern, listen and organize ourselves.<p>While the concept of democracy remains timeless, its practice is outdated.  Why do we have to stand in line to tick a name on a ballot?  Why do we wait till the annual HOA meeting to change something in our home?  Why isn’t it easier to change the name of a building or a street?  Why does it take decades to change a law?  Or the biggest mystery to me, why do we need to vote for 435 people to go to congress so they can vote for us?  The democratic process has remained primitive (I have my theory on why, but that&#x27;s a discussion for another day and forum).<p>Launching AyeTap is our first step towards making democracy useful for things in your life.  It&#x27;s a free platform, but we will soon be rolling out a paid service (for private, customizable elections).  We&#x27;ve created a dedicated page for HN, which summarizes AyeTap&#x27;s features and explains why a polling platform needed to develop a language processing algorithm to figure out that ‘Taylor Swift’ is not a ‘tailor who is fast’.<p>I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback because no one else has seen our work yet and we have zero feedback through all these years coding in a basement :) And I&#x27;ll be here to answer any questions about the platform (or our vision for democracy).')
