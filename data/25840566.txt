Item(by='paulmd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611099887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840148, text='&gt; to whom politicians must answer<p>but what if they simply... didn&#x27;t?  Most of the tories are going to turn out to vote Tory regardless, no?  Negative media coverage of, let&#x27;s say, brexit hasn&#x27;t significantly dissuaded them, even after the initial leave vote when the forthcoming consequences were explained to them in appropriate detail by that strong national public broadcaster.<p>What if the politician in question just said &quot;my party&#x27;s position is clear and I won&#x27;t be repeating myself ad nauseum, good night&quot;?  What would <i>really</i> happen?  Would those tories really not turn out, or even vote for the other guy?  Really actually?<p>The thing we are finding in the United States is that a lot of those &quot;musts&quot; in our media and in our government turn out to just have been social convention, a &quot;would normally&quot; if you will.  People <i>assume</i> that something bad will happen to anyone who doesn&#x27;t play fair, or someone who tells blatant lies, or who doesn&#x27;t execute some duty of their office in an evenhanded way.  But if you just <i>don&#x27;t</i>, and you do it shamelessly enough - nothing actually happens.  Particularly if you control enough of the government.<p>But the public is not really so good at actually holding politicians to account.  Those tory voters will pull the lever regardless, if nothing else &quot;because the other guy&#x27;s worse, isn&#x27;t he?&quot;.<p>And you have your own Murdoch media to radicalize those voters too.  They don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to play to the state broadcaster, if you have enough voters who think the BBC is just being unfair to their guy.  And Murdoch media lets the party get the message out directly to the voters.<p>There&#x27;s no easy solution, these kinds of attacks fundamentally &quot;break&quot; democracy, democracy works on the idea that voters are fundamentally well informed and at least somewhat even-handed.  But Murdoch media and other greasy rags use the freedom of the press as a trojan horse to spread lies, and fundamentally a lot of voters are susceptible to it and will just keep voting for &quot;their guy&quot; regardless.')
