Then JL6 asked if fediverse is moderating itself into a silo.<p>I&#x27;m saying moderation and exclusion are traditional tools in responding to offensive speech in private fora.  But moderation and exclusion can become too good.  We&#x27;ve seen right and left choose into bubbles big enough to sway elections with outrageous false claims.<p>The Twitter and AWS response to bad speech generated by free-choice silos is to enforce their own, bigger silencing or moderation policy. I&#x27;d like to find ways where people can grow, adapt, and cooperate more when they encounter hostile, offensive, or untrue beliefs or speech online.')
