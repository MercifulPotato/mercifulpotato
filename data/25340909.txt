Obligations exist in this situation - to the judge, court process, and CO.  If you want to debate the obligations to the public or immunity of cops, fine--but this isn&#x27;t like a random traffic stop.  What the police is supposed to do in this situation is very clear--serve warrant, get evidence.<p>&gt; You wouldn&#x27;t be sitting here sympathizing with how a random burglar is totally justified in entering a home with a weapon drawn because the homeowner could be armed.<p>This isn&#x27;t sympathy but just expectation.  You would <i>expect</i> a house invader to be armed for exactly that reason, right?  Similarly, why wouldn&#x27;t you expect a cop to do the same?')
