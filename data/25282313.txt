Although never as the only thing I eat for a longer period. So I suppose that would be an interesting experiment. I actually really like the impossible burger, not as much as a real one, but I have ordered it on multiple occasions. Beyond is ok. And I have had some great black bean burgers, but they don&#x27;t quite hit the spot.<p>I also probably don&#x27;t have the correctly balanced diet when I have done that in the past. And I have found a protein heavy diet is what my body prefers, and carbs are not super great for me. End up heavy and tired. And the vegetarian &#x2F; vegan stuff we have done in the past have been far to carb heavy for me.<p>And I love cheese. Mac and cheese, alfredo, things like that. And I have yet to find a substitute that is acceptable to me in the cheese department. Although I have been able to cut back on the dairy the last few weeks, so its possible I could eventually cut it out. That just hasn&#x27;t been on my priority list.')
