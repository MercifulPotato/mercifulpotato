Item(by='gspr', descendants=None, kids=[25198643], score=None, time=1606224695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197999, text='&gt; You mention Swiss train service for example which seemed pretty great as a visitor--but it sure wasn&#x27;t cheap as is true of a lot of European train service.<p>The thing is, if you&#x27;re <i>not</i> a visitor, you&#x27;d buy an AG or a demi-tarif (perhaps with a contribution from your employer). The former gives you free unlimited use on almost all public transit (including trains and busses), or alternatively, the latter gives you approximately a 50% discount on the price you paid as a tourist. The latter is quite commonly sponsored by your employer â€“ and even if not, both types pay off very quickly if you actually commute by public transit.')
