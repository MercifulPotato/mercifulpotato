Item(by='topspin', descendants=None, kids=[25286866, 25287113], score=None, time=1606971960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284325, text='&gt; It&#x27;s probably far safer now than other models.<p>All 737 have an obsolescent fuselage design.  It could not be certified given modern regulation and relies on being grandfathered for new production.  The consequence is the fuselage can shatter on crash landings or runway overruns whereas more modern designs will hold together and protect passengers.<p>The relatively minor training, hardware and software revisions of 737 MAX do not make it safer than other models.  Reading the FAA documents one learns there is little interest in pursuing more fundamental problems.<p>For instance, the trim wheel control force issue has been officially handwaved.  This means your 737 pilot may need to be an athlete in the midst of dealing with failed systems and reading flight manuals.  Modern designs have flight proven fly-by-wire systems and don&#x27;t involve wrestling with crazy naval vessel-like mechanical wheels to control pitch.')
