Item(by='Tarsul', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609372979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25587035, text='wow, that taxation is horrendous. And I thought German wasn&#x27;t too good (compared to whatever paradise I had in mind in scandinavia, france or whatever). To clarify: i don&#x27;t really mean high taxation is the problem (I&#x27;m pro high taxation). I just think someone who earns 60% of the median income shouldn&#x27;t pay nearly 50% taxes [numbers not representative, those come now]. If I can trust this calculator[1] then someone who earns 24k€ in Belgium has to pay around 40% in taxes (Germany: 30%). That&#x27;s really tough. And here I am sitting in Germany waiting for my opportunity to protest that the marginal tax rate is over 50% for people above the average income (income class 1, single, between 3800 to 4500€&#x2F;month I&#x27;d have to pay taxes of over 50€ per 100€ raise) but if you get above a certain threshold (especially after you don&#x27;t have to pay any additional taxes for healthcare) you&#x27;re good... as I said, compared to what low income earners in belgium have to pay in taxes, I now see that my complaints are negligible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icalculator.info&#x2F;belgium.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icalculator.info&#x2F;belgium.html</a>')
