I&#x27;ve noticed over the past 5 years a disturbing trend of &quot;entitlement&quot; in our startup and tech ecosystem - to everything from trademarks, to data access, to APIs, and most especially entitlement around building products and services on the back of those people&#x27;s work.  While this case with RPi wasn&#x27;t one of those nefarious examples, <i>the response of the community to RPi is.</i><p>The Raspberry Pi ecosystem is literally one of enabling creators, and when they went to mistakenly enforce their trademark, the community literally fell all over themselves to bite the hand that feeds them.<p>If you run a successful tech business, you can reasonability except hundreds of people to try to rip off your content, steal your API, demand access to your APIs, reappropriate your logos and designs, and outright steal and resell your content. The mobile app development market is notoriously subject to this trend.<p>I think it would be wise for those in this community to be aware that companies are daily trying to defend themselves against people that generally don&#x27;t want to develop their own businesses, but ride on the coat-tails of others.  The danger is a race to the bottom of dilution for the company brand and outright fraud for customers.<p>If Raspberry Pi or any other company does something like this, take a moment to maybe understand why they did it, and how something might have gone wrong before vilifying a company that literally contributes TONs of work to the creator community.  There are many times when I wonder how participants here actually run or have built a company - this comment isn&#x27;t to gatekeep, but to point out that it makes no sense for a creator community to act like this.')
