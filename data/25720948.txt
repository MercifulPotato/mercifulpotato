Item(by='tannhaeuser', descendants=None, kids=[25722275], score=None, time=1610318397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720358, text='While you&#x27;re here and know a thing or two about libinput: it&#x27;s completely unusable for me, and the only reason I&#x27;m able to work at all is that the old synaptics package (on which libinput is based as a clean rewrite as I understand) still works. The reason is that libinput doesn&#x27;t support sensitivity; I still remember the physical pain of hard-pressing the touchpad when my current notebook was new, and in particular the moment when I looked at the notebook and just stopped doing anything at all on it in conditioned anticipation of a frustrating experience. Also, kinetic scroll doesn&#x27;t seem to work, amplifying the issue.<p>I noticed Ubuntu have switched to KDE (or, alternatively, LXDE) as DE for their &quot;Studio&quot; variant. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s mostly because the minimal window decorations for resizing etc makes gnome hard to use, and Studio is for large notebooks or desktops anyway. I think the exercise of patience that was resizing windows on gnome2 has slightly improved, but I&#x27;m still speechless as to the loss of the global menu to be replaced by ... a centered clock accompanied by a minimal dot that I found out to display notifications after a while, and nothing else.<p>I mean I&#x27;m glad that F&#x2F;OSS for desktops still exists at all, but gnome3 is really just a big regression for no reason at all, and I&#x27;m starting to get a bit concerned where gnome is heading. It&#x27;s not that we have a wealth of new desktop apps anyway. Maybe Ubuntu is testing the waters to switch to KDE as well.')
