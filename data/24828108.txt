I&#x27;ve been complaining about this exact problem for years, so I&#x27;m happy that it is finally getting resolved (if it is getting resolved â€” Google&#x27;s statements about what Android 12 will allow have been pretty vague).<p>Also, as far as I know, Google hasn&#x27;t used the security excuse for not implementing it. I just assumed that this wasn&#x27;t going to get prioritized over OS features that enable Google to make more money.')
