I haven&#x27;t touched Mongo for about 10 years, so it wouldn&#x27;t be fair of me to compare, but I love the performance and power of JSONB in Postgres. And having all this right alongside regular relational tables in the sr database is <i>fantastic</i>.<p>I often work with TimescaleDB too, which again just works alongside everything else, in one database - Postgres really is an <i>incredible</i> database!')
