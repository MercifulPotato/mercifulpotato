I really do just mean &quot;procedural functions + return by value instead of mutation&quot; here.<p>It is completely normal to have a python script that is just ordinary functions, without state being enclosed in a class and accessed via `self`.  This &quot;My First Program&quot; behavior scales extremely well, both from a parallelism perspective, as well from a complexity perspective.  OO features can be applied iteratively on top of that.<p>With Ruby--syntax aside--it is just very rare to see people only write functions or private_class_methods.  The &quot;Everything is a Class&quot; mantra is very strong, and there&#x27;s lots of rich behavior in Ruby attached onto what would be considered primitives or basic structs in Python.<p>With data science specifically, this natural way of pushing simple procedures, primitives, structs from Python down into C has lots of performance benefits.  Because those functions are &quot;flat&quot;, you don&#x27;t have to traverse the call stack routinely and lose performance there.')
