On the federal level, there was basically no protection of the right to vote at all - there was that bit about states having to have a &quot;republican form of government&quot;, but it wasn&#x27;t codified, and the broad understanding was that property requirements, poll taxes etc are all compatible with it. So, it was a very different environment overall.<p>(I&#x27;m not disagreeing with your basic premise - I support, it actually. But US is not a good historical model for it. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any country that really is, or ever was. Those of us who believe that democracy is dead without radical free speech, have to figure out how to make it all work in a way that is, at least, tolerable to those who disagree with us.)')
