Rideshares would pull up to the wrong side of the street where the cell tower was, and immediately get kicked out and ditch me because it was a high use bus stop.  When driving myself I would pop several streets over every time a new office tower came into line of sight.  When near the beach, my location would fix to some cafe half a mile away with its wifi power up too high.')
