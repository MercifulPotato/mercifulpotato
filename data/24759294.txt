Even dealing with something as simple as loading environment variables for both local and &quot;real&quot; function invokes required way too much effort.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not working with this tech by choice. It&#x27;s for a bit of client work. I think their use case for Serverless makes sense (calling something very infrequently that glues together a few AWS resources).<p>Is the experience better on other platforms?')
