Item(by='core-questions', descendants=None, kids=[25433800, 25427198], score=None, time=1608008031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427036, text='Look up James Damore if you want one of the more canonical examples of this.<p>Essentially, &quot;tolerance&quot; has been redefined as a term to essentially just mean &quot;liberalism&quot;; whenever you hear someone suggesting that one &quot;be tolerant&quot;, you can just mentally replace that with &quot;be liberal&quot;. The term is leveled at folks like yourself, who are deemed intolerant and illiberal for having and trying to perpetuate a different value set.<p>If taken to the utmost extreme, which admittedly few people actually do, this boils down to excluding tolerance of _actually_ different beliefs and ways of life; only tolerance of different looking liberals from different backgrounds is actually included. Different cultures are tolerated as long as they&#x27;re far away and out of sight and mind.<p>The irony of all of this is completely lost on them, of course; they don&#x27;t think about it like this at all. They truly believe themselves to be tolerant, good people, even as they do this!<p>Most of them are actually trying to be good people, too; if they had been raised in your household they would have grown up to be good Christians, if they had been raised in India they&#x27;d be trying to be good Hindus, and so forth. They were raised under the aegis of liberalism and are doing their best to stand up for its own moral principles.<p>The big problem is that they&#x27;re incapable of seeing that same kind of goodness in people like you, preferring to boil you down to a reductionist caricature. This same problem rears its head in Christians who don&#x27;t see the goodness in others, as well; they&#x27;d do well to remove the log from their own eye, and so on.<p>Stepping back from this, I for one find generalized &quot;tolerance&quot; to be a fairly useless mechanism to espouse, anyway. Like any right-thinking person, I have my own moral code of what I believe to be right and wrong, based on philosophies ranging from Christianity to the best atheist thinkers to a variety of Eastern ideas. I&#x27;m not going to start believing an action is right when someone else does it that would be wrong if I did it - for a system of morality to make any sense and have any actual purpose it has to attempt to be objective and independent.<p>Importantly, it only applies to the actions of individuals, not to aggregated cultures, races, or other intersectional groups. When someone commits an immoral act, the context of their identity is only important so much that it might explain their motivations; it does not excuse their actions, unless they&#x27;re perhaps someone who should not have their own power of attorney, so to speak.')
