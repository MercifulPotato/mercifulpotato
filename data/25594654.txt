The phone company needs to <i>lose</i> money when they allow robocalls, to finally motivate them to actually start authenticating business callers and actually start respecting the national do not call registry. The carriers are the only group with the ability to prevent robocalls, and they’ve been allowing them precisely because they’re getting money from the whole arrangement by allowing them.<p>* Edit: the FCC order sounds like a good thing as a long overdue very first step, however this part sounds hilariously out of date to me: “Non-commercial, commercial and nonprofit organizations can now only make up to three calls per residential number within 30 days and are required to allow recipients to opt out.”<p>I could be wrong, but I’ve had a lot of spam calls in the last few years, and never have I gotten multiple calls from the same number in a month. They are spoofing and setting up new entities on the fly. Limiting the number of calls sounds like something a politician would do who doesn’t understand what’s already going on (or... maybe a sly move that makes the FCC appear pro-consumer while not actually threatening the business of carriers in any way...). Consumer-visible and actionable call authentication is what we need, not limits on the amount of spam. Limiting each individual company to three spams from my point of view means I experience millions of spams. In fact establishing a limit of an okay number of spams just might <i>increase</i> the amount of spam calls I get...')
