The results of this pilot randomized controlled trial (the first for vitamin D and covid, as I understand it) from Spain were astounding.  Patients were given vitamin D supplements during their hospital stays.  Of those who received the supplements, only 1 of 50 (2%) required ICU care, while 13 of 26 (50%) of the patients who did not receive supplements required ICU care (and two died).  2% vs. 50%!<p>Vitamin D supplementation is a low-risk, low-cost, side-effect-free (hard to OD) intervention.  I see no reason governments should not encourage vitamin D supplementation (or, better yet, actively enable it via distribution of supplements as in the UK...at least during hospital stays).  If it turns out that subsequent RCTs disprove the effects (despite the mountain of retrospective studies that show correlations in vitamin D levels and covid case trajectories), what harm will have been done?')
