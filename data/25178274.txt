Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606059567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25175971, text='&gt; I don’t have good citations handy, but it’s generally accepted that the construction of the American interstate freeway system after WWII was the primary enabler of the mass exodus of the white middle class to the suburbs, and the subsequent abandonment of people of color in inner cities for several generations.<p>This is like arguing against rope because it was the primary enabler of lynchings.<p>&gt; Furthermore, continuing to build more travel lanes to alleviate congestion has been shown to simply lead to more traffic. It’s a circular problem.<p>It isn&#x27;t. What those studies are showing is that congestion suppresses demand, so if you relieve some of the congestion, some of the demand comes back. So to relieve congestion you&#x27;d need enough lanes to carry not the existing level of traffic, but the amount there would be if there wasn&#x27;t any congestion suppressing it.<p>This is clearly demonstrated in China where they build multi-lane highways to nowhere as a jobs program and then traffic does not magically appear to fill them.<p>The problem is that in some places, satisfying all of the demand by <i>only</i> increasing the number of travel lanes would require like twenty travel lanes, which isn&#x27;t ideal. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t reduce congestion there by adding travel lanes, only that you need other solutions there too. Add a travel lane or two but not ten, build more housing closer to businesses so people don&#x27;t have to commute as far, stop charging user fees for mass transit etc. By doing these things <i>together</i> you can alleviate congestion without needing twenty lane highways.<p>&gt; We are finally seeing this turn around in a very painful way in Silicon Valley.<p>The problem there is totally unambiguously not &quot;insufficient highways&quot; and is in fact &quot;insufficient housing&quot; which induces those long commutes for whoever can&#x27;t afford the existing housing close to the city where the jobs are (and also outrageous housing costs for the housing that is, because nobody wants that commute). Build more housing.')
