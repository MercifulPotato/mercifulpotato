Buffer is a company that is open about its salary formula.  Their formula has exactly the problems I&#x27;m talking about.  See here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buffer.com&#x2F;salary&#x2F;customer-engagement-strategist&#x2F;average" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buffer.com&#x2F;salary&#x2F;customer-engagement-strategist&#x2F;ave...</a><p>&gt; At that stage, someone who&#x27;d be an appropriate &quot;right next step&quot; for the company at $80K may not be the right next step if they were at $100K<p>This is the right way to look at things.  You look at the price &#x2F; performance tradeoff of each employee, and make an offer based on that.<p>All the SF people get at least $100k because they all turn down the $70k offers, for the good and simple reason they can&#x27;t live the lifestyle they want on $70k in SF.<p>Some Rust Belt folks might take a $70k offer because it&#x27;s interesting work, and a fairly good salary in an economically depressed area.<p>&gt; you&#x27;re being subjected to some kind of corporate level accommodation where the business has decided that &quot;we&#x27;ll just take the hit and up-adjust salaries based on cost of living&quot;<p>This is the kind of policy I was expressing my distaste for.<p>If I don&#x27;t qualify for the CoL based on my location, it sure feels like the SF-level salary is the baseline and I&#x27;m being down-adjusted.<p>&gt; corruption happening at the company where they&#x27;re doing this for the sake of some central policy<p>I don&#x27;t really think this is a thing.  I think it&#x27;s more a misguided attempt to equalize the lifestyle of employees who happen to live in different places.  An ideal of &quot;All of our employees should be able to afford a middle class lifestyle&quot; means you pay your Bay Area people $100k and your Appalachian Mountainfolk $60k.<p>If you look at it from that perspective, it makes sense.<p>I&#x27;m trying to point out that from the view of someone who, at an earlier point in his career, was looking for remote employment while living in a low CoL area, this perspective isn&#x27;t the one that comes naturally.<p>Instead it felt more like my skills are worth $100k, and there are a bunch of tech companies out there who will pay me $100k, but they all have this really strange rule that they&#x27;ll only pay me what I&#x27;m worth if I agree to spend 40% of it on incredibly overpriced housing in a city I don&#x27;t want to live in.<p>And I got really angry because it felt like they&#x27;re screwing me.  And screwing me in a way that&#x27;s completely insane and economically irrational for them.  Either pay me $100k for remote work, or don&#x27;t.  Whether I&#x27;ll spend $15k or $50k of that $100k on food and shelter is, quite frankly, none of my employer&#x27;s business.<p>That was many years ago.  I&#x27;m at a much better place in my career now.  But at any given point in time, there are probably thousands of people at the point where I was.  It helps to be aware of prospective hires&#x27; perspectives when considering compensation policies.')
