It&#x27;s basically identical to the first models, just a slightly faster CPU. I used it two or three times to access an old multimedia CD-ROM I still have before it locked up, the hard drive dead. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever get it fixed, and unless I find someone to take it I&#x27;ll end up bringing it to Apple since they have a free recycling program. I kind of dread doing that because the thing is heavy. Really heavy. It weighs more than the combined weight of all the other Apple devices I have around:<p>MacBook Air (2013)<p>Mac mini (2012)<p>iPhone 4<p>iPod touch<p>iPhone XS<p>iPhone 5S<p>iPad mini (v1)<p>iPad mini (v2)<p>Newton<p>Powerbook G3 (Pismo)<p>It&#x27;s easy to forget how heavy CRTs were.')
