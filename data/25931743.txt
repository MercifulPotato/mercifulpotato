I was intending for this to be about the Supercharger stations as that&#x27;s what TFA was about. This adapter will not work for any of the Telsa Supercharger stations you&#x27;ll commonly find around. They&#x27;ll work for the smaller charging stations that private individuals will own, but you won&#x27;t be able to use Tesla&#x27;s charging network with this adapter.<p>Buying Tesla is supporting vendor lock-in and proprietary standards instead of supporting open standards.')
