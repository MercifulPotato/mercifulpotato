Like cache &lt;&lt; memory &lt;&lt; disk &lt;&lt; network in terms of time needed to read&#x2F;write, and it seems to me that microservices are particularly prone to this by often using HTTP calls.<p>Sure, you can run them on the same box, but it&#x27;s very easy not to, and I imagine that this will absolutely crater performance (at least in the DS&#x2F;ML stuff I do).')
