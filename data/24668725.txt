(disc. I have one) Sleep tracking wasn&#x27;t added till the latest release!!??<p>I didn&#x27;t buy an Apple Watch because of a) the cost and b) not wanting to charge a watch every day. My Amazfit Bip is 2.5 years old, and has<p>* Heart rate detection up to every minute (automatically speeds up to real time during workout)<p>* Bluetooth Smart sensor functionality, so I can use it to report heart rate to compliant apps like iSmoothRun<p>* Sleep tracking<p>* 25 days of battery life (real world, not specification)<p>* GPS (although I never use it, preferring GPS on my phone through iSmoothRun)<p>* Notifications display<p>* More than 20,000 user-contributed watch faces<p>* $60 price when I bought it; the successor Bip S is about the same price today<p>It doesn&#x27;t have Apple Watch&#x27;s arrythmia or blood oxygen detection, and there is a UI bug that the company never fixed after it appeared last year, but otherwise Bip has done exactly what it promised and more.')
