Surely there are some who are not.<p><i>you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature ‘according to the Stoa,’ and would like everything to be made after your own image</i> - I know of no Stoic, ancient or modern, who advocates this.<p><i>what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself.</i> - the Stoics consistently cautioned against dogma, evidenced in practice by the abundance of various interpretations - Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s interpretation differs in ways from Seneca&#x27;s, which differs in ways from Epictetus&#x27;s, Zeno&#x27;s, Chrysippus&#x27;s, etc. A common saying among modern Stoics is &quot;Stoicism has no pope.&quot;<p>As for constructive responses, google &quot;responding to nietzsche on stoicism.&quot;')
