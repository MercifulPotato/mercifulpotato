Our plan is to make it radically affordable at a few tiers:\n* Free tier with full functionality but only a few user accounts for the workspace. Unlimited apps.\n* Team tier with 5 editors and 15 viewers starting around $50&#x2F;mo. More users would be incremental fees. We hope to serve most smaller business user at this level.\n* Pro tier with advanced customization and enterprise features would be a TBD multiple of the Team tier.\nHope that helps keep this under consideration.')
