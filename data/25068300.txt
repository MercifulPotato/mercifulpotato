What youtube does to the audience is disgusting. What it does to creators is much worse.<p>When a channel does well, the channel owner starts thinking, he can quit his day job and go fulltime as a youtuber. They borrow money and invest huge sums in building a studio. Then, they realize that they need to post not just regularly but often. You can feel that they are getting burned out. Sometimes, there will be a post titled &quot;life update&quot; where they will hint at it but will soon succumb to the fact they have no way out. They have to post a rate that is worse than torture.<p>Sometimes, Youtube gets upset or somebody takes offense and makes a complaint. The channel suffers a steep fall in traffic. The channel owner complains but gets no response.')
