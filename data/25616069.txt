Item(by='jiggawatts', descendants=None, kids=[25616301], score=None, time=1609618592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614755, text='The topic of poor Jira performance came up yesterday, and I did some quick benchmarking of Jira cloud using the best-case scenario for performance: A tiny amount of data, no complex permissions, a commonly used form, no web proxy, no plugins, same geo region as the servers (Sydney), gigabit fibre internet(!), etc...<p>I spun up a free-tier account and created an empty issue. No data. No history. Nothing in any form fields. As blank as possible.<p>The <i>only</i> positive aspect is that most of the traffic is coming from a CDN that enables: Gzip, IPv6, HTTP&#x2F;2, AES-GCM, and TLS 1.3. That&#x27;s the basics taken care of.<p>Despite this, reloading the page with a warm cache took a whopping 5.5 seconds. There&#x27;s an animated progress bar for the empty form!<p>This required 1.2 MB of uncacheable content to be transferred.<p>With the cache disabled (or cold), a total of 27.5 MB across 151 files taking 33 seconds is required to display the page. This takes over 5 MB of network traffic after compression. (Note that some corporate web proxies strip compression, so you can&#x27;t rely on it working!)<p>For reference, it takes 1.6 seconds on the same computer to start Excel, and 8 seconds to load Visual Studio 2019 (including opening a project). That&#x27;s <i>four times faster</i> than opening an issue ticket with a cold cache!<p>Meanwhile, the total text displayed on the screen is less than 1 KB, which means that the page has transfer-to-content efficiency ratio exceeding 1000-to-1. This isn&#x27;t the animated menu of a computer game, it&#x27;s a <i>web form!</i><p>To render the page, a total of 4.35 seconds of CPU time was required on a gaming desktop PC to with a 3.80 GHz CPU. Having 6-cores doesn&#x27;t seem to help performance, so don&#x27;t assume upcoming higher-core CPUs will help in any way.<p>A developer on an ultraportable laptop running on battery over a WiFi link with a bad corporate proxy server in a different geo-region would likely get a much worse experience. Typically they might get as little as 1.5 GHz and 20 Mbps effective bandwidth, so I can see why people are complaining that Jira page loads are taking 10+ seconds!<p>In perfectly normal circumstances your customers are likely seeing load times approaching a solid minute.<p>PS: I do development, and I&#x27;ve avoided Atlassian products primarily because there&#x27;s been a consistent theme to all discussions related to Atlassian, especially Jira: It&#x27;s slow.<p>Stop asking your customers if they&#x27;re running plugins, or what configuration they&#x27;re using. Start asking yourself what you&#x27;ve done wrong, terribly, <i>terribly</i> wrong.')
