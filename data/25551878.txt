It’s extremely <i>convenient</i> but at the same time, it’s a major cop-out. Designing a database correctly (in the right denormalized form, with the right indexes, with correct relationships, with optima choice of primary keys, etc) is hard work, but it’s critical work to properly take advantage of all the algorithms and optimizations baked into the database engine. I see lots of people migrate from mongo and co to Postgres because they realize it’s a more appropriate data store but I also find them trying  to hold on to as much of the original mongo approach as possible rather than just throwing in the towel and embracing traditional db interfacing.<p>JSON support in Postgres is really not intended to replace - even as a stopgap - what nosql was used for.')
