Item(by='jjk166', descendants=None, kids=[25260221], score=None, time=1606754422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25254869, text='&gt; Nothing except these tests were not take home prior to COVID.<p>Take home tests were definitely a thing before covid.<p>&gt; So you are expecting the student to remember 100% of what they heard in the online classes? Or more likely the student would write down these details and handle it to the cheater to use during the take home exam. Or the cheater would &quot;do X&quot;. In most cases the one doing the helping is not a current student, so it doesn&#x27;t help.<p>I expect students to take notes for their open book exams. If you&#x27;re competent enough to identify all the material needed for the cheater to do an open book test, congratulations you have the knowledge to pass the test. If you just record every piece of information possible, congratulations you have spent way more time and effort than it would have taken to just learn the material.<p>If you don&#x27;t attend any classes, do X. You&#x27;re not being penalized for doing that, it just warrants scrutiny. If this is an entry level course that an intelligent person could teach themselves the material, then it probably doesn&#x27;t matter if you cheated or not, you&#x27;ll be found out in higher level courses. If this is a high level course, your department would probably have a good idea of how capable you are from past performance. If the guy struggling to get a C in introductory physics gets a perfect score on his quantum final without going to class once, that is super suspicious.')
