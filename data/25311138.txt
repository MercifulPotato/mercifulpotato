Gold bugs have been telling me that inflation was going to happen for my entire 20 year adult life. And being on the Gold standard did not in any way prevent inflation...but don&#x27;t let that little fact get in the way of your hard money talking points.<p>If you want to have an honest discussion about the inflationary effects of adding more dollars to the money supply, then we have to talk about where those dollars come from and why they do and don&#x27;t create inflation. Talk about what the real demonstrable alternatives are, and whether or not a higher inflation is really the devil that so many claim it is.')
