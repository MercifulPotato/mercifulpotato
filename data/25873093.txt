The RPi GPIO is 40 pins (2x20). This board has two 20 pin headers (40 pins total). You could have the RPi GPIO off to one side and it would take the same total area. Maybe it&#x27;s not as fun to route the multilayer PCB to achieve this, but it would fit better with the existing RPi brand&#x2F;ecosystem.<p>As for the ESP8266 (not ESP32), you can find them on eBay below $3 shipped. The ESP8266 is already quite fast and capable for a microcontroller (it&#x27;s overkill for many applications). I agree that more IO pins could be a differentiating factor.')
