But the number could still be perfectly average, which is not that much. And perhaps below since most of SE Asia seems to be doing very well regardless of policy. China could have 50 times the per capita death rate and would still be below average.<p>Certain wards are overflowing, hospitals as a whole aren&#x27;t. Many if not most didn&#x27;t have that much excess mortality. Not hard to cover up at all by simply not admitting people and&#x2F;or providing sub-optimal care (in which case you&#x27;d have much more effective capacity).')
