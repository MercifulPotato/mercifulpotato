Sure the pay is good, it&#x27;s a pretty cushy job (compared to something like a labourer), and I feel I&#x27;m pretty good at what I do... but I wish for something more fulfilling.<p>I just feel that in my career path, all my jobs have been about making other people (investors) more money and extracting value from markets rather than building something truly valuable to the world. I did actually work in a stint at an NGO, but that was so filled with a bureaucracy and wasting money I had to go back to a for-profit company.<p>I&#x27;m feeling that maybe I should leave the software engineering career and do something completely different (what I don&#x27;t know), but I&#x27;d still like to do programming on the side. I just fell into this career as it was what I was good at.<p>How anyone here been at a similar cross roads in life? Which path did you choose?')
