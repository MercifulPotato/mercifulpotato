But, since, to take one example, sexism is a known problem in tech - and throughout corporate America and society, to be fair - in order to <i>not</i> have a sexist workplace, one would need to be <i>proactive.</i><p>Broadly speaking. Point being, it&#x27;s easy to not want &quot;politics&quot; in the workplace when the workplace works well for you. If you&#x27;re someone whom the workplace doesn&#x27;t work well for, like a person of color, a pregnant woman, new mother, or new father, for that matter, well, then it&#x27;s a different story.<p>If you yourself believe that sexism&#x2F;systemic racism <i>aren&#x27;t</i> issues that show up (even inadvertently or despite the best intentions of individuals) in the workplace, well, then that&#x27;s a different conversation entirely.<p>I think this is different from someone in a position of power promoting a particular candidate in the workplace. That is more complex and problematic. The 2020 election was obviously an extreme example, and, tbh, with things like global warming, I think we&#x27;ll be seeing <i>more</i> politics like that in the workplace, not less.<p>Which, to me, means it&#x27;s not an easy or one-size-fits all solution, but rather, a challenge which requires each of us to exercise care and our own judgement.<p>For example, personally, I would have liked to see Hacker News take even a small explicit step of endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement (such as putting &#x27;Black lives matter&#x27; on the top of the homepage), seeing as how it&#x27;s one of the major civil rights issues of our present moment. I can also understand their concerns around doing so, even though I disagree with them.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s too easy for those of us doing well and making money to forget that the institutions we work for have a social impact and are a part of society.')
