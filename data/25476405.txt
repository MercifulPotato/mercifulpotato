I used to work in metagenomics, where we would assemble environments with hundreds of bacterial genomes. We developed a deep-learning approach to binning the assembly, Vamb, which worked really well. In hindsight, our approach to deep learning was quite naive, so I can easily see more skilled application of DL completely outclass all existing approaches to binning. So while DL indeed would have a hard time with assembly, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the case for genomics as such.')
