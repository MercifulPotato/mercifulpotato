This means they have engineers that don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, and there&#x27;s not much they can do to prevent it. The average &quot;security&quot; skill level is very very low, and even people who are good at it make huge mistakes constantly.<p>If you accept that, then it makes sense to spend time and money on preventing people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing from hurting everyone else. It is therefore essential that mitigations like this are applied, even though if everyone did their job perfectly, they would not be necessary.')
