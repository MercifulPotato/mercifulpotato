There are 3 other cars ahead of the Tesla at this red light intersection.  If you&#x27;re able to react within tens or hundreds of milliseconds to a changing environment, it would actually make sense to reduce compute to save power for when the vehicle is in motion and not surrounded by other vehicles at a stop light.<p>Edit:  It seemed to handle that intersection just fine, but a couple of turns down it ends up on the wrong side of the road, which is quite bad.  That said, what proof do you have that Waymo&#x2F;Cruise would be any better at this?')
