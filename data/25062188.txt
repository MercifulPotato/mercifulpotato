Poor people used to marry as their only hope of surviving and this often left them stuck in dysfunctional and unhappy relationships.<p>I would rather be single than forced into a miserable and possibly abusive relationship as my only hope of survival.<p>The upper classes have something of a tendency to view all details of lower class life like every single bit of it is terrible and more bad news. There is a tendency to never see any stats in any kind of positive light. If you are poor, well it must suck to be you and you must be a victim every step of the way.<p>I think that is problematic as a framing. I think discussions of issues impacting poor people really need more nuance than that.')
