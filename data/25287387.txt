There are two reasons you should try to avoid falling into this habit: (a) the components themselves are of finite precision (typical resistors are 5%; the parameters that characterize transistors, say, frequently are known only to a factor of two); (b) one mark of a good circuit design is insensitivity of the finished circuit to precise values of the components (there are exceptions, of course). You&#x27;ll also learn circuit intuition more quickly if you get into the habit of doing approximate calculations in your head, rather than watching meaningless numbers pop up on a calculator display.')
