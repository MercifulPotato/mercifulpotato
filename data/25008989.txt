Recognizing that our preferences are merely preferences, not needs, and that we can go forward without them controlling our attitude toward what life brings.<p>Of course we have preferences, and we make evaluations, and we endeavor to change. But Stoicism is partly about grasping those things loosely rather than staking our emotional well-being on them.<p>Even the cutesy &quot;live according to life&quot;: does anyone deny that we often <i>resist</i> life? We know there will be setbacks, losses, death, etc., and instead of anticipating and flowing with them we are surprised and dismayed.<p>Nietzsche <i>valued</i> a sort of resistance to life. But it&#x27;s a strawman to treat that value as axiomatic and dismiss Stoicism as inherently contradictory.')
