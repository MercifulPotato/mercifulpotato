A Pareto machine that covers 80% of functionality with 20% of the complexity.<p>Beefing it up towards something that is capable of serving as a development environment, as quite a few people wish for here, is fundamentally incompatible with that. Wanting a touch Mac is of course well and fine and understandable - but the iPad cannot become that without killing what makes it special in the first place.<p>Maybe there is a way to expose more power through iOS&#x27; user interface without adding noticeable complexity - but if there is, Apple has not found it yet. A good chunk of enhancements have either made things more complex — the &quot;just stuff another button into the share sheet&quot; school of thought seems prevalent — or led to features that are wholly invisible and undiscoverable.<p>Multitasking is a prime example: I end up using my girlfriends iPad Pro about once a week, and for the past year I have not managed to internalize how to reliably manage split screen modes and the like.')
