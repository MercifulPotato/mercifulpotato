I appreciate that synecdoche is a thing, but to recommend a &quot;roadmap&quot; to becoming an &quot;AI Expert in 2020&quot; while ignoring most of AI is...<p>... well I don&#x27;t know what it is, anymore. Sign of the times? Perhaps the field (AI that is) should abandon its name just to be sure that if a backlash ever comes against deep learning it won&#x27;t take everyone else&#x27;s reseach with it?<p>On the other hand, I feel a bit like the horses and the cows in Animal Farm, when the pigs took over the Revolution. Not that there was any revolution, not really, but the way that the research trends have shifted lately, from what would make good science to what will make you hired by Google, is a little bit of a shock to me. And I stared my PhD just three years ago. It&#x27;s come to the point where I don&#x27;t want to associate my research with &quot;machine learning&quot; and I don&#x27;t want to use the term in my thesis, for fear of the negative connotations (of sleazy practices and shoddy research) that I am concerned might be attached to it in the time to come.<p>And it&#x27;s such a shame because the people who really advanced the field, people like Joshua Bengio, Jurgen Schmidhuber, Geoff Hinton, Yan Le Cunn etc are formidable scientists, dedicated to their preferred approaches and with the patience to nurture their ideas against all opposition. The field they helped progress so much deserved better.')
