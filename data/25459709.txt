Robinhood and Cash don&#x27;t offer these services.  I guess an argument that can be made is that Coinbase understands the technology and will continue to offer products from the innovative defi&#x2F;blockchain space.  Most people will use Coinbase for its product offerings and security.  It sits right between, Robinhood and Uniswap.  If defi truly disrupts then I&#x27;m sure all financial institutions will start offering staking and defi products, then Coinbase hopefully has some first mover advantage.')
