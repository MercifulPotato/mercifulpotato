I donâ€™t know if this guy had a malicious intent or not but I can see his point of view. I install Dropbox on my work computer and sync some of my editor settings over and some other personal things. I never transfer company docs but I could see it accidentally happening if I meant to copy something to ~&#x2F;Desktop but accidentally autocompleted ~&#x2F;Dropbox.<p>Gonna have to remember to watch out for this one if I ever go back to a big company.')
