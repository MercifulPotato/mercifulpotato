Wayland is a nice lock. This &quot;keylogger&quot; depends on having <i>arbitrary code execution</i> as your user, outside of a sandbox. The same technique could be applied to backdoor literally anything.

X11 does allow this. That&#x27;s the key distinction. Wayland does nothing to prevent programs from snooping on each other using any of the other features of your operating system.
