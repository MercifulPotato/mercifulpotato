But did you try to rollback to previous version of a package? \nI had the problem on my personal laptop last year. There was no possibility to get a different version than the newest, which was broken (upstream&#x27;s fault in this case). Luckily I had the previous version in my pacman cache and was able to install it. The package maintainers did a good job and the issue was resolved in something like 24-48 hours (from patching upstream to pacman). So nothing tragic for personal use. \nIn a productive environment? A very big no. One to two full days are simply not acceptable in any kind and&#x2F;or size of business. Yes, you would (and should) test the update before rolling it out to production and be able to mitigate the problem, but you can&#x27;t be sure, because you can&#x27;t pin the version you want to install. Ok, you could build your own repo and package everything you need yourself. But it takes time and costs a lot of money.<p>Also automated deployment of Arch is a little bit of a headache.')
