I don&#x27;t know why this ships turned on, given so many machines implement it poorly, but it&#x27;s just one config checkbox to turn a trackpad that is awful this way to one that is OK.<p>(I&#x27;m referring to &quot;Press the lower right corner of the touchpad to right-click&quot; box.  The Dells that the school I teach at has are near unusable with this clicked, but improve significantly with it off and using two-fingers to right click instead).')
