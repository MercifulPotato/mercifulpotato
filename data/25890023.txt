What specific scenario are you talking about and who would have the resources, incentive, and immunity from law enforcement to actually pull it off?<p>If I receive my ballot at home, complete it at home, and then deliver it to mailbox or drop box, at what point can someone intercept me and &quot;force me&quot; to show it to them?<p>&gt; <i>Then people can be punished or bribed for their vote.</i><p>So you think someone could sway an election by intercepting people holding mail-in ballots, &quot;forcing&quot; them to show them the ballot, and then bribing&#x2F;punishing(?) them as an incentive to change the vote? Like you think someone could do this at a large enough scale to change the outcome of an election?<p>And if that&#x27;s true, why aren&#x27;t there any documented cases of this happening?<p>As soon as someone forced you to change your vote, you could call your elections board, report it, file a criminal complaint, and submit a new ballot.<p>&gt; <i>This has obvious significance in a union vote where those things have a greater history of happening, but it&#x27;s true in general.</i><p>It&#x27;s much easier to change a unionization vote with intimidation tactics than a large-scale political election. If unions were still organized criminal organizations in many places, this would be a legitimate concern. But it&#x27;s also not 1950 anymore, so it&#x27;s not a concern.')
