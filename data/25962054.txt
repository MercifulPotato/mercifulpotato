A $1M loan with a $10 &quot;fee&quot; is still a usurious loan and is prohibited. This is not open for opinions.<p>We&#x27;re not going to have any meaningful progress if this issue is not tackled. Any talk of &quot;equity&quot; is nonsense until then.<p>&gt; setting it to zero causes all sorts of distortions<p>It doesn&#x27;t, because under Islamic law, loans are purely an act of charity. That&#x27;s how the Islamic world has operated for a very long time now, until relatively recently where some people have succumbed to the Western economic practices post WWII.
