It&#x27;s really completely absurd. You should bring sources for socialist theorists who clamour for total egalitarianism.<p>The Chinese cultural revolution was a lot of very bad things, but it wasn&#x27;t in order to make everyone the same either, not at all.<p>I know that Pol Pot wasn&#x27;t a communist because he himself said that he wasn&#x27;t one. I haven&#x27;t heard of himself saying he was of some other socialist legacy either, so I don&#x27;t think this is sophism.<p>Marx does formulate a framework where everything mentioned is fully consistent, that being said I don&#x27;t have the time to give you a full introduction on Marxian economics. You could look up Richard D. Wolff if you want to see where these ideas come from, though. But the objection you make is misguided, because for Marx wealth only comes from labour, the instant you make wealth from something that is not labour then that wealth is not rightfully yours. This makes the whole thing where workers are inherently unequal in ability, but at the same time someone making wealth purely from ownership is a totally different kind of inequality that is not a reflection of their superior abilities, as we all know that you do not need superior ability to make vastly outsized earnings through pure ownership.<p>Basically, if you want to be making some kind of takedown of socialist ideology, and there is for sure lots to be critiqued, I&#x27;d suggest reading the works beforehand so you don&#x27;t say enormities like &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard of big socialists group who do not want total egalitarianism in the end&quot;.')
