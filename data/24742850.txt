Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602374674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726852, text='&gt; I think the key word in your argument is &#x27;implies&#x27; and you didn&#x27;t use the word &#x27;requires&#x27;.<p>You can make this same argument for the function name or the parameter names. Nothing about the implementation of the max function requires it be named max to work, it just needs to link to a function pointer or some equivalent construct that acts in a way as <i>defined by a specification</i> for what max should do. A name like max is helpful for use though. So is arranging max, min, and other standard math functions in the same module. Treating method names as different from other forms of organization is inconsistent. They are all forms of organization.<p>You&#x27;ve also raise some points re interoperability, but I&#x27;m not really arguing about that. My own argument is more of a conceptual one based on the difference between an API and an API contract as well as on the role a system specification plays in API design &amp; use. You could probably extend this concept to the interoperability question and I see no reason why it won&#x27;t make sense, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m doing here.')
