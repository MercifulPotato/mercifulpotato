It&#x27;s something that just needs to be good enough. It&#x27;s not a particularly important aspect of making a good photo. OP&#x27;s story highlights a much more important aspect: being in the right place at the right time.<p>I guess I&#x27;m getting old, but I can&#x27;t help but observe that the image quality provided by a smartphone today is superior to anything available even to rich amateurs when I was a kid in the 90s. This is especially so when you look at color accuracy and dynamic range as well as resolution (which is much less important, but much more often obsessed over).')
