Item(by='scruple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608319006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25468494, text='I recently asked an interviewer (on the 4th and final stage of their ~~gatekeeping~~ interview process during my very last interview when I got to the final boss of this dumb ass game -- the Senior Staff Software Engineer of the team I was interviewing with) if they &quot;did&quot; crunch. His face contorted a bit, it was obvious that I had hit on something. He said yes, frequently, in fact, and that they are &quot;very busy&quot; and &quot;have crunch periods&quot; typically in Q1 and Q4 of _each year_.<p>I asked him if there were planning process improvements that could be made to reduce the necessity of crunch periods. He sighed at me, turned his head to look at the window next to him, and then gave me a few sentences of tangentially related anecdotes about their planning process and why it&#x27;s &quot;hard&quot; &quot;because of customers.&quot;<p>It was already clear to me that I didn&#x27;t want the job if they made me an offer at this point. Thankfully they saved me from having to say so. The recruiter called me a week later to say, &quot;We&#x27;ve decided to move forward with other candidates who we feel are a better match for this particular position.&quot;<p>All I can think to myself at this point is, &quot;I&#x27;m too old for this shit.&quot;')
