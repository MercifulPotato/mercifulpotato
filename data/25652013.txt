It was only the 2013 or older Leafs that had issues and only in hot dry climates like Texas and Arizona.<p>Leafs were cheap primarily because there was a glut of off lease vehicles.  They were leased for federal and state tax rebates, in Georgia you got enough back in rebates to pay for the entirety of a 2 year lease, 2 years of insurance, and still have some left over.  Lots of people leased them, and then when the lease was up they didn&#x27;t want to renew the lease or buy them.<p>When I bought my off lease Leaf, I was talking with the salesman and he said he bought one off lease with less than 1000 miles on it because it had just been parked the whole time.')
