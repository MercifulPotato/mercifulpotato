I moved back to Los Angeles, and from then till now I rarely visited for the simple reason that once there in SF there is no place to park your car (all filled, gotta leave the city) and lunch at a non-franchise was $50 10 years ago.<p>Only old money, youth that knows no better, tech hope gambles, and those trapped in debt remain. The city is unhospitable.')
