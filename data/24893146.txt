They just want to ship their features on time and get their year-end bonus or whatever pat on the head.<p>Even at a company like Google, I don&#x27;t think most programmers are really pushing their understanding of software design or tools or techniques. They learn all the silly interview stuff about red-black trees then are just happy using coding within the well-defined bumper car arena of Google&#x27;s frameworks and coding guidelines (e.g. Golang with no &quot;hidden code&quot; like in C++, where not writing certain things causes the compiler to generate stuff for you).<p>We all read Hacker News and generally are excited by new advances in things (e.g. C++ concepts! No more stupid SFINAE!), but most people at big companies don&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s truly a testament to the genius of Go that it solves this problem: much faster than Java, not complicated because most programmers at Big Corp can&#x27;t deal with complexity (e.g. no exceptions in Google&#x27;s C++ coding guideline), and understandable without too much effort by the average programmer at Google.<p>We all understand what it looks like without this effort: The Monolith of Bug Spaghetti Code<p>I work for an extremely large software company that is stuck on C for decades. I try to use C++ where I can, but I usually get shot down in code review with a message of &quot;C++ is too complicated for your colleagues to understand what you did&quot;. To solve the code mess, they implement their own languages to generate the boilerplate C (e.g. like protobufs, but poorly done and NIH because some guy wanted a promotion to &quot;Principal Engineer&quot;).<p>As much as I dislike Go, I would take Go over the current situation I&#x27;m in...')
