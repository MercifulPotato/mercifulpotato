If you compare by reference, you probably don&#x27;t get what you want. If you compare by value, you need to go arbitrarily deep, which is not a sane default, because of possible reference cycles. You need a distinction between objects and value types. C# has that (record types).<p>&quot;<i>Once created, objects and collections must be immutable.</i>&quot;<p>If this is how you want to program, fine. Don&#x27;t tell me this is &quot;the right way&quot; to program. Immutable data structures can have a lot of overhead, which disqualifies them from many domains.<p>The real world is all about mutable state. At some point, you need to take the training wheels off.')
