There is no inherent virtue in a &#x27;$200k+&#x27; number.<p>&gt; &quot;Cost of living&quot; or however you want to break down that salary is irrelevant to what companies think employees are worth.<p>Exactly. Companies care about the cost of labor, not the cost living. And if you are in a different geography with a lower cost of living, it is believable that the cost of your labor is less. Why is it surprising then?')
