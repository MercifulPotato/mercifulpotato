Strangely enough, I found I was getting so much power from the panels that I don&#x27;t bother propping them up.  Because of the way the panels are mounted (basically at least 1 panel facing the sun at all times), I&#x27;m able to get roughly 500w from 8:30am until just after 5pm.  I was pleasantly surprised.')
