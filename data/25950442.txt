I just learned of &quot;...and forgive them their debts&quot; [0], and looking forward to reading it.<p>While I&#x27;m generally in favor of debt forgiveness for 2021 America, in his talks he&#x27;s primarily described jubilees in the context of regime change: a new conquering emperor, or an aspiring revolutionary leader, cancels the debts to secure the loyalty of workers and soldiers, and the nobility has to acquiesce at the point of a sword.<p>What I can&#x27;t figure out is how this could be done on a predictable timetable (as per the Biblical jubilee concept: every 7 or 50 years). In a conquest scenario, a lender might only withhold lending if the current power structure looked weak; but if debt forgiveness was institutionalized, why wouldn&#x27;t they just cease all lending on Year 6 or Year 49? (Or, more likely: fold the probability of forgiveness into a usurious interest rate, so they collect the same income on average.)<p>As it stands, I think debt forgiveness can only be done as a one-time solution to gross inequality and&#x2F;or social instability; and that institutional reform (to not need jubilees) has to be done upstream (such as public banking, Georgist land trusts, etc). But I&#x27;m very open to being convinced otherwise.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;42515482-and-forgive-them-their-debts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;42515482-and-forgive-the...</a>')
