Google&#x27;s xref system allowed you to browse essentially the whole Google codebase - it was amazing. Third party code was indexes too, I remember my team used code search to track down a bug in NGINX once.<p>Githubs normal search feature is bad. I can&#x27;t even quote stuff for exact matches. I usually end up using bigquery for GitHub wide searches [1] or just pull down the repo and grep locally.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;cloudblog.withgoogle.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gcp&#x2F;github-on-bigquery-analyze-all-the-open-source-code&#x2F;amp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;cloudblog.withgoogle.com&#x2F;produc...</a>')
