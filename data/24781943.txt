It would have been far more effective to just label these tweets as containing potentially misleading information. The story would have died out tomorrow and life would&#x27;ve gone on.  Instead this has blown up in their face spectacularly and directly lends credibility to the idea that they have their finger on the scale for Biden. If Trump wins reelection I imagine that he will immediately use the full force of the DOJ against Twitter.<p>At this point, Twitter might as well just lean into it, and go all out for Biden. They&#x27;re damned if they do, and damned if they don&#x27;t, so might as well pick a side and hope that you&#x27;re on the winning side.<p>FB might get off here for only &quot;slowing down&quot; the spread of the article, but maybe not.')
