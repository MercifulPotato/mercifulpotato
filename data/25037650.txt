Designing those formats to be useful cross-platform would be tough, but you could start with a format db that only promises linux compat, and later add bsd, and maybe windows even later.<p><i>edit: google had something like this internally, the &quot;protodb&quot;, a versioned repository of protobuf definitions so that any other tool could consume your tool&#x27;s output.</i>')
