The bluetooth keyboard works as my remote now, and it works very reliably - not just to stream content or play music, but its great to even do split screen, shop together&#x2F; look up something together while sitting on the couch, typing on the keyboard&#x2F;using a trackpad is infinitely better than using the onscreen keyboards on smart TVs&#x2F;roku etc.')
