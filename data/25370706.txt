If they don&#x27;t control it, would it make any difference if a company is state owned or private owned. If I own 1000 companies, and one of them is going to do the biggest IPO, I probably will still watch this one closely.<p>I think I have become too political recently reading hacker news. Such a waste of time. I will not participate in any philosophy&#x2F;political&#x2F;ideology any more. Thanks for the reply.<p>EDIT: We all have a habit to use logic to understand events, but many times, we can bend events to fit our logic. It is so natural, and we don&#x27;t even notice it. I don&#x27;t believe the world is black and white, or labelling makes it easier to understand the world. Everywhere you go is just a bunch of humans. When we are happy we take time and try to understand differences, when we are not, we attack differences. It is how we develop and survive in the wild.')
