It&#x27;s presumably not a rule against saying &quot;fire&quot; at all, since that what fire alarms are for.<p>I presume you mean that the limitations on speech take the form of punishments after the fact for saying &quot;fire&quot; when there wasn&#x27;t one.  I agree this is sensible.<p>But I think it&#x27;s an important point that we can&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t, and don&#x27;t) ban people entirely from shouting &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theatre, because if they&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s important to know.<p>I think it&#x27;s worth discussing this more fleshed-out example, because it shows that in order to limit speech without shutting down useful information, you need to have some sort of trusted fact-finding apparatus to punish false alarms, which then become an important locus of power.')
