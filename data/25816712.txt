Item(by='yosito', descendants=None, kids=[25816817], score=None, time=1610928852, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815352, text='I&#x27;m thinking of posting my photos to something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micro.blog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micro.blog</a> instead. Or posting them on my Gatsby site which is just a little bit more work for me (since I&#x27;m a developer) but definitely lacks a little bit of convenience. The biggest thing that&#x27;s hard to give up for me is the simplicity of Instagram&#x27;s image editing features built right into the flow of making a new post. I don&#x27;t use the predefined filters, but I&#x27;ve got a pretty good personal style that I&#x27;ve developed with the manual editing tools. Any tips on ways to reproduce this flow are welcome!')
