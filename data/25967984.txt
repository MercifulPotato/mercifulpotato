Immunization with the second dose should be continued to attain the anticipated protection.&quot;<p>I.e. if you take only the first dose of the two required then 13 days after taking it you already get an effectiveness of 50%. Therefore they recommend that people take the 2nd dose as prescribed. They don&#x27;t mention effectiveness one week after the 2nd shot, which is what Israel considers to be immune (i.e. &quot;green passport&quot; status).')
