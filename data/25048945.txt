Finding a “see also” link to one of those is the best, because you know it will actually show you how to use it. Otherwise you’re probably on your own.<p>For example, Previews are one of SwiftUI’s major features. Here’s its docs page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;swiftui&#x2F;previews" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;swiftui&#x2F;previews</a><p>You could read through that and all of the linked pages and still have <i>no idea</i> how create a preview. Want to preview it on a particular device? Well, I can see there’s a PreviewDevice, it’s initialized from various kinds of strings, and absolutely no information on how to apply it.<p>Turns out this is a SwiftUI modifier that you chain off of your view inside the struct that adheres to the PreviewProvider protocol. See example here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackingwithswift.com&#x2F;quick-start&#x2F;swiftui&#x2F;how-to-preview-your-layout-in-different-devices" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackingwithswift.com&#x2F;quick-start&#x2F;swiftui&#x2F;how-to-...</a><p>Could you construct that example from having read the documentation? I doubt it.')
