One of the things that I meant to express in the article but couldn&#x27;t was when as someone approaches a problem with an understanding of the context (business, people etc) they will be more likely to understand what&#x27;s important, what&#x27;s not and when good is good enough.<p>As a side note, I shared this article with Jessica as a draft and she shared it with her followers before I could add a few more things. Still my most successful post yet and comments such as these make me understand there is a lot of material for new blog posts.')
