It is why bookmakers don&#x27;t report all the bets they take in as revenue. Banks that trade securities don&#x27;t recognise the money from securities they sell as revenue. Roughly, you only recognise revenue on the part of the transaction that economically accrues to you. If you are just a middleman, you only recognise your commission (this is, however, very complex...for example, some companies that trade in commodities recognise product sold on the top-line because they take ownership of the cargo...so it varies...the accounting in this case is what I would want to know as someone using the financial statements).')
