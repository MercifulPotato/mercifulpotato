Were they all working? Has the footage from the insurrection attempt been saved?<p>I ask because the capitol seems like one of those places that would resist internal security cameras because congresspersons wouldn&#x27;t want their meetings potentially being recorded. Plus the general incompetence of security leadership before and on that day makes me wonder if any cameras were actually in working order and saving footage.')
