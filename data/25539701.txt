I find it ok. If I wasn&#x27;t so used to the keyboard mappings&#x2F;shortcuts it might be easier. Maybe ElementaryOS would have been a better OS if I&#x27;d had the choice.<p>Reiterating the parent, I just want things to work and work <i>well</i> together. I&#x27;ve been using computers since about 1980 and Linux since 0.9. At some point in my 30s I just decided custom tweaking and compiling from scratch was more self indulgence and a distraction -- I&#x27;m still working on my other distractions and bad habits, but Gentoo isn&#x27;t one of them!')
