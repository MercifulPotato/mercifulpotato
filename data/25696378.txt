Google removes parler from the Play Store today, a different action (not banning trump). Apple didn&#x27;t ban anything, but is considering it.<p>These seem like different actions by different companies, responding to the same news.<p>Also, pedantic as it may be, it&#x27;s not political action. These companies are not political entities. Just because groups of people communicate about politics on the platform doesn&#x27;t make them political.<p>What we are seeing is major internet companies responding to and banning perpetrators of treason and sedition, of domestic terrorism.')
