I just don&#x27;t see how having to compete with Amazon is, all of a sudden, a better deal for MacStadium. If anything, it just highlights the volatile nature of running a business in the Apple ecosystem.<p>&gt; For the record in no way I think that Apple took this decision to favor you or anyone else except themselves. It just seems that you won a regulatory lottery.<p>&quot;<i>Congratulations, you&#x27;re a winner... your prize is to compete with Amazon!</i>&quot; Some would certainly wear it with a badge of honor!')
