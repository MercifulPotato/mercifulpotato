There were even restaurants putting up Pompeii last meal menus in London&#x2F;UK.<p>The fish part is probably garum[1] ..a condiment fermented fish entrails. I have had the unenviable task of helping to prepare this for a chef who picked me because I was a vegetarian then.<p>Probably known as Liquamen in Pompeii but it’s the same as Garum. it’s basically fatty gish(sardines&#x2F;mackerel&#x2F;tuna) that is heavily salted to remove the juices and it’s then fermented. Actually it ends up smelling not so fishy at all.<p>Salted and brined fish is common in Asia too. In fact, the origins of ketchup is actually a fish based sauce from China. Bit different method.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Garum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Garum</a>')
