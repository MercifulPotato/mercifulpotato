That is, on the various speeds of various package managers. I don&#x27;t know a ton about Conda, but when I was looking into Poetry, one of the core issues is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;python-poetry.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#why-is-the-dependency-resolution-process-slow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;python-poetry.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#why-is-the-dependency-re...</a><p>&gt; This is due to the fact that not all libraries on PyPI have properly declared their metadata and, as such, they are not available via the PyPI JSON API. At this point, Poetry has no choice but downloading the packages and inspect them to get the necessary information. This is an expensive operation, both in bandwidth and time, which is why it seems this is a long process.<p>Cargo doesn&#x27;t need to do anything with packages directly to do its job; everything it needs is in the index. This makes it pretty fast.')
