And I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a complete picture. I ask you to consider the disabled and the aged as examples of what I&#x27;ll call &#x27;shaped&#x27; potential to distinguish from &#x27;infinite&#x27; potential. I hope you would make the distinction between the availability of education and the requirement for its use. To demand &#x27;infinite&#x27; growth from &#x27;shaped&#x27; potential is cruelty, not generosity.')
