Kids are arrested and charged for low-level drug offenses for doing something innocuous like smoking a joint. Then, prosecutors in municipalities will offer them plea deals and offers to expunge their records in return for paying exorbitant fees and participating in a jobs program for probation officers.<p>Why would someone take a plea deal and agree to pay municipalities what often amounts to thousands of dollars in fees? Because students with drug offenses on their records can have their eligibility for student loans stripped, potentially ruining their chances at bettering their lives through education. A drug conviction will pop up on every background check if their records aren&#x27;t expunged.')
