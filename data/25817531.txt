Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610937327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817439, text='&gt; Parler&#x27;s entire point was being an alt-right platform<p>I don’t think this is a fair statement. From past interviews, it’s clear that the CEO of Parler and its founding team intended for it to be politically neutral and a destination for those of all ideologies. They may have attracted those on the political right, but that’s because Twitter is by default a bastion for the political left and naturally those seeking alternatives would have a different lean. But I don’t think that’s the same as the entire point being an alt-right platform.<p>Also, Twitter and Facebook definitely played a role in the riot story, and likely a much bigger role than Parler because of their scale.

But of course Apple and Google haven’t taken any actions against Facebook or Twitter. If the argument is that “most content on these services is fine”, that was also true of Parler.')
