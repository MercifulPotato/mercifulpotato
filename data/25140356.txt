San Leandro is closer and could take almost an hour driving. Hayward could take an hour but you also have the option of crossing the San Mateo bridge further south and driving up 101, especially if your workplace is closer to the 101 exits on the south side. Ultimately public transport on BART is likely going to be the faster option, since it’s 25-30 mins once you’re on the train.')
