Well, looks like it&#x27;s not working out as planned, at least not for Facebook, with both NYTimes and WSJ accusing them of basically being the same as Parler.<p>One possible future is that this just blows over, and&#x2F;or gets swept under the rug for a few months&#x2F;years until another <i>faux pas</i> happens and Big Tech is again in the crosshairs (this time, Democrats&#x27; crosshairs - who are generally more anti-business). Another option is that FB&amp;co fight back, and accuse the media&#x2F;Democrats of tolerating&#x2F;promoting violence over the summer.<p>Who could have predicted this? :D')
