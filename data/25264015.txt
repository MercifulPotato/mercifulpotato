Startups will do it - okay - at what cost? What funding do they need that ITER is somehow consuming their budget?<p>The US military expenditure for fiscal year $934 billion dollars. That is not the actual spend. ITER, over it&#x27;s entire 20-30 year history will cost about $23 billion USD projected. So a $1 billion or less per year.<p>By comparison, the US military budget between FY 2019 and FY 2020 increased in proposed (i.e. the actual spend was more) by $63 billion USD.<p>So the US, somehow, between 2019 and 2020 found the money for another 3 entire ITER projects. Just kick another 3 20-30 year projects out, fully funded.<p><i>Uber</i> has raised $24.5 billion USD to date. A company who&#x27;s principle asset is an algorithm which dispatches taxis, raised enough money to literally fund it&#x27;s own ITER project.<p>So &quot;At what cost&quot; - what are these startups needing to be budgeted for, that are going to be so much cheaper, that they are unable to get any of this money? Set aside the actual defense spend of the US - but I mean, how can you, the US runs nuclear powered carriers, and would have infinite utility for a compact fusion power plant - how is it that ITER is always the problem here, and not that this notion of &quot;we need startups&quot; might actually be running into funding issues because on closer examination they&#x27;re not actually as cheap, the data is not as convincing, or they&#x27;re actually about to ask for <i>just as much money</i>.<p>So again, how much money do these alleged startups need? Why is it apparently so hard for them to get it, when the total valuation of ITER is being thrown around by venture capitalists pretty regularly and the prize is dominance of the next several centuries of power generating technology?')
