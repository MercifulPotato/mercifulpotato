Because typically it&#x27;s the average person&#x27;s pockets they&#x27;re draining to line their pockets.<p>There&#x27;s no trust because there is nothing to trust.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s not true, there is trust, we can trust that whatever they&#x27;re doing or saying, it&#x27;s for their benefit and not the general good of most people.<p>It&#x27;s blatant and obvious and if people are losing faith in these institutions, it&#x27;s not distrust, it&#x27;s the coming to the obvious awareness that these institutions are not and have never worked for anything other than themselves.')
