It’s also not fun that there is no mechanism to cap APM. I’ve also always dreaded starting 1v1 due to the mental stress. I get the same playing Go. I really wish there were more competitive 2v2 or more.<p>Anyone here remembers natural selection I and II? They were hybrid RTS&#x2F;FPS where a single player would play an RTS game and other players would play units. I felt like there was something to be explored more there...<p>Also one thing that always created great space control were front lines: total commander has that, and capture the flag (I remember league of legends having a “dominion” mode that was really fun). I also remember an RTS where you could occupy buildings.')
