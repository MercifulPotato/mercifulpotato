The opposite is naive as well, where you assume everyone always have hidden agendas. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.<p>&gt; For example, the line about &quot;economic justice&quot; almost certainly means the authors believe the company should be used as a propaganda vehicle for socialism&#x2F;communism.<p>Well, yes and no. Yes, you can describe their economic justice value as socialistic, I don&#x27;t think they are trying to hide that. Here&#x27;s the full value:<p>&gt; Social and economic justice are paramount to achieving just outcomes. We will prioritize the needs of the worst off. Neutrality never helps the victim.<p>Yes, sounds like socialism. Exactly what they are aiming to implement in the Google&#x2F;Alphabet workplace. The people who sign up with the union, are people who agree they want to focus on fixing that particular problem.
