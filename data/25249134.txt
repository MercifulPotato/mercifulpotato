You can get pretty far with VMs running systemd&#x2F;init.d services and a mechanical way to apply filesystem changes. This is how &quot;typical&quot; services were operated for decades, and it has distinct advantages at small scales.<p>If I were advising a startup on technical architecture, I would recommend they write their software as if it runs in Kubernetes (avoid hardcoded configuration, bundle dependencies into the build artifact, use mTLS instead of firewalls) but otherwise behave like someone running a LAMP stack in 2003.')
