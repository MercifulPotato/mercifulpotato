And student should be able to apply for promotions at any point, where if they pass the test, they can get promoted to the next level. Grades should be secret from one another like salaries often are, so students shouldn&#x27;t feel like they compete with others, but only with themselves. And they should focus on working towards their promotions, with a 1:1 with the teacher where the teacher can tell them what they should focus on next and all to work towards their promotion.<p>That way everyone can go at their own pace, which can even be a pace that varies from time to time. Students don&#x27;t feel a competitive pressure. You don&#x27;t really have &quot;class mates&quot; in the sense that there&#x27;s much more churn at all time of who is currently in any given lesson. And you get more personalized feedback on how to reach the next level.<p>Also, schools shouldn&#x27;t be rated with how well their student performs, but instead by the diff of how much better the students became year over year. Like imagine a fitness studio bragging how their program makes you super fit, but they only accept people who are already super fit to join, doesn&#x27;t make any sense.')
