However, until we install enough solar that’s a pointless exercise as simply directly using solar energy is more efficient and there isn’t a regular surplus to capture.<p>The economics of this get really interesting. In a largely solar grid, 1 axis Solar tracking systems add production in the morning and evenings, thus offsetting the need for a lot of battery storage.  However, we aren’t currently using significant battery storage so that isn’t worth it yet.  Similarly shipping a surplus East &#x2F; West time shifts it, but we don’t currently have that surplus.')
