DD and friends are just annoyed they&#x27;ll have to do some minor business relations work instead of drawing value out of a business and then palming customer support off to them, while they never knew they were ever part of the transaction in the first place.<p>It puts the restaurants back in a position of control over their own business operations, I think that&#x27;s fine. If you want to work with the business to draw value from them, you&#x27;ll have to arrange it. People are looking at this like it&#x27;s the customer versus the restaurants, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s about mediating the relationship between two commercial operations and the vast majority of law is about just that kind of thing.')
