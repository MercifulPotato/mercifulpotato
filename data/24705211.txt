Item(by='NE2z2T9qi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602043691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697860, text='In my entire life I&#x27;ve only ever felt screwed over by two--and only two--entities: Comcast and private universities.<p>Not Apple, not Google, not Facebook, not Amazon, not banks, not credit card companies, not even my cell carrier. On the whole—as a customer at least—I feel like all my dealings with these &quot;big tech firms&quot; have been fair and mutually beneficial. I love Apple products, I think Google basically deserves a Nobel Prize for their democratization of knowledge and their creation of useful tools, and I can sing the praises of how much Amazon has simplified my life with easy ordering and reliable product reviews. Frankly, I even sorta like getting targeted ads!<p>In contrast, Comcast keeps sneakily raising my bill, charging me BS fees they don&#x27;t disclose ahead of time, locking me into punitive contracts, providing mediocre service—and I literally can&#x27;t do a damn thing because they are the ONLY service provider in my area.<p>As for universities, they demanded that I take out hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to pay their insane tuition bills. They would in fact prevent me from registering for classes and would even withhold my diploma if I was even a little late paying their bills!. They employed these draconian tactics despite having endowments in the billions and receiving many hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants each year. And, these universities received all their money up front and pawned off any repayment risk to the Government or private lenders... And despite asking me to mortgage my future to pay their bills, they now have the outrageous gall to send me letters almost weekly asking for more even donations. And, very conveniently for somebody, educational debt is non-dischargeable in bankruptcy.<p>That&#x27;s my longwinded way of asking: who the hell decided that regulating big tech is America&#x27;s most pressing issue right now? I have nothing but goodwill toward big tech.<p>Meanwhile, I don&#x27;t hear any politicians saying a anything about Comcast (in fact, I see many Comcast execs throwing fundraisers for Joe Biden), and all hear about universities from many Congresspeople is how we need to increase their funding and make sure more students can pay their insane tuition bills—not actually reigning in those bills.<p>Something seems... off.')
