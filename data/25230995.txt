Item(by='_april', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1606499961, title='Apple DNS Resolver coming soon?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Just noticed &quot;resolver-a.dns.apple.com&quot; and &quot;resolver-b.dns.apple.com&quot; - 17.7.7.7 and 17.8.8.8.<p>Neither responds to DNS queries, but they respond to ICMP by the nearest Apple PoP. Would make some nice competition to the other resolvers currently available.')
