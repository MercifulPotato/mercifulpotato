Nothing to be done about it, except education. But let&#x27;s say some users want of an open source program to integrate some graphs somewhere. They go to a social media and they ask the users. &quot;How many find useful these graphs?&quot; The users hit like to the feature, and they immediately transfer a small value to the owners of the project. In case the sum of all the values of all the users is enough, the owners of the project may go forward, accept the funds and allocate resources to implement this feature.')
