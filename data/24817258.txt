Instead it turned into dictatorship, tyranny and mass murder. And you can not say that Germany at the time was  not rational and not educated populace. It was a Physics mecca of the world with people like Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr√∂dinger and Albert Einstein.<p>My point is education does not equal to rationality, and democracy is not good but it is the best system we had so far.')
