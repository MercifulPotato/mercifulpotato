Searching for something like &quot;Rust vs&quot; is a good way to find things similar to &quot;Rust&quot;. Without &quot;vs&quot;, I could still search for something like &quot;similar to Rust&quot; or &quot;Rust alternatives&quot; or &quot;like Rust&quot;, but there would be a lot more variety with how questions and articles are phrased and more false positives when including terms such as &quot;like&quot; and &quot;similar&quot;<p>On the flip side, it&#x27;s really unfortunate to have entities with generic names such as the email service &quot;Hey&quot; or the Mac clipboard application &quot;Paste&quot; since searching for those terms would produce lots of results not specific to those entities. I imagine this is pretty common in lots of languages, though it also seems possible that in some traditions it&#x27;s unconventional to have something named with any arbitrary word.<p>For those of you who search in other languages, what have you found to be benefits and pitfalls of the language for the purposes of searching?')
