What evidence would you expect to see and where have you looked?<p>&gt; I have see a lot of people on HN make vague statements along the lines of &quot;there are things that suggest that some shady things may have taken place&quot;. Every one of these statements was unsourced, and carried a general subtext that any claim of fraud automatically deserved attention and belief, no matter how little evidence was provided, and that the burden on proof should lie on people refuting these claims.<p>Why didn&#x27;t they just link to [0]?<p>&gt; The burden of proof is on you for making extraordinary claims. The claims of widespread fraud should require extraordinary evidence as well, and there really hasn&#x27;t been any.<p>Well I think its extraordinary to claim (without evidence) that an adversarial process with high stakes and poor process controls was not corrupted.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apelbaum.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-georgia-ballot-underground-railroad&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apelbaum.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-georgia-ballot...</a>')
