For example a simple accelerometer attached to the center of a lamp shade might create an intelligible signal, but one attached to a heavy table might not. Remember, AI can build speech from a very noisy signal, however.<p>To pick up a better signal you need either a large flat or concave object (like even a computer case), or else something small and flimsy. You may know that even shining a laser pointer at the window of a building can pick up sound from a mile away simply by using a telescope to capture video of it and then let video processing detect the miniscule jostle in position due to the vibrating window. That trick has been used for decades, and works well.<p>But yes <i>recording</i> stuff secretly from an electrical device means you need either computer microcode or software secretly onboard that is recording signal variations that emerge from these physical vibrations, but there is almost no way, even after full disassembly, that even an electronics expert can necessarily detect this setup.')
