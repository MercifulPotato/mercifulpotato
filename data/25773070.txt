Lots of the methods are just like in these examples, only with looping&#x2F;multiple nodes. Example:<p>$(el).addClass(className);\nvs\nel.classList.add(className);<p>Do not work the same. jQuery (and Umbrella JS) deal with multiple elements and with multiple class names in multiple formats (as a string, as arguments, etc). That&#x27;s why I find myself still using Umbrella JS from time to time in smaller non-React projects! Just makes everything a lot easier, for 3kb.')
