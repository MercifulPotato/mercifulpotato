Maybe when I was younger Id make that mistake but luckily never bought expensive clothes in label only. If I had the money to throw around I’d have probably fallen into that trap.<p>But Im having more and more difficulty finding that real good classic shor that is well made and is maintainable&#x2F;fixable and which is a good fit and could be happy with for a couple of years. I live in NYC and the market here is innundated in low quality crap. Even an expensive brand such as Prada doesn’t have well made shoes, they’re made to not last very long')
