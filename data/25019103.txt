I guess I was born in a time (early 80s) where populism was on an all time low. However, the Cold War did exist, and that caused FUD as well (though that term partly unfairly de-legitimizes the realistic fear). So populism, it has been on the rise ever since I became an adult. I wasn&#x27;t around yet, but what I believe happened was Reagan. War on Drugs. Reaction to the counter-culture, by marginalizing these minorities. If you remember Adam Curtis&#x27; series The Power Of Nightmares, already a new threat was on the verge when the Cold War was over. And that threat was exploited on for greed and profit, at the expense of the common men and common women (the soldiers).')
