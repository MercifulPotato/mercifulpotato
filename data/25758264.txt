Taken alone, we can&#x27;t draw any conclusion from a single person claiming an observation of a UFO.<p>Statistically, however, there needs to be a convincing psychiatric study that people with no history of mental illness and &quot;good moral standing&quot; in the community can have a single hallucinatory event, often with multiple witnesses and specific details common across different sightings, to discount these observers as crazy, like so many here do. What is the mechanism? Our society is mostly based on witness testimony and trust, at the end of the day (we are coming back full circle with the advent of deepfakes).<p>I&#x27;m not talking about seeing a dot of light moving strangely in the distance or something seen for only two seconds. Skeptical people rightly point out that those typically have a prosaic explanation, and often not a very exceptional one.<p>I&#x27;m referring to the &quot;close encounters&quot; in which the witness(es) couldn&#x27;t possibly mistake the giant black triangle silent floating 50 feet over a car with dozens of witnesses. Or the ranchers who check on the strongest bull in their herd one day, and the next find it precisely mutilated about a field, along with a dozen others, with no blood to be found. Or the entire schools full of children reporting metal objects landing with beings coming out to communicate with them telepathically.<p>I do not doubt that some of them are crazy, but all of them? With what mental illness?')
