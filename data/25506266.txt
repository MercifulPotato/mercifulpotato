Caster Semenya [has] high natural testosterone</i><p>Caster Semenya has XY chromosomes and internal testes. Semenya has &quot;high natural testosterone&quot; as a result of having male anatomy and hormones. The specific regulation Semenya has been fighting is explicitly &quot;limited to athletes with ’46 XY DSD’ – i.e. conditions where the affected individual has XY chromosomes.&quot;<p>The idea that testosterone confers physical advantages of strength&#x2F;speed is not &quot;vague biological determinism&quot; it&#x27;s one of the most basic facts of our existence. It the primary reason sex-segregated sports exist in the first place.<p>&quot;To say that an XY human can’t compete in the women’s category of professional sports unless they lower their testosterone below 5 nmol&#x2F;L — a figure that is still 7.5 times the value of the average woman competing at the 2011 and 2013 track and field World Championships and a figure that not a single healthy woman born with XX chromosomes, ovaries, and producing estrogen at puberty can reach — isn’t a huge human rights travesty. It’s a protection of women’s sports.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letsrun.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;what-no-one-is-telling-you-about-caster-semenya-she-has-xy-chromosomes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.letsrun.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;what-no-one-is-telling-...</a>')
