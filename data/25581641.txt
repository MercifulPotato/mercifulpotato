And, as a &quot;rationalist&quot;, it&#x27;s been my observation that it&#x27;s the progressive that indulge in this kind of behaviour. The so-called &quot;cancel culture&quot;.<p>&gt; Scientific work should be judged on the basis of scientific merit<p>Sure, but obvious comment is obvious. Why bring it up?<p>&gt; No individual should suffer harassment or attack based on their personal or political views, religion, nationality, race, gender, or sexual orientation.<p>Oh, here we go. The statement, whilst logical and indisputable enough in its expression, betrays a pushing of a Progressive agenda.<p>&gt; Scientific discourse should be based on mutual respect<p>Sure dude, whatever. Do you really need to write that in a letter? And why the ACM in particular?<p>&gt; In short, challenging and debating ideas is always acceptable and ought to be encouraged.<p>Imagine going up to Isaac Newton and saying this. I imagine he&#x27;d give you a puzzled look as if you were slightly backwards.<p>Are the signatories rationalists, or progressives? It&#x27;s difficult to tell. My suspicion is that although it is rationalist on its surface, it is covertly progressive.<p>Progressivism: always pushing an agenda covertly, never speaking in plain words.<p>That&#x27;s my take, anyway. I don&#x27;t have much karma to burn.')
