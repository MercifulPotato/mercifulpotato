That&#x27;s a real red flag, and it would make sense that others would see that and refuse to talk to us.<p>Tangentially, we put almost no effort into interspecies communication. It&#x27;s asinine to be constantly searching for intelligence when we can&#x27;t even figure out how to communicate with cetaceans. By now we should have a full functioning networked dolphin-computer interface and dolphin web forums and interspecies instant messenger. But NOOOOOOO, we&#x27;re all too busy literally shouting at the sky.')
