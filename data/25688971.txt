Here&#x27;s my argument: having this stuff out in the open does have benefits.<p>Most people lurk. Lurking these sites has a lot of benefits despite the risk of being drawn into radicalization:<p>- It allows you to truly understand the motives of these kinds of people, and predict what they will do.<p>- Understanding these motives allows you to address root causes that lead to this extremism. For every radical who storms the capitol, there are a thousand people who have slightly watered down but directionally parallel beliefs. This is good to understand so you can contribute to finding solutions to any justifiable grievances motivating their higher order beliefs (some won&#x27;t be justified, some will), to help pull them in the other direction.<p>- Seeing this stuff full-on and not heard about through second hand accounts demystifies it. There are people like yourself who look at this, get a sense of revulsion from it, and then that both hardens their mind away from it and also motivates them to counteract it when they see people in their own lives starting to echo similar sentiments. If you don&#x27;t truly grok the mental models these people have, you lack the prerequisites needed to disarm any version of them in the minds of people you care about. This isn&#x27;t a sure thing, but anyone who doesn&#x27;t will have no effect.')
