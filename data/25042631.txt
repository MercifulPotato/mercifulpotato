At the same time, there&#x27;s an assumption (that I agree with) that personal attention from a good teacher is a major contributor to the education of a typical student. So What if we removed that constraint?<p>Let&#x27;s then assume that we had unlimited funds, and could hire the best possible educational expert on a subject, perhaps the one who is best suited to write the textbook and lesson plans, to instead teach a single student directly, without any time or resource limits. What would the ideal course of study look like then?<p>Expanding upon this, here&#x27;s my proposed research question: &quot;If a curious, capable and motivated student has unlimited access to a kind, knowledgeable and motivated teacher, how should the relationship between the be structured to optimize the educational benefit?&quot;.<p>In particular, I&#x27;m interested in time allocation - how much time should the student spend studying per day? How much of that time should be spent with the teacher, how much on their own, how much with peers (with or without the teacher)? How much of the time with the teacher should be spent on the student listening to &#x2F; watching the instructor, how much of that should be spent on the student asking questions, how much on the instructor watching the student tackle tasks and providing limited guidance? To what extent should the education be directed by the teacher, and to what extent by the student? And is there any framework that would guide both sides in this endeavor?<p>Are any of you familiar with studies on this and could perhaps direct me to some reading material? Any relevant research, or if possible, a suitable theoretical framework, or even just some good search keywords regarding this would be highly appreciated.')
