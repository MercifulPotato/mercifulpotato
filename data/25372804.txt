Sure we see fines, but what happens to the money from the fines!  Do they go to the users impacted - nope.  Do changes happen as a result - slowly if at all.  It&#x27;s all kinda like some form of taxation upon the user&#x2F;people as we all know any large fine upon a corporation - who ends up paying for it...the users&#x2F;people..again.')
