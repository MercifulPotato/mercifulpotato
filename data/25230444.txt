My partner is on a cap-exempt H1B (academia) and is a citizen of a European country. She has her work authorization, but the visa in her passport is expired, and to my understanding she needs that to re-enter the U.S. should she leave the country. As you know, visas are not being issued until at least Dec. 31st by presidential proclamation. After that, it seems consulates have a huge backlog of visas to issue, so assuming the proclamation is not extended, it seems the time-limiting step will be getting an appointment. It is our understanding that until then, she cannot leave the country without risking her employment, as she may be unable to return to the U.S. for six months or more (which violates the conditions of the H1B).<p>I have two questions:<p>1. Is our information correct? We have found conflicting information from &quot;official&quot; sources (universities, lawyers, ...)<p>2. I understand the desire to prevent abuse of the H1B system. Is there some way in which these travel restrictions on active H1B holders prevents abuse? We&#x27;re both very frustrated, but the worst part of not being able to see family is that there seems to be no logical reason for it.<p>Thanks in advance.')
