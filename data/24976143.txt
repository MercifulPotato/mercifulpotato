Carmack didn&#x27;t mess around optimizing things for no reason, he was (and is) pretty focused on spending time (coder and CPU) where it will do most good.<p>Also, a &quot;mere&quot; 1% speedup seems trivial for most general coding but squeezing 1% out of optimized game code is like blood from a stone. Add a bunch of similar tricks together and you can see 10-20% overall improvement which is huge.')
