So when the manager asks, hey do this in 70% of the time, you have reference to live recent data that it’s impossible.<p>Or even simpler.\nManager asks to finish something and have it live in Y \ndays.<p>You will finish it in Y days because the last project needed an additonal 3 days and you communicated that immediately back then, so your manager already has provided a solution by the time you’re ready for the next development cycle or sprint. Hence Y days should be computed with feedback you already communicated from the last cycle.<p>&gt;&gt; You have to educate your managers a bit.<p>Ironically, this could come off as feudal since a manager is “senior” in terms of time and experience at the same company. In which you are currently a junior. How often will a manager be like “so glad you educated me on my own delivery and timelines, you were right!” Versus hey, that’s my job, you worry about yours and I got mine.<p>I think the word “synchronize” (delivery times for production, ie) applies better than educate.<p>Why worry about educating them if you’ve set a self-expectation to communicate immediately when something is not as expected. Or as initially agreed between the employee and their team or manager (s).<p>Majority of these empathy gaps b&#x2F;w managers and engineers is actually the byproduct of failed communication protocols that both parties can maximize upon assuming consistent internet service (unfortunately still not the case or available with examples of significant gains. The moment you start caring about how another feels or thinks towards your execution, work, or biz strategy, gg.<p>You are now thinking about what others are thinking, and planning all these scenarios to ensure you act accordingly + optimally. This whole hr analogy shouldn’t even exist - it reminds me or read receipts on iMessage. Back in the old day, you didn’t have the information of when someone actually opened your mail indoors.<p>All I’m saying is to forget about the hierarchy + roles and just crisp clean communication  up front.<p>Any gaps in understanding means that you needed to communicate much clearer, earlier. Versus, omg hr might be out to get me or something.')
