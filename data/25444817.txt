Smartparens, rainbow parens, easy eval of forms (+ pprinting, macroexpand, inline replace etc), jump to definition, for Clojure - contextual awareness of the namespace and REPL session you&#x27;re in. Probably forgetting a number of things. Without these there wouldn&#x27;t be much for me left to like about programming in a Lisp. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, learning to use the editor well is as important as learning the language itself.<p>I only know Emacs well. Checked out VS code for Clojure a while ago and it wasn&#x27;t even close. Clojure IDE &quot;Cursive&quot; is supposed to be good, but never tried and not sure if you want to invest time in an ad hoc IDE. It seems to me lispers don&#x27;t want to discourage people by recommending Emacs, but at the end of the day, most people who stick with it tend to be Emacs users.')
