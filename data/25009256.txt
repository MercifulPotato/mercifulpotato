Every single time we&#x27;ve done it in the past, we heard weird comments here, on Reddit and Twitter that our theory would never work because the implementation was not there yet.<p>There were also unfortunate professional choices I don&#x27;t want to comment on, which forbade me to work on Pijul other than sometimes on the weekends. I ended up resigning in July 2020, and have worked on the new Pijul more or less 100% since then.')
