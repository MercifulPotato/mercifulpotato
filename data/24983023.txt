When I publish my Actions, I publish them at `v1.2.3`, `v1.2`, and `v1`. Since Action authors using the `@actions&#x2F;core` API had to update them on 1 Oct, users consuming a `@v1` release tag across their hundreds of repos&#x2F;Workflows don&#x27;t need to make any YAML changes at all to get the updated Actions.')
