We failed to contain spread and are paying the economic price now for that earlier politicization because we have so much community spread that control is much harder now than it would have been. You should be directing your anger at the people who refused to take basic safety precautions or operate their businesses safely and ensured that we would have no option which isn’t expensive and painful.')
