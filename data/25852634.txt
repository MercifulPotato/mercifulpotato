Item(by='progman32', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611180490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25842769, text='&gt; I imagine that this isn&#x27;t the norm, though.<p>Agree. This is an anecdote to frame my point, not a statistical claim.<p>&gt; How much do hospitals cost where you live?<p>Unjustifiably, prohibitively expensive. They were asking for money specifically to go to the hospital.<p>&gt; What were they going to do with the others?<p>Not immediately tossing the clothes into the dirt in front of my friend, for one. My friend spent time sorting and folding the clothes before coming back outside to the homeless man waiting on the porch. My point is this doesn&#x27;t really change the ethics.<p>&gt; Why is this the fault of the homeless person?\nIt isn&#x27;t, and I did not intend to have my post interpreted in this way.<p>All that is beside my point presented at the end of my post, which was elided from your response.<p>Let me restate my position. If I give a dollar to a homeless person, they may blow it on destructive behavior. Or maybe they led me to falsely believe they needed the help. Point is, that does not excuse <i>not helping at all</i>.')
