Not needing speaker wire adds to that convenience: you can then stick a speaker in the garage or the bathroom in the future without laying more wire, as long as you have an outlet.<p>Of course, all of this isn&#x27;t exclusive to Sonos, but from what I understand none of the copycat competitors have matched their ease of use so far.')
