Item(by='hudsonjr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609793650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632769, text='&gt; Democratic Decision Making\nI&#x27;d question whether it&#x27;s wanting &quot;democratic&quot; decision making or if the group wants a great role in decision making, perhaps beyond that which it&#x27;s numbers justify. I say this as I work at a place where topics for all-hands could be submitted and voted on. This seemed to work well until a topic was submitted and the downvote to upvote ratio was &quot;disappointing&quot; to the person&#x2F;group that submitted. After this meeting, only upvotes were allowed on submissions.')
