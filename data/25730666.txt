Some entrepreneurs will feel the same.  And some would also be looking for providers other than AWS if they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> hold Parler to the letter of their TOS in this case.<p>It is also true that AWS and all network providers exist within a societal context where the speech and actions of the participants can result in consequences.   Where the line is drawn and why is a never ending tension.  Very, <i>very</i> rarely is the extreme moral position universally true IMHO -- there is possibly content you would like kicked of AWS, and there will be poeple who can defend <i>anything</i> in the name of free speech.  Good luck with the SAAS, and may your customers not be scoundrels!')
