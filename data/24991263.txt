Obamacare is the recent, big one that comes to mind. The crazy thing is that the &quot;charitable&quot; parts were part of it back in 1991, when it was considered a right-wing proposal, but the Overton window moved so far to the right that today&#x27;s right wing called them socialism and kicked them out the door.<p>Goverment funding has been chopped for state schools, housing projects, the list goes on. The right kills social programs on a practically daily basis. Not to mention shifting the tax burden away from the upper class and towards the middle class. If your taxes have been going up over the last 30 years, it&#x27;s because you aren&#x27;t upper class.<p>And yeah, social spending has increased ever since we shipped all the jobs to China. Democrats rationalized it by promising to use the new revenue on social programs; Republicans put a stop to that straight away. The American middle class got double-teamed. Privatize the gains, socialize the losses!')
