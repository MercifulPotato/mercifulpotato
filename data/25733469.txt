After all, they&#x27;re all on Facebook and all use it.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get to request it, because I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s going to fail, especially with my parents and other from this age group - having them download another app, signup, etc. will be too complicated.<p>My family group is all iphone users, so I thought about moving this to iMessage, which feels more possible, but again, I&#x27;m not even sure my parents understand the difference between whatsapp and iMessage, as they send me messages on both platform without much logic.<p>Like everything else &quot;bad&quot; that happens to Facebook, this event won&#x27;t change much and impact on whatsapp will, unfortunately, not change anything.<p>Remember when corporates stopped advertising on Facebook? They&#x27;re all back.')
