I&#x27;ve still got MP3s obtained via Napster and its ilk back in the day.  The quality on many of them is below current standards, so I&#x27;ve been trying to upgrade to higher quality sources over the years.  I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;ve got about a 20-25% success rate in being able to actually purchase that content legitimately.  I could probably up that by 10-20% by going with overseas vendors, but I suspect most of those are bootlegged anyway.')
