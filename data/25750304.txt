I don&#x27;t think anyone will disagree with that assessment. They let Trump violate the TOS for 4 years.<p>They are perfectly within their rights as a private business to make those exceptions. Is it fair? No. Would we much rather they apply things consistently? Yes.<p>The question is, do we want to enforce who and what they can and cannot allow on their platform via law, or do we want private businesses to control who they are allowed to do business with?')
