Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604966292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25038734, text='As someone who both blogs and does freelance writing through a service, I have written articles describing Amazon products. I don&#x27;t think I have ever written a &quot;fake review.&quot; I think what I&#x27;ve done has fallen on the ethical side of that line, but I know there are writers who will write fake reviews <i>because it pays</i> and writing is a hard way to make a living.<p>If you object to this kind of thing going on, let me again remind people that there are creatives -- like me -- trying to fund their work with tips, Patreon and similar and not making enough money. Over the years when I have complained that I don&#x27;t make enough money even though my articles have a track record of hitting the front page of HN, I have repeatedly been told &quot;Get a real job, you whiner. Quit expecting writing to pay. It doesn&#x27;t pay.&quot;<p>Sure it does. But most of what pays is stuff that routinely hits the front page of HN as &quot;undesirable&quot; in some fashion: Fake reviews, sketchy content marketing where the piece is intended to sell you something rather than actually inform you, etc.<p>If that&#x27;s not the internet you want, let me suggest you make an effort to support independent creatives.<p>I&#x27;m too poor to give money via Patreon to other creatives, but I run r&#x2F;ClothingStartups so indie clothing brands have a venue for advertising their stuff for free and trying to connect with others and figure out how to develop their business. So I do what I can to help small-time operators succeed online because the years I spent homeless while being told to STFU about my whiny crap of not having enough income while tens of thousands of people read my writing drilled it into me that &quot;This is one of the things wrong with the world and this is something we desperately need to work on in earnest.&quot;')
