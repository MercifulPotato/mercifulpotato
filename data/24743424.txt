Item(by='jjeaff', descendants=None, kids=[24759149], score=None, time=1602384425, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24741932, text='&gt;The likelihood of being infected by a COVID infectious passenger coughing in the seat next to you in a single-aisle airplane (no empty seat between you) is lower than if you sat&#x2F;stood 6 feet apart in your office&#x2F;home&#x2F;shopping center (in both cases masks are worn).<p>Color me sceptical. Are we comparing standing face to face with a coughing person 6 feet apart for 3 hours to a person sitting next you on a plane? Because I can guarantee you no one is standing face to face while they cough at you in the office for any significant length of time.<p>I&#x27;ll need to see more detail about their methodology. Also, it will need to come from someone who is not the International Air Transport Association, a trade and lobbying group for the airlines.')
