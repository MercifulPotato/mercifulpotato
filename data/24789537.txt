There are people on our team who have been working in less than ideal circumstances at home for more than six months now, and who are really struggling as a result.<p>Even if people do have a good space to work, if partners are working at home together there&#x27;s often only enough room for one of them to use that good space at a time. Again, not ideal.<p>My priority at the moment is securing some office space so that people have some respite from the endless grind of working at home under these circumstances.')
