It&#x27;s even worse.<p>I&#x27;ve been running Docker on Windows since Windows 10 17.09 or roughly the time WSL 1 came around. That&#x27;s since October 2017.<p>It&#x27;s been really fast and stable here and now with WSL 2 it&#x27;s even better.<p>There hasn&#x27;t been a single Flask, Rails, Phoenix or Webpack related project I&#x27;ve developed in the last 3+ years where I felt like Docker was slowing me down[0]. I&#x27;m using a desktop workstation with parts from 2014 too (i5 3.2ghz, 16gb of memory and a 1st gen SSD). About a month ago I made a video showing what the dev experience is like with this hardware while using Docker[1].<p>Code changes happen nearly instantly, live reloading works and even Webpack happily compiles down 100s of KBs of CSS and JS in ~200ms (which could further be improved by using Webpack cache).<p>[0]: The only exception to this is invalidating cached Docker layers when you install new dependencies. This experience kind of sucks, but fortunately this doesn&#x27;t happen often since most changes are related to code changes not dependency changes.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;for-the-time-being-16gb-of-ram-for-web-development-works-really-well" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;for-the-time-being-16gb-of-ra...</a>')
