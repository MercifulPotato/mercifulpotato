Also, to your proposal to manage the process, they clearly don&#x27;t trust you after your company tried that trademark BS. So from their point of view anything you&#x27;re involved with would actually require even more of their attention due to potential legal liability.<p>So it&#x27;s not about not being a main member but rather about being basically seen as a bad actor to the community. Actions have consequences and the consequence for the trademark BS is being seen as an enemy of the community. The way to resolve that is to not annoy them about things while being as helpful as possible. Your comments on Github definitely are not that (they&#x27;re adversarial, clearly annoy them with something they don&#x27;t want to deal with, etc.) which simply cements their view of you being a bad actor.<p>edit: Your attitude is one I&#x27;ve seen before and it works in getting things from people who are forced to deal with you (service workers, employees, government officials, etc.). It does not work for people who can just walk away, block you or blacklist you since they will just do that.')
