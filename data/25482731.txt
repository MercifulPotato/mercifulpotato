Well, better than the victim but ends up passing up many opportunities where others are genuinely ready to help.<p>Abuser &quot;I don&#x27;t bother to help others but I take advantage of them&quot; - becomes obvious very quickly and you are ostracized and hated.<p>Doormat &quot;I help everyone but because I don&#x27;t have healthy boundaries, I end up attracting abusers and victims.&quot; Gross.<p>The &quot;best people&quot; are clear and confident with their boundaries and generous with their time and resources when people are on the right side of the boundary. I see this a lot with truly successful senior managers and businesspeople, for example.<p>Even in politics, when a candidate runs for office, they want to tell stories of &quot;X came to me and needed help and I really took the time to hear them and help them (kindness). Then Y came and they sought to rip us off and I told them to go fuck themselves (boundaries).&quot; We seek that as species, we expect that out of the best among us, and therefore we reward those who operate from this place (and it&#x27;s good for lots of other reasons.)')
