Most of my kudos are around getting questions answered and problems solved, in venues like SO.<p>I tend to avoid using dependencies. When I do use them, I often try to share use cases, and spread the word.<p>The obverse, is that, when I find something to be unsuitable, or bad (in a totally subjective way), I generally don&#x27;t bitch about it. I just leave it alone, and look for something else.<p>I am <i>very</i> hard on myself; but it isn&#x27;t helpful for me to apply that to others.')
