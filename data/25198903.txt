I appreciate that opinions on this matter differ; but I&#x27;ve struggled with these issues for well over a decade, and I still believe that &quot;open sourcing&quot; (which is an action that lies along a continuum) a jailbreak tool is are not ethical (and so am somewhat relieved to hear that this one isn&#x27;t truly open source; though I fear that, given the authors, the parts kept closed source may be serving the wrong goal).')
