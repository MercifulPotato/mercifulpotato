Studies by our group and others have shown that traditional MD is limited to timesteps of about 2 fs due to high-frequency resonance frequencies.1–3 Many biologically relevant motions occur on the microsecond to millisecond range, which is 9 to 12 orders of magnitude greater than the timesteps possible with traditional MD. Further, each step requires a costly force calculation (O(N) to O(N2)). As such, simulating medium-size proteins often requires months of computer time on a large distributed cluster such as Folding@home4,5 to simulate milliseconds of dynamics, while simulating a large protein (e.g. the β-2 Adrenergic Receptor) on biologically-relevant time scales (milliseconds through hours) using a standard desktop computer would take years. Thus, it is not feasible to simulate timescales of biological interest without substantial advances in MD methods.&quot;<p>12 orders of magnitude of difference in time is akin to the difference between causal events happening once per millisecond and those happening once per century.
