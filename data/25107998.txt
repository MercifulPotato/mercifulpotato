If the middle and lower classes could benefit from increasing productivity with reduced consumer prices, and were allowed to build wealth by saving currency instead of having it eroded away and existing hand to mouth, then they&#x27;d have a fighting chance to wield some market power. As it is, they&#x27;re stuck on the rent treadmill that extracts wealth upwards.')
