Item(by='bmn__', descendants=None, kids=[25763286], score=None, time=1610541632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760382, text='&gt; But then they changed it to give no version info<p>This is still the case. Every KDE application has the menu entries <i>Help → About $APPNAME</i> and <i>Help → About KDE</i> which both show the relevant version numbers. I&#x27;m overwhelmingly certain this feature never went away because I am on a rolling distro and upgraded through pretty much all versions and I figure I would have noticed the absence of these menu entries.<p>&gt; then the bug report tool asks up front what version you&#x27;re using<p>That&#x27;s incorrect. The menu entry <i>Help → Report Bug…</i> opens a dialog with version information that has a button <i>Launch Bug Report Wizard</i> which produces a link like e.g. `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.kde.org&#x2F;enter_bug.cgi?format=guided&amp;product=konsole&amp;version=20.12.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.kde.org&#x2F;enter_bug.cgi?format=guided&amp;product=kon...</a>`. Consequently in the bugtracker, the available information is already filled in.<p>----<p>By the way, this post is an example for the bullshit asymmetry principle, and I resent that I had to spend a magnitude more time to correct your misinformation than it took you to produce it. Please be a better netizen.')
