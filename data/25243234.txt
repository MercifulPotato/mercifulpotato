Apps can opt out from the macOS App Store, and this is especially useful if there already is a macOS version. Why? Generally, any macOS version of an app -- even one like Jira which is nearly a straight port of the iOS app -- is 10x better than the iOS version. Running iOS apps on the M1 is a lot rougher around the edges compared to running Intel apps on the M1. I expect Apple will polish up how iOS apps run on macOS in future releases, if they maintain the feature in its current form.')
