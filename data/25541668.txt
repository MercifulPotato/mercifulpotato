In exchange the inventor gets exclusive rights for a limited time.<p>If trade secrets cause knowledge to be held from the public and then ultimately lost that would be worse.<p>Whether that’s still relevant today I don’t know. In cases with massive research R&amp;D like drug discovery they still seem really important.<p>In that case a trade secret wouldn’t be enough to justify up front investment if the drug can be copied and sold as a generic for cheap along side it.')
