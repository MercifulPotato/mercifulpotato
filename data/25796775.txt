I can&#x27;t infect you if I&#x27;m not infected. And a proper valved, sealed, FFP3 mask gives a <i>really</i> high level of protection, while a valveless N95 is moisture-saturated and useless in a matter of hours, and a simple face covering is no protection at all in enclosed spaces, in either direction.')
