Really useful, I can have a setup method that reads config from the environment or wherever, sets up various things and passes them in (you need an SSL context associated to these CAs? Great. And you need one that needs mutual authentication? OK then, here&#x27;s one I made earlier) . Makes testing easier, and makes it obvious where the setup is being done and how this stuff hangs together.<p>But &#x27;full&#x27; IoC with a framework injecting stuff at runtime? Why? This just obfuscates as far as I can tell, and works around the language, making it harder to conceptualise and reason about.<p>(Also yes, I don&#x27;t subscribe to interface-itis).')
