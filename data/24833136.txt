So a centralized forum like Reddit had the advantage of people not needing to be enough of an &lt;interest&gt; fanatic to join &lt;Interest&gt;Forum.com but enough to want to poke around on r&#x2F;&lt;interest&gt; from time to time. So r&#x2F;&lt;interest&gt; is going to have an advantage over the forum.<p>And people also like interactivity and group chats. Group chats weren&#x27;t a thing when I built my slowly dying forum, but they are now. And now I&#x27;m in like 5 group chats. And Discord is just an extension of that desire for interactivity that isn&#x27;t just f5ing a forum. There&#x27;s more to life and human interaction than writing paragraphs to each other on a forum. Something isn&#x27;t lost just because people find other casual ways to interact online.<p>And I don&#x27;t think Discord is as competitive with forums as you think. My forum has a Discord. Yeah, people hang out on it, and now it&#x27;s an essential part of the community. A lot of our casual conversations and friend-making is just shooting the shit which forums are awful at. But now I see my users engaging each other on more and more personal levels and getting to know each other.<p>But as someone who spent a summer of my youth arguing on forums that Xbox &gt; PS2, I don&#x27;t see gaming culture as something that&#x27;s gotten worse. I think it&#x27;s much better now because it went mainstream. When I was growing up, being a &quot;gamer&quot; still had that loser virgin stereotype. Now I see my friend&#x27;s 13yo son in Discord voice chats when I&#x27;m hanging out at their place and you hear a healthy assortment of even women gamers. Seems so so much better than when I was 13yo. Also, 20 years ago my friend and I were voice chatting by strapping our house phone to our head with headbands.<p>There are always things that change for the worse in these kinds of shifts, but it&#x27;s also important to understand the upsides.')
