Changing the behavior of GetTickCount() would be difficult and would likely be less efficient. So, NT can&#x27;t become completely tickless - there needs to be an interrupt to increment that counter.<p>Realistically there will almost always be some thread that wants to wake up then so the recurring interrupt probably doesn&#x27;t cost anything.')
