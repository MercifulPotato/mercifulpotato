Neighbors, friends, and relatives are surprised when we have no newspapers at home (Newspapers are still an in-thing in India).

In-fact, when iOS 14 changed the interface for phone calls, I was dumb-founded few times before I realize the tiny notification like thing on the top is the phone reject&#x2F;accept interface. Anyone can lead a distraction free phone life[1].<p>I disabled almost all forms of notifications a while back and I’m super happy with that decision. My default when adding any new App&#x2F;Program to my toolset is to start by turning off notifications[2].<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;no.phone.wtf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;no.phone.wtf</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brajeshwar.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;missing-step-productivity-activities-stop-notifications&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brajeshwar.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;missing-step-productivity-activi...</a>')
