There is a strong cost&#x2F;benefit outcome favouring this learning.<p>I invest in learning enough about things otherwise that interest me, to decide if I need to deep dive or not. I did a haskell MOOC for this reason (Glasgow Uni) and the outcomes were mixed: I had no opportunity to move this into the first category (directly applicable at work) but I felt very motivated by what I learned about FP and typed languages.<p>I try not to over-invest in anything in this space, learning is hard. I&#x27;m 59. I hope I can continue to learn, and maybe even pick up the pace, but learning is hard, and being made to do courses in stuff I don&#x27;t want to (leadership, presentation skills, new whizz-bang techniques to do old things) costs me brain time I think of now a as a precious asset.')
