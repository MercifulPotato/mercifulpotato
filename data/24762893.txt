It&#x27;s like having a car in the sense that you need to think about where you can put it and take it with you when you leave. If you go out drinking, the bike has to stay home. If you go to the airport, the bike has to stay home. If you take it on the train, you are &#x27;that guy&#x27; taking up three grandmothers worth of standing space with your bike and causing a disruption as people give you zero time of day to deal with maneuvering your bike up and down escalators. If you take it on the bus, everyone on the bus gets pissed that you are making them late for work securing the bike to the front of the bus, and in my city sometimes busses are ambushed at red lights for the bikes mounted in the front so it&#x27;s not a great spot security wise.<p>On the other side, with the bike share, I don&#x27;t care about what happens to the bike after I&#x27;m done with it. Someone could rip it apart for scrap money or throw it into a river for all I care. Me finding another one in working order is trivial, compared to replacing my stolen bicycle. Plus many of them are electric so I can do it in a full suit.')
