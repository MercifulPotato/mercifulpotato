Near the beginning of the game, there is a quest where you and Jackie have to pick up some equipment then fight your way out of the building. On my first attempt, Jackie got stuck in combat because he didn&#x27;t recognize a dead as enemy as being dead, so he wouldn&#x27;t leave the building for me to talk to him and finish the quest.')
