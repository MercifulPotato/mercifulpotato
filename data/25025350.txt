What the OS gives you is a full system and all of its services managed exclusively with the paradigms of the package manager.<p>I do run NixOS on all four of my machines and I got in OS-first package manager second. At first, like the author, I also frequently needed escape hatches like other machines or VMs, but I think if you get into the package manager first you&#x27;re probably less likely to get stuck. Depending on what you want to do you get a lot of the good stuff with much less commitment that way.')
