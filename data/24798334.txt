Total number of jams I&#x27;ve cleared from my personal printers are probably less than 10 in 20+ years.<p>I&#x27;ve cleared much more paper jams from top of the line printers regardless of their build year. Reliability of a business printer is a function of its maintenance quality it seems.<p>My most stubborn printer wouldn&#x27;t feed some papers since they&#x27;re too smooth but, it started to happen after 7 years and its feed rollers were dry and worn down at that time.<p>One of my HP printers started to lose cartridge calibration, made funny noises and gave strange error messages after 6 years. Looks like I&#x27;ve worn down its internals. It was a &quot;disposable&quot; model it seems. I&#x27;ve probably used it three times its expected lifetime.<p>&gt; The only thing that was better about printing in 2000 is that back then printing was more useful<p>It&#x27;s still very useful at a personal scale. I&#x27;ve also cut back my printing to save the trees but, reading articles, academic stuff and a good old technical documentation is vastly better on paper, hands down.')
