However their business interests can be aligned with privacy.<p>Back in the days, Microsoft was evil, and FOSS was good. That&#x27;s what sprouted Facebook and Google. They contribute to FOSS, as does Microsoft. They have proprietary applications (including web applications), as does Microsoft. They&#x27;re into advertising and profiling, as does Microsoft. Microsoft&#x27;s software stack is partly FOSS (e.g. Edge), just like Google&#x27;s (Chrome, Android, ...). I still prefer Unix&#x2F;Linux over Windows but other than that its more of the same these days.<p>I was one of these people who was happy with Windows 10 free upgrade. But thinking back of it, perhaps I&#x27;d rather pay and then keep my privacy (without hassle).<p>The danger is that the poor are indirectly paying for devices and services with their privacy while those who are wealthy are able to afford privacy-friendly Apple. Its already more or less like that. The cost of privacy when it boils to Android devices, and how much profit it yields, isn&#x27;t transparent.')
