We usually do a lot of business via email. So it makes sense to have records. Whereas texting we are just casually having conversations. Most people don&#x27;t use it for business, though I&#x27;m sure some do.<p>I do completely understand archiving specific texts (sorry if this wasn&#x27;t clear in my original statement), but the mass saving is weird to me. It feels akin to having a conversation with my friend and them just pulling out a microphone and recording our conversation. And then when asking why the answer is &quot;for my records&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s my data&quot;. And I&#x27;m accused of being the weird one. I guess I just fundamentally don&#x27;t understand.')
