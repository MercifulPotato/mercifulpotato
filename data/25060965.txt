If anyone is wondering about some of the hoops that need to be jumped through to make it work, here&#x27;s another guide [1].<p>One question in case you or anyone else knows: What&#x27;s the story behind AMD&#x27;s apparent lack of math library development?  Years ago, AMD and ACML as their high-performance BLAS competitor to MKL.  Eventually, it hit end of life and became AOCL [2].  I&#x27;ve not tried it, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine.  That said, Intel has done steady, consistent work on MKL and added a huge amount of really important functionality such as its sparse libraries.  When it works, AMD has also benefited from this work as well, but I&#x27;ve also been surprised that they haven&#x27;t made similar investments.<p>Also, in case anyone is wondering, ARM&#x27;s competing library is called the Arm Performance Libraries.  Not sure how well it works and it&#x27;s only available under a commercial license.  I just went to check and pricing is not immediately available.  All that said, it looks to be dense BLAS&#x2F;LAPACK along with FFT and no sparse.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pugetsystems.com&#x2F;labs&#x2F;hpc&#x2F;How-To-Use-MKL-with-AMD-Ryzen-and-Threadripper-CPU-s-Effectively-for-Python-Numpy-And-Other-Applications-1637&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pugetsystems.com&#x2F;labs&#x2F;hpc&#x2F;How-To-Use-MKL-with-AM...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.amd.com&#x2F;amd-aocl&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.amd.com&#x2F;amd-aocl&#x2F;</a>')
