Nearly all hobbyist RC drone batteries that are have 2 or more cells in series have a big discharge lead with all the cells in series, plus a smaller parallel &quot;balance port&quot; that provides access to each individual cell. Balance ports are used for charging, and can also be used in flight to wirelessly report the voltage of each cell. There are plenty of common (and apparently somewhat reliable) balancing chargers for under $30.<p>A popular $22 balancing charger for hobby RC drones: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hobbyking.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;turnigy-accucel-6-50w-6a-balancer-charger-w-accessories.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hobbyking.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;turnigy-accucel-6-50w-6a-balance...</a><p>A $15 sensor that plugs into the balance port and sends telemetry data about each cell: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alofthobbies.com&#x2F;frsky-sp-flvs-smart-port-lipo-voltage-sensor.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alofthobbies.com&#x2F;frsky-sp-flvs-smart-port-lipo-volta...</a><p>A similar sensor that beeps really loudly when any cell falls to 3.5 volts (these are very popular for people without telemetry systems): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outofdarts.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;lipo-voltage-alarm-1-mini-size-buzzer-only-for-safe-operation-balance-port-connector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outofdarts.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;lipo-voltage-alarm-1-mini-si...</a><p>An article explaining balance ports in RC aircraft batteries: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tjinguytech.com&#x2F;charging-how-tos&#x2F;balance-connectors" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tjinguytech.com&#x2F;charging-how-tos&#x2F;balance-connecto...</a>')
