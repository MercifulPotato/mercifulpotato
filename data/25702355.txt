Simple test: squat all the way down without a weight without lifting your heels and without falling backwards... If you can, your mobility is pretty ok. If you can&#x27;t.. Well, you should fix that.<p>I did the mistake of squatting with poor mobility a while when I first started out, and hurt myself before figuring that out. Took just a few weeks of stretches to fix. Incidentally the same stretches (touching toes or floor, squatting and holding the position without a weight - if you can&#x27;t do it at all start by holding on to something in front of you to keep you from falling) is great if sitting a lot too.')
