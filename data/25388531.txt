Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=[25389459], score=None, time=1607709152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387484, text='&gt; Now emulation I can get behind because when you are completely fed up of the idea you had it&#x27;s easier to dispose of it than getting rid of it on ebay :)<p>Attaboy. I went the other way and realized that I wanted to buy some very modestly priced emulator-on-a-SoC for an old gaming console near and dear to my heart. That gave me the best of both worlds -- form factor and tactility of the real console with cost, speed, battery life of a present day android device. I must say, for a $40 Android device, I use it a lot more than I thought I would.')
