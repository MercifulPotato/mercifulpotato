Once you learn the modes and scales and arpeggios and pentatonics, then you have to learn (gasp!) <i>songs</i> and stuff, then you have to know your genre very well. You can get by with a MIDI transposing Ionian keyboard, but frankly that will look to everyone else like a crutch or enabling device for the less-abled. Unless you can make great music on it, in which case you will be in demand as a player.')
