It&#x27;s something like two xors on a register. If that&#x27;s a byte or two <i>per pointer</i> (ie: it&#x27;s pointer metadata that you&#x27;d have to store anyway, which I assume is the use case) that&#x27;s actually a pretty significant win, and could help reduce cache pressure, thereby buying you back the performance (and then some).<p>Addresses are also XOR&#x27;d all the time with a secret as a mitigation, I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s much of an impact at all.')
