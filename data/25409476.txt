One obvious challenge of going to wider vectors on something like the M1 is that you either pay the cost (area and power) for the capability on the small cores, or you lock threads that use those capabilities to big cores, neither of which is ideal. If you could have 128-bit SVE registers on little and 512-bit on big, it would help with that; but it&#x27;s not clear to me how complex it would be to allow an SVE instruction to be interrupted and restart it on a core with a different vector width. I guess in extremis one could emulate the remainder of the instruction before restart, but eww.)')
