This sounds sensible, pro-active and productive until to work on legacy systems that have been in place probably or organisations that don&#x27;t value any of these activities (you typically don&#x27;t want to stay there but sometimes you just gotta put up with a role until you get a chance to move on).<p>Generally in this scenario your job is to make a change that fulfils the requirements, verify that it works and test it manually, pass it onto QA and move on. Businesses often don&#x27;t care your improvements unless it is a new feature and it will make you look bad because it will take you longer to complete a task than they deem necessary.<p>As for refactoring in this situation. Don&#x27;t. Even making seemly simple changes can it makes it difficult for others to code review it, or could incur breakage (yes there are some systems that are this fragile).')
