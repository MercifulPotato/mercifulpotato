I would argue the inherent economic value of this planet for a human on Earth is null. You cannot and there&#x27;s no realistic time frame in which you would be able to extract value from owning it. And yet you could sell the ownership, lend it, ..., and make money. That doesn&#x27;t give inherent value to the planet, it&#x27;s just speculation.')
