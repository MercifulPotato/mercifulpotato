According to wikipedia the all time record for low temperatures was -1°C, so it&#x27;s usually fine.<p>If the temperature was to drop to below -10°C I&#x27;m not sure what I would do. I&#x27;d try to buy a better heater, but so would half the city so that might be a problem.<p>Madrid tends to have more extreme weather than here though, I suspect because the ocean offers us a certain thermal inertia.')
