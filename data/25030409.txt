Scammers love this. They install the bogus battery, click through the warning, then when they show you you are screwed.<p>Why can&#x27;t apple disable features, like battery life indication, for batteries they haven&#x27;t profiled for the service? This is what makes users trust apple, if your phone says battery life is 80%, you can be pretty sure it is 80%.')
