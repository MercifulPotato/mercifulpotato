This cycle avoids the RHEL issue of a &quot;rolling turd of backport fixes&quot;&#x2F;trying to figure out WTF version you&#x27;re really running for packages, and the Ubuntu issue of not knowing exactly what&#x27;s coming in the next release (users can easily deploy Debian Testing to validate the next version).  Finally, the breadth of Debian&#x27;s packages are outstanding, and Debian&#x27;s backports repo gives you an easy, &quot;blessed&quot; way to use newer package versions without impacting your existing system.')
