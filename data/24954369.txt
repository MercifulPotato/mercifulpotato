Cars WILL kill people with AI or humans driving. AI is not great right now, but it&#x27;s already way better than humans in several situations.<p>Then people get spooked by bugs that the AI brings because they&#x27;re not &quot;normal&quot; accidents, and think it&#x27;s a bad idea to continue to train the AIs.<p>But why? Why is a &quot;beta&quot; AI killing people worse than the normal everyday drunk&#x2F;distracted&#x2F;bored&#x2F;texting human driver?')
