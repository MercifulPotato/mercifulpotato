All of the benchmarks that are saying &quot;the M1 is so much better than my Intel machine at video work&quot; are all taking advantage of hardware video encode &#x2F; decode blocks in the M1 (and unified memory between the GPU and video codecs).<p>Discounting their existence is entirely unfair, as one of the whole points of Apple Silicon is to give Apple the opportunity to put whatever hardware into their computer that accelerates the use cases they envision for their computers. Dedicated hardware is way more power efficient that software implementations.<p>However, what happens if you work in a video codec that Apple didn&#x27;t build in hardware support for? Software video codecs depend heavily on SIMD instructions to be performant.')
