In PHP7, internal functions return null for type mismatches, and in PHP8, they raise a TypeError. This means going back through every case where they call an internal function and wrapping it with a try&#x2F;catch for TypeError, <i>in addition to</i> checking for null. That sounds like a pretty significant workload change.')
