Item(by='baxtr', descendants=None, kids=[25908854], score=None, time=1611605815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907630, text='<i>&gt; Google and Facebook destroy competitors.</i><p>I agree that they both hold onto their monopolies. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because they &quot;destroy competition&quot;. Take Bing for example: it is quite alive. Google just delivers better search results. Yes the results have been deteriorating, but every time I get frustrated with them and try Bing as standard search engine, I switch back after a week. I don&#x27;t like the google monopoly, but their core product is still not being challenging by anything I know of.')
