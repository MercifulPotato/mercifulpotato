What&#x27;s critical, regardless of the solution you use, is to get a runbook of your software.<p>By way of example, my hand-rolled blog has a README file which lists these things in it. Whenever you pick up a new SSG or create your own you should make sure that you have a good plan for at least these things:<p>1. How to start writing a new post. For me, that&#x27;s the script to fill out the template, plus the instructions to run the dev server.<p>2. Frontmatter fields supported. If there&#x27;s too many to list all of them, at least list every one you&#x27;ve used before, since you&#x27;ll probably use those again.<p>3. Tools for writing. For me, that&#x27;s a few scripts to do things like properly import media.<p>4. Publishing. This is a full checklist including &quot;verify mobile&quot;, &quot;verify excerpt on posts page&quot;, &quot;run publish&#x2F;deploy&quot;, &quot;submit to these sites&quot;.<p>One of the reasons your personal SSG feels better than anything is because you know every nook and cranny in it. That feeling will go away after about 6 months, and you&#x27;ll thank yourself for having written good documentation.')
