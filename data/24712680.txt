Workers vote on issues that affect them.<p><i>Tech workers are in so much demand that they don&#x27;t really suffer such a disparity of negotiating power, like workers in other industries.</i><p>Absolutely true, but if demand wasn&#x27;t so high and supply wasn&#x27;t so short, what happens to worker leverage and treatment?<p><i>Many software companies offer equity, which makes employers the shareholders. What&#x27;s good for shareholders is also good for a lot of tech employees.</i><p>Equity compensation is a result of the pressures of a competitive labour market. If companies could get away with not handing out equity, they would. But since the other guys are paying so well, they are forced to up the ante.<p><i>Also, barriers to entry in software are almost 0. If you can&#x27;t get someone to treat you well, you can have your own software company paying your bills in 6 months, or VCs funding your startup.</i><p>An exaggeration. You&#x27;re not getting hired at the big players without a degree and&#x2F;or significant experience. Software engineering != entrepreneurship. The majority of software devs would not be able to pay their own bills after 6 months of working on their own projects. Most projects fail.<p>There is a reason all the big sports leagues are unionized with player associations (also highly skill specialized, limited labour supply pool). They are able to negotiate for 50% of league revenue and establish protections. There are downsides; the highest earners are giving up their ability to earn true market wage (ex: a salary cap creates a wage maximum on an individual). But in general I&#x27;ve never heard a pro athlete say that the union has not given them measurable benefit and otherwise higher long term gain.')
