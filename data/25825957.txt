Maybe not now, but in the future - what we consume isn&#x27;t available to them. Even if you claim the resources we consume aren&#x27;t food to the food species of your choice, due to the law of increasing entropy we definitely shorten the lifetime of whatever comes after us just by existing.<p>Hardcore buddhists for example consider all life equally worthy. No karma bonus for vegans, maybe less than for non-vegetarians who buy only from farms which provide a healthy, livable life to the livestock (or, obviously, for the plants)')
