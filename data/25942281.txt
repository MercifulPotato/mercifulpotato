It limits tight design. PRs are often going to be for things that the user wants but that aren&#x27;t on your design plan. Accepting these PRs causes design creep and leads to code complexity, even if each individual PR is written well.<p>2. It takes time to review PRs. People submit all sorts of code of various quality. Doing several rounds of reviews to get a PR up to snuff (or decide to reject it) takes time out of your day. If your team is small, this is a major cost.<p>3. It can set the wrong expectations. People get mad when their PR is rejected. Often <i>really mad</i>. Closing 50% of PRs, even for totally valid reasons, ends up with a nontrivial number of people sending you really terrible emails calling you nasty things.')
