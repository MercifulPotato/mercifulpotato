Item(by='tlamponi', descendants=None, kids=[25181564], score=None, time=1606038224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171539, text='&gt; No, damage control or image management in no way implies a Company or PR department. Any group can engage in these activities. Later you point out, the OP appears to be affiliated with Debian.<p>1. I said it seems he is affiliated, but anybody can nick name himself a variant of &quot;debian developer&quot; in any forum.\n2. It implies that a formal body of the organisation, that can be a single person like the DPL, else it&#x27;s not damage control by Debian like you suggest, but that of a single person - which can hardly be framed as damage control in this case, the blog did clearly refer to Debian as a whole, not a single person.<p>&gt; I am not expecting the OP to solve the problems, but I am suggesting that it would be more constructive to comment [...]<p>That&#x27;s what you say now, but not what you said originally. As said, change needs to come from Debian within, not some HN discussions - talk is cheap.<p>Thanks for the constructive down vote, though ;-)')
