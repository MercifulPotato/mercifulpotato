Item(by='JacobSuperslav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607417217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338901, text='Niches - We work in some pretty broad major niches like &quot;yoga&quot;. We just identify ones where the players are a few years behind and try to produce better content. My wife&#x27;s main yoga blog is outranking yogajournal.com for many keywords, a major publication with a print magazine and a team of writers. You just need to be really good with SEO and know how to create great content -- and that&#x27;s the really difficult part.<p>There&#x27;s also not a whole lot of places you can learn that from :&#x2F; All the crap SEO gurus are selling is outdated as heck. Also they all sell you shortcuts - because shortcuts are sexy, but the reality is shortcuts don&#x27;t work for marketing&#x2F;content creation. I have literally never seen an SEO course&#x2F;blog that I would approve of... In my case the knowledge came from working at a digital agency, and then building my own sites. The first 2 years were tough.<p>The turnkey sites offer a great .com domain in a niche that I think is good, a special theme created by me that is designed for speed&#x2F;caching and displaying ads well. The content is just starter&#x2F;filler so the site gets some traction in Google (we age the sites 1+ year before selling them). Unfortunately all sites are currently sold out (fortunately for me, I guess).<p>Ever want to talk&#x2F;brainstorm, and I&#x27;m not looking to charge anything, send me an email to jacob@superslav.com')
