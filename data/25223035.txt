Most protestors had little or nothing to lose or risk anything to be out there.<p>Clearly, the fact that young people don&#x27;t have dignified jobs and nothing to do but sit on social media all day and watch viral videos about obscene police violence is the fuel to the fire in this situation. I&#x27;m not saying police reform doesn&#x27;t deserve a reckoning in the US, but there&#x27;s definitely a correlation in internet use and protests.')
