The three week yoga retreat that the Beachbody app has is great to learn it without going to a class. I simply repeat the final weekâ€™s flow. It may teach you how to still your mind by using the distraction of body movement to achieve a meditative state. This may allow you to ultimately meditate without the need for yoga. In other words, this may be a path for you to be alone with your mind without needing distraction. Best of luck.')
