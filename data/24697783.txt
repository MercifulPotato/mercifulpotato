As long as what you&#x27;re building is some sort of actual website and not a derivative component library<p>The license itself doesn&#x27;t seem to have clear relicensing&#x2F;sublicensing terms, so it&#x27;s not clear at all how it works for either open source or proprietary products.  If it actually does allow downstream open source licensing, then while it prevents the direct licensee from creating a component library, it doesn&#x27;t prevent a downstream licensee of the open source product from doing so; if it&#x27;s usage restrictions (which on their own would prevent a project from being open source) continue to apply to downstream users, then it cannot be used on open source projects.')
