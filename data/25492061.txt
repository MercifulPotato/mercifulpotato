I got cold sweats. I was afraid I&#x27;d get fired. To this day I&#x27;m so glad my team leader was still at the office at the time. I told him about the blunder, and he asked me about the details. He sat down next to me, and we started working together, exchanging information and getting replacements back up. There was no CloudFormation, so everything was manual.<p>He never accused me in the postmortem, and I still feel so grateful for it. I learned from my mistakes and took action to prevent it from happening again.')
