Large animals can and will jump right out in front of you; more than usual as they&#x27;re not habituated to the dangers of cars.<p>I remember once driving through West Texas on US-90 (the highway, not the interstate) in the evening on a cross-country drive. I don&#x27;t think I passed more than a handful of cars, if that, but after barely missing several antelope despite driving well under the speed limit, I just called it a night and pulled into the next motel I found.<p>It really drove home the point that the dangers aren&#x27;t only the obvious ones. So even on a straight, empty road as flat as Kansas[1] and in broad daylight I would never go so fast. Who knows what might jump out at you, from any which way.<p>[1] I&#x27;ve driven US-50 coast-to-coast. Not much of interest in Kansas other than experiencing exactly how flat it is, particularly the western portion coming down from Colorado.')
