One of my friends used to work at a candy factory, and the difference between freshly made gummy bears and the ones picked at retail (that have been sitting in a warehouse and on shelves for a few months) is very large. One of them is filled to the brim with flavor, while the other one is much less flavorful and drier.<p>They&#x27;re both edible and safe to eat, mind you, but it was much better to get fresh ones. Or not eat candy at all.')
