Though I still prefer C in some ways simply because of its minimalism in the language, while still allowing for the kinds of things you want to be able to do if you wanna push your code to the limits. It is a bit scary sometimes writing in C though and sometimes I get a bit annoyed at how some things work or not work in it. I personally am hoping Zig can soon fill this minimalism trait in langs for me. C will probably always be the standard though and I do think more programmers should learn C better to become better programmers.<p>Rust is a good lang though. I am glad something else is pushing up there for the top spots. And more competition in performance is a good thing.<p>You don&#x27;t always have to pick your sides. I just want to be able to write good code and be happy writing it :)')
