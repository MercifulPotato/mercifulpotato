I’m a brown guy with a beard from a Muslim country and with a Muslim last name. I found my friends’ (sincere) concern about Trump’s campaign rhetoric to be odd, because I didn’t find it alarming myself. (Apparently 30% of Muslims polled did not.) I thought it was distasteful and counterproductive—pissing away a demographic George W. Bush won in 2000–but I felt all the rhetoric on the left about concentration camps was way overblown. I didn’t support Trump for other reasons, but the mere presence of some xenophobes in the party wouldn’t keep me out of it. I care about my safety, but I don’t really care if other people think we should have fewer Muslim immigrants. (Also, being from a Muslim country I know that the security issues aren’t totally manufactured.)<p>So what do you mean by “erase?” Republicans don’t want to put gay people in concentration camps and forcibly re-educate them, just like they don’t want to put Muslims in concentration camps and convert them. Indeed, these days half accept same-sex marriage. But (social) conservatism is by its nature not lifestyle affirming. It has opinions about how people should live their lives, and cares a lot about cultivating that kind of lifestyle in communities. It is very important to conservatives to reinforce social norms to encourage people to conform. If you ask my mom (and like nearly every other Muslim mom in the world), the kind of life you should live means getting an education, getting a good job. getting married, and having 2-3 kids. The Republican base feels the same way, and like my mom believes it is the duty of society to cultivate what they view is a lifestyle that is beneficial to society.<p>Which brings sexual orientation being innate. I’m not sure about the evolution of the science in this issue, but the vast majority of people in 1978 believed that being gay was a choice: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.gallup.com&#x2F;origin&#x2F;gallupinc&#x2F;GallupSpaces&#x2F;Production&#x2F;Cms&#x2F;POLL&#x2F;7pis-3i4okqzmu7cys8qga.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.gallup.com&#x2F;origin&#x2F;gallupinc&#x2F;GallupSpaces&#x2F;Pro...</a>. If you look at the bottom chart in that page, it shows that this believe is almost dispositive for people who think same-sex marriage should not be valid. Very few people who hold that view accept that being gay is purely a matter of genetics. Public awareness of that issue really changed in the 21st century. By 2018, 50% of people accepted it was innate while only 30% believed it was a choice. Republicans lag Democrats on that front, but lots of folks are still ignorant. As of 2018, 36% of Republicans and 61% of Democrats say that being gay is purely a choice. So regardless of party, you’re going to have to deal with a significant number of people who think it’s a choice.<p>Gay Republicans presumably understand this thought process and make their peace with it, or even agree with the general principle even if they disagree about the specific case. Richard Grinnell, for example, Trump’s ambassador to Germany, described his coming out to his very religious family in a recent interview. He explains his nurse sister immediately bringing up the science, and working through the theology himself before working through it with his mom.<p>It’s also worth noting that gay conservatives played an important role in <i>Obergefell.</i> See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;gay-marriage-votes-and-andrew-sullivan-his-landmark-1989-essay-making-a-conservative-case-for-gay-marriage.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slate.com&#x2F;news-and-politics&#x2F;2015&#x2F;06&#x2F;gay-marriage-vot...</a><p>&gt; In 1989, most Americans had never even heard of gay marriage, and certainly couldn’t conceive that it would one day be legalized by popular vote. That year, Andrew Sullivan wrote a landmark essay for the New Republic, “Here Comes the Groom: A (Conservative) Case for Gay Marriage.” Sullivan’s essay is one of the most important magazine articles of recent decades. His argument, which he went on to elaborate in his books Virtually Normal and Same-Sex Marriage and in later essays, is that marriage for gays would “foster social cohesion, emotional security, and economic prudence.” Sullivan’s conservative case would eventually become the intellectual and moral foundation of the campaigns to legalize gay marriage.
