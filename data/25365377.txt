There&#x27;s zero evidence of fraud, and abundant affirmative evidence that the machines accurately and completely counted the ballots that were entered.<p>By all means, continue to have a paper record so we can verify afterwards, but the dominion systems worked very well.<p>Edit: The fact that this question is continuing to be asked, in spite of all of this mountain of easily available affirmative proof, is a shocking indictment of the general public. I wish people took the responsibility which comes with the right to free speech a little more seriously.')
