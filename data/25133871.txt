You can make ARM chips that are just as fast as x86 chips and they will end up consuming roughly the same amount of power during heavy calculations but much less in idle. The fact that ARM is king in idle power consumption isn&#x27;t a surprise. It&#x27;s ARM&#x27;s bread and butter.<p>All the wishful thinking was wrong but that doesn&#x27;t mean ARM is doing badly.')
