They&#x27;re similar in that they&#x27;re both &quot;better Cs&quot; but their targets seem pretty different.<p>&gt; Does everything we write on the internet have to be investor-friendly? Fuck I hope not.<p>I don&#x27;t see it at all reflective about &quot;investor-friendly&quot; but more the existing community around the language. It&#x27;s great that zig&#x27;s is active, but if some of the major community members spend seemingly equal&#x2F;the majorityu of something like a newsletter about a fairly big development release being incredibly negative toward another project while pretending to be respectful, eh.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you have to cater to me, since I&#x27;m a nobody, but this and a few other things about the zig community have made me less interested in spending my limited free time playing with it.')
