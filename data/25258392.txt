Whether it&#x27;s positive or negative, whether it&#x27;s stronger than bias around other tech companies?<p>How are you going to tell apart bias in favour of Apple and just being in favour of Apple?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s easier to prove in some of the positive cases if you notice that people are making demonstrably incorrect favorable statements. But I doubt that you can reliably prove that bias doesn&#x27;t exist.')
