Electric motorcycles at worst.<p>These are very far from that. This LeMond ebike has a 250W motor. Any moderately strong cyclist can put out more than 250W. Very strong riders can do double that.  And the motor assists cut off at 20mph.<p>Even a weak cyclist like me (~180W FTP) can trivially do 20mph on a regular bike if the trail is flat so that&#x27;s hardly a high speed.')
