There are many great features, but the standout ones are probably the persistent data structures (which syntactically act both as data structures and functions) and parallelism&#x2F;concurrency support. It&#x27;s also very natural to do interop with the host platforms (Java<p>Absolutely everything mentioned above in this quote is available in Common Lisp as well by just loading the needed libraries.<p>&gt;Another issue has to do with startup time. The Clojure application bootstrap process is relatively slow, i.e. start-up might take 1 second,<p>&gt;The main issue with Clojure is probably its tight integration with the various host platforms. When you get a stack trace in Clojure&#x2F;ClojureScript, you basically get a Java or JavaScript stack trace, so there is some expectation of familiarity with the host platform.<p>Correct. And there are no such problems in Common Lisp. Except if you want to execute CL in a JVM, in which case the available implementation, ABCL, does take a slow time to start. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great implementation.')
