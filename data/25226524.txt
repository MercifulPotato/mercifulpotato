Item(by='httpsterio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606465013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25226220, text='&gt; This reads to me as “identifies people that should be managed out”<p>That&#x27;s a very pessimistic outlook I think.<p>I work as a consultant for a company with approx 100 employees. Average age of workers is somewhere around 45 and most aren&#x27;t really that good with computers, decent at best.<p>I&#x27;ve handheld their digital security officer when he configures a Zoom webinar. So far, he hasn&#x27;t been sure enough to do it all alone and still asks me to check the settings.<p>This company produces word documents as their core business and if their digital security representative is that bad with computers, you can probably guess the average skill of the rest of the company.<p>Nobody is getting fired though, they still get the job done and management invests in training. I&#x27;m currently helping build their entire IT ecosystem and one key aspect of the tools selected, is that it&#x27;s simple enough to teach to their employees. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll love those metrics as they can actually see the biggest pain points and proactively do something about it.')
