It then secures further loans against that revenue stream in the expectation that my children will be helpless to forfeit even more, and my grandchildren after them.<p>My government is currently desperately trying to paper over this pyramid scheme by importing as many foreigners as possible under the apparent misconception that they will be instant net taxpayers (the opposite is usually true), compounding our economic collapse with a social and cultural collapse as well.<p>I&#x27;m quite sure the average young man here would do better with that cash in his pocket than the government is doing with it. It borders on overtly hostile.<p>In short, there is no money. It&#x27;s gone. If anything, there&#x27;s a moral obligation to avoid contributing.')
