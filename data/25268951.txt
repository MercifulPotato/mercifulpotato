We believe that travel makes us and the world better, and are trying to lower the bar to it. We&#x27;re one of the top-ranked travel planners on web and Android (and rising on iOS), and have grown even during COVID.<p>We’re currently a team of 6, including 4 engineers (counting twin-brother founders Peter and Harry as engineers), a designer, and a growth marketer. Our stack is Typescript with Node.js, React, React Native, and excellent front-end and back-end test coverage. We&#x27;re looking for either an intern who can stay for 6+ months and a full-time engineer.<p>We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places members of the team have traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, allows us to bond with others on our trip! We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in joining us, email me at founders@wanderlog.com or check out our job posting at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wanderlog.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;full-stack-engineer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wanderlog.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;full-stack-engineer&#x2F;</a>')
