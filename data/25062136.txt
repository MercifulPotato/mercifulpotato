It&#x27;s obvious that Arun knows their stuff and is able to communicate it clearly.<p>The sad thing is that Dropbox Product has so heavily dropped the ball that users like myself (from back in 2009) have switched away in droves over the past few years.<p>I understand that Dropbox core functionality wouldn&#x27;t have been enough to multiply the valuation of the company to what investors expected. But it would have been nice to not jam collaboration features into the product and mess up the simple, platform-native UI with it&#x27;s current abomination. I&#x27;d pay $10&#x2F;mo forever if I could get the 2010-esque Dropbox Mac client and sync service back since it&#x27;s way better than anything else (especially iCloud).')
