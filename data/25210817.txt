It&#x27;s the fact that — assuming you&#x27;re a B2B SaaS — when you&#x27;re down, the customers depending on your service are probably down too, since they&#x27;re very likely to also be dependent on the same service that knocked you offline.<p>It&#x27;s like a city-wide power outage, or a flood in a city that&#x27;s in a flood-basin. The city&#x27;s entire economy will &quot;pause.&quot; If you&#x27;re a B2B business affected by the outage&#x2F;flood, you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing sales&#x2F;customers, as your customers won&#x27;t even be <i>trying</i> to make any requests of you, since their capacity to serve requests to <i>their</i> customers is knocked out, and without that, they won&#x27;t be making any requests of <i>you</i>. In fact, as long as <i>they&#x27;re</i> down, they may not even notice that <i>you&#x27;re</i> down!')
