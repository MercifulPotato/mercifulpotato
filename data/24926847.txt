Looks like it has a potential to mess up some CI pipelines.<p>&gt; You are receiving this email because of a policy change to Docker products and services you use. On Monday, November 2, 2020 at 9am Pacific Standard Time, Docker will begin enforcing rate limits on container pulls for Anonymous and Free users. Anonymous (unauthenticated) users will be limited to 100 container image pulls every six hours, and Free (authenticated) users will be limited to 200 container image pulls every six hours, when enforcement is fully implemented. Docker Pro and Team subscribers can pull container images from Docker Hub without restriction, as long as the quantities are not excessive or abusive.<p>&gt; In addition, we are pausing enforcement of the changes to our image-retention policies until mid-2021, when we anticipate incorporating them into usage-based pricing. Two months ago, we announced an update to Docker image-retention policies. As originally stated, this change, which was set to take effect on November 1, 2020, would result in the deletion of images for free Docker account users after six months of inactivity. Todayâ€™s announcement means Docker will not enforce image expiration on November 1, 2020.<p>&gt; For more details, please read the blog post summarizing the changes or review the documentation for rate limits.<p>&gt; Details about Docker subscription levels and differentiators are available on the Docker Pricing Page.<p>&gt; Thank you for using Docker.')
