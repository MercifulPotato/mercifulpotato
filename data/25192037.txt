Item(by='roel_v', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606166267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25191882, text='Oh I&#x27;m sure nobody expects you to write anything up tonight :) After getting along a bit further in the survey, I&#x27;m also interested in how you&#x27;re going to approach the analysis of the responses, more specifically, how you&#x27;re going to separate out the personal preferences of respondents, since I&#x27;ve had a few cases now where the choice was basically &quot;do I find large breasts more attractive than smaller ones&quot; - even if there were some minor other factors at play in the specific images. Anyway, good luck, although I do agree with some other posters that you might get more people to complete the whole thing if you&#x27;d show them fewer images; it takes a long time to get through a full round.')
