No. In fact most of my higher vote comments are lower in substance (because people won&#x27;t read long&#x2F;nuanced posts, they want short black &amp; white answers).<p>But it does irk me slightly when someone will -1 a comment without an explanation&#x2F;response. I don&#x27;t mind an active counter-view (heck, I may learn I was wrong!), it is the silent dismissal I cannot stand (and often seems knee-jerky when you criticize a sacred cow company&#x2F;product).<p>But like all complaints like this, I am a giant hypocrite and have downvoted comments without responding.')
