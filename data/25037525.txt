That is not what I want as a consumer. I want something where I don&#x27;t have to trust the server at all, i.e. everything is E2E encrypted - and if that&#x27;s not true, that&#x27;s not a protocol I want interacting with my personal data.<p>The comparison with email is apt, because no one in their right mind would design email as it is today without E2E encryption baked into the protocol.')
