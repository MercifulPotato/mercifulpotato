I put in a few different sets of science fiction works ranging from Heinlein to Atwood and it returns about half comic books, a significant number of fantasy&#x2F;sci-fi works, and a smatter of other things. Oddly, it includes children&#x27;s books I&#x27;ve read to my kid.<p>My bubble very much includes both <i>Dune</i> and <i>The Far Side</i> and I&#x27;m not certain how these are supposed to be in different bubbles.
