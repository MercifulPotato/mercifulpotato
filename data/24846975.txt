Is there a list of publications?  e.g. New York Times, The Australian, Bangkok Post... ?<p>I understand your data comes from GDELT.  I&#x27;m new to that and all I could glean from visiting the GDELT site at first go was that they have access to a lot of historical data sources - but I couldn&#x27;t see a list of 1000+ current news publications.  Is there a list somewhere?  Are all the sources typographical, or might some be radio&#x2F;tv?  Thank you.')
