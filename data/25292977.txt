Different cultures have different relationships to intoxicants, and they can change over time. Over the last 60 years in America, drunk driving &quot;high-functioning&quot; alcoholism has been denormalized. It&#x27;s still a problem for a lot of people, but there&#x27;s more &quot;loss of face&quot; associated.<p>Looking at the stoners I knew in college, you&#x27;d think that pot was a pretty destructive drug. But now, working with successful professionals who buy dispensary weed on the weekends, it seems like harmless fun. Besides any class stuff going on there, I think that hanging out with people who want to do bong rips and zone out on the couch leads you to a different relationship with THC than having friends who will look down at you if you get too high to hold a conversation.<p>A Peruvian friend told me that their mother served coca leaf tea to the family on a regular basis. It was traditional, it wasn&#x27;t treated any differently than we&#x27;d treat coffee, and it hadn&#x27;t led anyone in her extended family to seek out more refined versions.<p>So how would cocaine legalization look in America? Would coca tea go on the menu at Starbucks? Would people stop there, the same way that lots of folks drink a pot of coffee a day but relatively fewer take caffeine pills? Probably not, that&#x27;s not how we do things here. Without regulation, bodegas would be selling single-serve bumps in little tear-open packages with Scarface on the label. We will sell you as much &quot;here, go destroy your life&quot; as we can.<p>Up to a point, regulation can tamp down the market for cheaper and more powerful intoxicants (like, alcohol prohibition was hopeless but cities can successfully prevent malt liquor and everclear sales if they think that cuts down on alcohol-related deaths) But I think that attempting to shape the culture of consumption around a drug is probably a better long term strategy than full prohibition.')
