It&#x27;s like the difference between gardening as a hobby versus farming as a lifestyle.<p>The amount of hunting needed to control the deer population and the population of able bodied and sufficiently interested hunters simply doesn&#x27;t scale properly in most communities.<p>Predators who hunt as their main purpose and niche in life seems like a more viable solution if we determine how to keep the livestock predation to an acceptable level.')
