Item(by='_ph_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608640115, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496545, text='Not sure what you meant by &quot;toy benchmarks&quot;, but to me this has a very negative connotation. The SBCL compiler excells at complex code and regularly produces much better output than most Lisp compilers. CLOS is a very bad example for judging the compiler quality, because its performance heavily depends on the implementation. To compare compilers, you would have to use the identical underlying CLOS implementation. A bad one can ruin your performance independantly of the compiler used. To make comparisons, one needs benchmarks where the whole code in question is compiled by the different compilers.<p>To my knowledge, SBCL switched to a precise GC some time ago. But I still would expect ACL&#x27;s GC to outperform the SBCL one.')
