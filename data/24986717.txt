No smudging, no bleeding, nada.  It also uses big refillable ink tanks that are <i>way</i> cheaper and longer-lasting than overpriced HP-style disposable cartridges.<p>Now I&#x27;ll admit that from a strict dollars-and-cents perspective, it&#x27;s probably still more expensive per picture than using a photo service, but it&#x27;s <i>way</i> more convenient.  And it does a fine job with B&amp;W printing too.')
