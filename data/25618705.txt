It&#x27;s just common sense humanity.<p>For some folks.  All sorts of different people in the world.<p>My wife needs a plan for every day.  Not to the level of checklists and planning it out in software, but if she has an &quot;open ended&quot; day she doesn&#x27;t do that well mentally and doesn&#x27;t sleep well unless she has a mental model for the day coming up.<p>For me, I&#x27;m the opposite.  I hate scheduled days, but I also know I need a bit of structure for myself otherwise it&#x27;s easy for a long weekend to devolve into napping on the couch and posting to HN.  My entire organization for this is just a simple TO-DO list where I toss a couple objectives of the day down in the AM while drinking my caffeine.  It adds a tiny bit of order to an otherwise unordered personality and helps me move along my personal projects and social life.')
