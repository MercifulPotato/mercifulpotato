I spun up a blog using 11ty and netlify, and it was just as easy as all the blog posts about them say it would be. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better time to try to self-host a blog if you are at all inclined. I&#x27;ve also been excited about Dev.to (although I haven&#x27;t dug too deep into it).<p>* Shameless plug: my blog lives at salem.io, and I&#x27;m more than happy to answer blog-related questions (or any other, honestly) if you&#x27;re interested in starting but need a little push.
