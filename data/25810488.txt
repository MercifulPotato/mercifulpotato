The cprofile module gives a decent first-pass at figuring out bottlenecks, and it&#x27;s sometimes not what you think it is.<p>If I find that the time is spent in one or a handful of functions, and the slow-down still isn&#x27;t obvious, I&#x27;ll then use line_profiler for more fine-grained profiling.<p>There are other profiling tools, but I haven&#x27;t need to use them for many years for my current projects.')
