Item(by='jrk', descendants=None, kids=[25189340], score=None, time=1606152804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189137, text='&gt; The period of growth was a period of massive decline in the price of energy.<p>This is referring to the decades <i>before</i> 1970, not after the oil crisis.<p>&gt; We&#x27;ve since had 50 years of stagnation in energy prices.<p>This is the period of 1970-2020. The price of oil has oscillated (jumping around, as you say) during this period, but the overall price of energy has not had a clear long-term trend.<p>The earlier poster&#x27;s argument is that the stagnation in other metrics (from a period of impressive growth before 1970) may reflect this stagnation in energy prices (from a period of impressive reduction before 1970).')
