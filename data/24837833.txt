It could be as simple as a bit of prose, writing some code, or as involved as a birdhouse. I haven&#x27;t succeeded in creating every day since, but I did successfully create a habit of behavior that I cannot break. I&#x27;ve built games, websites, apps, written blogs, filed patents, built siege engines, been published, painted, carved wooden toys, remodeled houses, and much more. I&#x27;ve also started a couple of companies, one of which went through YCS17 and is still growing.<p>It&#x27;s sad that there exists any cynicism around creation at all. Our ability to create might be the most human of our qualities. We literally make the world we live in.<p>The creations that excite me most are those that enable people to create even more. I really appreciate what PG is saying here, what he believes, and the dream factory that is YC.')
