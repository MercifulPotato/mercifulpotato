Yolu would be without a girl and the money of the ring.<p>That said,the good thing of hitting rock botton is that theres no way, but up. 3 Years ago I was being underpaid, divorced a 6 years marriege, and was sunk in debit.<p>I was really depresed,for the first time of my life I cried waching a movie, and was pretty sure I was in funcional side of alcholism.<p>That said, I keepd it going by solving one problem at time. First, I organized all debites of my company, and made a rigid paying plan.<p>Then I made a deal with my dad, that I would stay at his home for 1 year, while I paid some of the debt my ex wife left me.<p>After that I put my company on hold for 1 and a half year, so I would not generate new taxes while paying the old ones.<p>I found a shit soul sucking job, but with good payment, in the capital. For almost 2 years I would spend 4 to 5 hours in traffic, just to get to this job. But small things helped me going foward.<p>I got close to my friends (before the pandemic). I checked out lots of books from my reading list, while I was in the bus, or train, going and back to work.<p>I basically sold or donated most of my possessions, basically reduced my life to small things that really mattered.<p>The thing is, don&#x27;t try to fix everything wrong at the same time. Focus on small problems that you can solve, and after a while, even the big problems will appear to be less intimidating.<p>Now, finally after 3 sucking years, I reoppened my company, I paid all my  debts. I still got to deal with shit from my ex from time to time, but goddamm I love being free now.<p>Well at least for a while. Now my ex appeared telling me shes pregnant, but shes pretty sure I&#x27;m not the father, but she&#x27;s not 100% sure... well I will deal with that when the time came.')
