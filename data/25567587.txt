The redundant copy is easy to visualize – you literally stored another copy of the block on another disk. Now, if your evil RAM leaves this block alone, ZFS will see that the second copy matches its checksum, and so it will overwrite the first block with the same data it had originally – no data was lost here, just a few wasted disk cycles. OK. But what if your evil RAM flips a bit in the second copy? Since it doesn’t match the checksum either, ZFS doesn’t overwrite anything. It logs an unrecoverable data error for that block, and leaves both copies untouched on disk. No data has been corrupted. A later scrub will attempt to read all copies of that block and validate them just as though the error had never happened, and if this time either copy passes, the error will be cleared and the block will be marked valid again (with any copies that don’t pass validation being overwritten from the one that did).&quot;<p>(dont just read the quote, read the link)<p>Anyway, I am using ZFS since 2007&#x2F;2008 and I have never had any issues (except with those damn Seagate 3tb DeathStar hdds, where I was barely able to replace them fast enough - in 3 months 3 were gone - i will never buy seagate again)<p>Co-creator of ZFS:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;civis&#x2F;viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1235679&amp;p=26303271#p26303271" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;civis&#x2F;viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1235679&amp;p=...</a><p>Anyway, I am having a asus microatx board with 16gb of non ecc ram, additional SAS HBA and 3x3Tb Toshiba into zraid and additional 10TB HGST He3 disks + Ultrium 3000 (LTO-5, they are quite cheap today and are designed for 24&#x2F;7 operation which is barely what I will ever encounter while tapes can be restored on latest LTOs if needed, while you can get cartridges on some sale for peanuts) for backups. There is no way in hell to go for my important data (like images) to disk only and tape is nice. You take the cartridge and store it at parents&#x2F;gf&#x2F;worspace drawer&#x2F;...<p>Anyway if I remembered correctly, google has lost 150k of user accounts in 201x and restored them from tapes. So even for cloud opinionated people, it still makes sense to shovel important data to tapes if you dont use the data in everyday processing (and just an info - even shelved disks die)')
