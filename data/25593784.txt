I think JIRA, like most tools, is as good or bad as you make it.  I&#x27;ve been at numerous companies using JIRA that don&#x27;t seem to have most of the issues referenced here.  The only thing I&#x27;ve ever felt like JIRA really lacked in was in a good UX for embedding code snippets or other technical details into issue comments.  Native support for Markdown in comments would be a good win.<p>I actually like JIRA and Confluence and have generally had good experiences using them in multiple companies.  One of the main things I like is the integration between the two, and Confluence&#x27;s concept of spaces so you can have some things publicly facing and other things private, which allows you to use Confluence documentation as user-facing docs, which references JIRA issues directly for known issues, and can write requirements&#x2F;specs&#x2F;PRDs in Confluence and reference them easily within a JIRA issue.<p>The only real problem JIRA&#x2F;Confluence have is being very very slow.  They&#x27;ve gotten marginally better over the years, but they&#x27;re still terribly slow compared to competing offerings.')
