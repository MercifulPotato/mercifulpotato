One of the greatest function that npm can get you :)<p>I&#x27;m a scala person, so I naturally tend to like promise style (and async&#x2F;await is a nice sugar) but my experience interviewing a lot is that people that were not exposed a lot to callback style don&#x27;t understand what asynchronous means, which is a good enough reason IMO to keep callbacks :) the fact that the std lib is also full of them (we are using node 12, I don&#x27;t know what is the current status, but for now most of the std lib is callback only for us) does not make me want to do the switch at all.')
