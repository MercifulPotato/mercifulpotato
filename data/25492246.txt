At the very least, concentrating on a static imaginary shape activates some kind of drainage system in the brain: for a few minutes you feel what a clogged pipe would feel when it&#x27;s being cleaned by a powerful water stream. That effect alone seems valuable.<p>Regarding the meaning of meditation, my conclusion is that it&#x27;s a whistle. Just like you&#x27;d produce a certain whistle to summon an animal or a bird, you&#x27;d sharply imagine a certain shape or symbol to summon ideas or certain effects. The former is how you get inspiration. &quot;Mysticism&quot; begins when you are able to produce this whistle the right way and when you know which thoughts or symbols to target.<p>The most comprehensive explanation of meditation that&#x27;s available in English is probably lamrim, volume 4 (500 or so pages, described by its author as a brief summary of key concepts from canonical sources that an interested reader should read himself).')
