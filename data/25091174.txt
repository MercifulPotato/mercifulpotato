Itâ€™s arguable that 20 years still provides most of that same motivation and disallows huge corporations to profit off of artists who have been dead for 40+ years. What motivation to new artists does anyone owning the rights to Mickey Mouse do other than enrich people who had no hand in creating it?<p>Shortening copyright would allow DRM to focus on a very small subset of works and allow everyone to use and enjoy older works.<p>Yes, DRM may be arbitrarily placed on anything but if the work can be freely acquired elsewhere without fear of retribution, then no one will seek out the DRM version anyway.')
