When I went on anti-depressants (for pure-o OCD), my intent was to get some breathing room and learn to manage my symptoms better.<p>I&#x27;ve definitely been able to do that, but it&#x27;s lead to a few cases of thinking &#x27;hey, I should be able to stop taking these now&#x27;, which have all gone poorly for me. I think I&#x27;m better able to cope now if I don&#x27;t have access to medication, but I won&#x27;t be stopping again any time soon, it&#x27;s too risky for me.')
