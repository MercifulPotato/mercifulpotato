Trump&#x27;s M.O. was one of denial, ignorance, and stupidity.<p>Now, one might say these don&#x27;t affect me. For example, the separation of children and parents of immigrants does not affect you if you are an American citizen who is allowed to vote, has a job, etc. Neither might climate change affect you as it is, or perhaps not enough yet. What did affect us all, in the world, was COVID-19, and the first wave was especially deathly. The nonchalant response of Trump to that issue was what I expected to be an eye opener to the American voter. And honestly, you don&#x27;t want a president who behaves in such a way to a crisis (also look at how it backfired in Brazil). You want one who addresses the issue, is honest to you, like a gentleman or gentlewoman would.<p>Every Republican who stood up to Trump, I am proud of you. It takes courage to go against the flow of a powerful lunatic, when everyone follows him. The emperor wears no clothes.')
