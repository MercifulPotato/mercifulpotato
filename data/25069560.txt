Because I <i>do</i> believe it&#x27;s true for most things.<p>But then look at open source software, which powers SO MUCH of our society. Much of the most essential software in the world was written for absolutely free. These days there&#x27;s lots of open source that is written for corporate PR, but that wasn&#x27;t always the case.<p>So, just be careful. Products and services really <i>might</i> be labors of love. We need to leave a tiny gap in our cynicism to allow for some goodness to come in. :)')
