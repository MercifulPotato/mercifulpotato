Item(by='hakfoo', descendants=None, kids=[25894080], score=None, time=1611388954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25876865, text='Micro-transactions require micro-products, and those are a hard sell.<p>Compare a tangible market situation:  remember the old Bazooka gum that used to say &quot;3 cents&quot; on each piece?  Few customers are going to walk into a store and buy a single piece, no matter how cheap and frictionless payment is.  At that level, the burden of thinking &quot;I have to actually go and buy it&quot; exceeds both the financial cost and likely the perceived upside of a single bite of gum.  You can successfully sell a handful alongside another transaction, or a bag of them for a dollar, though, because you&#x27;ve raised the stakes of the total transaction high enough that it&#x27;s worth thinking it through.<p>Maybe the classic micropayment story-- the individual news article&#x2F;video view&#x2F;song play-- is a single piece of Bazooka.  Since it&#x27;s likely to be ephemeral and competing with a nearly-as-good free alternative (the same content on an ad-based site), you don&#x27;t have much room to make the case that it&#x27;s worth going through a purchase process.')
