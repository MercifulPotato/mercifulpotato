Increasingly, the low quality of products, the flea market like shopping experience, and concerns about Amazon getting too big&#x2F;powerful have led me to reduce how much I shop there. I was thinking it would be a big challenge to wean myself off Amazon but it has actually been very easy since several competing retailers are reasonably convenient and many companies that manufacture the actual products have easy direct online purchasing options.')
