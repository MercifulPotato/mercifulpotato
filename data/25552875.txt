Recently I&#x27;ve felt so many of these threads have devolved into &quot;these stupid companies using whiteboard hiring are all a bunch of idiots!&quot; that I usually stop commenting.<p>What&#x27;s most illuminating about those kinds of comments is they rarely even try to view thing from the hiring company&#x27;s perspective. Having been in that boat, you&#x27;ll find:<p>1. The cost of a mishire is <i>huge</i>. And, even worse than hiring someone who is downright awful is hiring someone who is just plain mediocre, or slow. I mean, I&#x27;ve hired diligent, hard-working, otherwise smart people who could only get stuff out the door at about a third the rate of other devs. Having a performance discussion with those folks can be extremely difficult, because oftentimes there is little they can realistically do to go faster.<p>2. Experience can have little correlation with proficiency. I&#x27;ve interviewed people who were &quot;senior engineers&quot; and &quot;architects&quot; at major corporation who couldn&#x27;t code FizBuzz, moreover they could barely code a syntactically correct function in their chosen language.<p>3. Many companies <i>want</i> to diversify their employee base by going outside just friends&#x2F;referrals and well known college programs, but to &quot;take a chance&quot; on other folks means they need to get a strong signal during the interview process.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t problems in hiring, but given how there is a giant economic incentive to make hiring as accurate and efficient as possible it&#x27;s at least valuable to attempt to understand why a company might interview the way it does.')
