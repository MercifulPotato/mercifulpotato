But if I were running a government I would be putting all my money into improving air quality and reducing fossil fuel usage etc.<p>Ultimately there are always going to be many factors which are &quot;killing humans&quot; and a limited amount of money to spend to try and &quot;fix things.&quot; By far the biggest &quot;killer&quot; right now is advertising and unhealthy foods so we should be focusing on that if we really care about the health of human beings. In addition, assuming we care about the maximum amount of human lives lengthened, we should be focusing on pollution, climate change, and the environment.<p>In comparison to these issues, worrying about microplastics is fucking meaningless. If you had 10 trillion dollars and wanted to increase the chances of humans becoming extinct, what would you spend it on, seriously? Who gives a fuck if we&#x27;re breathing in toxic fumes all day or the planet is so hot we can barely walk outside?')
