This process is corruptible and eventually you&#x27;ll find that opposing a current government is &#x27;bad&#x27; (this happened in my country in a short span of 15 years). So it turns out that allowing all speech, even &#x27;bad&#x27; is less harmful for society in the long run than trying to suppress some speech.')
