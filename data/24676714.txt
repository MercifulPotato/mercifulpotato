I believe the magnetron shorted and burnt out the power supply. As I was microwaving water for tea, there was a bright white light on the inside of the microwave. Family also described a similar failure around the same time frame of ownership.<p>I enjoyed that microwave before that happened and was thoroughly impressed with the ice cream soften setting.')
