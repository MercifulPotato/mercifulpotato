They might be wise or they might be dumb, but the simple idea expressed in the phrase (regardless of who uttered it, or what they meant at the time) seems wise to me as we consider the tradeoffs between a walled garden vis-a-vis privacy.</i><p>Well, the idea is: never trade essential liberties for temporary safety, you&#x27;ll lose both.<p>To which I answer: safety is always temporary, what&#x27;s an &quot;essential libery&quot; is debatable, and we must voluntarily (and ocassionally involuntarily) give up essential liberties all the time to get the temporary safety and other goodies afforded by society.')
