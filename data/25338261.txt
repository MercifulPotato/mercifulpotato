Their submarine and surface ship captains don&#x27;t know how to navigate, running aground and into other boats. And their aircraft carriers don&#x27;t even have enough crew&#x2F;planes and will deploy US Marine Corp units to meet their full complement. It will likely take the UK 15-20 years for the two new Carriers to be at full operating capability (2009-TBD, probably 2024 at the earliest).<p>That being said, the US could stand to spend less on military funding.')
