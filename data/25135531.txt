We expect people to not break the rules, e.g murder or steal. We don&#x27;t expect people to stop eating meat, polluting the earth, or generally to stop being extremely selfish. If we expected everyone to be moral you and I wouldn&#x27;t be spending money on vacations and buying computer games but on trying to save poor kids in Africa and Bangladesh.')
