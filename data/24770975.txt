Writing constraints was the hard part, hard enough that eventually we gave up on a solver and went back to our terrible home rolled algorithm. That&#x27;s always the case with solvers though.<p>Another hard part was combining chain through time with entities that can be scheduled together vs ones that need gaps. This seems to be a common use case, grouping work where you need a setup&#x2F;teardown gap between entities. Not sure how to improve this but maybe add some kind of built-in support for &quot;entity coloring&quot; on chained variables where you can configure which run together in a chain vs which ones need setup&#x2F;teardown gaps between.<p>Overall Optaplanner is an amazing piece of software though, good work!')
