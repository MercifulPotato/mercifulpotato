Item(by='kmm', descendants=None, kids=[25589102], score=None, time=1609376290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586808, text='It&#x27;s of course just more anecdotal evidence, but in my experience if you dare to mention the possibility of the virus being man-made on Reddit, regardless of the nuance and sources you add, you will get torn to shreds.<p>This is not just me being salty about reactions to my own comments, I&#x27;ve personally never made a comment on the origin of the covid on Reddit, as I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything of value to add yet. It&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve witnessed over and over again.<p>Like the GP of this thread I&#x27;ve never understood why such a relatively harmless claim would be so contentious. I&#x27;ve always assumed it was something political that as a non-American I simply don&#x27;t know the context of. It reminds me of the drama around hydroxychloroquine, where mentioning it on Reddit would get you tarred-and-feathered as a loony Trumpist, even though it seemed like a non-issue to me. Obviously HCQ doesn&#x27;t really work, but believing it does never seemed to deserve such harsh treatment, which I&#x27;m again assuming has roots in a political context I don&#x27;t fully understand.')
