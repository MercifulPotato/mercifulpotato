You can&#x27;t just hand-wave that away.<p>Sorry, I should have elaborated.  It&#x27;s a city state with unusually high levels of both social compliance and government control, population is fairly wealthy and fairly evenly distributed.   So - small population is a very small area simplifies logistics a ton.  Especially ignoring problems related to migrant workers (it&#x27;s own set of problems), most people have both high social support and some financial depth, there is also little to no housing insecurity.<p>It&#x27;s basically unclear if you can successfully scale the Singapore model, nobody has tried.  As against, e.g. , the several universal models that are outperforming the US currently, with more comparable populations etc.')
