School is probably the best public invention to systematically distribute knowledge to the masses. Some like to point out &quot;dropouts&quot;, &quot;self-taught&quot; geniuses or the &quot;lucky few&quot; as models instead of exceptions to the rule.</i><p>NO ITS NOT! This is a lie. There were reports in 1960&#x27;s when the congress asked for an experiment to different ways of teaching. The children taught in a 1 to 1 way performed enormously better compared to the rest. And one of the worst ways was to teach is in mass. When the results came, they buried the report after it wasn&#x27;t in their favor.<p>Schools are only good for above average intelligence people. If you want no one to be left behind then you should teach those who&#x27;re slightly disadvantaged in a dedicated manner in 1 to 1 classes.')
