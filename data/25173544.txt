Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=[25174350, 25173860], score=None, time=1606001615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147919, text='I personally believe that browsers will eventually be forced to turn off CA verification (by default) of local network traffic (reserved IP spaces and the .local TLD) in non-enterprise browsers.<p>Enterprise browsers will no doubt continue to perform CA verification by default, and I expect a preference will be offered to let home users (rare) and enterprise profile management (common) override this to enable&#x2F;disable as needed for whatever custom localnet definition they require.<p>No other solution can work here, as by definition anything in localnet can neither be verified by an external entity nor issued in any trustable or permissible manner that is resilient enough for home users to configure, navigate, and manage on their own.<p>This is a predictable outcome of HTTPS Everywhere, and all major browsers have chosen to not yet deliver this for simple <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatever.local" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatever.local</a> requests, as tested in each of them today. While <i>technically</i> local network traffic might need as <i>urgently</i> need to necessarily be HTTPS to keep users safe in a home scenario, browsers further narrow the list of HTTP-offered features each year, and with the advent of HTTP&#x2F;2 and HTTP&#x2F;3 requiring mandatory TLS, the ancient status quo that&#x27;s being delivered no longer meets the needs of modern networked homes.<p>I encourage the major browsers to step up and define their direction forward in coordination with each other, so that further wreckage is not introduced into the home networking ecosystem. The lack of progress here is indirectly harming users by teaching them that &quot;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> is fine if something says it is&quot;; as is well understood, the judgement of whether to wire-encrypt or not cannot (by default) be entrusted to end users following instructions.<p>If there are existing discussions underway by any of the major browsers, I&#x27;d love an opportunity to learn more about them from links or stories shared in this discussion.')
