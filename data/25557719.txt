Is this true?<p>Depends on the crop&#x2F;cultivar and where and when it is being grown, but I distinctly recall 2019&#x27;s Peach bumper crop in Colorado as I made a peach salad on my station that sold like crazy which was used as a sauteed fruit with our pork chop entree!, too and we still had more come in than we could use And this was sold alongside a melon and heirloom tomato salad that also sold well, but was always constantly running out sooner into service because of the immense surplus of peaches we had that year [0]. Looking deeper into that later in the Fall after we looked over the (record breaking) numbers I looked back at the reasons why which included the weather in the Western Slope: no snap frosts, very little hail and warmer&#x2F;balmier albeit wetter weather in the Summer in Colorado.<p>This was true for almost all stone-fruit that year, too. Whereas the heirloom tomatoes were limited in the early Summer hit a snag because they kept bursting due to the extra rain or had to be grown in lower elevation counties in Boulder, Weld, Ft Collins and in the Southern Counties. This would get better, as one who has farmed&#x2F;gardened would predict, in the later Summer to Fall despite the rain as more plants were planted and were maturing to uptake the water.<p>&gt; I understand that the change in climate will change the established weather patterns that we&#x27;re used to now, and create drought in areas that are currently wet. I don&#x27;t understand why we can&#x27;t adapt to this and move our farms to where the water is.<p>This is my biggest concern (one that I understand well) as our prediction models and the Ag supply chains and distribution models we&#x27;ve created and been reliant on and how fragile they are under simple variable changes as proven by COVID this year. We could, should and WILL HAVE TO adapt but the issue is that we have such a centralized food system that its so monolithic with massive labour shortages and is hard to correct that without a local system to meet the demand (which is the case for most city dwellers) is exactly how Society breaks down.<p>&gt; I keep hearing this, that global climate change will reduce our ability to grow plants, and I don&#x27;t understand why this is true or how the science for it works. Can anyone shed some light on it, please?<p>Its way more complex than that, and is really impossible to give a complete answer as countless books are written on specific topics that range from: water depletion due to lack of rain and drought, soil erosion, bee&#x2F;pollinator collapse etc... I can help if you narrow down what specific aspect you&#x27;re asking, but essentially what you&#x27;re describing is the fear of ecological collapse as much of Man&#x27;s intervention and actions have led to immense consequences we never took into account.<p>I also think that the Sun&#x27;s activity is playing a bigger part in weather, specifically the role cloud formation has on rising temperature as a result of cosmic ray ejection, that we do not speak about enough.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coloradosun.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;29&#x2F;western-slope-peaches-bumper-crop-worker-shortage&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coloradosun.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;29&#x2F;western-slope-peaches-bum...</a>')
