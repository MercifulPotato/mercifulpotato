Refined sugar all seems to be sucrose. There are non-refined sugar sources like honey that aren&#x27;t sucrose, but obviously honey also differs in many other characteristics from &#x27;normal sugar&#x27;. I&#x27;ve never come across a recipe that calls for fructose, lactose, or glucose specifically and I don&#x27;t think my store carries them in a refined state. Why not though?')
