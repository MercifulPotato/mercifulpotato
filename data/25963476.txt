Abject need was the motive for agrarian debt. A key financial dynamic of ancient civilizations was precisely the problem of debt arrears (including unpaid tax collections) mounting up beyond the ability of many borrowers to pay. This is what led to the royal amargi, andurarum and misharum &quot;Clean Slate&quot; proclamations of Mesopotamia during 2400-1700 BC, cancelling agrarian debts (but not commercial obliga- tions, that is, the placement of money with tamkaru-merchantsto finance their trade ventures).\n```<p>(Sorry for the long quote)<p>It then goes on to list the common interest rates of borrowing money for various markets which includes a listing for Mesopotamia. Just because they engaged in debt cancellation doesn&#x27;t mean they didn&#x27;t practice usury - quite the opposite, indicates they practiced it quite a bit.<p>Practically, the anthropological origins of usury prohibitions have very little to do with non-usury markets. Even those groups which you listed practice usury - they simply put those who practice it into secondary (or lower) social groups.<p>The reference to communism attempts isn&#x27;t a non-sequitor since depending on the particulars of their brand of communism they either want to limit usury to only a national&#x2F;popular entity or get rid of it entirely. When discussing non-usury based markets they are basically the closest modern examples we have - and it&#x27;s worth noting the only surviving self-labeled communist country with a functioning economy is China, who allows usury!')
