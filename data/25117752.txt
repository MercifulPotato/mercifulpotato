That doesn&#x27;t include incidents – such as the story&#x27;s main anecdote – in which officers claim there is footage even when there isn&#x27;t, or much of it is missing.<p>&gt; <i>CBS 2 obtained data on more than 340,000 of those stops between the start of 2018 — the first full year all patrol officers had body cameras — and June 30, 2020.</i><p>&gt; <i>More than 62,000 stops during that period didn&#x27;t have body camera video, the data showed.</i><p>&gt; <i>About half of the interactions that weren’t recorded involved police officers who are not required by policy to wear body cameras, including those on specialized teams.</i><p>&gt; <i>In order to find out how many stops were potential policy violations, CBS 2 isolated stops made by cops who would normally wear body cameras. It shows about 34,000 stops — roughly 10 percent — were made by officers not assigned to gang, gun or saturation teams.</i>')
