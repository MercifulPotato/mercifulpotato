By doing that, they removed a method which was valid under GDPR article 20 subsection 2 to transfer personal data directly from one controller to another. FreeYouMusic is using another process without cooperation or consent from Spotify, and doesn&#x27;t include all personal data.<p>I&#x27;ve been exchanging emails with Spotify to demand that they re-enable the API or allow for some other method to transfer my personal data directly to another controller. So far they&#x27;ve just sent me boilerplate back telling me about their GDPR article 20 subsection 1 process. You can read the full conversation here [2].<p>I fully intend to file a complaint with the Dutch civil court if they don&#x27;t allow me to exercise my rights under the law. It would be good to have some precedent here. As they&#x27;ve already shown it to be technically feasible (a requirement of the law), and enabling the process is literally a boolean away, I think such a complaint would have a high chance of success.<p>Additionally, in my opinion their GDPR article 20 subsection 1 process is currently also in violation, because they take up to 30 days (counting 2 now) before emailing you the ZIP with your personal data. This is arguably &quot;undue delay&quot; (which is prohibited under the GDPR). If it comes to a case, removing this delay will certainly be part of the demands.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;songshift.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;spotify_transfers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;songshift.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;spotify_transfers</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24764371" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24764371</a>')
