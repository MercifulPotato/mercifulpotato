What you&#x27;re saying sounds like an excellent reason for you personally not to visit wallstreetbets, it doesn&#x27;t sound like any kind of reason at all for the community to be curtailed, censored, or banned.<p>As an example, I grew up in a very religious home.  My family would find things like cursing, taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain, or advocating for atheism to be very offensive.  And yet, I hope it is very easy for you to understand that it would be wrong to take what my religious family finds offensive and apply those ethical rules to other people.  Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses think birthdays and holidays are offensive, Muslims think graven images are offensive, etc etc.  All sorts of people believe all sorts of things.  Every group of people is not obliged to not be offensive to every other group of people.<p>You may be inclined to say that people can choose not to be religious but have no say over things like mental type or race.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true because the majority of religious people are in the same religion as their parents, implying there isn&#x27;t much free choice involved.  Even if that were true, why is something you believe less respected than something that you are?')
