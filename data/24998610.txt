In terms of quality, but also in terms of documentation (frequently not there, partially there or wrong). It&#x27;s not even rare to find libraries wrapping things with only half of the expected functionality implemented.<p>To say nothing of trying to get patches into the core. Be prepared to wait months for any response at all, every time getting the feedback that there is some new minor problem (or even worse, a &quot;this needs to be talked about&quot; without any followup).<p>It&#x27;s not a healthy ecosystem. For that you require high-quality core libs, a strong developer ecosystem (that doesn&#x27;t mean a lot of devs, it means good ones) and a culture of third-party libraries being few but high-quality. Anything else is going to end up pissing you off, guaranteed.')
