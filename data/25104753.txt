Item(by='rewtraw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605473816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104231, text='100%. I&#x27;ve been using Lutron Caseta switches &amp; hub for over 5 years and have never once had a single issue -- no matter how minor. The dimmers work like normal even if the wifi is down, and they don&#x27;t need internet in order to work with HomeKit. I&#x27;ve never once had a switch not work or fail to respond with HomeKit. I have friends with Z-Wave&#x2F;Zigby&#x2F;Phillips&#x2F;etc and they are always talking about how they are finicking with Home Assistant or Smart Things, or how the lights all returned to full brightness after a power outage in the middle of the night.<p>I want to install my switches and have them work, always. If my wife even once complains, that&#x27;s a total failure. If a guest can even tell that they are anything but normal dimmers, that&#x27;s a failure. With my Caseta system, my wife has never complained -- only asked me to install more of them.<p>And h&#x2F;t to HomeKit and Home.app. I&#x27;ve tried Google&#x27;s version (Home) and it&#x27;s absolute garbage in comparison.')
