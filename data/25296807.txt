I explicitly deleted all my old gmail addresses and moved back to my own mail servers in 2013 (due to Snowden&#x2F;domestic spying .. sad how so few people did anything due to that) and I remember reading that once I deleted the e-mail address, I could never create it again. I made sure I had moved over all the accounts I cared about to my new e-mail address first.')
