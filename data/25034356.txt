Pfizer is a US company, but has at least one key ingredient from Austria, is made with technology from Germany, has manufacturing in US+Europe, etc.<p>Pfizer&#x27;s CEO answered this question this morning on CNBC.<p>Pfizer has two separate manufacturing divisions- one in the US (Massachusetts, Missouri, Michigan) and one in Europe (Germany+Belgium).<p>They will be producing in parallel and he seemed to imply Europe manufactured-&gt;Europe distributed and US manufactured-&gt;US distributed initially (but didn&#x27;t explicitly say this). But he then stated that it&#x27;s important to share the vaccine across the world - &quot;I hope that we will be able to ship to the entire world from these manufacturing sites without problems&quot;.<p>They have signed contracts with multiple governments in the world and in most cases have defined their monthly quantities distributed to those countries through 2021. I would guess these are public and am curious about the quantities and timelines for the various countries.<p>They are estimating to have 1.2 billion doses by the end of 2021 (enough for 600 million people, as each person needs two doses).<p>EDIT:<p>US: 100 million doses of this Pfizer vaccine (enough for 50 million people) by December 2020[1], but Pfizer now says they are only producting 50 million doses globally this year[2]<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;pfizer-corona...</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pfizer.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;press-release-detail&#x2F;pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pfizer.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;press-release-deta...</a>')
