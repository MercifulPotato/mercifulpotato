Q.E.D.<p>Yep.  And corporate&#x2F;enterprise environments <i>should</i> (not nearly enough do) do exactly that with devices owned and managed by the enterprise.<p>Any personal devices or those owned by contractors, clients and other external actors should not be allowed access to internal corporate networks.  This is neither a particularly new or controversial idea either.  Most large (or even medium-sized) organizations have separate &quot;guest&quot; networks for external resources which aren&#x27;t secured or monitored.<p>However, <i>internal</i> networks are (and should be) a <i>very</i> different story.')
