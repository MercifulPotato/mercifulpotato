I had read two replies and put them together in my head when replying to you. So, yes, I agree with what you are saying here.<p>The idea that I was trying to get at is that you can accept that you were a victim and do something about it. We are saying the same thing - but you are saying it better, so sorry for the confusion.<p>Additionally, some people are victims of situations - so say, poor family background, a minority race that is looked down upon by the majority, having a chronic illness - and you can accept that is true but mentally decide that you are going to take steps to make it better, however you can.<p>You don&#x27;t want to land in &quot;I have no control and am a victim&quot; when you are being victimized. That is what you are getting at too.<p>As a society, we don&#x27;t want to create a society where anyone being abused feels like continuing to be abused is actually better than looking for help &#x2F; making a change. That&#x27;s not the victim&#x27;s fault... that&#x27;s someone choosing what they see as the best of two not attractive outcomes.')
