I recommend anything between 16mm to 24mm focal length lens (based on 35mm equivalent). \n Using DSLR or mirrorless camera as webcam on desk is done by many, especially by Twitch streamers, Youtubers, and Zoomers who want quality video.  Also check out EposVox (Youtuber) who has a great setup with such a small amount of space.  He has great video and tips on such setup.')
