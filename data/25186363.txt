Signal and WhatsApp have native clients, so at least they maybe able to link between native apps in a secure way. But I think it&#x27;s way too easy for Google to spy on users&#x27; Messages for Web, as it&#x27;s a web service. How would we even know they aren&#x27;t doing it while they still show us the &quot;lock&quot; icon.')
