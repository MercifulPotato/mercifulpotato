When we look back to the Founders this is what we&#x27;re talking about. A multi-layered Federal Republic without strong centralization. Centralization is what Progressives have been pushing on us bit by bit for 100 years and look at the mess we&#x27;re in now. Every regime change in the Whitehouse pisses off 50% of the country. We&#x27;re a large country with 50 independent states of differing geographies and political philosophies that s&#x2F;b largely governing themselves. We&#x27;re not a small country like Sweden. Why can&#x27;t we have progressive states like CA and conservative states like TX. If CA wants healthcare they can implement it themselves and if TX doesn&#x27;t then they don&#x27;t have to do it for themselves. CA is the 5th largest economy in the world on their own. They dont need DC. I&#x27;m a conservative who crossed the border from MA into the Live Free or Die state of NH. Why do Progressives want to hammer a one size fits all solution down to all states from DC and ruin our freedoms like that?')
