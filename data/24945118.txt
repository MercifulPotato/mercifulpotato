I am pretty bothered at how much emphasis folks throw behind the TechEmpower benchmarks. If you really dig into the implementations for the top languages, it&#x27;s easy to see how far from the real world, those apps are. In the case of C#&#x2F;ASP.NET, as soon as you add EntityFramework (or Dapper, if that&#x27;s your thing) and some real-world querying of a database. You&#x27;re looking at a pretty big slow-down. I&#x27;m certain things can be done to speed it up though.')
