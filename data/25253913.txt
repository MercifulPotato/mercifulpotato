It&#x27;s an element. It will cost energy to recycle it, but that energy is increasingly sourced by clean energy sources. Let me cite the oil company, BP.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bp.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;global&#x2F;corporate&#x2F;energy-economics&#x2F;statistical-review-of-world-energy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bp.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;global&#x2F;corporate&#x2F;energy-economics&#x2F;stat...</a><p>Coal is in terminal decline. Solar and wind have been growing exponentially, and are on a path to pass coal within the decade.
