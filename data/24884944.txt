I think it&#x27;s generally fine to call a GPL program from a SaaS application. I believe it&#x27;s fine as long as it is providing an optional or tangential feature, and your application can continue to perform the core functions when that GPL tool is not present. AGPL licenses go a step further and prevent access to any AGPL commands over the network, so that&#x27;s when a commercial license is always required.<p>Am I allowed to distribute GPL programs contained inside a Docker image for on-premise installations? Do I just need to provide proper credit and a link to the source code?<p>Or is there a commercial license available for Pandoc? (I couldn&#x27;t find anything.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docspring.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docspring.com</a><p>UPDATE: I&#x27;ve decided to evaluate pandoc and see if it might be useful for supporting Markdown and Word formats, etc. If it is, then I&#x27;ll reach out to John McFarlane and ask about a commercial license (or just something in writing), perhaps in exchange for sponsorship on GitHub.')
