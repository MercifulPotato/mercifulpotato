If so, this role might be for you.<p>Weâ€™re looking for an inquisitive, imaginative story teller who loves software development, loves writing, and talking to people about writing about software development. This person has had broad experience (though not necessarily deep) in software development.<p>Our clients need content written that software developers will want to read. We need a client whisperer to talk to our clients about what they are trying to achieve with their content, what their product or service does, and help them weave a story that would make an article worthy of reading.<p>We&#x27;re not after fluff. We&#x27;re after code-first, technical accurate articles that a developer can use to understand a product, to make decisions, or to solve programming problems.<p>This role isn&#x27;t to write the articles. It&#x27;s to help the client understand what needs to be written and provide instructions to our hundreds of deeply technical software developer practitioner authors.<p>To learn more or apply, see our job posting at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca.indeed.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;content-strategist-fc647f4960c536e2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ca.indeed.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;content-strategist-fc647f4960c536e...</a>')
