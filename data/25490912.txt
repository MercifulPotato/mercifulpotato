Item(by='Frost1x', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608510138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490283, text='I think we need to create new language for dealing with these sorts of cases to differentiate what&#x27;s being said.<p>When you make a claim that a statement someone makes displays racism, that usually implies indirectly that the speaker is actively&#x2F;knowingly&#x2F;intentionally being racist. Being a racist voluntarily implies <i>a lot</i> of negative baggage. It often implies not only ignorance but more consequently, unjustified: bigotry, hatred, willingness to commit violent acts against another on this bias, and so forth.<p>When you promote an idea that happens to prop up or create institutional racism, the vast majority share only one feature: ignorance. We&#x27;re <i>all</i> ignorant of somethings to different degrees so I wouldn&#x27;t put a scarlet letter like &quot;racist&quot; on someone due to ignorance. Unfortunately, this also sets the stage for sociopaths to push academic dishonesty, to essentially truly be racist in the traditional sense and promote&#x2F;support features of institutional racism while feigning ignorance, so you&#x27;ll get some false negatives, but I think it seems reasonable.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the term, phrase, or linguistics should be but I think something new and distinct from &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; needs to be developed, otherwise the terms become wild cards for any and every type of bias that may arise, even if the bias has no real intent of being racist, directly or indirectly. The more you throw &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;racist&quot; around outside the well established context, the less power it carries in language. Right now it carries a lot of weight still and I don&#x27;t want to see that language lose its power.')
