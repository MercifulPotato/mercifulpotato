Item(by='randallsquared', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610425211, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721734, text='Thank you for your response!<p>Some people on the right (and a very few on the left) would view being armed as the natural state of free people. <i>Especially</i> when discussing suggestions from righties, it seems like &quot;bring your firearm&quot; is right next to &quot;don&#x27;t forget your keys&quot;.<p>I think that&#x27;s one of the issues that really worries me about all this: the cultures of the left and right are different enough that the left views behavior the right considers normal to be violently deviate, and then the right (at least on my own social feeds) reacts as though the left is targeting them personally.<p>My best argument that no insurrection was <i>intended</i> by those present is that the bombs (or bomb-making materials, or whatever) that were found weren&#x27;t used, even though the mob had control of the Capitol building.  Indeed, even though a significant percentage of the rioters were likely armed (see above), the only shots fired were by Capitol police. More than anything else, that confirms for me that the mob didn&#x27;t arrive with the intention of taking the Capitol, or insurrection, or anything like it. They had the materials available to make things much, much worse, and instead they acted like tourists.  Why?  Clearly (I think!), because there was no intent by 99+% of them to do anything but show up and support legislators in finding the courage to dissent from what the Trumpists believe to be fraud.')
