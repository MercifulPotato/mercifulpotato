Internal procedures are prone to non-trust. I&#x27;m curious if public procedures and checklists &#x2F; verifications by a third party for the FCC standards (to be written) would be appropriate? FCC is a trusted government body. I don&#x27;t think there are standards &#x2F;tests and scoring around privacy, data protection, and standards to follow. Should there be?
