Item(by='GoToRO', descendants=None, kids=[25644256], score=None, time=1609841224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643393, text='It&#x27;s not about believing, it&#x27;s about knowing. You have to couple that time interval with the company they worked for.<p>At one company it took them 2 weeks to set-up my email, 3 months to decide on which project to work on and in about 6 months I was delivering something. So 6 months &quot;experience&quot; actually meant zero. I was ready to deliver from day 1 but...<p>At another company I had all the accounts created by the end of day 1, already working on bugs the second day. Some projects took 1 month in total. 6 months could mean 6 projects. The amount of skills accumulated in that time was way over the skills accumulated at the first company.<p>As you can see the time interval is useless. I think it&#x27;s fairer if the recruiter simply rolls a dice.')
