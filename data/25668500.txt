Which is exactly my reaction to the linked statements by Hillary Clinton.<p>It is still absurd to act like there is an equivalence between her claiming that Russian interference misled voters into choosing the &quot;wrong&quot; candidate, vs. Trump (a) claiming that ballots were manufactured, altered or tampered with and that actual voting infrastructure and processes are corrupt, (b) having his legal team launch a bunch of frivolous lawsuits in various states, and (c) pressuring the secretary of state of an electorally-close state to overturn election results.<p>Clinton&#x27;s statements, as overblown as they may have been, were just an accusation of unfairness, not calling for the results to be overturned and the loser installed in office. All of the #resistance rhetoric was about the need to defeat Trump through the electoral process, or through parliamentary procedures (based on his actions after taking office). Again, there is a fundamental difference between claiming that voters were lied to, and claiming that the government itself directly interfered in the voting process without ANY remotely credible evidence to back that claim.<p>Trying to equate the two situations because they both involved the use of the word &quot;illegitimate&quot; is beyond laughable.')
