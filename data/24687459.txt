If you ever have to do some sort of inner join of a table on itself to bring in the single &quot;next&quot; row to tell you information about the current row, then you are stuffed. Query complexity explodes. Performance takes a nose dive.<p>The end date of a contract is a property of <i>that</i> contract, not any other.<p>Forgetting all other contracts for a moment, what do you need to know about one contract? There should be a straight forward way to query that contract on its own, with a query that represents a tree through tables in the database. It should not become a graph, with the potential for cycles that graphs allow.<p>And I get the business requirements could need no overlaps, but gaps are clearly possible if a customer leaves for a while and then comes back later. Does that person need to then become a new &quot;customer&quot;, because you don&#x27;t allow gaps? And then are your customers&#x27; PII only allowed to be registered to a single account? Comcast has been a huge pain in the ass in years past because of moving, gaps, and email address reuse.')
