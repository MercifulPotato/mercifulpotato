Surgeons get better with experience, it&#x27;s a skill, and different surgeries are different enough that experience doesn&#x27;t transfer too much. There&#x27;s also changes over time in best practices so skills degrade not just due to lack of recent experience. If I remember the best predictor of the outcome of your surgery is how many similar surgeries the doctor does per year.')
