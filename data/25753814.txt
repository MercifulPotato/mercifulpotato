It was something like this:<p>- Email: Not urgent. Expected response: ~1 day.\n- Chat: Somewhat urgent. Expected response: &lt; 1 hour.\n- Text: Shit is on fire. Expected response: Immediate.<p>Building on the points OP makes re the problems thinking one line at a time in chat, in this little mental model there&#x27;s a whole lot of daylight between email and chat. And there&#x27;s lots of problems with email that make it not a great communication medium for semi-urgent things.<p>My sense is that we need a better primitive inside chat platforms to differentiate between &quot;this is important and we need to have this discussion now&quot; and something closer to email-ish pace.')
