Especially in the areas where it seems that they are inspired by physical, classical watches: there’s a bunch there that you can basically see as very attractive to traditional watch people. But the other faces? Eh, they’re kind of mediocre. I never really understood why Apple is so dead set on shipping watch faces that aren’t very good while also denying people the ability to make good ones :(')
