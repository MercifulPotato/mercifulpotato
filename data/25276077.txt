The MSRE reactor had a volumetric power density of 2 MW&#x2F;m^3, a factor of 10 lower than a commercial PWR (counting the volume of the entire primary reactor vessel; the power density in the core of a PWR is a factor of 5 higher than that.)  Of course that was an experiment, but look at something like Moltex&#x27;s design and the power density is still lower than a PWR, last I looked.<p>&gt; Likewise, while ITER is uber expensive like large PWRs, ARC is 10 times smaller, and a factor of 30 times or more cheaper.<p>The ARC design is smaller than ITER, but it&#x27;s still very much lower (a factor of 40) in power density than a fission reactor.')
