However in my time here I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s the exception, not the rule. The majority is actually pretty fair.<p>Side note, if you want my 2 cents, I&#x27;d guess the reason why your comment on the System76 laptop was downvoted is because you said &quot;X is just better than Y&quot; with minimal evidence and you didn&#x27;t present it as an opinion. If your comment said something like &quot;My opinion is...&quot; or &quot;Anecdotally&quot; I think you likely would have gotten voted up instead. Don&#x27;t take it personally, the community here tends to be <i>very</i> focused on hard evidence or being clear about an opinion being that.')
