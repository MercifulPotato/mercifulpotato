I work in a group that&#x27;s very distributed and we get together (normally) a couple of times a year plus another once or twice with a larger group.<p>Of course, that doesn&#x27;t work if it&#x27;s more like getting together in person every week or two.<p>In any case, I agree it makes sense to collaborate.
