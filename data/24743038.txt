Tint is cheaper because you don&#x27;t have to disassemble a car, and a flat surface is much cheaper to wrap than a car with curves and edges. I don&#x27;t see the price going down unless you can somehow automate it, theres a lot of labor involved. \nAlso, wraps need special care. You can&#x27;t leave it in the sun too long, otherwise it will literally bake onto your car, making it look bad and removal tough. If you don&#x27;t clean it once a week, you&#x27;ll have nasty stains from bird poop and other dirt thats impossible to remove. Also, you need to remove and re-wrap every 5 years, even if you care for it well. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for 99% of people who don&#x27;t really care about the color of their car.')
