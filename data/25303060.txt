I&#x27;d never heard of historious, thanks for the link. I&#x27;m quite surprised that using that is easier than hitting Ctrl+D (in Firefox anyway), and doing the management there. I totally get it though.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think so, I prefer doing my own hosting and NextCloud&#x2F;WebDAV works quite well, so I wouldn&#x27;t want yet another account to manage.<p>Yep, I can see that, many who find their way to joplin are quite technologically independent and came to joplin precisely because of those reasons. I guess not many people would really want hosted WebDav when you can just hook up NextCloud&#x2F;S3&#x2F;OneDrive&#x2F;etc.<p>&gt; Yeah, I ran into this problem with my script as well, where I wanted some notes to be private. For those, I just created a notebook that has &quot;private&quot; in the name and put them all there, the script skips them. Tags might work as well.<p>Yeah -- tags would definitely be the way, but the problem is that I&#x27;d want someone to be able to publish an update from their phone (or at least from every platform possible), <i>and</i> be able to keep their encryption. Just spitballing, but imagine serving a sync&#x2F;backup service that happens to also be able to spit out md-derived websites very very easily. Notion and it&#x27;s ilk have features like that and people seem very excited about it. A notebook as a blogging platform also seems interesting&#x2F;incredibly low friction. Could even be a podcasting platform if you attached audio to notes.')
