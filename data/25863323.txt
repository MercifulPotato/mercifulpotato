That is a separate question from if your PI will do networking FOR you.  Some will, some won&#x27;t, either by malice, by ignorance, or by temperament.  I worked for a nobel laureate (who discovered restriction enzymes).  Publication was not a problem.  He was lovely and fun to work for, but in the end I had to leave academia because he couldn&#x27;t be bothered to network for me (he was more interested in playing penny slots at the casino).<p>If you&#x27;re in grad school, my strongest recommendation is to optimize first for a PI that will network for you.  That is generally the most valuable form of networking, because 3rd party validation generally carries a strong amount of weight by human nature.  Plus it potentially takes minimal effort on your part.')
