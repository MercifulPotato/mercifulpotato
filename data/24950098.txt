I would guess that the variant had little selective pressure - being grouchy and tired all the time isn&#x27;t enough to kill people or prevent them from reproducing.<p>Here is the specific mutation in the gnomAD genome browser &#x2F; variant database: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gnomad.broadinstitute.org&#x2F;variant&#x2F;12-107386740-T-G?dataset=gnomad_r2_1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gnomad.broadinstitute.org&#x2F;variant&#x2F;12-107386740-T-G?d...</a><p>The variant is particularly frequent in Ashkenazi Jews (which says very little about any selective effects), but it seems to be more prevalent in African-descent people than Finns, and more prevalent in South Asians than Europeans. So it doesn&#x27;t seem especially common in Europeans, or even particularly related to latitude&#x2F;longitude.')
