I&#x27;ve been a big fan since Zeit platform version 1 - I remember the transition to platform version 2 was difficult but over time I can see how incredible of a platform you&#x27;ve become.<p>Just a note from a fan - I hope you all can determine a way to approach the future with longevity and corporate independence. The web really needs your entire teams dedication towards performance, end user experience, and developer experience in the coming years. I would love to see Vercel as an independent entity a decade from now and witness how your philosophy changes the web in that time!')
