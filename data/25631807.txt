I&#x27;ve been operating my own mail server for almost a decade, since I am the only person using it the volume of email I send out is almost none.<p>I&#x27;ve observed on more then one occasion that sending an email to my gmail or my fathers gmail account can sometimes take 20 minutes or more to show up in gmail inbox although I know that google accepted the email as soon as it was sent.')
