Two are connected via USB-C directly which means they are passively converting to DisplayPort. One is connected to HDMI from the Mac directly. All are 4k and all work fine.<p>That said, two of these displays were just purchased. They are kinda cheapo small &quot;portable&quot; displays (12.5&quot; 4k native) which I primarily use for things like always visible terminal or slack&#x2F;etc.<p>While experimenting with exactly how I wanted to connect these, I did for a time use Belkin&#x27;s higher end USB-C to HDMI and had it misbehaving kind of randomly. After switching things around and connecting the one monitor with HDMI directly to the Mac I still had some issues... until I disabled FreeSync on the display itself and those issues disappeared.<p>The reality is that external displays have become extremely complex in the last few years with numerous optional functionalities such as HDR (which 100% always looks like garbage to me, I don&#x27;t get the appeal) and VRR and so forth. Any issues I have experienced with external displays seem to have relationship with how complex the display&#x27;s feature set is.<p>In this case, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the issue was linked to some subset of features that 11.1 breaks on now. I might suggest toggling such features off if possible on your displays to see if it helps anything.')
