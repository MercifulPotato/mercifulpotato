The handshake is at once the most complicated part (which means you don&#x27;t really want it in Ring Zero) and the part you&#x27;re most likely to want to customise (e.g. OCSP stapling is in the handshake, certificate compression is in the handshake, SNI handling is in the handshake, and so on) which means that&#x27;s the part an application author is least likely to be satisfied with being done on their behalf.<p>Notice that in Linux because sockets &quot;are&quot; file descriptors you actually can put all connection and handshake work into a separate processes altogether, and just pass the socket (now TLS encrypted) to a process that pumps data back and forth, without it needing to be aware of TLS at all.')
