I picked Dogecoin solely because I could get 137k of them, which I think was worth about $20 at the time. Apparently that would be worth over $1k right now, but sadly I shoved it in a bter account and it is now lost. C&#x27;est la vie.<p>I still think cryptocurrencies are largely an experiment in the application of contemporary memetics to scam people, but I have to admit that said experiment has produced wildly more successful results so far than I had ever anticipated. The power behind the convergent desires of get-rich-quick schemers, true believers, conspiracy theorists, anarcho-capitalists, and complexity fetishists is a pretty terrible thing to behold. My prediction would be that this particular maneuver won&#x27;t work because only just over one of those groups really have any interest in its success (believers and some schemers). Then again, all my other predictions about cryptocurrencies have been wrong so far.<p>[0] I took advantage of a hype cycle to make ~$1k. I kinda regret it because in a small way my greed-driven maneuver contributed to the current state of BTC and its ludicrous energy usage.')
