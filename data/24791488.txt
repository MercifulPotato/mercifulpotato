The identity is &quot;We are the people who follow these rules,&quot; and in particular, &quot;others are those who don&#x27;t&quot;. Compare it to Western revulsion at people who eat insects or dogs, even though they&#x27;re as nutritious and safe as anything we eat.<p>The rules come from God because Jews consider themselves a chosen people. They don&#x27;t particularly want you to follow those rules or concern yourself with the mechanics of them, because they&#x27;re not about you. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t make sense is perfectly fine.<p>Interpreting those rules in a modern context is every bit as arcane and arbitrary as the rules were in the first place. The important part is that they come to a conclusion and follow them together. That cements the society as a group.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter what God thinks, either. If God had a contrary opinion, He&#x27;d say so. There is, for that matter, a famous story about rabbis coming to a conclusion that God explicitly sends messages against, but is pleased that they have used their reason.<p>The Jews put a lot more weight on community and a lot less on trying to please their deity by following the rules. It just so happens that the rules really are both things.')
