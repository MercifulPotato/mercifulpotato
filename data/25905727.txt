Language is important for keeping the goal in sight.<p>There is a science to designing human computer interactions. But there is a subtle difference between wielding that science in the service of the humans in those interactions (users) and wielding it solely in the name of increasing the company&#x27;s bottom line. The former will lead to a better product, will improve customer satisfaction and lead to sales. The later leads to a dystopian, exploitative relationship, even when it increases revenue. The difference is the goal: Serving users or serving shareholders. The language of UX design needs to be carefully crafted to keep a the focus on empathy with users.')
