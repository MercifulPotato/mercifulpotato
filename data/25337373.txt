I&#x27;ve done it before -- someone who looks great on paper, interviews well but can&#x27;t code their way out of a paper bag. I have no clue how or why they are in this industry, but I will never again let someone off the hook without demonstrating that they can code.<p>I don&#x27;t want to hire people who think coding is beneath them or are so far removed from the actual tech that they can&#x27;t code anymore.')
