The current trend is that the only acceptable criticisms are those that are &quot;punching up&quot;, meaning they&#x27;re directed at someone or something of higher perceived social status. Taken to the extremes, the only safe targets for &quot;punching up&quot; are the largest corporations and billionaires.<p>This mentality is especially prevalent among the younger students I&#x27;ve mentored. They seem highly confident that corporations are somehow taking something from them, but they can&#x27;t exactly explain it.<p>For example, virtually everyone is convinced that Facebook is selling their data, yet when pressed they can&#x27;t explain what &quot;their data&quot; is, or who Facebook might be selling it to (Facebook doesn&#x27;t sell data, the idea that Facebook is selling people&#x27;s data is a myth). It&#x27;s amazing to hear so many people insist that Instagram is listening to their conversations to sell ads (they&#x27;re not), yet they can&#x27;t point to any sort of background activity, battery drain, network activity, or reverse engineering reports. The supposed evil of large corporations is treated like magic.<p>Likewise, many of my mentees will insist that large corporations &quot;don&#x27;t pay any taxes&quot;. Yet when I explain that corporate income tax is only one of many taxes that companies pay and that the corporations they&#x27;re thinking of are actually paying corporate income taxes on their earnings, they assume I&#x27;m somehow misinformed.<p>In the hyper-connected social media of 2020, it seems the safest and most persistent themes are &quot;corporations are bad&quot;. This is easily bolstered by cherry-picking a small number of anecdotes of bad things that were done by corporations, yet it&#x27;s missing the point that corporations do a lot of things, the vast majority of which are not &quot;bad&quot;. It&#x27;s the equivalent of saying &quot;humans are bad&quot; after reading about a few serial killers. The idea is especially sticky among young people because they haven&#x27;t yet worked inside of corporations long enough to realize that corporations are just groups of people. They speak of corporations as some sort of sentient alien entity, or as an extension of Zuckerberg and Bezos.')
