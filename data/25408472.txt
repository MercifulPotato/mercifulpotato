I did, admittedly, feel that the level of support could&#x27;ve been greater, but for a predominantly distance learning education that&#x27;s par for the course, IMO.<p>The debt is indeed a bummer! Still, their fees are lower than most other UK universities right now, and my study landed me my current DevOps position, so I&#x27;m very happy.')
