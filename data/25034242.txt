Semantic&#x2F;format-aware versioning would be really nice. The easiest plugins to write would be s-expressions and JSON, and I could definitely see myself choosing Pijul for such repos in the future. If the patch-based approach is truly as nice as it appears, that might push me to use it more generally.<p>In fact, making an s-expression plugin which is robust across various Lisp dialects might be a good way to bootstrap the user community.<p>It would be nice to have for other languages too (C, Python, etc.), but they&#x27;d (a) be more complicated and (b) more subject to churn.')
