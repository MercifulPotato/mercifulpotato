Just that generally people aren&#x27;t viewing these things as trade-offs. You believe the government shouldn&#x27;t be trusted with regulation and that it wastes too much money when doing transit. That&#x27;s fine.<p>You can site examples that validate those basic beliefs and I&#x27;m sure someone could site some that invalidate them. But whether you think those examples are an exception or the rule largely comes down to your values.<p>Is this true of absolutely everyone, no. The Cato Institute produced a health plan similar to Obamacare after all. Yes, there is a small group of policy wonkish people that get off on this stuff but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the majority.<p>Edit: btw if my point seems to dismiss people&#x27;s opinions I mean exactly the opposite.<p>IMO posts like this say &quot;if we could just sit down, we could see eye to eye and find compromise&quot;. But I think what they really think is, &quot;if we could just talk, I could resolve their information deficit and they&#x27;d come my way a little&quot;. I think that&#x27;s condescending honestly and underestimates how much people believe they have thought their beliefs through, how much evidence they believe thwy have observed and how invested they are in those beliefs.')
