The goal here is to reduce transmission in the population to a level where the virus can no longer spread.  That is only possible if enough people take the vaccine and healthy people should absolutely be in the front of that line.<p>This is not a purely personal choice.  You have to understand that by deciding not to immunize yourself you are making a decision for <i>everyone else</i>.')
