Museums have limited space, and as stuffy and unchanging as they can seem, really do reflect the vision of current curators. Simply by math, a lot of pieces don&#x27;t get selected for display, and they just hangout in the archive for whatever scholar&#x2F;student&#x2F;future curator might be interested.<p>Additionally, a lot of the art in the archive is by nature going to be stuff that might make sense to display in a dedicated exhibit, but less so in a general museum. By that, I mean that if you have a handful of Picasso canvases, along with 100 of his sketches, displaying all 100 sketches probably doesn&#x27;t make sense unless you&#x27;re doing a special Picasso exhibit.<p>In this way, the archive is important, and Rijks burning down would suck. Along the lines of your thinking, however, there is a ton of amazing art sitting in investors&#x27; basements and shipping containers that we might never see again, much of which we&#x27;ve already lost track of.')
