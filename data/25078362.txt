It would be great if there were some kind of time-based decay -- or ripening, depending on your perspective -- of open tabs into a more permanent bookmark-like arrangement, with spatial&#x2F;proximity and window affinity cues. These could easily rehydrate to their live versions, or become fixed as &quot;organic bookmarks&quot; living alongside &quot;affirmative&quot; bookmarks and the normal, more ephemeral, uncurated browsing history.')
