(Think of the &quot;freedom&quot; to wreck your hands with a mouse from the Apple 1984 ad)<p>The simple fact is that you could get a better client for a server IF there is a competition for clients.  Twitter,  Discord,  et al.will just shut you down if you make a better client.<p>In the &quot;police&#x2F;military&quot; sector communication with chat is widespread (e.g. most cops have a computer with an XMPP client in their car)  They might tap out a message and it goes into Lotus Notes,  be handled with a workflow,  looked at by intelligence folks, etc.  XMPP has all kinds of extensions such as: fill out something like an HTML form and send it somebody that serve those people well.  (e.g. fill out a form about what happened on patrol today)<p>Contrast the continuous decline of proprietary chat w&#x2F; interoperable phone calls,  SMS,  you just take it for granted you can call a Verizon phone from AT&amp;T and it is because the government got involved.<p>Europeans concerned about falling behind would be well advised to mandate interoperability for chat clients and servers -- the one problem is their privacy minimalism  works in the favor of centralized companies like Facebook (which legislators might think they can control) opposed to a distributed network where somebody can record what goes by and have no respect for &quot;the right to be forgotten.&quot;')
