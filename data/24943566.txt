Wolves are among the few predators that can and will attack <i>humans</i>.<p>That the wolves, themselves, now have a deep-set fear of humanity and would only dare to do so if they&#x27;re desperate and starving... is a distant second to that same deep-set cultural fear of wolves.<p>Unpopular Opinion Time: The ecosystem damage from <i>not having apex predators</i> is large enough that it might be worth a few human lives to avoid.<p>Unpopular Opinion Time the Second: But there are other apex predators, such as the lynx, which can take much the same role without being nearly as dangerous to megafauna like humans.<p>Though that&#x27;s only a decent solution if you don&#x27;t have problems with megafauna like elk.')
