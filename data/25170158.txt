I care about the XMP spec that&#x27;s promised to me by the manufacturer, so I can rely on it.  I&#x27;m not against overclocking myself but if I&#x27;m trying to boost it by a significant amount then I have no idea what to set the timings to and there&#x27;s a good chance it just won&#x27;t work, with no recourse on my end.<p>Also that module costs <i>way</i> more than $65.')
