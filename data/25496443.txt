Same reason why a bottle of water can cost $8 in an airport, students are required to buy specific textbooks, sold through limited outlets. Textbooks sometimes get wrapped in to the loans which is also why schools charge so much. What bothers me are the fees, from parking to wellness to lab fees, while administrators make six figure salaries. Universities are such a financial imbalance of corruption.')
