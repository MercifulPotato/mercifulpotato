I&#x27;m six miles from the nearest supermarket and shops and public transport is non-existent. (Once a day type of thing). Prior to lockdown and wfh I was commuting 200 miles a week in a 18 year old Diesel that I bought for Â£500.I couldn&#x27;t cycle (too dangerous), walk (too far) or bus (no bus).<p>Round here many people drive Diesels for their economy (11% extra energy per gallon compared to Petrol) though currently with the Diesel price premium over Petrol being roughly 11% more that&#x27;s no longer true but diesel engines do last longer.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to EVs but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;ll be cheap ones like my Diesel if ever or at least for a long long time.  And no one has said about future taxes on EVs. All that ICE fuel tax revenue will have to be replaced as it dwindles away.
