Java was a &quot;weird&quot; place because it only existed because Gosling and some other folks were walking out the door and Scott McNealy asked what he could do to keep them. Their response was give them full autonomy to pursue their ideas. That gave birth to &quot;First Person&quot; which was an independent company wholly owned by Sun (I still have my First Person business card :-)). One of the people knew I was &quot;loose in the socket&quot; as they say and wanted to be sure I had an opportunity to participate and brought me over. It made the last 4 years at Sun mostly enjoyable.<p>As the limelight started fading from Sun and they started killing off things that couldn&#x27;t make a profit, they decided to kill off First Person (couldn&#x27;t make a business case for it). So the Java team negotiated with them to let us release the sources so that when we were job hunting the person could look at the source to see what we had been doing for the last 4 years. We did a stealth release in January of &#x27;95, then an &quot;official&quot; release in March. That put us on the front page of the Mercury News. A couple of us attended the WWW conference in Darmstadt Germany and it was all anyone wanted to talk about (much to SGI&#x27;s chagrin). At which point the politics REALLY ramped up back at Sun when people figured out it would be a &quot;good&quot; thing to be associated with Java instead of a &quot;loser&quot; thing. This affected different people differently, and some, who had pretty bad case of imposter syndrome, went all out trying to claim credit for everything. It ceased to be &quot;fun&quot; with the hard to get along with folks becoming intolerable.')
