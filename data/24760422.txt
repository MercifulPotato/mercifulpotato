Item(by='azinman2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602543198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756902, text='&gt; I imagine that it’s like when you’re trying to explain something technologically mundane in your world, say, Instagram Stories, to your grandma who can barely send email<p>This trope needs to go away. Your grandma might be Ada Lovelace, or any other uber technically minded person. Same with your mom. This is both sexist and agist. Notice how they never talk about &#x27;your dad,&#x27; in this example, which I personally find hilarious because in my family my mom is the technical one and my dad has the most trouble with any technology. These are the kinds of &#x27;microagressions&#x27; that I know first hand have turned women off CS.')
