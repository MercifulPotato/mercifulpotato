A lot of the time this will be done in a mixing room with studio monitors yielding as flat a response curve as possible (and without any room reverb). You will get a better sound in that it&#x27;s precise, but it&#x27;s not necessarily more pleasant to listen to.<p>As for precision: it&#x27;s easier to hear the panning &#x2F; stage in good headphones just because it&#x27;s so augmented. The low end - no matter how good the headphones are, you can&#x27;t rely on them to mix it properly, you need good monitors. If you mix the low end on headphones, there&#x27;s always a high probability that it will only sound good on this pair of headphones and not translate to other setups.')
