Or 100 people each independently created 800 votes? A thousand people each created 80? 80,000 each created one?<p>Remember again that all of these people have near zero incentive to commit voter fraud. Each person would also have to keep their secret and not brag -- something very hard for most humans to do.<p>&gt; If I were a ballot harvester I could fill in any blanks that someone left on their ballot.<p>Ballot harvesting is illegal in PA [1]. Also, ballots envelopes are generally sealed by the voter and election workers would notice if a seal is broken and not count the vote [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.publicsource.org&#x2F;what-is-ballot-harvesting-and-who-can-and-cant-deliver-your-mail-ballot-in-pa&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.publicsource.org&#x2F;what-is-ballot-harvesting-and-w...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;6abc.com&#x2F;naked-ballots-pennsylvania-pa-voting-in&#x2F;6962025&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;6abc.com&#x2F;naked-ballots-pennsylvania-pa-voting-in&#x2F;696...</a><p>&gt; If I were a postal worker I could just lose some mail if someone had the wrong sign in their yard.<p>Ballots are tracked, and then the postal worker would rely on the voter not checking the status of their ballot. If there is a pattern, then the postal worker would likely be arrested or fined, so in all likelihood each postal worker could only &quot;lose&quot; one or two ballots.')
