He does of course provide a lot more hyperlinks to circumstantial stuff, a lot of angry links to mainstream media not taking the story seriously (which is his main focus) and more sympathetic links to reportage by the likes of the Daily Caller, but the Chinese spy story&#x27;s credibility certainly wouldn&#x27;t have been <i>boosted</i> if Bloomberg&#x27;s house style involved angrily linking to everyone who said they didn&#x27;t think there was any truth to it and accusing them of mounting a coverup operation, or by links to support the circumstantial case everyone already knows (yes, China can and does mount surveillance operations; yes, Supermicro manufactures in China).<p>If anything, I&#x27;d say the opposite is often the case: aggressive hyperlinking is often a way to encourage people to overlook the obvious bias and thinness of a story is by appealing to the &quot;if it&#x27;s got lots of hyperlinks it must be complete, accurate and important&quot; strand of faith in stuff that&#x27;s written down. Ann Coulter and Michael Moore don&#x27;t fill their books with footnotes because they want their readers to look <i>beyond</i> their biases....')
