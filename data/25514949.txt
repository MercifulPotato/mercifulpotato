This is to say the level of danger directly and only corresponds to the fact that a large dog can do more damage than a chihuahua. Statistically buying your kid a bike is much more dangerous to their continued survival.  Dogs that are raised properly aren&#x27;t particularly dangerous regardless of breed. Like the bike its a small manageable risk you can virtually negate by not being an idiot and helping your kid not be an idiot.<p>What YOU want to do is take this decision out of their hands based on dog attack videos on youtube and debunked information from a person you now seem to agree is a lunatic.<p>I&#x27;m going to need to see an actual source for your claims.')
