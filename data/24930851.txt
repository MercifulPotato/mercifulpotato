I grew up in a society with deep structural problems around equality and those sorts of problems seep into every aspect of life. I think it would be arrogant of me to claim I&#x27;m somehow immune, that it hasn&#x27;t influenced the way I think.<p>I have no problem accepting that I have subconscious biases around things like race and gender, but I work to recognise those biases and I do the best I can to mitigate them.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to pass a law and declare the that the war against racism has been won, society has to work clean up the mess and pay off the debt left behind.
