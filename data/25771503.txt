Sure, they might in the end do a good thing (or a less harmful thing than they could have), but they have a huge amount of power and very little oversight.<p>I <i>like Apple products</i>, but I try to avoid any illusion that they’re good guys on a corporate scale. They’ve proven they’re not in a lot of ways (see many recent articles about their labor practices). That doesn’t mean every thing they do should be equally scrutinized with a pessimistic predisposition. But I really don’t fault anyone for assuming a large for profit organization will prioritize their own priorities over everything else.<p>The thing I try to moderate that with is understanding their actual priorities and not just falling into blind cynicism.')
