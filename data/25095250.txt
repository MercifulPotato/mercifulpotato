Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605384735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095050, text='&gt;In a lot of countries the most powerful institution is &quot;family first&quot; (sometimes extending that to ethnic or religious in-group second).<p>&gt;The (currently) successful countries got that way with a different norm, &quot;same rules for everyone&quot;.<p>Which successful countries are these?  As far as I can tell, the richer, more resourceful, established tribes don&#x27;t follow the same rules as everyone.  They might not be as blatantly corrupt as others, or the corruption may be more higher level with more plausible deniability, but &quot;family first&quot; is human nature.')
