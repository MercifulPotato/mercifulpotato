But the article said that more videos were likely to be limited to age-verified accounts, and that identification would be done by machine, which tells me that more and more videos are going to require being logged in first.<p>I&#x27;ve already seen over the last couple of months that YouTube insists on prompting me to log in, so I figure there&#x27;s a larger movement at Google to tie viewers to actual people&#x2F;accounts - almost certainly to improve advertising revenue.<p>So at some point there will likely be something I want to watch which is &quot;age restricted&quot; or &quot;for premiere accounts&quot; or something like that, which once upon a time would have been available to anyone.')
