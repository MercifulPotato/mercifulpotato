I had a work trip to Austin and thought I could add it on staying over through the weekend, but turns out Texas is REALLY BIG and Big Bend is about a 7 hour drive from Austin.  Also after researching it a bit more the park sounds enormous and to really do it right you need a couple days at least to explore.  So, I will be going back when I have more time!<p>Bisbee, Arizona is also somewhere I&#x27;d like to stay for a month or so.  I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a fun artists town with funky bohemian vibes.<p>Finally, my partner has never seen Maine so I&#x27;d love to take them to Acadia and then take the ferry over to Newfoundland.')
