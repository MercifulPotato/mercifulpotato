However, if I&#x27;m interpreting the AlphaFold results correctly, this distinction isn&#x27;t practically significant, right?<p>If you can approximate an algorithm with error that is &quot;below the threshold that is considered acceptable in experimental measurements&quot; (to quote another HN comment), then you have something as good as the algorithm itself for all intents and purposes.<p>Therefore the use of the word &quot;solve&quot; doesn&#x27;t qualify as hype-rhetoric, and the distinction you&#x27;re making does seem somewhat pedantic (even if technically true).<p>(I&#x27;m speaking as someone with only the tiniest amount of stats&#x2F;ML experience, so I could be totally wrong!)')
