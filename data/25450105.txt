I mean I know they are in practice, but I don‘t see why you couldn‘t use them as a fixed document format.<p>Web content is not that fixed, same code can redner different in different browsers this is why sometimes we need to use some css reset rules to attempt to make stuff render as similar as possible.<p>What is great with PDF it that it should look and print the same everywhere, I always have issues withfor example .doc files that don&#x27;t look and print the same on my  machine as the sender one and it is just a few lines of normal text, nothing fancy.<p>So a PDF replacer should be identical on all machines this means a extremely strict specifications with no place where implementation could deviate a pixel.')
