It takes a while to set up these kind of positions and it takes a while to wind down these kind of positions.  Especially when they had to get billions of dollars from other companies to shore up their funds.<p>Also, where were the market movement indicators that signify billions in transactions?  Who were the sellers, who were the buyers?<p>Until they show receipts, I would be very skeptical of this statement.<p>Most likely, they are playing word games with &quot;got out of short positions&quot; phrase.')
