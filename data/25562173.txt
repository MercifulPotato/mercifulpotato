That, and, I think it&#x27;s likely that most aren&#x27;t self-aware, or are at least less self-aware.<p>&gt; If that&#x27;s the case, is the life of a person with a high IQ objectively more valuable than the life of a person with a lower IQ?<p><i>Possibly</i>â€”it&#x27;s just that trying to make that judgement opens up enormous possibilities for horrible outcomes! Just to scratch the surface, IQ tests are very rough measures of intelligence, because they rely heavily on cultural knowledge and are thus biased against certain cultures. You don&#x27;t want to attempt to make life-and-death decisions based on fuzzy measures like that.<p>But, I&#x27;d posit you should choose to save a dolphin over a dog (and not just because dolphins are endangered).')
