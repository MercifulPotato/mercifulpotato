For the last couple of years, I used Matlab successfully on large, sparse multiplication and factorization problems.  A friend who was using R simply could not approach the scale I was able to work at, and I assume it&#x27;s due to weak sparse support.<p>I was multiplying and inverting sparse triangular matrices of size 650K x 650K with Matlab, on a laptop.  Just amazing.')
