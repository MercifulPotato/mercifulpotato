Item(by='danans', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605976833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25170453, text='&gt; I&#x27;ll be honest this is a stupid story.<p>Stupid in that it&#x27;s incredibly reductive.<p>It is blissfully unaware of the explosive costs of items needed for life and its continuation (AKA children) like healthcare, housing, and education (the last last two especially explode in cost together in unison).<p>Yeah I get it.  Frugality is useful.  When coupled with creativity it even sometimes results in amazing workarounds that sometimes turn into novel solutions that more people benefit from.<p>But people who aren&#x27;t rich don&#x27;t need to be lectured on frugality by someone who is rich.  For every disparaging anecdote you hear about a non-rich person with a 65&quot; TV, there are multiple families working 3 jobs to feed, house and educate their members.  They also lend their spare time&#x2F;effort to their neighbors, and there are entire communities that keep going on such efforts, sharing childcare and other essential needs.  It takes a village after all.<p>Those people are engaged in a kind of community frugality the author can likely not comprehend with his peanut-butter sandwich anecdote. They don&#x27;t write guru-style blog posts about these things, though, because it&#x27;s so blindingly obvious to them that they need to watch their spending very carefully.')
