If you look at this chart[1] from anandtech, you can see that the nvme drives (crucial P1, intel 660p) are significantly ahead of the sata drives (860 evo, 860 qvo, crucial mx500). The sustained write results[2] worse for nvme drives, but they&#x27;re still better than similar sata drives if we control for flash type (qlc vs tlc) and capacity.<p>Also, comparing nvme drives to sata drives is hard to begin with, since they&#x27;re usually in different price segments. sata drives tend to be cheaper than nvme drives (maybe the controller is cheaper?), so if you were comparing a sata drive and a nvme drive of the same price, you might end up with a &quot;worse&quot; nvme drive because of the nvme premium.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;graph13633&#x2F;burst-rw.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;graph13633&#x2F;burst-rw.png</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;graph13633&#x2F;sustained-rw.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;graph13633&#x2F;sustained-rw....</a>')
