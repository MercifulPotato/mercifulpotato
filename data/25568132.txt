He did and was given the first dose last week. It became a race for those even most eligible.<p>For the rest of us, it&#x27;s a bit of crap shoot depending on where you live. Some counties in our state have created sites where you can enter in your information so that when you&#x27;re eligible, you&#x27;ll be notified. For those of us not in those counties, we&#x27;re hoping similar systems, because the alternative is very messy and will almost certainly add to the body count.')
