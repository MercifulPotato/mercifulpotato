A rough example is burning CO (carbon monoxide) in O2, with reasoning being &quot;both of them can be obtained from martian athmosphere&quot;. So the fuel isn&#x27;t great, and specific impulse - Isp - is low, but if you add a relatively low-molecular weight component to fuel - like water - you can hope to have greater positive effect from lowering average molecular mass of combustion products than negative effect from adding an inert component.<p>That&#x27;s partially illustrated by nuclear hydrogen engines - there is no chemistry, and the gas coming from the nozzle is actually colder than what conventional chemical rocket engine produces. Hydrogen doesn&#x27;t participates in any transformations, it&#x27;s purely a working fluid, yet Isp is about twice as good as with LOX-LH2 engines.<p>So at least adding water to burning process might sometimes improve the result.')
