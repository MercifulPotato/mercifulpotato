No causal awareness.<p>1-order: Skinnerian: behavior X leads to good&#x2F;bad outcome Y, I do more X to get Y. Causal inference without indirection.<p>These are pretty uncontroversial. Higher order reasoning sees much more debate, but I see evidence all over the animal kingdom.<p>This is the domain of cognition and eventually theory of mind, and arguably extends behavioral logic with recursion and reasoning about causality indirection.<p>Audrey knows several tricks. When we are trying to get her to do something hard, she knows we want her to do something. So she &quot;rotates&quot; through her repetoir, spinning, jumping, hi-fiving, searching for the correct behavior. One could argue that it&#x27;s just extended Skinnerian conditioning, but I don&#x27;t think so, I think this is the roots of 2nd order reasoning and creativity - &quot;a solution exists and I need to try differnt approaches&quot; - and it&#x27;s cool to watch. She&#x27;s 1.5 years old so she&#x27;s still learning about the world.<p>But the best dog story comes from another owner who taught her poodle to drop toys before going outside (she couldn&#x27;t leave hollow toys outside lest scorpions nest in them). So one day the dog brings two toys and drops one at the threshold, as if to say, &quot;there, I paid your dues! Let me out!&quot;<p>This higher reasoning is clearly harder for them though. I think this manifests most obviously in &quot;no take, only throw!&quot; They want to _have_ the ball (immediate minor reward) but also fetch (delayed large reward). She rarely drops the ball immediately, rather she <i>almost</i> drops it a few times, only to bite down at the last second, before relinquishing.')
