And Biden might be a bit corrupt. In fact he might have engaged in behavior that&#x27;s almost identical in scope and corruption as the sitting President. He also wants you to know that he doesn&#x27;t like innuendo and insinuation, despite that being all that the currently known facts about Hunter&#x27;s laptop supports. He also wants us to know that the US media is biased towards Biden, but he&#x27;s definitely not biased towards Biden despite this style of corruption being demonstrated by both candidates for President.<p>Does Greenwald have any similar exposes of Trump&#x27;s alleged crimes? It&#x27;s the same thing in 2016. At worst, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s crimes were precisely the same as the Bush admin using a private email server to conduct official business.<p>Implicit in all of this is a glaring bias of &quot;we all know that Republicans do bad stuff but I expect better of Democrats so they&#x27;re the _real_ bad actors here.&quot;<p>How bout this? It&#x27;s unethical to help destroy Biden&#x27;s shot at the Presidency even if he may have engaged in unethical behavior, simply because Trump is unethical in all of these same ways _and more_. Dispassionately pursuing the facts of this story serves more harm than good and that&#x27;s an uncomfortable truth if you value objective journalism. Glenn seems to be unwilling to accept that the US media learned the lesson of 2016 which is that they got played once and they don&#x27;t want to get played again.')
