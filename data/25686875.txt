Item(by='Mediterraneo10', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610125728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686056, text='<i>Presque</i> in French is not a reflex of Latin <i>paene</i>, so <i>presqu&#x27;Ã®le</i> is not a straightforward continuation of Latin <i>paeninsula</i>.<p>&gt; I could totally be wrong about this, of course. For example if you would spoke French, I&#x27;d look like an asshole.<p>I do happen to speak French, but that is irrelevant. Merely speaking a language does not make a person an authority on etymology. The general public often holds unsound views on where the words they use come from. I am however involved in historical linguistics in academia, and what I would like to emphasize here is that the Romance languages are well known to have created calques on the basis of learned Latin -- examples abound in Spanish and Romanian too, for example. The layman may believe them to continue Latin forms, but they can be shown to represent late coinages, not retentions.')
