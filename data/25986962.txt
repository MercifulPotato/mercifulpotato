It has been formally shown [1] that investors who have enough money to buy the most efficient ASICs out there earn disproportionately more, compared to smaller investors who can only afford less efficient ASICs&#x2F;GPUs; in contrast, in PoS every investor has a fixed ROI for each one of their $ (regardless of their total investment); as also shown in that paper, this is the best you can hope for in an anonymous system. In other words, unless you can authenticate users and distribute rewards in a democratic (and possibly egalitarian) manner, the rich will always get richer, and the rate with which this happens is actually worse in PoW than PoS.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1907.02434.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1907.02434.pdf</a>')
