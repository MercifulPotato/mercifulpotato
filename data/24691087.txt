The core defining characteristics of a wiki are:\nEditing, Navigation, Linking, and Searching.<p>Wikis do not have any enforced navigation structure.  Navigation is implicit (defined by Editing and Linking).<p>OneNote, &quot;PerfectWiki&quot;, Teams built in &quot;wiki&quot;, and many many others rely on a hierarchical page structure to function.<p>This would be fine were it an optional navigation mechanism, but it rarely is.  Usually this is also how content is stored and managed.  This ultimately makes the content itself VERY brittle to change, very difficult to refactor, and rarely navigable for long term use.<p>It&#x27;s a much more approachable UI paradigm for beginners, but I have yet to see a large knowledgebase that didn&#x27;t collapse under its own weight over time when using an enforced tree-structure to content.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly rare that knowledge fits into a hierarchical taxonomy.  Doing so at a UI level creates conflict and cognitive dissonance that accrues over time.')
