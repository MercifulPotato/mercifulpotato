Item(by='CogitoCogito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610210196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25701383, text='&gt;&gt; You literally didn&#x27;t contradict anything I said linguistically or culturally (i.e. that China is _not_ some singular linguistical&#x2F;cultural area), which was my point. So no I _do_ have a point and you yourself agreed with it.<p>&gt; I am making the point that the linguistic differences between Romance language speakers are exaggerated and nonexistent in practice, not agreeing with you that the linguistic differences in China are significant.<p>&gt;&gt; You made another point that the fact that China was unified more recently as an empire than Rome means they are somehow more legitimate.<p>&gt; You acted as if China was some newly formed entity, and used it to imply that it isn&#x27;t natural for it to be unified. The amount of times China has been unified far outstrips the amount of times when a single city that&#x27;s not even self sufficient infrastructurally has been independent.<p>So you agree that there is no natural cultural-linguestic reason for China to be unified in its current form? You argue that the reason to support unification is because of China&#x27;s past successes in militaristic imperialism support current unification? I mean if that&#x27;s your point, then I hope more people read this so they understand the facts on the ground. You&#x27;re basically saying that Hong Kong should be part of China because it can take it. Okay that&#x27;s at least a consistent argument. I find it extremely immoral, but well I guess the only thing other countries can do is try to stand against China in that case.')
