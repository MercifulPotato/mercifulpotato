The smart and the powerful win. You&#x27;ll never limit winners to just the smart. If you someone did for a period of time, those smart people would become powerful and decide to limit other smart people.<p>But so what if you did allow just smart people win? Most people aren&#x27;t that smart and you&#x27;d wind-up with a fleecing. So making this game fair isn&#x27;t particularly in the average not-genius-with-nerves-of-steel person&#x27;s interests. It&#x27;s more in the average person&#x27;s interests to have an index-traded-funds go up a reliable amount each year.<p>Fleecing Reddit geeks isn&#x27;t fleecing everyone in America.<p>Edit: My point is - sure it might be against the rules but this affair is between smart speculators and big speculators. Saying it&#x27;s crime against everyone is ridiculous.')
