I don&#x27;t support that and will defend your rights as vigorously as my own, whether I agree with you or not.<p>This applies to Stipe and Paypal too. They can arbitrarily prevent anyone from operating an online business. The libertarian view that you should care more about their right to do that than individuals who will lose their livelihoods with no recourse, is something I&#x27;ll never understand and we&#x27;ll never come to agreement on.')
