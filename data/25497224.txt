Purdue is one relatively well-known university that offers this. What&#x27;s crucial about an ISA (especially an ISA that only collects on income beyond a threshold) is that the university then has a direct incentive to actually improve students&#x27; employment prospects.<p>Then again, the Lambda school ISA selling issue demonstrates the potential to eliminate this alignment of incentives. In universities, there&#x27;s also the issue that colleges might only accept ISAs with students interested in majors with good employment prospects. But if we view university as an investment where the return is better employment, then this is working as intended.')
