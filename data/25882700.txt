I don&#x27;t like the Google business model either. But it works, and in capitalism that&#x27;s all that matters. And they&#x27;ve climbed to the top so why should it be easy to unseat them?<p>Google and Facebook did what any capitalist organization should do. Grow unapologetically, pivot into new areas, absorb competition, and take over the world.<p>In one sense I wish it weren&#x27;t Google or Facebook that this happened to but on the other hand I&#x27;m glad it was progressive companies who treat their employees right instead of the status quo McDonald&#x27;s and Wal Mart and holding firms.<p>You know they are the ones complaining that tech is taking over. Isn&#x27;t it ironic that last years world leaders are upset about being booted from the table by executives who don&#x27;t even believe in capitalism. If that&#x27;s not an enormous &quot;we&#x27;re better at this than you&quot; then I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>I don&#x27;t like FB or Google&#x27;s revenue streams... but that doesn&#x27;t matter in capitalism. They have a stable business model and they deserve to see where it goes.')
