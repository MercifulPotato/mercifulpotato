If it behaves as badly as you say, shouldn&#x27;t it be called a &#x27;method&#x27; or a &#x27;procedure&#x27;?  Because my &quot;fix&quot; for it is to <i>actually use transactions</i>.  I suspect your fix would be the same.<p>Why did you choose to interleave its steps like that, when &quot;Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re telling it like it is, then I cannot argue with facts.  I guess I&#x27;ll stop using DBs, at least until they figure this stuff out in 1973.')
