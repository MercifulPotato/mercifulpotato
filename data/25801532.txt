I don’t remember typing my code being so abstract and complicated.<p>Take php 7+, has good typing features and is way, way easier to understand.<p>All I want is native js interfaces, namespaces and basic types, then F### typescript :)<p>Seriously somtimes as nerds we like something because its complicated and presses our dopamine buttons when we figure it out, but then what is the practical outcome?<p>Problem is there seems to be no middle point? I can’t write vanilla js now on new project, typing structures like json messages is bare minimum.<p>The problem with Ts is even if you don’t want to use it &quot;like an expert&quot; there is no beginner use, you will very quickly run into complicated abstractions and all kind of typescript errors due to fluidity of js language.<p>So I think native js typings is our only hope but when you see how crappy some vanilla js syntax is, what they did with classes, I’m not holding my hopes up.')
