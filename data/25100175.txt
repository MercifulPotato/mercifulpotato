I also run cat5 (or maybe even cat6, don&#x27;t remember) to every room, most even multiple times, just put it in walls&#x2F;cailings&#x2F;whatever worked and all 40 or so sockets work just fine.<p><i>I turn the switch on, the lights go on, I turn it off, the lights go off.</i><p>I run a star configuration for switches and light points, where all switches are on 12V DC and use a &#x27;patchboard&#x27; to hook them to impulse relays which drive the lights. Still switch on&#x2F;light on, but you can select which switch does what, easily hook up miltiple switches to multiple light points etc. Not domotica, but still much more dynamic than traditional build-once-change-never.')
