I didn&#x27;t discuss in it whether a judgment of Martin was justified or not, merely that it exists. The person I originally replied to asserted that there wasn&#x27;t.<p><i>&gt; He simply noted the deficiencies of GRRM</i><p>I agree with this.<p><i>&gt; the resulting consequences of such.</i><p>On this I disagree. My interpretation from the historical references given in the essay are, as I already said, that Martin was just wrong. Meanwhile, the author jumps into saying that Martin isn&#x27;t just wrong, but irresponsible. That isn&#x27;t supported by anything else in the essay other than the author&#x27;s opinions.<p><i>&gt; If you&#x27;re fine with the predicate but have issue with the conclusion, I would suggest you make a counter to his argument</i><p>I have no issue with the conclusion or argument (the argument that the Dothraki have no basis on real cultures, anyway). I disagree with the suggestions made on Martin as a person, and not just because the jump to those have little evidence (or place, in my opinion, which is why the article comes across as preachy) in the article itself.<p>And I <i>did</i> present an alternate interpretation.<p><i>&gt; to lambast his conclusion</i><p>I did no such thing.')
