The main difference I see, so, is that in the case of the retailer delivery windows are defined by the retailer. In the case of vaccines, I have the impression, that AZ informs customers when a batch is ready. And then the customers have to accept delivery within 5 days. That means AZ is driving the whole supply chain to certain extent, and not the states being responsible for the vaccinations.<p>A single DC is sensible, Germany has a total of 16 for the Pfizer vaccine. As states have a lot of independence in Germany, I fear that every state has its own DC for AZ as well. How that middle mile will be organised, I have no idea.')
