Even with unknowns you can still study outcomes and legislate around them. Instead you seem to propose &quot;oh we don&#x27;t know enough, so we should just let it run wild&quot;.<p>I do agree that sensible legislation around this is hard to impossible to do. I&#x27;d rather see some more research into the effects funded before jumping directly into legislation.')
