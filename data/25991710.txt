For instance, there&#x27;s a really cool used technical bookstore near me that I only discovered because I saw an ad for it. Also I would have missed a Humble Bundle that I really liked without an ad.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I probably hate the average ad more than most people (any Liberty Mutual ad just makes me angry), but to say that ads are <i>not</i> useful from a user perspective is a bit too absolute a position; for me, the good ones definitely are useful.')
