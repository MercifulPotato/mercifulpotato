Specifically:<p>- the post really talks about cohesive platforms of all sizes: a topical forum can easily have the same aspects even though members may migrate at any time.<p>- countries might come out of the current ruckus with an understanding that massive centralization and platforms is something to worry about, in a lawmaking and enforcing way, even if it&#x27;s not monopolies. Because it&#x27;s a centralization of power, albeit indirect power so far. Of course, this problem is just what cyberpunk prophesized, so it&#x27;s interesting to see how countries deal with expanding rule of corporations: namely if the US rethinks or confirms its position that corporations are just fine.')
