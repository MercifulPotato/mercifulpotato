The SBC market is a sham, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, with these stupid ARM toys they keep pushing. 100%, the real embedded market has much better equipment.<p>I looked around some for R1606G offerings, and there&#x27;s quite a number of boards around $350. Alas, none use the on-chip 10Gbe ports. I haven&#x27;t found anything under $700 that offers 10Gbe. Even the $350 is questionable, when by compare one can get a 1L sized mini-pc with a 35W desktop chip that will rip it to shreads. Those systems will idle under 10w. Mine does.<p>The R1606G chip you talk about, the R1606G, is 2 Zen cores running 2600-3500 Hz &amp; uses 12-25W. That&#x27;s a bit north of what something like this here Celeron kicks out, but it does match a lot of Chromebox style computers very closely, which is a little smaller than the typical business 1L mini-pc.<p>There is also a R1305G and R1102G which have lower clocks &amp; single-channel in the R1102G&#x27;s case. They also have dual 10Gbe. I&#x27;d love to know what price chips like these come at. I suspect AMD plays the same game Intel does: even though you are getting 1&#x2F;8th the physical chip size versus a desktop, the fact that it has competitive performance in it&#x27;s price range means AMD&#x2F;Intel are still going to try &amp; charge you the same ~$300 they&#x27;d charge for a desktop chip.')
