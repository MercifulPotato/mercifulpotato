In the POV of a product manager, addressing technical debt is an investment with the promise of little short-term returns with the tradeoff of significant risk in the form of downtime and regressions and bugs.<p>And more importantly, technical debt is not a &quot;one and done&quot; deal. There are always more rewrites and refactoring to be done, and the one you&#x27;re doing today might be the topic of technical debt discussions in the future.')
