If half of a molecule is inside a black hole and half is outside, the half inside is necessarily constrained to the black hole, while a molecule outside does not have such constraint. The chemical bonds should be also necessarily broken at least for a moment, since an atom inside black hole can not exert electromagnetic effects on an atom outside black hole. Wouldn&#x27;t it create a bias across your whole body with some really weird atomic &#x2F; chemical consequences?')
