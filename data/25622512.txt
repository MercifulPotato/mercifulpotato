At the same time, in my very limited experience there, they were used for gate keeping both on the authoring side and on the review side. Certainly some level of gate keeping is necessary and intended but I hold the opinion today that RFCs could &#x2F; should be used everywhere and that extra work should be put in to ensure contributions and reviews are fair and welcome. On at least one occasion an RFC had a VP or higher say “no thanks” and then in out-of-band conversations it gets approved. I think I was just too naive and thought decisions and discussions would be very open.<p>Also a couple teams worked without creating RFCs and I don’t think that was healthy, either. That’s the legalistic side of me coming out... if there’s a process for some but not all what are the exemptions and why?<p>Managers would tap some people to write RFCs and would dissuade others. Again, probably to be expected in a large, political org and just something to be aware of if you implement RFCs at your org.')
