I use Prime all the time but never have sorted out the grocery stuff, so I use Instacart.<p>I did once try something that iirc was Pantry. I searched for Pantry items, they mixed in a bunch of stuff that wasn&#x27;t Pantry but wasn&#x27;t obvious about that, and after I filled my shopping cart with various items they wanted to charge me lots of extra shipping. So I backed out and didn&#x27;t bother with it anymore.')
