I&#x27;d <i>love</i> for at least a basic understanding of computers down to boolean logic and the very basics of semiconductors up to the OS level and beyond to be &quot;widely known&quot; by programmers and &quot;computer literate&quot;.<p>At the same time, I know that&#x27;s extremely unreasonable to expect.
