Item(by='api', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604242547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24953951, text='&gt; As a very crass but serious example of that, when I was growing up no one in a place of authority was trying to convince me that I (a male) was a girl whereas children growing up now are having to deal with that.<p>I&#x27;d like to see some statistics on this. Is this a common thing or just something that went viral once on social media? I know people from all over the political spectrum and I have neither seen nor heard of anyone doing this.<p>I feel like you&#x27;re placing far too much weight on an anecdote, and dare I say it appears you&#x27;re being triggered by it. Liberals fall into this trap too, like pushing to ban plastic drinking straws because a pic of a cute animal damaged by a drinking straw went viral on Facebook. In reality banning plastic straws won&#x27;t accomplish anything as that&#x27;s not where 99%+ of ocean plastic comes from. In reality parents forcing gender identities on children that are different from their biological identity is just not a thing beyond an exceedingly small fringe-of-the-fringe.<p>(I agree that this could well be child abuse, though I&#x27;d like to know the details before passing judgement.)<p>In any case, if this were happening to you today you would have the option of approaching a teacher or counselor and reporting that it was occurring and that you were not okay with it. It&#x27;s likely that this would get you a visit from CPS, or some other kind of intervention, in most states. Once you were old enough there are options like emancipation available.<p>Those aren&#x27;t great options, but options exist.<p>In the good old days you&#x27;d have no recourse. There was no CPS. There was no emancipation. Your parents could have dressed you in women&#x27;s clothes against your will or just plain kicked the crap out of you and well, they&#x27;re your parents so shut up and behave. A hundred years ago parents more or less owned their children. While I&#x27;m sure forced gender reassignment was rare, physical and sexual abuse were not. They are still far, far more common than weird things like what you mention.')
