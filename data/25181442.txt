I really can recommend it, does magic to autocompletion, peek definition, snippets insertion and linting TF&#x2F;HCL files.<p>Author of this blogpost have not mentioned Terragrunt [0], while I think it is worth mentioning. It is nice tool, especially if you work on bigger projects having multiple modules and per-environment variables.<p>Also, a tip from a person, who works in team using terraform - use brew&#x2F;apt repositories to keep the binaries up-to-date or at least on the same version as your team mates. I remember at least few situations, when patch update of a terraform binary was crucial to make some issues disappear.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terragrunt.gruntwork.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terragrunt.gruntwork.io&#x2F;</a><p>Psst... I am also using Terraform to bootstrap Pop_OS! with my dotfiles and it is surprisingly nice enough to mimic declarative and atomic NixOS configuration :)')
