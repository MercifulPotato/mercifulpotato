During that time I started two technology businesses, one successful and one not, and I&#x27;ve learnt an okay amount about the &#x27;tech start up&#x27; space.<p>When I practice, I have no record of what I practice, when and for how long - unless I write it out into a spreadsheet or airtable (which is what I&#x27;ve been doing). Time consuming, not standardised and takes more effort the more I practice. Hard to record that I practiced from bar x to bar y. Difficult to manually compute whether I&#x27;ve got good practice coverage over a whole piece.<p>Does anyone know of anything that works like Strava, can passively &#x27;listen&#x27; to my practice and produce a sense of what I played and for how long. Produce &#x27;snippets&#x27; of sound from each day so I can compare day to day (I do this manually right now).<p>I&#x27;m trying to work out whether this is something I could pursue as a start up (and scratch this bloody itch). Thanks!')
