A reasonable one, but still completely unsupported by clinical data - not because data refutes it, but because there is no data. All trials only examined the reduction of symptomatic infection; they didn&#x27;t even try to measure whether vaccinated people were able or not to spread the virus.<p>I would expect your conjecture to be true, but humans are weird, viruses are weird and medicine should be based in evidence, and evidence isn&#x27;t in yet.')
