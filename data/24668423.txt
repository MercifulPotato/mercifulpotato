I&#x27;d prefer for the NUC to handle the tuner part, too, and let the tv simply be a screen with speakers. Or even a screen with speakers, a few extra ports that are routed back into the NUC, an embedded antenna, maybe a microphone and a webcam... there&#x27;s still a lot of cool things you could do as a manufacturer of televisions even if you gave up on the modern businesses of rent-seeking and surveillance. TV manufacturers actually make things, things people want and don&#x27;t feel they can do without. They don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to rely on the financial scams and deception that make up the rest of the economy to stay in business.<p>There&#x27;s already a DRM standard for browsers. We don&#x27;t need TVs to have proprietary bullshit preinstalled on them to have Netflix.')
