I even saw very technical founders fail, who just happened to have skills in a different technology than their team.<p>Such people try to get away with this by micromanaging because they panic, but that&#x27;s usually no solution.<p>That said, it can work if the non-technical founder is lucky and just happens to get a good team, but they have no way to evaluate the required skills themselves.')
