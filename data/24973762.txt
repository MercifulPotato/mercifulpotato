It may not beat the big x86 gaming rigs but I am quite confident that the highest performance laptops of any kind in the next few year will all be ARM based.<p>iMac and Mac Mini are also small enclosures which will benefit from ARM performance wise.<p>All that matters is really watt per performance and dollars relative to performance and there ARM already beats intel. To beat an x86 intel is just a matter of throwing in enough cores.<p>AMD will be harder as their performance relative to cost is better than ARM and intel. But there is nothing special about beating intel at this point.')
