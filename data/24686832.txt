Plus all the commits are found in the order they were introduced to master, rather than randomly interleaved with other feature branches that were built at the same time. Personally I would think any kind of branch cleanup to get the history of a feature branch into a presentable state is a significant price to pay. I&#x27;ve only had to restore a PR branch a handful of times to find the particular culprit.')
