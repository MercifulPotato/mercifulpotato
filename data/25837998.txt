Internally its based on Aurora. But, by my understanding, the SSPL also covers MongoDB&#x27;s API, so this is why DocumentDB has not attained anything higher than 3.6 compatibility (and even its 3.6 compatibility is ish, but that&#x27;s not for legal reasons by my understanding).<p>Amazon definitely doesn&#x27;t want to open source Aurora. Not only is it a massive moat for their cloud, its an extremely powerful database, but there&#x27;s enough evidence to conclude that its so internal-AWS-reliant that it would be almost useless to anyone not running on AWS.')
