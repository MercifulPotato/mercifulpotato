The question is truly:  who decides what&#x27;s true and false.  Today you might agree with the current Fact Checker group.  What if tomorrow Trump decides to be the fact checker.  Rudy Giuliani tried to ban certain art in NYC when he was mayor, because it offended his religion (Catholicism).  McCarthyites in the 50&#x27;s sought to ban anything unpatriotic (from the State Department removing books from libraries to finger-pointing and &#x27;calling out&#x27; people accused of communism, to the visa entry forms that may still exist that ask if you were a communist).<p>We defend the megaphones of the stupid and the fake as an insurance policy.  We&#x27;re wary of giving too much power to those who can yank megaphones away and pick winners and losers, because history itself shows us that the alternatives threaten all of us more than fake information.<p>&gt;It is wrong to think of these platforms as neutral. They are not. They are always choosing what to show to the public based on selection criteria.<p>Oh, but the devil is in the details, here.   How they choose is the critical question that we should be talking about, debating and thinking through.')
