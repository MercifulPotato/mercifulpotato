For the first time we find regulations giving the prescribed coinage alloy: 83% copper, 15% lead, and 2% tin. Previously the percentages used seem to have been on an ad hoc basis. Actual analyses show rather less copper than this.<p>&gt;  By 660, deterioration of the coinage due to forgery had become a problem.<p>(Why is this evidence that the value of the coins didn&#x27;t come from their material? Because in that case, there would be no reason to control their production, nor would &quot;forgery&quot; really be an applicable concept.)<p>This should tend to keep down coin clipping, since you end up clipping off small shavings of a metal that isn&#x27;t worth much in the first place. Why bother?')
