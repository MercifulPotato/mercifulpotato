It&#x27;s not even &quot;<i>knowing</i> non-compliance&quot;, though -- although that&#x27;s almost certainly <i>worse</i>.<p>To illustrate this with an example that most HN readers will easily understand (and which some might even be affected by):<p>The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury recently issued an advisory [0,1] to &quot;alert&quot; U.S. companies of the potential risks of &quot;facilitating&quot; ransomware payments.<p>The TL;DR is that &quot;U.S. persons, wherever located&quot; are subject to heavy civil penalties -- under &quot;strict liability&quot; -- if you &quot;facilitate&quot; a payment from a ransomware victim that ultimately ends up going to an &quot;entity&quot; that&#x27;s in one of the embargoed&#x2F;sanctioned countries (Iran, North Korea, Syria, Crimea, Cuba, ...) or on OFAC&#x27;s &quot;Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List&quot;.<p>&quot;Strict Liability&quot;, by the way, means that you&#x27;re still liable and subject to penalties <i>even if</i> you &quot;did not know or have reason to know&quot;.<p><i>&quot;Oh, really? Oh, well, that&#x27;s too bad. You&#x27;re still liable, pay up!&quot;</i><p>Finally, think about how broadly the vague term &quot;facilitate&quot; might possibly be interpreted (especially by the U.S. Government!) There&#x27;s belief in some infosec circles that this even means that, for example, a consultant who told a ransomware victim, &quot;yeah, you should probably pay if you want your data back&quot; might be considered liable.<p>--<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;policy-issues&#x2F;financial-sanctions&#x2F;recent-actions&#x2F;20201001" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;policy-issues&#x2F;financial-sanctions&#x2F;...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;126&#x2F;ofac_ransomware_advisory_10012020_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;126&#x2F;ofac_ransomware_a...</a> (PDF)')
