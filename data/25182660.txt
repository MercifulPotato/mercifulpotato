Her supervisor (a woman) was up for a promotion. She has worked at the place for 5 years. A guy who was newly hired 2 years back was also up for the promotion but he had more experience for the role (he had worked at a bigger firm and had done work at higher levels before, it&#x27;s a legal nonprofit).<p>These were the only two up for the role. It&#x27;s between work experience and time with the organization. Whichever you value more will probably determine who you choose. The big boss (a woman) ended up choosing the man over the woman for the job.<p>The woman was qualified. No doubt. For my wife and her supervisor, this was another example of sexism, women getting passed over for promotions again. But for the big boss (a woman) or for someone else on the outside, it&#x27;s not so clear. Her leg up was her experience in the org. His leg up was his experience from other orgs.<p>When looking at a situation like this, how can you prove this is sexism? For someone it will be proof positive of sexism. For another it won&#x27;t be.<p>Explicit, institutional sexism towards males is easy to spot out. Towards women, it takes this form, where you can&#x27;t honestly say you 100% know it&#x27;s sexism.<p>So what do you do then?')
