Despite this, Arconic continued to market it as the much safer Class B</i><p><i>&gt; The Irish company Kingspan’s insulation passed one of these tests, which took place on a fake wall made with non-combustible cement. This test pass permitted its use on tall buildings, but only in an exact replica of the system tested. Despite this, the firm marketed its insulation as ‘suitable for use on high-rise buildings’. [...] After the test was passed in 2005, Kingspan altered the chemical composition of the insulation so that it was no longer the same product</i><p><i>&gt; Celotex, a smaller firm [...] its insulation had also passed a test, also using a non-combustible cladding panel, and it too began to market its product as safe for use on high rises. But the test was not as it seemed: fire resisting boards were used around the temperature monitors that record the pass or fail, distorting the result.</i><p><i>&gt; the Local Authority Building Control [...] appears to have written its certificate simply by copy and pasting an email written by Celotex&#x27;s Jon Roper, even including the same typo on the certificate.</i><p>So, among Arconic, Kingspan, Celotex, LABC (or Spectator, if they&#x27;re pulling a Bloomberg) - I wonder if anyone is going to jail...')
