In the 90&#x27;s everyone had a proper PC workstation. But now people have touch screens instead. You wont type long blog posts or participate in lengthy forum discussions using a touch screen.\nIf you would put a graph with PC sales vs pads and phones showing the last 30 years you would see where it shifted from creating&#x2F;consuming to passive&#x2F;consuming. There are still normal PC users, it&#x27;s just that the number have now grown much, while the number of touch screen users has grown exponentially.')
