They&#x27;re very Euro-centric- even in comparison to how a North American uses the same services.<p>Could you expand on this? When you say &quot;ways in which users use OSM data&quot;, do you mean &quot;ways in which American users use OSM data&quot;? What is wrong with OSM&#x27;s geolocation services? What even are OSM&#x27;s geolocation services - i thought OSM was just a map! What doesn it mean for them to be Euro-centric?')
