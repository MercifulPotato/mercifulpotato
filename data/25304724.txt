In 2002, I released a program called Meta-CVS: a wrapper version control system based on CVS storage, and using the cvs program under the hood. With Meta-CVS, you could store permissions, symbolic links and the directory structure itself as a versioned object. Plus do things like imports of code snapshots with automatic rename detection.<p>Meta-CVS uses Makefile to build. Every .fasl depeneds on the corresponding .lisp and is recompiled if it changes.  The CLISP memory image depends on the .fasls and so on.<p>Using Lisp like C in this manner is just fine.')
