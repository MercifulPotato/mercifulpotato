I’m the founder of Ultimate Guitar. Nice to meet you.<p>The situation is this: Musescore.com was about to get shut down because of massive copyright infringement. The future of MS Editor would be unclear under those circumstances. After the acquisition, we’ve made deals with all major music publishers plus thousands of independent publishers to license its offering. The downside of the process is that we had to takedown about 1% of the catalog (however the current offering grew x2 since then).<p>Upside is this:\n1. Catalog is still free for everyone\n2. Downloads are restricted just for copyrighted songs, because\n3. Copyright owners get paid for their content since then\n4. Original and public domain songs have no download restriction \n5. Since acquisition the team behind MuseScore grew x7 times, as well as open source contributor community grew x2.\n6. We are at 3.6 version now, which is the last stable version before 4.x, which is coming this year\n7. 4.x will likely feature major workflow improvements, playback improvements, VST support etc.<p>I’m happy to answer all your questions.')
