And Vim provided the syntax highlighting I needed to write those initial lines of code.</i><p>Sorry, but if you&#x27;re using VIM and command line, you&#x27;re missing all of the best parts of Smalltalk. It&#x27;s like trying to learn HTML&#x2F;CSS by designing web pages in Word.<p>If you want to see what the fuss is <i>really</i> all about, you should download a standalone Pharo VM and latest stable image: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pharo.org&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pharo.org&#x2F;download</a><p>It instantly gives you everything you need to learn and develop things with a modern IDE. It has Playground (better REPL), the famed debugger, the code explorer and a bunch of other things.<p>Then listen to MOOC: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mooc.pharo.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mooc.pharo.org&#x2F;</a><p>Then buy The Blue Book on Ebay (Smalltalk-80: The Language and its Implementation). Absolutely worth it. Yes, even now. Yes, even if you don&#x27;t plan to use SmallTalk.<p>If you need help, join Pharo Discord or use the mailing list.')
