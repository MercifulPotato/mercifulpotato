For example, if you are nine years old, you are in your tenth year. If an array has ten elements, the last element is the tenth element, it is nine elements away from the beginning. We could do &quot;int array[10]; array[10th] = x;&quot; if we wanted to mirror that.<p>We could imagine a language that does the distinction, but I don&#x27;t know what good it would do.')
