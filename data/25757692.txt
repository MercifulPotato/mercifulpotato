I _do_ agree that things are different post-1&#x2F;6.  But I think it has more to do with people finally waking up and smelling the coffee they&#x27;ve been brewing for the past four years.<p>I also agree that there is a huge legal vacuum here that FAANG are having to fill.  We definitely put too much responsibility and blame on these companies.  It&#x27;s way past due that the government set some rules here, one way or the other.  We may not agree on whatever rules get set, but at least they&#x27;ll be rules set by a democratic process rather than the whims of corporations.')
