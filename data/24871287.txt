Their hardware and software used to be synonymous with quality, nowadays their shoddy quality has become a meme at work.<p>&quot;Oops reboot.&quot; - &quot;What did you expect, it&#x27;s a mac.&quot;<p>We&#x27;re looking for the door, and slowly started to introduce windows machines. We were shocked how fast computers got\nwithout apple catching up.<p>Apple used to he one of the pillars of our productivy, nowadays it&#x27;s a liability.<p>And from a developer perspective, they murdered their own App ecosystem.<p>Mac software used to be really really good. But who do you expect to write great apps for 70ct per sale. That&#x27;s just ridiculous. Also, why should I get an iPad pro, if I can&#x27;t even write software on it.<p>They could&#x27;ve dominated the PC market if iPad Os was actually a real OS.<p>I doubt that apple can keep its brand relevant without opinion leaders like design professionals.<p>I mean, c&#x27;mon, even Ive left.<p>Apple is dead, it&#x27;s only a matter of time for the rot to bring it down.')
