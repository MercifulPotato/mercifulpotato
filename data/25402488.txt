Their whole point is that there &#x2F;is&#x2F; an exclusive trade-off, which is different from what they&#x27;re trying to say.<p>If you want my opinion, they both piss me off, just in different ways. The IDE requires me to use my mouse, even with the best Vim impersonation plugins. I hate that, but I put up with it because the autocomplete, syntax completion and indexing just works so much better than the Vim equivalents which fall apart under heavily load. And conversely, trying to edit remotely complex projects is a nightmare with Vim, no matter which distributions I use.<p>Which maybe is a different tone of saying exactly what you are saying.')
