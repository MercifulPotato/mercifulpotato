Item(by='ddlsmurf', descendants=None, kids=[24736900], score=None, time=1602306472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736634, text='&gt; How can _any_ language compile a unit passing a struct Foo on the stack without knowing the size of Foo (and thus having to read, say, foo.h)?<p>by having a runtime that has higher level instructions like &quot;change that field&quot; moved the onus of knowing where the field is onto the runtime. Another answer is that it&#x27;s the difference between needing to parse text everytime and having some binary intermediary description (which both delphi and c# have, compare .obj to .dcu and an assembly). This means there is less work to do when a dependency changes in incremental compilation.')
