Short selling should be the thing that is illegal. None of this nonsense would exist if it werenâ€™t for the absurd nonsense that is borrowing a stock, selling it, waiting for the price to drop, buying a stock, and giving it back. Short selling is absurd. All options trading should be banned by the SEC.')
