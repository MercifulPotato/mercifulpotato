If you make a table with RGB values: #00FF00, #008800, #004400, and #000000, you&#x27;ll see the &quot;lime&quot; green move more towards a forest green.  You&#x27;re not adding other colors, just reducing the intensity of the color.<p>Blue is pretty similar.  The #0000FF blue is pretty different from a nice #000044 navy blue.')
