Saturn V wasn&#x27;t designed for LEO, but it certainly could have dropped that much there. (Skylab used a pretty fair fraction of that capability.)<p>When you&#x27;re comparing launchers you have to pick some baseline target orbit. LEO is a good lowest common denominator, but isn&#x27;t quite fair as launch systems optimized for higher energy orbits (like the Saturn V) lose some of their advantage. But a higher orbit is even less fair to systems designed for LEO; choose anything else, like GEO or lunar insertion, STS would have a big fat 0.')
