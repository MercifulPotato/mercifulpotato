I don&#x27;t mean add more people, I mean to grow the skills and competencies of the people already on it.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that often people micromanage because they don&#x27;t trust their team, but it&#x27;s not <i>necessarily</i> because the manager is a dumb narcissist who vetoes their team&#x27;s brilliant ideas as some of these articles tend to imply (although it certainly can be). Often it&#x27;s because the team is more junior, or missing a critical competency, or simply hasn&#x27;t had time to grow into an area they&#x27;re working on.<p>If you feel like you&#x27;re the only one who can do something correctly&#x2F;to a high enough quality bar, it&#x27;s probably worth teaching someone to do it the way you want. Sure it&#x27;ll be more work in the short term, but ultimately it feels like your goal as a manager anyway is to get to the point where your team basically doesn&#x27;t need your help.')
