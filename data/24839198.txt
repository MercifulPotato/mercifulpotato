The slide is connected to your Stripe account via a webhook, so the revenue figure on screen is dynamic and updates in real time<p>- You&#x27;re pitching an investor with the goal of convincing the investor to give you money, and you&#x27;re recording the conversation in real time. The recording gets processed through some language processing system, and the system recognizes the context of the conversation. You&#x27;re about to talk about your team, but the system thinks that perhaps a better strategy would be to talk about the market size. So, it automatically reorders to slides and makes the NEXT slide about the market size. You hit next, see the market size slide and then talk about it<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a million different creative use cases that we&#x27;ll see in the future. I&#x27;m fairly optimistic that Pitch has a ton of potential to change the general presentation status quo from static presentations, to dynamic presentations')
