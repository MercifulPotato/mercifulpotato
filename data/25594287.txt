That is to say, a New Yorker or Bostonian readily identifies with needing heat to survive, where they don&#x27;t as readily identify with needing air conditioning to survive. So, extreme heat is more &quot;foreign&quot;, more &quot;other&quot;.<p>Also, in the US, air conditioning is more of a comfort factor than a life-sustaining factor. I mean, sure, there are places in the desert that are only habitable due to A&#x2F;C, but there are just as many places across the south that are miserable in the summers, but people lived there 100 years ago, all the same.')
