Yes, Python has many more libraries thanks to it being much older than Julia, same for R. But at the same time, Julia can be used for impressive work that R&#x2F;Python struggle with and which only seem solvable in these languages because of large investments into certain packages by big companies.<p>So I find the fact that many hard problems can be solved very generically and performant with small libraries written in Base Julia much more interesting than countering that much larger and older Python packages with millions of developer hours poured into them are currently more feature-complete. Yes, they are, right now. Why wouldn&#x27;t they be. But does what is being done in Julia with much fewer resources not point to an impressive ability of the language to facilitate such development?')
