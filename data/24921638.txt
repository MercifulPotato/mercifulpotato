And the latency pretty much is unbearable as soon as you move to and from a non-central location (suburb to suburb) or not during peak hours.<p>To further use the computer network analogy, the last mile is generally also a problem. Doesn&#x27;t matter if most of the network is fiber, if my house can only get a twisted pair the network is going to be bad. Same thing if the bus station or train station is 2 miles from my house; it&#x27;s like it didn&#x27;t exist.')
