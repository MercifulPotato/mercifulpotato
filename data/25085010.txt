This alongside being aware of drinking mostly water instead of sugary drinks and keeping snacking to a minimum should lead to more gripability on one&#x27;s diet, since tracking what one eats is much easier to remember when one cooks his own food. If this doesn&#x27;t quite work, perform a calorie calculation once to be sure it lines with the dietary calculators to actually decrease caloric intake.')
