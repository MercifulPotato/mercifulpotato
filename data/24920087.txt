It&#x27;s horrible when a driver is tired, drunk or simply misses something - but on a human level, you can understand what&#x27;s going on. Also, you know the guy at fault and that he will be punished (at least, somewhat).<p>An autonomous vehicle, in comparison, is not relatable at all. Some equation delivered some wrong result, maybe it was something in the training set, so that&#x27;s why the car suddenly drove into you. Bad luck. If you&#x27;re lucky, you get some damage payments from the car company, if you happen to have enough money for a very good lawyer.<p>Sure, as a technical person, I understand some of the possible errors, but it still feels like a complex system that one cannot relate too with hardly understandable edge case behaviour. That&#x27;s probably why we&#x27;re so much more lenient with humans.')
