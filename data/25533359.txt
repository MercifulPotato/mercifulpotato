I am hunt and peck touch typist, at about 70wpm, and use my left thumb for space and left pinky for shift. Otherwise I just use both my index fingers very quickly, but there is an upper limit on how fast two index fingers can move.<p>An unexpected benefit is my hands and wrists are positioned in such a way that I don’t get much strain &#x2F; carpal tunnel. My hands get more stressed from using the touchpad than typing.')
