Plants are good for air quality in the sense that they filter out some dust and exchange CO2 for O2, but they also add to the contaminants, are a frequent source of fungi and other pests, require a lot of maintenance to stay healthy and are expensive in the quantities required to have a measurable impact on air quality.<p>They are pretty though and if you have the time and the room for them they definitely are worth having but $ for $ if your goal is clean air technology is far more efficient.')
