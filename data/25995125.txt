I used to scroll through the front page, open every article with a remotely interesting sounding title in a new tab, usually another tab next to it with the HN discussion that I&#x27;d read after reading the article and where I&#x27;d keep reading quite a while after being done with the article. That&#x27;s bad. Once I started prioritizing I&#x27;d have much more time for meaningful things. Saying no to reading comments about something I actually didn&#x27;t care that much about. Saying no to actually finishing reading an article that I didn&#x27;t really like that much. Saying no to even opening an article just because the title suggested it &quot;could&quot; be interesting but not really my cup of tea.<p>A recent new strategy of mine is to first scroll through the list and then pick the article with the most promising title. Saying no to everything else. I may have missed really good stuff, but the payout is fantastic.')
