That&#x27;s not necessarily true by default. Not to mention, if the speed is okay for the initial request, why not the following requests?<p>The final nail in the coffin for me is that CDNs are a shared resource, if your CDN is getting heavy traffic or otherwise suffering, it becomes your slow point, while your site is fine. I just don&#x27;t see any upsides worth the tradeoffs.<p>If you have scale that demands some serious content distribution, that is different, I would argue you shouldn&#x27;t be relying on public shared CDNs then even moreso. Pay for a CDN service or roll your own.')
