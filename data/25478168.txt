When people are getting 5-6% returns on investments (minimum), 0.4% is still not even stopping the rich get richer effect. Not to mention that it&#x27;s almost certain no one here will ever be touched by this tax.<p>If you&#x27;re going to move where you live or significantly alter where you spend you time because of 0.4% of things above 30M, that&#x27;s a real sign of just how far American greed has gone. The rich will drive themselves right into another french revolution unless they start realizing that taxes need to return to where they were from the 1930&#x27;s-1970&#x27;s. Trickle down economics is a known failure and at this point it&#x27;s a question of when the pendulum will start swinging the other way.')
