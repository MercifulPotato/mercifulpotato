Not everything that needs to communicate exists in a nice parent-child relationship - occasionally you need to communicate &quot;across branches&quot; in a hierarchical tree when there is no other interactions such as collisions etc.<p>You can get a long way with just cobbling stuff together, but eventually you get into growing pains where it becomes a mess.<p>The &quot;best&quot; solution I have so far is awkward &quot;god&quot;&#x2F;&quot;manager&quot; objects that act as glue to let everything access everything. There has to be a better way?<p>The nice with with Unity though is that the logic is in .NET IL so it is trivial to see how people are doing things and learn.')
