You probably meant you \n lost mass.<p>Most people expect to not leave the earth, so for all purposes, losing mass is the same as reducing the earth&#x27;s effect on one&#x27;s body, which is what people feel. We don&#x27;t feel mass, we feel weight, so if we feel lighter, we&#x27;ve lost weight.')
