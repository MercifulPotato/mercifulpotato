When I tried to change the url to 2019 I got a 404, and funnily enough, when I just remove the year from the url, expecting it to go to the latest, it instead redirects to 2017... a bit humorous and sad for a suge a bastion of the internet.<p>That said, here is the relevant part from your link:<p>&quot; Today, the majority of Mozilla Corporation revenue is generated from global browser search partnerships, including the deal negotiated with Google in 2017 following Mozilla’s termination of its search agreement with Yahoo&#x2F;Oath (which was the subject of litigation the parties resolved in 2019.)<p>In CY 2018, Mozilla Corporation generated $435.702 million from royalties, subscriptions and advertising revenue compared to $542 million in CY 2017. 2017 was an outlier, due in part to changes in the search revenue deal that was negotiated that year. Despite the year-over-year change, Mozilla remains in a strong financial position with cash reserves to support continued innovation, partnerships and diversification of the Firefox product lines to fuel its organizational mission.<p>A portion of search revenue combined with grants and donations is used to fuel the advocacy and movement building work of the Mozilla Foundation and its broad network of supporters of Mozilla’s mission. &quot;')
