Of course Tesla is going to be safer than older cars; NHTSA regulations <i>require</i> that.<p>Notably, Tesla refuses to release comparisons of Tesla to cars of similar age or type. You know why? Because their competitors have the same low accident statistics as Teslas driven without Autopilot or &quot;safety&quot; features enabled, and admitting that would kill Tesla&#x27;s safety marketing claims for Autopilot.')
