C is the baseline API for most systems. Your system package manager is already installing C&#x2F;C++ libraries and headers. Most platforms even have standard paths for storing C&#x2F;C++ headers and libraries.<p>Also as a C&#x2F;C++ guy I could care less if the libraries are written in Brainfuck for what is worth, as long as their API stays usable from C, which is pretty much guaranteed. So the idea of a &quot;C&#x2F;C++ package manager&quot; seems strange, and even trying to create a barrier where there was none.')
