You are there either as a tourist, or you are there for business. If it is for business you will need to have a registered business, freelancing doesn&#x27;t qualify.<p>I tried to fly there on a business visa but I wasn&#x27;t able to get one because Thailand doesn&#x27;t recognise a &#x27;self employed&#x27; person as a business.')
