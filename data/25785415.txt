I had one altercation in 2nd (?) grade where we mostly just pushed each other around and then wrestled on the ground.  I can think of a couple times people got in each others faces in high school, but no knock-down-drag-out fights to speak of.<p>It&#x27;s so weird that someone would say they didn&#x27;t go to a violent school, but there were constant fights.  Violence doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;weekly school shootings.&quot;')
