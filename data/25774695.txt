The comments were essentially “Twitter was right to flag Trump&#x27;s inaccurate tweets about the 2020 U.S. election, banning his account altogether was a step too far ... governments, not private companies, should decide on any limitations to freedom of speech”.<p>She missed the fact that freedom of speech in the US doesn’t protect incitement to violence, by law that was decided by the legislature.')
