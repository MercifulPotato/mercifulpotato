For months, I was researching laptops, I am currently 13&quot; MBP user but was debating switching to Windows laptop. However, if it was going to be able to run video games, it was turning into $2000+ purchase. Plus pretty big to be portable.<p>Then I discovered Shadow PC. For $12 a month, I have pretty powerful machine. My MBP is now a simple thin client.  When it dies, I ll buy the cheapest Macbook. Also I use 21&quot; external monitor or my TV to play games. Works great.<p>Also been using it for ML projects but unfortunately they will shutdown the VM if it doesn&#x27;t receive user input. So long running processes require you to be sitting by the machine.<p>I am a big user of iPad and their iPad app is awesome. If I can figure out right dongle tobl hook up hdmi, keyboard, and mouse, I might just never buy another laptop.')
