Item(by='blub', descendants=None, kids=[25250983], score=None, time=1606667384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244584, text='You seem to be hanging on to the &quot;pledge of alliance&quot; discussion with the other guy which wisely decided to cut their losses and stop responding :) You do realise you&#x27;re talking to somebody else now, right?<p>Somebody which merely limited themselves to discussing patriotism, which doesn&#x27;t require pledges. In fact I disagree with such behavior, especially when kids are required to recite them. Such things are typically encountered in undemocratic countries and they are a form of manipulation and control.<p>Patriotism neither requires such things, nor does it mean that those who recite such pledges are patriotic. As I&#x27;ve mentioned before, patriotism for me indicates positive feelings towards one&#x27;s country.')
