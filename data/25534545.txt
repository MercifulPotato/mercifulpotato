The incredible richness and diversity of cheeses across Europe is directly due to them being mostly made and consumed locally in historic times. We would certainly not have that richness now if there hadn&#x27;t been various historical barriers to trade. And indeed, that richness is already dying out as people increasingly buy EU-subsidised &#x27;standardised&#x27; cheeses from outside their own countries and overlook their locally made cheeses.<p>&gt; The infinite variety of French cheeses — one of the finest achievements of French culture — is gradually being eroded and dumbed down. Only one in ten of the cheeses now consumed in France is made with raw-milk or “lait cru” in the authentic manner.<p>&gt; Search where you like in the finest cheese shops in France, you will no longer find a Bleu de Termignon or a Galette des Monts-d’Or. They are among 50 species of French cheese that have vanished, like rare flowers or butterflies, in the last 40 years. Other varieties, like Vacherin d’Abondance and M. Michelin’s hand-made Mont d’Or have been reduced to a single producer.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unherd.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;the-slow-death-of-french-cheese&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unherd.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;the-slow-death-of-french-cheese&#x2F;</a>')
