A real problem in things that aren&#x27;t publicly traded on open markets is hype asymmetry. Somebody who wants the share price to go up can put enormous amounts of time and money into creating the appearance that the stock is worth more than it is.

But there&#x27;s no practical way to bet against them until they&#x27;re publicly traded and we can short them or buy options (which may get hedged by buying or (short) selling stock).')
