What is a &quot;synthetic biology facility&quot; (research center? Manufacturing plant?), who is paying for them, why are there no jobs, why are they in red states, and since when did synbio become a low labor field? If its private sector investing in synbio manufacturing, they&#x27;ll do that wherever the tax credits are. If it&#x27;s the government, they aren&#x27;t going to be doing any manufacturing, and research needs people.')
