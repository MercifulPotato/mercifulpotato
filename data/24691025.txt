Our present-day obsession with reliable technology in healthcare is a very recent development, but it&#x27;s something that has largely been sold to us by industrialists and the oil industry, and we consume it, increasingly, at the cost of the living standards, even the lives, of the poor and those in developing countries. Society has conditioned us to believe that reliable power for safety-critical life-sustaining applications is something that we can&#x27;t live without, but a measured examination of the evidence of climate change means that we must urgently reimagine a future without the growth or even the maintenance of healthy human lifespans for those in the developed world.<p>A modest proposal of my own would be for western governments to introduce climate-safeguarding social credit systems that normalise and enforce the migration to a new intermittency economy, while forestalling the dangers of any dissidence or skepticism that would hold out against the new economic model that this would create. It would help to prepare us for a new society and a new economy that wasn&#x27;t reliant on the old and unsustainable paradigms of food, resource and energy security.')
