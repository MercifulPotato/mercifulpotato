I can think of a few roads where the sharrow abruptly switches from one side of the road to the other, encouraging I suppose lane switches within traffic. It&#x27;s abysmal.<p>I do occasionally appreciate them when they&#x27;re in the _middle_ of a one-lane road, so it&#x27;s more clear that I as a cyclist have equal right to take over the lane.')
