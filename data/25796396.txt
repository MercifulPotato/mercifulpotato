The working poor in this country have been ideologically divided by moral wedges such as abortion for decades now. Few poor republicans and poor democrats would like to admit that they are in the same economic boat, and as a result typically the former votes against their own economic interest on the grounds of their moral principles.<p>For the wealthy in this country, the political footballism is the perfect machine to ensure their position on the economic ladder remains at it&#x27;s lofty heights, and inequality continues to widen by the year. I really don&#x27;t think republicans like Mitch McConnel care at all about an issue like abortion, they just use it to drum up votes from their base in order to further their economic policy goals.')
