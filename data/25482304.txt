I mean, this specific book isn&#x27;t a replacement for Dr. Seuss.  No one is going to buy this for their kids (or new graduates) who don&#x27;t already know the Seuss book.  And obviously no one is going to consume this instead of Picard season 2.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not competing with the original.  But it&#x27;s <i>trading</i> on the originals, which is clearly sort of unfair.  So the court wants to find against them.  But the only tools in the box are these clumsy arguments about &quot;transformation&quot; that would seem to apply equally to this thing if it wasn&#x27;t commercial.  But if it wasn&#x27;t a commercial product, it wouldn&#x27;t have seemed unfair!<p>Basically, the law just needs a clearer standard here for what it clearly wants to do.')
