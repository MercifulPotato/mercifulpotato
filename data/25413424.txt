Right now macs aren&#x27;t closed at all, so honestly the customers they&#x27;ve lost so far (yourself included) are... faint-of-heart? Excessively sensitive? Not sure what the best way to phrase this is. You&#x27;ve effectively stopped buying macs for something that <i>could</i> happen, not something that has actually happened. I would find it incredibly surprising if you install enough unsigned GUI apps for that whole warning + have-to-open-it-with-right-clicking thing to be a dealbreaker for you on its own. And if it was, they could&#x27;ve lost you at any time because that seems like incredibly fickle consumer behavior.<p>An <i>actual</i> closing of the platform though will be a watershed moment.')
