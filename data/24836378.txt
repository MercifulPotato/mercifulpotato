I remember reading reviews of the X-25 like a decade ago and being so excited (it was this anandtech review <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;2614" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;2614</a>). To me it was the dawn of the &quot;common SSD&quot;. Just now I&#x27;ve looked at a bunch of timelines of SSD history, and I suspect the X-25 was similar to many other people. There was certainly a lot of SSD activity prior to the X-25 being released, but it seemed like the only customer facing brand that had an offering before it was OCZ (you can see it in the review comparisons... you can also marvel at the old 10k RPM HDDs... how&#x27;s that for a nostalgia trip).')
