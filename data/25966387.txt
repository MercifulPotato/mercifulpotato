You&#x27;ve got to respect anyone who is a self-made billionaire.<p>But I thought he did a bad job expressing himself in this interview. IMO he should have clearly separated stocks and options at the very beginning, and he should have stressed the difference between them.<p>The counterparty risk is higher in options. A lot of the Robinhood crowd is&#x2F;was playing by owning call options.<p>If professional option market makers step away (which, in my limited study of the market they did), then the only way to make money on an in-the-money option is to exercise. But the risk is huge on a stock that is so volatile. And most of the Robinhood crowd that owned those call options most likely didn&#x27;t have the cash needed to exercise.<p>Peterffy is right that being a counterparty to Robinhood was risky. As proven by Robinhood needing to raise $1 billion in capital on an emergency basis.<p>Of course everything gets even more complicated as soon as the DTCC starts increasing margin requirements. They probably demanded 100% (instead of more typical 2%) on GME stock. Oh shit! Now the stock itself is very hard to trade. So much capital required.<p>Peterffy should have explained stuff like that. But that&#x27;s probably hard to do when the CNBC anchors are asking loaded basic questions.')
