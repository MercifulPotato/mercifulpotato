I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s well founded, could you expand on your thought?<p>The refactoring tools in JetBrains products are amazing for me. Renaming a variable and having all uses within scopes renamed too is great. Renaming classes by patterns is also great. Being able to move definitions to new files and have it update all my imports etc is great.<p>Not sure I see any downsides to optional tools')
