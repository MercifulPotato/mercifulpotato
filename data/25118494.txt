That&#x27;s what &quot;freedom&quot; means: it means people are free to make mistakes. Note, however, that if the corrupt local cops are violating state or federal law, they&#x27;re still liable even if a majority of local voters are ok with it. I don&#x27;t have a problem with, for example, local cops being prosecuted for violating a citizen&#x27;s Constitutional rights.<p>However, I strongly doubt that a majority of voters in these localities are actually ok with police corruption. I think they either don&#x27;t bother voting because they don&#x27;t think it will make any difference, or don&#x27;t know about the corruption because they haven&#x27;t personally experienced the consequences. Even in a large city like, e.g., Chicago, the majority of voters will never have a personal encounter with a city cop.<p><i>&gt; going to a couple levels in governance (state or federal) makes total sense given the systematic nature of some of the problems</i><p>You&#x27;re assuming that the state and federal levels of government don&#x27;t also have systematic problems that would prevent them from fixing corruption. That strikes me as a highly unlikely assumption.')
