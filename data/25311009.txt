I don’t believe more than about 10 million should be able to be passed on to children. Maybe less than that. Just having been born to such rich parents is an opportunity that gives them incredible legs up in society, let alone them getting a ton of money due to the luck of their birth. If a parent that rich cares about their child they have many ways to help them achieve in life. If it is actually possible for a person to be so much better at creating things than another that they deserve billions of dollars, the parent can pass on that skill to their child. It’s hard enough to keep wealth from accumulating without also letting it accumulate across generations.')
