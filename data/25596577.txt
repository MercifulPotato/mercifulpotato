I&#x27;ve gone from Google Photos -&gt; iCloud -&gt; testing out Unraid + PhotoPrism + NextCloud. That is, point PhotoPrism&#x27;s import folder to the NextCloud photos folder. Both hosted on Unraid. And then on my iPhone, have the photos automatically uploaded. Only issue so far is I don&#x27;t see an auto-detect and import option in PhotoPrism so I have to manually click &#x27;import&#x27;.')
