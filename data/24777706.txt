This leads to commercial landlords refusing to budge on a ridiculous price that was determined in different market conditions and as a result will opt to leave it vacant.<p>Taking the lower price would adversely affect their access to financing and could put them under water (they already were) on their loans.<p>Why these agreement&#x2F;loans don&#x27;t take this problem into account to prevent this situation is a total mystery though.')
