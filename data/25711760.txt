Item(by='demifiend', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610262441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711329, text='&gt; Who decides what &quot;hate speech&quot; is?<p>From an authoritarian viewpoint, all speech is hate speech.<p>Left-wingers are fine with &quot;all cops are bastards&quot; and &quot;eat the rich&quot;, but $DEITY forbid you suggest that trans women aren&#x27;t women or that people might decide that gay sex is more fun once they&#x27;ve tried it instead of being born that way.<p>Conversely, right-wingers have no trouble suggesting that anybody who has a penis is a man regardless of whether trans and intersex people find this hurtful, but $DEITY help you if you dare suggest that capitalism is overrated or that Christianity is a crock, or that maybe that Eisenhower guy was right about the military-industrial-congressional complex.<p>The Fediverse doesn&#x27;t fix this. All it does is let instance operators set up their own little fiefdoms and federate with allied fiefdoms (instances with similar opinions on what constitutes &quot;hate speech&quot;) and blacklist dissenters or instances run by people they find offensive.<p>If this doesn&#x27;t bother you, that&#x27;s OK, but let&#x27;s not pretend that many of the people on Fedi aren&#x27;t people who couldn&#x27;t hack it on Twitter, but couldn&#x27;t let go so they decided to make their own Twitter with blackjack and hookers.')
