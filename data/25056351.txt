Schools lacking male teachers does not help either.<p>This trend is visible all over society as well. Where I grew up with semi regular bar fights, today every physical alteration involves the police.<p>Not saying &quot;the old days where better&quot; at all. Just that society has changed to honour the feminine treats much more then the male treats, so I too worry more about the success of my son then about the success of my three daughters (who are in effect, socially &amp; financially significantly better off, although slightly younger).')
