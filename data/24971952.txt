Much more believable. But a week before the election I guess only Trump is an acceptable target. Notice Biden didn&#x27;t get mentioned a single time.. even when making fun of Trump&#x27;s son-in-law, surely there&#x27;s a better joke there about the picture of Hunter Biden with a crack pipe in his mouth that&#x27;s more relevant to the topic. Or I guess, Matt and Trey know that&#x27;s real ;)<p>I give it a 4&#x2F;10 for effort. The first half was pretty funny. After that, it&#x27;s just Orange Man Bad. Comedy is always so boring when there&#x27;s a Republican in the White House.. usually Matt and Trey are an exception but you can&#x27;t win them all.')
