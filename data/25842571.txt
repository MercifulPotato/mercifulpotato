Individual programs could check which file descriptors are open and read&#x2F;write the format automatically. This may also be the best way to leverage the benefits of plain text and structured data and move between them quite naturally as the situation demands. It&#x27;s also really not that hard to write a few basic utils or fork old ones to the new scheme as a proof of concept, but AFAIK no one ever has.<p>While we&#x27;re here I&#x27;d also like to see more experimentation on using file desciprtors with GUI&#x2F;TUI tools. I&#x27;ve had good like using things like vim in the middle of a pipe for data that needs a human touch before being passed through. The suckless world uses dmenu quite a bit.')
