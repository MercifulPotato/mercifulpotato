I don&#x27;t understand why they lock down iOS either. I also don&#x27;t know why they are moving further on locking down OSX over time. I&#x27;m only observing what they are doing and extrapolate. I don&#x27;t care what they are saying because it&#x27;s worth nothing. I rather watch their actions.<p>I really would love nothing more then buy the new Apple Arm Macbook Pro but I can&#x27;t risk investing in this ecosystem when, to me, it&#x27;s quite obvious where Apple stands on this.')
