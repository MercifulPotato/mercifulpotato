If Biden wins a county that is 50&#x2F;50 D&#x2F;R, then they&#x27;re assuming that he will also win a county that is 60&#x2F;40 D&#x2F;R (oversimplifying a bit because turnout can very from county to county and mail-in ballots might have different demographics than in person voters).  However it was a bit controversial that Fox called AZ as early as they did, I don&#x27;t think any of the other TV channels have followed suit')
