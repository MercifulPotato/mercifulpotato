In the exhibition halls of convention centers this is generally not the case as the Wi-Fi is commonly changed for each event.<p>• Warehouses: it can be difficult to provide accurate indoor in large empty warehouses. However, if the warehouse is filled with equipment, shelves or other objects this is less of an issue and indoor positioning can be made to work well.<p>• Any small building, office, shop or restaurant: the basic rule is that if the space is so small you can’t get lost, then indoor positioning is not appropriate for that location.')
