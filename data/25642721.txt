It&#x27;s a good idea and using .cv for CVs is a nice touch.<p>That said, here&#x27;s how your website looks on my 27&quot; 2560x1440 display: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;5dsRIlN.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;5dsRIlN.png</a><p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I have to be harsher than usual with my (granted, unsolicited) feedback now because you&#x27;ve been a designer for 11 years and I find your design - to be blunt - inconsiderate and inconsistent.<p>I hope you can school me on design in general by answering these questions:<p>1. Why is 3&#x2F;4 of my screen empty space, while 1&#x2F;2 of the content is invisible, forcing me to scroll down like I ran out of screen space? Seems inconsiderate.<p>2. Did you make this website for your own use, or for other people to use as well? If for other people, then why are you not accounting for the fact that lightgray on white is difficult to read in general, but especially hard to read for older folks? Seems inconsiderate.<p>3. What are the tiny circles with pictures supposed to tell me on the home page? They&#x27;re just super tiny images with no information or tooltips. Seems inconsiderate.<p>4. Why do the &quot;Create profile&quot; and &quot;View examples&quot; CTAs look like buttons, but the mouse pointer is different when hovering on them? Seems inconsistent.<p>5. Why are you messing with the scrollbar to force me to scroll through the main CV? Seems inconsiderate.<p>6. Why is the &quot;View example&quot; button taking me to a page that wastes my time by showing me the exact same CV that I am forced to scroll through on the main page? Seems inconsiderate.<p>7. Why is the text on the main CV not selectable, yet on the &quot;View Example&quot; page it is selectable? Seems inconsistent.<p>8. Why are the links in the footer so close together? Seems inconsistent with the rest of the spacing on the page.')
