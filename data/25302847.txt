Not as streamlined as a trello, but hey, FOSS and self-hosted. On desktop I can view my tasks and lists with Nextcloud&#x27;s web app, or Thunderbird&#x27;s Lightning addon. With OpenTasks, one task can have a title, a detailed description, a checklist, start and due dates, completeness status, even priority - I usually just use the title, and often the checklist, excellent for groceries and household chores.<p>You could also try Wekan[1], which is awesome on desktop, but I found the mobile interface unusable.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f-droid.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;packages&#x2F;org.dmfs.tasks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f-droid.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;packages&#x2F;org.dmfs.tasks&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wekan.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wekan.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
