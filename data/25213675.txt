Few are giving real thought to how it really impacts the average person because they have long lived above them economically to the point all they can do is pay lip service. Fear is an incredible political weapon and its being used adeptly.<p>The real issue is with schools is we have a perfect scenario for real education reform but we are doing everything but that. Instead we are leaving an incredible number of students behind because everyone is thinking of their political power under the guise of their health and that of the children. Parents are frustrated because many of them have to work because either their job is deemed essential or apparently not as much of a risk; as if the cashier at a grocery store is not more at risk than a teacher.<p>If anything the pandemic is further reducing the trust people have in their elected officials and one can hope it pans out in upcoming elections both local and national. This won&#x27;t be gone even through the majority of next year.')
