Appropriately eloquent. And I&#x27;m not being sarcastic!<p>The number of times I&#x27;ve gone to reply to a post somewhere to tell someone &quot;You don&#x27;t get candy if you&#x27;re a bad boy, go back to your room&quot; but ten other, nicer people have already tried to positively engage...<p>You&#x27;ll be glad to hear I&#x27;m not the one being nice. I flag&#x2F;report, or if a thread is turning sour tell them they&#x27;re on their own if they try to mistreat me. This is why I don&#x27;t mod any communities because too many people would get the same treatment the lamers did on IRC: I&#x27;d kick them out the door and get on with my day. Seems that&#x27;s out of vogue these days.')
