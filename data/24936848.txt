It&#x27;s not deceptive because they have your booking and your money, they can see your order and rebook you in another hotel which the direct hotel wouldn&#x27;t be able to do (this happens regularly when there are problems like the hotel has no room).<p>If you have a corporate discount with a specific hotel you definitely need to deal with the website of the hotel directly, not hotels.com')
