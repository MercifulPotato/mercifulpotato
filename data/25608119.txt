I could explore at my own pace and defeat enemies in many more ways than using my weapons. I could use Sheikah Slate abilities, push rocks, send them marching off cliffs, freeze them then plonk them in deep water, etc.<p>Skyward Sword punished me for sitting still at a desk. BotW didn&#x27;t. I gave up on Skyward Sword partway during the first temple â€” which took two four-hour streams to arrive at!')
