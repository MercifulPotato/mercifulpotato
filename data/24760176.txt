I&#x27;ve been building this tool since summer as I was cancelled my internship in a fintech firm. I&#x27;m having a great time, but now talking with other makers they are telling me I should start thinking about strategies to monetize it. As of now, I&#x27;ve made a virtual coin to keep the balance of the supply and demand. \nWhat do you guys think? Would you suggest exploring some subscription or similar?\nLink: peerpull.com\nThanks for commenting if this resonates with you :)')
