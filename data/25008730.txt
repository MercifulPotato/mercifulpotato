I don&#x27;t have many expenses (rent, phone bill, some lunches, a few hardware purchases) but I would advice setting up an LLC&#x2F;c-corp&#x2F;s-corp on something like LegalZoom (or competitor) then open a business banking account for that c-corp. You then give that business banking info to whoever is paying you. Then you pay yourself from the business account. My bank (FVC) even lets me pay bills directly from the business banking account. I also use a very simple spreadsheet to track income, expenses, and salary.')
