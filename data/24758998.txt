Looking at their faces when I&#x27;d mention taking the bus to a concert as a teen, you&#x27;d think I was talking about performing wizardry.<p>As a city kid I could literally go anywhere I wanted at any time, just walk, hop on my bike, or the bus. My parents left dollar bills in a designated spot for bus fare if we wanted to go somewhere.<p>There was even &quot;wilderness&quot; in the city I grew up in. I grew up building tree forts of dubious structural integrity and swimming in streams. Without adults being involved, just the neighborhood kids. I loved that there were always neighborhood kids, there was always a playmate around - just walk outside and see who was out and about. This was all elementary school age.<p>The good part about &quot;neighborhood kids&quot; is you don&#x27;t get to choose them, they were just whoever lived in your area - so you learn to get along with people you&#x27;d otherwise not hang out with.')
