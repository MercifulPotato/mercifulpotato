It&#x27;s 0.5mm but it&#x27;s a very bold line, especially on smooth paper like a Rhodia pad.  It appears you can get 0.7mm cartridges for it too.<p>They are super classy and IMO great value for money.  However they do have <i>one</i> problem, which may or may not affect you.  The cap doesn&#x27;t like to stay put on the back of the pen during robust use, e.g. sketching.  This happens more with the silver model than with the black model for some reason.<p>For me it wasn&#x27;t a show stopper, it just means I use different pens for bar sketching or, if I really want&#x2F;need to use the Tombow, I remember to pocket the cap before I get going.<p>I&#x27;m also a big fan of the Energel though, just today I was marveling at how thin and precise its 0.5mm line is.<p>If you&#x27;re into the Uni-Ball look I recommend trying the Eye, which you can get in Fine or Micro or Needle.  I guess in the US it&#x27;s called the Vision?[1]  Might be too thin for you and the aesthetics aren&#x27;t for everyone but the Micro is my go-to sketching-and-writing pen for when I&#x27;m out and about and might lose it.  Works much better than the Tombow on toothy papers, like proper artist&#x27;s drawing paper.  They fit very nicely into many spiral bindings too.<p>Good luck with your search!<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetpens.com&#x2F;Tombow-Zoom-505-META-Liquid-Ink-Rollerball-Pen-0.5-mm-Hairline-Silver&#x2F;pd&#x2F;27603" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetpens.com&#x2F;Tombow-Zoom-505-META-Liquid-Ink-Roll...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uniballco.com&#x2F;vision-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uniballco.com&#x2F;vision-1&#x2F;</a>')
