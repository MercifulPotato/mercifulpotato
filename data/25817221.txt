Ever since the pandemic started, 90% of our B2B SaaS platform customers (current and prospects) have asked &quot;do you have a Teams app&quot;. Its <i>sudden</i>; it was not like this a year ago. Its an &quot;end the conversation&quot; question for maybe half of them, similar to how not having SSO was&#x2F;is an &quot;end the conversation&quot; issue in B2B.<p>Thankfully, Satya is only right in the domain of B2B. The web browser is critical software for any use-case, B2C and B2B; Teams will probably never breach B2C in a meaningful way.<p>Worth saying, developing apps for Teams is quite literally the most garbage-filled process we&#x27;ve ever been through. We&#x27;ve dealt with Google Play and Android, we&#x27;ve dealt with Apple and iOS; this is not an overstatement, Teams is a magnitude worse than both of those combined. At their core, most apps are just iframes for a website. But their reviewers actually give a shit about how your website looks. But, they give a shit in the typical Microsoft phone-it-in inconsistent half-assed way. It took us four months to get our app approved, and we&#x27;re an official &quot;Teams Partner&quot; (whateverthehell that&#x27;s worth, it means you get a contact at Microsoft who rotates every three weeks and is woefully undertrained and only capable of giving abstract, vague advice on getting through reviews). This wasn&#x27;t &quot;pandemic four months&quot;, this was &quot;dozens of back and forths with a brick wall&quot;. We&#x27;d submit the package, they&#x27;d complain about a dozen things, we&#x27;d invest dozens of person-hours fixing half of them, dispute the other half, they&#x27;d cave, then come back with a half-dozen totally new things. Repeat. For. Four. Months. We&#x27;d model user experiences after their own apps; nope, against design guidelines. We&#x27;d build one Teams SSO flow; they&#x27;d deprecate the library. We&#x27;d make a change; their guidelines would change. It doesn&#x27;t help that 80% of the devops tech they use to &quot;help&quot; with Teams app dev (App Studio being the big one) literally doesn&#x27;t work. The VSCode plugin breaks all the time. The quality of the entire ecosystem is bad even by Microsoft standards, which are already so low they could win an olympic limbo tournament.<p>We finally made it through, and two of the primary engineers on the project put in their two weeks. I laughed and wished them well, and then I realized that this 1:1 with my boss that just popped up is likely him passing ownership of the project to me. At which point, I will also put in my two weeks. We have 11 engineers total; Teams single-handedly killed a quarter of our product development team. If you&#x27;re ever asked to work on Teams; RUN (if you can). If you&#x27;re ever asked to use Teams; RUN (if you can). It is deeply cursed; it is fundamentally, to its core, anti-user, anti-developer, and only benefits Microsoft and the so-called &quot;Global AD Administrators&quot;. If Teams had existed in 1949, there&#x27;d be a page in the Geneva Conventions categorizing it as a Weapon of Mass Destruction and banning its use during wartime.')
