It also ships with a webmail interface (SOGo [1]), rspamd UI and an admin interface for your server.<p>I used to be a Kolab [2] user and &quot;promoter&quot; for many years but the project seems stalled a bit recently and although it is still being worked on and developed, it is lacking documentation for the latest releases.<p>I have moved to mailcow recently and am amazed at how easy it is to setup and maintain as opposed to Kolab.<p>The thing I miss from Kolab in mailcow is the integrated LDAP storage and custom built UI (if anyone knows a good and reliable LDAP administration UI as a web app, please let me know!), which I got used to using for user authentication in other services. Luckily, there are some efforts in LDAP integration into mailcow [3], although, still not mature yet and not that tightly integrated.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailcow.email&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailcow.email&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sogo.nu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sogo.nu&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kolab.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kolab.org&#x2F;</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Programmierus&#x2F;ldap-mailcow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Programmierus&#x2F;ldap-mailcow</a>')
