There&#x27;s a growing divergence between the spoken French and the written French.<p>Où irions-nous ? Nous hésitâmes... (written French)<p>On allait où ? On a hésité... (spoken French)<p>Writings from the XVIIth century bare little difference to most modern novels. Of course, some words have evolved (e.g. &quot;caresser&quot;  was akin to &quot;praise&quot;, now it&#x27;s more like &quot;pet&quot; or &quot;fondle&quot;) but the grammar and the vocabulary is mostly identical.<p>Centuries ago, the langage spoken was already different from what was written. I think the main difference was that there were many local variations, like shown in the Littré dictionary (1870s). The uniformization came with WWI, then the modern communication.')
