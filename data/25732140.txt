Liberal and Conservative extremists have ruined every online space I have ever been a part of. Whether it&#x27;s someone who can&#x27;t help themselves from calling everyone a white nationalist&#x2F;sexist&#x2F;misogynist&#x2F;racist or whether it&#x27;s people like this trying to use brigading, manipulation, and hate to get their way.<p>I already can&#x27;t watch the news because it&#x27;s just lined with narratives instead of truth and this war of escalations is far out of hand. In my hometown in San Diego, these people are fighting each other with knives, bear mace, skateboards, bikes, and hateful rhetoric in the same places that people used to come to surf. You now have people that have taken over government buildings and people across the spectrum that make regular attempts at excusing it.<p>I am so tired of it. I am so tired of all of you. I am sure dang and company have tools to find these people.')
