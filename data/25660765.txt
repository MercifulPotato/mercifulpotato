They could not but arrive at whatever they arrived at, true of false.<p>Heck, this stands for physics and chemistry too, and all their empirical verifications. It&#x27;s not like someone making an experiment actual has the free will to say anything other than what they were predetermined (by a causual chain of events going back to Big Bang) to say. Truth and accuracy is thus irrelevant, their proclamations and what we believe about them &quot;is what it is&quot;.<p>Now, to step aside this &quot;free will exists&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; thing for a moment, we know so little about the universe, constrained by our IQs, energy available for experiments, etc. (just 400 years ago we didn&#x27;t even know about crude Newtonian gravity equations - much less how it works -, suddenly we think we&#x27;ve mastered most there is), that it&#x27;s laughable to claim with any certainty whether free will exists or not in general.')
