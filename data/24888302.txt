I wonder whether it&#x27;s because studying anything to do with a human brain is hard and we can&#x27;t trust the numbers or if it&#x27;s because of changes in society that caused people&#x27;s personality to shift in a direction which makes CBT less effective.<p>Another theory is that methodology doesnâ€™t matter and the result mostly depends on personal qualities of the psychiatrist.
