I&#x27;ve seen at least one instance where they lowered price and refused to price match sale that hasn&#x27;t even been delivered yet. I think they have data shows that not all people will go through the hassle to return and rebut and&#x2F;or there&#x27;s enough lock-in that amazon.com does not care about frustrating users.<p>Maybe the people who would be frustrated would go through the hassle to return and buy again. I mean if you have prime and you haven&#x27;t opened the box, it is just two more days.')
