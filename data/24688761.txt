You can probably go back to school and get a PhD, this will be way more efficient than randomly reading without guidance.<p>Well the core question is just that: if my goal is to become a researcher, should I just go for a PhD, or is there another way. And also the reason I resigned from my work, to first see how far I can improve my understanding on my own (and how much that can amount to finding a research opportunity).<p>&gt;Furthermore, a researcher do not spend his days to implement state of the art algorithms, he tries to push science a little further in very small steps, implementing is just part of the process.<p>I&#x27;m aware that implementing SoTA is not necessarily research, but still often something done by PhD while PhD to understand&#x2F;test&#x2F;reproduce&#x2F;get insight of a certain SoTA approach, to build&#x2F;modify on it.<p>&gt;Even when you have a PhD, pure research jobs are pretty rare<p>I&#x27;m also aware of this fact, as I met plenty of PhD people at my previous start up(mostly doing the implementation I mentioned above, in their respective field of expertise), although most of them wasn&#x27;t that interested in research anymore.<p>I use research to cover both the process of discovering new and noble things, and finding a suitable SoTA for a specific engineering problem (usually what PhD going to industry end up doing, it seems) because as I see it, it is also valuable &quot;research&quot; in the field of robotics. (For context, my particular interest is in Reinforcement Learning application in Robotics) Engineering application of theory in industries seems like a good &quot;feedback&quot; to the academic community too =)<p>But I&#x27;m aware that my view of things is limited&#x2F;naive, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking for others experience. Maybe I should&#x27;ve been a bit more specific, though!')
