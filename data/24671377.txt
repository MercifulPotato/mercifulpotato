If you want a dumb TV you have to accept poor image quality. If you want good image quality your only option is a smart TV.<p>I still have my Pioneer Kuro LX6090 which is&#x2F;was the most incredible TV at the time. For older, non-remastered content I still prefer it over my LG OLED.<p>However if you want the very best image quality with 4K HDR Blu-rays then you can&#x27;t get better than an OLED.<p>IMHO the best option on the market today for <i>movies</i> are the Panasonic OLED range followed by Sony and LG which are roughly equal (to my eye).<p>If you want it for gaming as well I would recommend an LG though. While the image processing isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> up there with Panasonic or Sony they offer more options and features that next gen consoles will benefit from and let&#x27;s be real unless you&#x27;re a professional I very much doubt you will notice the difference between an LG OLED and a Panasonic OLED but you will certainly notice the 1-2 grand price difference and most likely the next-gen console features like VRR :)<p>I also have a Sony PVM which I have setup for older consoles as games on PS2 and earlier systems look awful on a flat screen (LCD, plasma and OLED) compared to even a mid-range CRT. I managed to pick up the PVM for &#x27;cheap&#x27; a few years ago from a media company that was relocating and selling off old equipment from storage. It is also the best way (imho) to watch most VHS content, especially non-professional&#x2F;camcorder stuff.')
