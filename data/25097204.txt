At some point, you&#x27;re going to have to make that password accessible to the client.  Plus, it&#x27;s arguably less secure because the account now has multiple valid passwords that will work for authentication, and, based on your description, there&#x27;s nothing that prevents someone from using the exact same password over a netcat session from accessing the account.')
