Heck if you learn how math works on computers, it feels like a number trick. Those are reliable.<p>The issue comes when you need to track never ending decimal points. Even if every transistor was dedicated to your problem, you&#x27;d still need to round. So even if you have 32 bits of decimals, there will be rounding sometimes.<p>The human has to decide what to do. Instead of converting the binary to decimal and calling it done, it&#x27;s more important to be consistent and predictable.<p>The issues described in the article arent 5&#x2F;2= 2 billion. The article talks about rounding giving you always even numbers, which you can imagine leads to issues if you are using both float and using logic that involves even and odd numbers.<p>Edit- can someone correct me or add details, I&#x27;m very interested but I&#x27;m not taking ENG 240 again... :p')
