Taking many of the main ideas behind another engine and using those ideas to make your own (with different key features) does not make it the same engine.<p>My saying you don&#x27;t have the &quot;right to disagree&quot; was a response to your ludicrous assertion that an engine can be whatever you want it to be, not what <i>it is</i>. Any ludicrousness coming from that is purely a function of how ridiculous your original response was.')
