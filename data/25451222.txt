Which isn&#x27;t nothing, but... unless you happen to need a helmet <i>and</i> the helmet just so happens to be the right size for your body, you&#x27;d need to sell it, and no one is going to pay full price for a used helmet. I&#x27;d be amazed if you got more than a couple dollars when all was said and done.<p>I suppose you could buy straps in bulk for much less money, but then you&#x27;re basically setting up a helmet-stealing operation... it all just seems like <i>so</i> much work, for very little gain! If you&#x27;re that desperate, wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to invest in wire cutters so you can steal the bikes themselves?')
