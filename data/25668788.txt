Deciding whether atrocities get a free pass or not depending on the country doing it is just nationalism. Somehow considered those atrocities &quot;necessary&quot; due to some misguided Messiah complex is extremism. You&#x27;re judging nationalities instead of crimes, giving murder a free pass when you do it, punishing it when other nationalities do it. At some point you punish other nationalities simply because you already established they&#x27;re bad.<p>&gt; we should still retaliate against China [...] we should definitely still stop China from doing bad things<p>You <i>can</i> retaliate. <i>Should</i> implies an obligation. Since the narrative (yours included) is that you&#x27;re punishing actions (&quot;bad things&quot;) not nationality, not following up with retaliating against your own leadership for the same &quot;bad things&quot; or worse means having exactly that misguided Messiah complex (misguided because you don&#x27;t understand the purpose of your own country&#x27;s actions) as well as holding a healthy dose of double standards or hypocrisy. You live in a democracy which makes all these actions <i>your</i> will.')
