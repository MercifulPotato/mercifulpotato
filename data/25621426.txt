It can do backing from multiple computers to same repository (with dedupping) at different times without a lengthy index rebuilding. You can do this also with an intermediate server if you want clients to have different credentials to the repository (this is also quite difficult with borgbackup), but I haven&#x27;t set up that yet.<p>I guess performance-wise it doesn&#x27;t hurt it&#x27;s written in Go, though I don&#x27;t have good numbers on that because my backup storage is not the fastest available :). It&#x27;s able to do concurrent access on S3 which helps a lot.')
