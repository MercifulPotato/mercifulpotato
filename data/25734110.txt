Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25734386], score=None, time=1610391148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733038, text='IANAL, but I already see one massive issue with the lawsuit:<p>Count 1 is a claim against the Sherman Antitrust Act. By their own citation (see claim 31), they need to allege specific facts that would conclude (1) the existence of a conspiracy, (2) intention on the part of the co-conspirators to restrain trade, and (3) actual injury to competition.<p>There&#x27;s no facts that allege (2). Actually, I suspect they also need to list Twitter as a defendant to properly claim (1) as well, since it&#x27;s Twitter that has the alleged monopoly, and the one for whom the alleged conspiracy to restrain trade exists.<p>Their facts probably don&#x27;t even amount to alleging (1). They basically say &quot;AWS also provides services to Twitter&quot; (okay that&#x27;s not a conspiracy by itself) and &quot;Twitter also had an issue with the #HangMikePence hashtag&quot; (omitting the fact that Twitter did kill the hashtag)--which <i>still</i> doesn&#x27;t allege a conspiracy.<p>I&#x27;m sure some actual lawyers will shortly comment on whatever other gross procedural filings this lawsuit has (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;questauthority&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348700506470952960" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;questauthority&#x2F;status&#x2F;134870050647095296...</a> suggests there&#x27;s quite a few).')
