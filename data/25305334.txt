That is like the definition of one of the legal bases you can use (aside from consent) and definitely does <i>not</i> require consent.<p>The law is quite readable and not overly elaborate, see Article 6(1) of the GDPR: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;?uri=CELEX:32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;?uri=CEL...</a><p>Example, 6(1)(a) says: &quot;in order to take steps at the request of the data subject&quot;, so you don&#x27;t need to have any GDPR checkboxes or banners when you have a contact form.')
