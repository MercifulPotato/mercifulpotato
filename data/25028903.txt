I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re English (or an Irish Unionist), and will point out that the UK has been entirely onboard with the EU&#x27;s most egregious abuses of power. Hell, some of them were the UK&#x27;s idea. (EUCD Article 17 comes to mind.) In this particular case the UK already has local laws which establish a legal duty to decrypt data on command of the government. As far as I&#x27;m concerned the UK&#x27;s hands are just as dirty as any other EU member state, and the problems with the EU are not the institution itself but the member states that make it up using it as a policy laundering device.')
