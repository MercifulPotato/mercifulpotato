I think there’s benefit in open sourcing the components that drive financial services and infrastructure, but believe it’s disingenuous to conflate that with the need for tokenized finance, distributed ledgers, and similar Rube Goldberg mechanizations.<p>To compare this to open source, why did we need Linux in 1991? If you wanted Unix with paid support from a company, it was available. If you wanted free Unix, the BSDs were available. If you were worried about the BSD lawsuits, then it&#x27;d seem more appropriate to encourage this Torvalds fellow to contribute to GNU Hurd, a right proper operating system in development, instead of embarking on a scrappy one person effort.<p>If you trust the rule of law and the financial system, then you are free to continue to use it and ignore cryptocurrency in your life. But what&#x27;s the problem with having an alternative for those that don&#x27;t share your view and wish to develop a system free from the encumberances of trust in third parties?')
