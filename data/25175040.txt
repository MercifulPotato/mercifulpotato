The publisher needs to opt in to having their content served by Google; and the ad metrics, analytics, and login need to be delayed until the user clicks on the result. That can&#x27;t happen without cooperation from the page. Hence AMP. I don&#x27;t even do web development, and the design of AMP is mind-numbingly obvious even to me.')
