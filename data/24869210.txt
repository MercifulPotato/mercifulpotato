You can&#x27;t reverse a small erroneous transfer if you initiated it as the account holder (in contrast with credit card payments in the US for example).<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;m not exactly the first person to buy crypto through the largest crypto exchange in the world (Coinbase) with such a Portuguese bank account.
