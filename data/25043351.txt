I mean like pretty much every instruction has separate source and destination addresses&#x2F;registers, memory caches obviously complicate things, but it seems that processing data from one location to another is the most efficient operation.<p>&gt; Copying state means (usually) calling the memory allocator<p>Sure, I guess if the main conception of moving data around involves not really knowing where it needs to go, and having to figure that out, that&#x27;s somewhat true. But there are many ways to structure computation that minimizes or avoids allocator usage.<p>&gt; unnecessary copies<p>I think this is the issue, if you have to copy first then do in place mutations, of course it&#x27;ll be slower, but you can instead structure your entire computation to process your data from one location to another, then all your points about registers, and L1 cache being fast, holds true while still being able to handle immutable data')
