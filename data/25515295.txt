Or Ford voiding your entire warranty if you install aftermarket lights (this has been clearly ruled illegal).<p>The simple fact that these platforms started out with these anticompetitive restrictions (because they’re smart and play the long game) doesn’t change that these are <i>active</i> anticompetitive actions.<p>Saurik’s lawsuit highlighting Apple adding contractual restrictions, preventing App Store developers from publishing on Cydia, should be a slam dunk case.<p>--<p>A perfectly legitimate example of bundling is Sherlock&#x2F;Finder: Apple added a feature, Sherlock wasn&#x27;t limited in any way.<p>An illegitimate example is Screen Time: when Apple added the feature, they went on a delisting spree banning any other parental control apps.')
