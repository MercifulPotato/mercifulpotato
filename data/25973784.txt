If they decide that the farmers are &quot;oposition funded extremists&quot; (or whatever) it isn&#x27;t.<p>Basically the only solution is the one that is independent on the government and international corporations... be it ham radio, wifi mesh networks, or some other kind of technology. Obviously all of that is easier in developed nations, where everyone can buy an extra router and a handheld radio for a price of a dinner at a shitty restaurant.')
