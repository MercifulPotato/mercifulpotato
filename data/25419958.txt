The issue right now is that subscribing to 100s of different services is both annoying and expensive. What if you could subscribe to a single service, which then would compensate the different services you use based on how much you use them? Sort of like how Spotify compensates artists based on number of listens. Quite easy to solve technically I think, but of course hard to solve socially.')
