And sure, there may be some political differences between their old home and the new place but it&#x27;s more about the lack of respect for where they&#x27;re moving and pushing their old culture onto the new place with no disregard to what made the new place nice in the first place.  Change is inevitable so I can&#x27;t complain about it too much but there are fewer and fewer places to escape to that aren&#x27;t becoming Californicated.  Or New Yorkified.  Or Floridiated.')
