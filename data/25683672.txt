Item(by='jacobolus', descendants=None, kids=[25687773, 25685891], score=None, time=1610106258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25683628, text='As a parent of small kids who just watched the video, I would say 2â€“3 year old seems about right, assuming kids who do a lot of running around. 3-year-olds can move with significantly more grace (the motions are more intentional, fluid, subtle, and steady, and seem less scripted) than these robots, but definitely can&#x27;t do a jump precisely the same 10 times in a row, so it&#x27;s not really apples to apples.<p>Maybe age isn&#x27;t the right measure. I would say that these robots move like a 3-year-old kid who has been practicing a particular motion sporadically for a month or two, but not like an active 3-year old who has been practicing the same motion for a year.<p>If you compare to the kids who do martial arts or gymnastics or some serious sport or whatever, by age 6 or 7 the kids are leaving these robots in the dust. (The robots are still amazing though.)')
