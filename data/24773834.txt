The map has become the territory.\nSeriously, the simulation argument has to be one of the absolute stupidest.<p>Even from a probability standpoint, it&#x27;s not P(A) vs P(B), it&#x27;s P(A and B) that we&#x27;re in a simulation.<p>The amount of energy required to run a universe scale simulation is beyond our ability to even begin to calculate.\nIt&#x27;s an interesting and useful thought experiment, but a terrible argument. I suspect people like Musk popularize it because they want to highlight the real and terrifying risk that humanity will destroy itself.<p>As Occam stated: &quot;Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.&quot;')
