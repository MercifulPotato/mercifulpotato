Bernie is a leftist. Biden is a liberal. Hillary was &#x2F; is neoliberal (which you could also peg biden as, and which we used to call neoconservative).  The democratic party is, on a good day, liberal but actually neoconservative.<p>That is to say:\nLeftist : power to the people. pro social programs, pro election reform, held of the belief that unchecked markets lead to unchecked evil.\nLiberal: pro regulation, socially left. don&#x27;t-rock-the-boat political and economic mentality. pro middle class, pro tax\nneoconservative &#x2F; neoliberal: let the markets run free, deregulate the banks, remove capital gains taxes and push tax burden down the chain to the working class. extremely permissive business laws. heavy focus on socially liberal policies like gun regulation, abortion, and gay rights because it makes for a wonderful distraction while their wall street buddies rob everyone blind and deaf.<p>please stop clumping leftists in with the rest. we hate that shit. there are barely any leftist politicians, and the democratic party spends most of it&#x27;s time trying to get them to shut up. we&#x27;re as mad about it as anyone else.')
