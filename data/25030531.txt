It&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s what&#x27;s inside that matters, and lacking the technology inside the iPad, those other companies had no reason to adopt the corresponding product design.<p>(Except, of course, in the TV and movie industries, where any number of prop designers did exactly that, decades before Apple.)')
