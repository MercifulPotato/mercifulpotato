And instead of just cherry-picking a sentence here or there from the rulings, compare the &quot;requested remedy&quot; and harms alleged in the claims with the potential impact.<p>Or you can just have other folks spoon-feed you what you want to hear.<p>If not, and you do the work, I expect that you&#x27;ll find that these folks are requesting that the courts throw out hundreds of thousands or even millions of votes based on speculation, issues which could and should (and in some cases, were) have been addressed <i>before</i> the election[0], issues which affect orders of magnitude fewer votes than would be affected or change the result of the election, claims of malfeasance that aren&#x27;t actually malfeasance and a variety of other mostly spurious claims.<p>The truth is that while there are always irregularities and even fraud[1] in every election, it wasn&#x27;t enough to change the outcome in any of the relevant states.<p>[0] Laches isn&#x27;t just &quot;too late, you lose!&quot;, it&#x27;s that voters <i>relied</i> on the rules in place and if you change the rules <i>after the fact</i>, you disadvantage&#x2F;disenfranchise voters who did exactly what the rules required.

No.  Was it brought before the 2020 primary in Pennsylvania?  No.  Was it brought before the general election?  Nope.  The lawsuit was filed <i>after</i> two elections.  Millions of voters relied upon Act 77 as the law of Pennsylvania.  Should all those folks be disenfranchised <i>after the fact</i>?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heritage.org&#x2F;voterfraud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heritage.org&#x2F;voterfraud</a><p>Note that the above database has found ~1300 cases of fraud all across the US since 1982.
