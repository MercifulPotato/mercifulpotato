We live in a democracy, and the tax payer is ultimately responsible and <i>should</i> be punished in some small way. We don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to shut off our brains when someone up for election preaches about &quot;law and order&quot;&#x2F;&quot;think of the children&quot; and accuse opponents of being &quot;weak on crime&quot;. Everything from over criminalization to qualified immunity could be wiped with the stroke of a pen if our representatives at the federal and state levels acted. That that hasn&#x27;t happened is ultimately our fault. The very least we can do is pay damages when the result hurts people.<p>Yes there should be more individual accountability too, but power always should go with some level of responsibility. Tax payers have power as well. It&#x27;s very irritating to see people separating themselves from all that and acting so passive. Democracy isn&#x27;t a spectator sport.')
