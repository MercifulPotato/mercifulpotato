Geeks <i>love</i> to cut up other geeks.<p>As the recipient of a fair bit of that stuff, over the years, it has hardened my resolve to:<p>A) Do a top-notch job on all my code; regardless of whether or not anyone else will ever see it it; and<p>2) Not pass public negative judgement, in a specific way, on others&#x27; code (unless, of course, I am planning to use it).<p>Positive judgement is all good. I will sometimes make generalized &quot;kids, these days&quot; or &quot;get off my lawn&quot; statements. I may have specific targets, but I keep things vague.<p>As a manager for 25 years, I learned that carrots tend to yield better long-term results than sticks.<p>If a young programmer releases something that they think will &quot;change the world,&quot; but is, in fact, just another wheel, I see geeks pile on them mercilessly.<p>I feel that it is better to praise the good work, and gently point them towards the previous wheels.<p>But I&#x27;m a fairly abnormal geek.<p>I&#x27;ve also open-sourced almost all my work for the last couple of decades.')
