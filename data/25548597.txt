I&#x27;m member of the clan &quot;why are you creating your own XDR, just use sqlite!!&quot; and have oft jumped to that in technical discussions, so appreciate it.<p>However, what&#x27;s lacking from something like this is a detailed bill of the cost.  I&#x27;d love to see some, <i>any</i> benchmark on a DB with &gt; 10^6 edges to see how it goes.  That&#x27;s the other hand of the equation &quot;just use sqlite and be happy&quot; -- the expectation that performance will actually be reasonable.')
