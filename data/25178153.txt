Everyday it seems we&#x27;re being asked to tip in new situations where there never was such an expectation before. This is really just employers passing their staff costs on to customers.<p>Also, if you have a &quot;tip&quot; jar on the counter at a takeout joint or convenience store you&#x27;re not asking for a tip, you&#x27;re panhandling at work. I really don&#x27;t appreciate the attempt to guilt me into paying extra for a gallon of milk or whatever.')
