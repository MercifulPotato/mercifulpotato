Or harassing them by having their websites deranked and hidden on Google, like what happened to WSWS (among many other &quot;dissident&quot; sites)?  Or simply disappearing them on Facebook and Twitter with unexplained and unappealable shadowbans and account suspensions?  Do you think the widespread establishment push for censorship because of &quot;disinformation&quot; is coming out of the deep concern for people who are being misled?  Its about tightening the screws of narrative control, which used to be near absolute when 99%+ of Americans got all of their information from the 3 major networks and was lost with the uncontrolled spread of information on the internet and social networks.  The powers-that-be want that narrative control back and they will stop at nothing to get it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsws.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;goog-n04.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsws.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;goog-n04.html</a>')
