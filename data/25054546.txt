Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605058182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041245, text='&gt; More money is being forcefully redistributed from people that produce work to people who don&#x27;t produce.<p>I think it&#x27;s a bit presumptuous to declare that the people footing the bill are even most of the time (let alone all of the time) producing more work than the people receiving a net income from UBI.  I would, indeed, argue the exact opposite: your average warehouse or restaurant or farm worker is almost certainly putting in <i>significantly</i> more labor than your average landlord or C-level executive or Bitcoin hodler while receiving a fraction of the income.  This might not be the most popular opinion on a website that revolves specifically around the worship of venture-capital-backed get-rich-quick schemes, but I really have close to zero sympathy for those in the latter category; &quot;won&#x27;t you please think of the poor billionaires&quot; is, frankly, insulting to those actually working for their money.<p>In any case:<p>&gt; Yes, I&#x27;m against any form of taxation for the same principle<p>A land value tax wouldn&#x27;t have this &quot;problem&quot;; it&#x27;s arguably the one form of taxation that ain&#x27;t &quot;theft&quot;, since it&#x27;s actually a service payment (i.e. you pay rent to the government that <i>actually</i> owns land - that is, the basis of a &quot;fee simple&quot; title system as used in e.g. the US and other common-law jurisdictions - in exchange for said government recognizing and enforcing your claim on that land).  Even if it came from income taxes (which I&#x27;d agree would be a worst-case scenario), I&#x27;ve yet to see a single proposal that taxes anyone other than people who can readily afford those taxes.  Taking things to an extreme, a billionaire with a 99% income tax is still overwhelmingly richer than (I suspect) the both of us combined.<p>But this all assumes we&#x27;d be pursuing UBI <i>in addition</i> to other welfare systems; I&#x27;d argue that ain&#x27;t necessary.  That is:<p>&gt; Taxes will increase, pushing businesses even more outside of here.<p>There&#x27;s every indication that the overall tax burden for all but the absolute wealthiest Americans would decrease substantially by replacing existing welfare programs with UBI.<p>&gt; The more money you give to bureaucrats the more they will keep for themselves, the more they will waste, the more will not go to the economy.<p>By replacing existing welfare programs with UBI, you eliminate a considerable amount of that bureaucracy.  Most of that bureaucracy revolves specifically around determining eligibility; if literally every US citizen is unconditionally eligible for a fixed income, we can immediately replace those bureaucrats with a pretty simple system:<p><pre><code>    def redistribute_tax_as_ubi(amount):\n        for c in citizens:\n            c.send_check(amount &#x2F; citizens.count)\n</code></pre>\nAnd from there it&#x27;s just a matter of tuning how much tax needs collected in order to ensure every American can afford basic needs.  And at that point, with that UBI flowing, it then becomes entirely unambiguous whether or not someone&#x27;s poor due to circumstance or bad choices - that is, UBI eliminates that variable, and achieves <i>actual</i> equality of opportunity.<p>As an added bonus:<p>&gt; I think the terrible corporate lifecycle is caused primarily by people not being entrepreneurial enough<p>UBI would directly enable all Americans to pursue entrepreneurial ventures without putting themselves in danger of starvation.  People would be more entrepreneurial than ever when they know that even if their startups flop (because let&#x27;s face it: the vast majority of startups crash and burn) they still have food on the table and roofs (rooves?) over their heads.')
