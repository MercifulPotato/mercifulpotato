It’s possible to have a dominant position and not abuse it, and it’s possible to not have a dominant market position and be cutthroat; antitrust is concerned with neither of those cases.<p>And yes, it’s good for consumers right now to get cheaper stuff; the concern is that stuff might not be so cheap in the future if Amazon is allowed to gain a 99% market share in the segments which it enters.')
