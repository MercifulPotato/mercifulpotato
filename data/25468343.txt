No one&#x27;s ever mentioned it at an interview, but there may very well be interviews I never got because I didn&#x27;t have the credential. At this point, it&#x27;s not worth the time or money for me to get a degree the traditional way. If I could have done it in six months for a few thousand dollars, it would have made sense earlier in my career.')
