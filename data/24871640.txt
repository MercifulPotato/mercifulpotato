Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603473064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24868422, text='&gt; What does a failed prediction about super-symmetry in 1996 have to do with the opportunities of the next collider?<p>There are two criticisms she articulates very clearly:<p>1. SUSY is not a testable theory, as it can always &quot;retreat&quot; to higher energy levels, without any real limit.<p>2. There is no scientific reason to believe SUSY should be true - it doesn&#x27;t solve any real problem with any of the known theories of the universe. There are infinitely many ways that the universe could be different wherever we haven&#x27;t looked yet - we can&#x27;t possibly test all of those theories.<p>The combination of both arguments leads to the following &quot;law&quot;: until we have a theory that solves unsolved problems in physics AND that makes concrete predictions with bounded parameters (so that a failure will explicitly rule out this theory, instead of pushing it endlessly to &quot;maybe at higher energy levels&quot;), we shouldn&#x27;t be paying huge amounts of money to test things blindly.<p>This is the fundamental difference between, say, the Higgs prediction and SUSY - we were looking for a concrete thing that it was necessary to exist for the rest of the Standard Model to make sense; and we knew a clear range of energies where the Higgs must exist; if we found it like we did, we know the theory was correct. If LHC didn&#x27;t find the Higgs, then it would have definitively ruled it out, leading to an explicit need for a new SM.<p>By contrast, SUSY has not been confirmed, but it is also impossible to rule out entirely, and none of our models NEED SUSY to be right - so in the end, experiments for SUSY don&#x27;t achieve anything. We might as well be launching space missions to look for Russel&#x27;s teapot.')
