I&#x27;m one of those types of people where if there&#x27;s an eggshell, piece of bone, stem, or anything else that&#x27;s an unintended guest in my food, I <i>will</i> find it.<p>I don&#x27;t mean for this motive to sound selfish, but it would be nice to be able to enjoy something of the sort (e.g. ground beef) without it becoming meat-flavored chewing gum.<p>Joking aside, I think the potential for a high degree of consistency in terms of texture and flavor would be another bonus.')
