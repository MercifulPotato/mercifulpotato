I&#x27;ll give you a few examples. One of these examples was me, the rest were my friends who also got the EB-1A.<p>Examples - software eng in investment bank building some complicated bond pricing engine with some heavyduty math, software eng in car manufacturer building an EE tool to visualize hazard parameters after car crash, software eng in bio building tool used for genetic splicing,  software eng in pharma building tool for drug identification from trials.<p>As you see, none of these is management. Regular software engineer, usual BS&#x2F;MS in Computer Science, not in tech industry, but in some niche field (typical boring East Coast&#x2F;Midwest&#x2F;Defense Corridor company), building something niche to support PhDs in the team. The PhDs then give you tons of supporting paperwork that basically says your presence in USA is &quot;in the national interest&quot; &amp; if you don&#x27;t get EB1 their whole research will come to a halt. If immigration officer buys into that, you get your EB1.')
