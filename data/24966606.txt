I&#x27;ve seen this story far too many times, and no longer will I say &quot;yeah but it&#x27;ll never happen to me&quot;.<p>Setting up the import was insanely easy, and my Fastmail account is now configured to enable me to send using my Gmail address from directly within Fastmail. Plus after the import is finished, it will still periodically bring over any new emails received to the Gmail account.<p>Fuck you Google.')
