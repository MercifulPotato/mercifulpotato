Deaths and losses per million trip-miles.<p>This is where the momentum will come from.  There will be a day where machines reach and surpass the human level, and we&#x27;ll see a huge momentum towards penalty-boxing human drivers.  I fully expect to call Progressive in 2040 and the hologram Flo will tell me that it costs four times as much to insure me if I have the audacity to retain a steering wheel.<p>I also think there&#x27;s a snowball factor.  Self-driving cars are going to be way more consistent and predictable than human drivers.  That only amplifies as more and more vehicles on the road are self-driving.  Once you get to 90% self-driving, I could imagine things like increasing speed limits and dynamically organizing convoys for efficiency.')
