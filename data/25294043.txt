That means months of avoiding chatter about it at work or in public that could spoil the movie for them.<p>&gt;This decision is the first solid indication that going to theater might not be an option for people like me in the future.<p>I mean, maybe? Perhaps that would depend more on where you live. There will always be a certain portion of the populace that prefers a theater experience, so there will always be that option available.
