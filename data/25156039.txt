While I&#x27;ve reversed the ones that happened in my own family, it took my tech expertise and some research to figure out how to do so (via Google Play, where the refund request button is deliberately extremely obfuscated)... many parents probably just accept the money is gone and move on.<p>Roblox has no real way to know, but I&#x27;d guess a not insignificant amount of their revenue is unauthorized charges. Better protections on parents&#x27; cards may cause their revenue to dry up a fair bit...<p>And that&#x27;s before we get into the problematic nature of pushing a monetized game on kids as young as five years old, who might be incentivized to steal from their parents now at an early age. I could see this company&#x27;s business model getting nuked by future legislation.')
