My flatmate thought I was nuts at the time but as a person often up late reheating things it&#x27;s a considerate thing to do, there&#x27;s no need for a device where you can&#x27;t turn off the sound. Even worse when it continues making noises every 30 seconds afterwards until you open the door. RIP anyone who likes to cook then cool.<p>Microwaves are already loud appliances, I can hear it running from the next room. Meanwhile you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find a toaster that beeps.')
