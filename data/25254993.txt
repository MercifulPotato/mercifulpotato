Although I took courses with proofs, they never really helped (I&#x27;m more engineer than mathematician). Notation is a huge help (and can be a hindrance) in grasping the<p>So Addn&lt;Multiply&lt;Trig&lt;Algebra&lt;Calculus&lt;ODE&lt;PDE... unfortunately, I don&#x27;t consider myself to have really learned PDEs although I can work with them. It&#x27;s interesting to work with someone who CAN solve a novel PDE analytically, since their tool set is larger and they have real intuition.')
