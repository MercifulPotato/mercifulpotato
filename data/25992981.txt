While it&#x27;s one of the most obvious applications, adoption has been curbed through historically high minimum order sizes, where cost is an implicit factor. Some providers require up to a 250 sq. km minimum order area, which already prices out a lot of small time farmers. We&#x27;re hoping to reduce our minimum order area to 1 sq. km. and help enable this semi-neglected portion of the market. One company we&#x27;re excited about in this space is Enveritas, a company looking using geospatial data to push for sustainability within the global coffee industry.<p>That&#x27;s just one I can think of from the top of my head!')
