DRY isn&#x27;t just doing the inheritance dance footgun.<p>I&#x27;ll just add that thinking about future use is a practice inherited from classical engineering (the one without &quot;software&quot;), where you had to plan for the potential future installment of cabling or pipes, before it becomes prohibitively expensive to tear walls down and start anew. No YAGNI ain&#x27;t gonna save your 19th century self.<p>If course, this practice doesn&#x27;t make as much sense to the fast paced start up world, where time to market is more important, RAM is cheap, and your company&#x27;s going bankrupt in 6 months.')
