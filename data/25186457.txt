Considering Apple hardware doesn’t have a Nvidia option and people like me are probably niche to bring their own GPU (even though CUDA exists), it’d be highly unrealistic to think that Nvidia would rewrite their drivers for Metal because the affected users has to be quite small.<p>I hope you’re right, but personally, I don’t trust Apple to allow me to do what I wish anymore.')
