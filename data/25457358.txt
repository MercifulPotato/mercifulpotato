Educational backgroud - master&#x27;s degree in data science after an unrelated bachelor&#x27;s and a ton of self-studying. Tools - mostly Python at work, otherwise Julia&#x2F;C++ and I also know R which I don&#x27;t really use these days.<p>Work is mostly fun and the culture is quite relaxed. The biggest challenge right now (a couple of years of experience) is deciding whether to specialise more in some branch of statistics or get more experience in building stuff and be an ML engineer next. I really don&#x27;t know which of these two paths to take.')
