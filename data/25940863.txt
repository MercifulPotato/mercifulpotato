But that doesn&#x27;t always mean &quot;simple HTML&quot;, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t mean avoiding react or jQuery or whatever HN framework hipsters are complaining about this week - if anything, those popular, &quot;bloated&quot; frameworks are more likely to have been tested on these obscure browsers and have whatever workarounds you didn&#x27;t think of. It might not even mean following &quot;web standards&quot;; frankly I&#x27;ve found writing HTML3 with no CSS, table layouts, and maybe even the occasional &lt;EMBED&gt; works a lot better on these old browsers than flexbox, semantic tags, or whatever the overengineers are trying to push these days.<p>The bottom line is right; rather than posturing, test your site - actually test it - on one of these browsers.')
