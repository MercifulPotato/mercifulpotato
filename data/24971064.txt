All plans on Wistia come with 200 GB of bandwidth then it&#x27;s $0.33&#x2F;GB.\nAccording to their bandwith predictor, for the example you gave 7200 views is equivalent to 202GB so you exceed their limit.<p>Now my point is that it&#x27;s complicated to determine exactly how much a video is going to consume. Each provider has their own calculation. I&#x27;m going on a per minute view time basis instead.\nIndeed if you have only one video in your account, to reach 600 hours&#x2F;month you need 7200 views. But you assume that the video is watched at 100% which is very optimistic. If your video is viewed 90% you have 8000 views. If it is watched 50, 14,400 views.<p>&gt; 8000 views is 224 GB on the Wistia calculator and so it costs you $7.92 more.<p>&gt; 14400 views is 404 GB and therefore you get $67.32.<p>I wanted to test a new approach to pricing. In the future there may be some adjustments to the quantity levels or the addition of higher third parties.\nI&#x27;ll probably add a little calculator on the pricing page so you can test and compare how much hodho would cost compared to the solution you&#x27;re already using.<p>If you have any further questions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to contact me.\nHopefully I&#x27;ve been clear enough.')
