Even Russia can&#x27;t probably beat it. Though when it comes to absurdity Russia is still a contender i think -  for example last year Russia gave 13 and 12 years prison terms to newlywed bride and groom for disclosing &quot;state secret&quot; -  a friend of the groom got drunk and was telling everybody who he is, giving out contact info, etc. The friend is an FSB officer and that is usually not a secret by itself. Well,  the unsuspecting couple posted the wedding photos and video on Internet ...<p>And Russian opposition leader Navalny has been just arrested  right upon arrival back to Russia, for failure to check in with parole officers ... while he was treated for the poisoning in Germany. Because of that failure to check-in his parole may be revoked, and he will get to really serve the time.')
