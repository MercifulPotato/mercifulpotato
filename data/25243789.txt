Of course they are. The problem is your claim that they are somehow primary. There are many other tendencies of comparable weight, and how strongly they are expressed relative to each other depends very much on the individual.<p>Not to mention that when it comes to tribal instincts, there&#x27;s a huge difference between individuals as to what they perceive their tribe to be. Their nuclear family? Their town&#x2F;state&#x2F;country? Their profession? Participants in their hobby? Their &quot;race&quot;? All of humanity?')
