Quite the opposite.<p>When there is no competition the prices are higher. That is one way the consumers are harmed.<p>&gt; I like the walled garden and have no interest in it going away. I like that my mom can install apps and not worry about them spying on her.<p>And you can have your walled garden and your mom can still install apps without worrying if they are spaying on them. Just use apples app store, simple as that. This is a non issue.<p>&gt; I like that developers aren’t allowed to use their own payment processors. I don’t want to input my credit card into your black box payment system that might or might not charge me correctly.<p>You still have the option of using the apples app store. Again, a non issue for you.')
