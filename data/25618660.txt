But I don&#x27;t have a good way to curate a backlog of the IF games I&#x27;ve been meaning to try.<p>The way I tend to play IF is somewhere between reading a short story and toying with a puzzle, or maybe a bit of something else. I&#x27;m happy to lean on hints or walkthroughs to get through content faster. The experience is unique though I wonder if I&#x27;ll ever bother to introduce it to my kids?<p>There are absolutely standout entries in the genre, both big and small, that struck some kind of narrative chord and for which the memory of playing is very clear to me (&quot;Vespers&#x27;, &quot;Anchorhead&quot;, &quot;The Meteor, the Stone and a Long Glass of Sherbet&quot;, &quot;Photopia&quot;, &quot;Shade&quot;, &quot;9:05&quot;, &quot;In The End&quot;, &quot;Christminster&quot;, &quot;Theatre&quot;, &quot;Curses&quot;, &quot;Jigsaw&quot;). It&#x27;ll be a bummer if these things ever totally vanish.')
