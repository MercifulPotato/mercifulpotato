Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602701646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779635, text='&gt; Oculus has competitors.<p>I wish that was true. If that was the case, I would&#x27;ve bought a headset from a competitor in a heartbeat.<p>Unfortunately, while there are many competitive VR headsets out there, I cannot recall a single other VR headset that works standalone without a PC.<p>Not even mentioning the price point of Quest and the fact that it can be used for both PCVR and standalone, thus bringing a superset of features of other headsets. No need to set up lightboxes and being able to just buy the headset and play without anything extra is a value proposition that I don&#x27;t see any other VR headset can provide.<p>Hopefully, the success of Quest will provide a kick in the ass to other manufacturers to make their own versions. Imo, the standalone+PCVR combo with no lightboxes is the future, with lightbox PCVR-only headsets being reserved for highly niche uses.')
