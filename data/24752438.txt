E.g. for Ruby library when I see &quot;9 years ago&quot; everywhere then likely the code needs some work to get it working with the latest Ruby version. But when there is just one &quot;2 months ago&quot; on `lib` directory it tells me somebody came back here to maintain the things. I am not sure if list of accurately formated timestamps would be quicker to scan.<p>Regarding unmaintained projects, usually my next step is to check recent PRs list or Network Graph page to see if there is some more active fork.')
