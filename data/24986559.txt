It can not switch executors like it can in C# where the continuations could be called on an arbitrary thread. In Rust, wakeups for an async task essentially just schedule it for running again, but the execution happens on the previous executor.<p>Anyway, in both models you can have deadlocks. And even if there is no deadlock, blocking the eventloop is still an antipattern, since it prevents other tasks which might be able to make progress from running.')
