Item(by='Broken_Hippo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602689915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775820, text='Like others have pointed out, &quot;socialist democracy&quot; is a thing, and folks trying to pass these sorts of policies are outed as socialists in the US. Like everything else, socialism has a range of ways to see itself through.<p>There are so many little things you just couldn&#x27;t do in the US. For example, the largest dairy coop - Tine - has to distribute goods from smaller dairies. I buy my wine and liquor at a state run store, which is nicer than any liquor store I knew in the US.<p>Health care is so much more efficient and you get things you can&#x27;t have in the US: For example, they send a nurse to your house up to 6 times a day before you qualify for a nursing home. The nurse is free: The nursing home is a percentage of your pension (and everyone gets one). A bonus is that folks live longer than they did going to a nursing home sooner.<p>The state inspects chimneys to cut down on fires. Schooling doesn&#x27;t really depend on the taxes in your local area, though is run more locally (as is some of the health care), and the libraries are nation-wide and can get books from other places.<p>Comparatively, socialist.')
