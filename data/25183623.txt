I know a lot of state schools do this, but it should be more common&#x2F;normalized.<p>As far as I know, this is radically common. Where are you from that this isnâ€™t common? Most everyone goes to community college as prep for getting a four year degree later or do some particular 2 year program. I rarely meet people who do a two year associates just for the sake of it. (As it usually means very little in the marketplace) Usually the people who quit at two years never really could figure out what they wanted to do. (Which is fine)')
