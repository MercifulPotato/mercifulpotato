If it reaches the legal threshold to be regulated, then either they should open up to competition and let the market do the price discovery or be regulated like a utility and have the price set for them. If they don&#x27;t reach the threshold, then they should be free to set whatever price they want, and you&#x27;re free to go elsewhere if you don&#x27;t like it.<p>Of course, the big question is whether the app store reaches that threshold, but I&#x27;m not sure whether they charge 30% or 20 changes anything.')
