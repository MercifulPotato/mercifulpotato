Back when I was in school, I learnt a lot by copying BASIC programs from mags and typing them in and then modifying them. I don&#x27;t think I even acknowledge that early stage much now given that learning strategies have evolved from there.<p>edit: Thinking back to that, it seems to me that one of the attractive aspects of BASIC for interactive programming was line numbers. You could replace any line by typing a fresh line with the target line number instead of going back to edit the program. There&#x27;s something innocent and simple about that.')
