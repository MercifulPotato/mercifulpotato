NPR changed theirs. Take a look and you&#x27;ll see that they&#x27;ve changed it again since you posted your comment.<p>While I have you: if you don&#x27;t stop breaking the site guidelines, which you do with most of what you post, and often egregiously, we&#x27;re going to have to ban you. This has been going on for years and we&#x27;ve cut you a ton of slack, way more than most people get. We&#x27;ve asked you to fix this god knows how many times.<p>It seems pretty clear that you don&#x27;t want to use HN as intended, but I&#x27;d prefer to be wrong about that. If I am, it will be easy to correct.
