Certainly better than in Europe. (See Brexit, see France and Muslims, see Germans and Muslims.) And certainly more so than nearly anywhere in Asia.<p>The problem is that you’re trying to solve a devilishly difficult problem that we don’t want to acknowledge is a difficult problem. When Iraq voted for the first time in 2005, it did so along strictly ethnic&#x2F;sectarian lines. My home country of Bangladesh seceded from Pakistan because even though we were all brown muslims, they were brown Muslims who spoke a different language. Even Belgium to this day had huge economic disparities between French-speaking regions and Dutch-speaking regions.<p>We should seek to build a tolerant multi-ethnic society, but that will fail if, under some false belief in the perfectibility of human nature, we don’t acknowledge how hard a thing we are trying to accomplish. You can’t build such a society if your response to people being concerned about the culture in their communities changing is to call them racist. You can’t do it if you pretend that moderate in-group favoritism is some defect among certain white people, rather than a human trait that is displayed equally by Black and brown people: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tablet-mag-images.b-cdn.net&#x2F;production&#x2F;883104fdaad1810c8dbbb2a6df5a4b6ed7d5036f-2560x1138.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tablet-mag-images.b-cdn.net&#x2F;production&#x2F;883104fdaad18...</a>. You can’t do it if you blithely kick stools out from underneath society without regard to whether they’re serving some critical function gluing our massively complicated heterogenous society together.')
