Item(by='elric', descendants=None, kids=[25424502], score=None, time=1607982857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25421440, text='&gt; &quot;well, it seems nobody likes taking night trains any more, so let&#x27;s cancel them&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a bit more insidious than that. I suspect they were deliberately cancelled so they wouldn&#x27;t compete with high speed rail. HS rail is much more expensive, and can&#x27;t compete with night trains. So night trains had to go in order to make room for for HS rail.<p>Of course, now that all forms travel are much more accessible and affordable, night trains and HS rail might coexist -- if we get rid of cheap air travel.')
