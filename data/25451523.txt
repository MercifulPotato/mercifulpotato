Did you know that it&#x27;s now a 2-axis variable font, with large ranges on both width and weight? Check it out on Google Fonts.<p>And also thanks for the kind words about my writing. I consider education to be a pretty big part of my personal mission, and take care to write clearly, explicitly trying to minimize controversy and misunderstanding (if you optimize for clicks or number of comments, it often takes you in a different direction). And sometimes my blog posts take a <i>long</i> time to gestate. &quot;The compositor is evil&quot; was 18 months from concept to publication, 11 of which were in my private repo.
