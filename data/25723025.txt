Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=[25723558], score=None, time=1610328610, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720944, text='I would say no because I understand the definition of &quot;VPN&quot; to mean something like &quot;host-to-network&quot; not peer-to-peer.  The user connects to some &quot;VPN gateway&quot; so that she can reach a private, remote network.  Further, &quot;VPN&quot; software tends to be application layer.  Every application needs to be compatible with the VPN software&#x2F;standard.  I use a P2P solution that does not fit this definition of &quot;VPN&quot;.  It operates on the network layer instead of the application layer.  Nodes are all on the same Layer 2 overlay.  Unlike, say, creating a Wireguard interface that only provides the means to reach one peer, this creates a TAP interface and a means to reach every peer.<p>The catch is one needs supernodes that are world-reachable, not to pass traffic but just to allow peers to discover each others&#x27; listening IP:port.  I guess as long as one uses a middlemen (hosting provider) to obtain a world-reachable address on which to run a supernode, disintermediation is possible.')
