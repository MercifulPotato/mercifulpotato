They&#x27;re a corporation offering a service in exchange for data-mining everything you do, why wouldn&#x27;t they be free to choose who gets to use the service, and why would they have to justify it?<p>If you, the reader, launched a website and allowed anyone to register and use the service for free, do you feel that you then would be obligated to offer the service to anyone, or that if you denied them service, that you should be required to explain exactly why?<p>Presumably the answer is no, but I&#x27;m guessing most people feel that there&#x27;s a difference between Facebook and just one guy launching a website. I would question where that line is drawn though, at which point, at how many active users did Facebook become public domain?')
