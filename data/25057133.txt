Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25057201], score=None, time=1605089794, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057087, text='This is what happens in my country, public notices from the county get 2-4 pages in the free door-to-door newspaper.<p>I don&#x27;t like it myself, I&#x27;d rather they send me a letter instead, or use the fancy new digital messaging system. But that system is dead in the water I think, because the company that was set up to build it gets to charge for every single message they process; I just looked it up [0], they charge 40 cents per message, about half the cost of a postage stamp. But it means that if the county wants to send a message to all inhabitants of my city, they have to pay â‚¬60.000.<p>No wonder it only seems to be used to send me annual bills.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logius.nl&#x2F;onze-organisatie&#x2F;zakendoen-met-logius&#x2F;doorbelasting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logius.nl&#x2F;onze-organisatie&#x2F;zakendoen-met-logius&#x2F;...</a>')
