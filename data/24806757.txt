By honing the drug to the tumor, and minimizing the effects on the rest of the body, you are essentially able to unlock power on the tumor that would have put the patient&#x27;s life at risk before. \nTaken it even a step further, if you have a system that selectively gets the drug to the tumor, then you can give combinations of cancer drugs that would be otherwise lethal, also preventing the possibility of mutations that would make the tumor unaffected by a single drug. The possibilities are immense.')
