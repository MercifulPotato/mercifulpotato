What is &quot;linear hierarchy&quot;? That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve heard those terms, and I did have a decent Discrete Maths course back in the uni (it did have graph theory and algorithms on graphs). &quot;Value&quot;, on the other hand, is indeed generally understood to mean &quot;a datum with an associated type&quot;, maybe without &quot;with associated type&quot;, pretty much universally since the sixties.<p>As for two different senses, look at the the first paragraph in the &quot;Mathematical Formalism of Ownership Semantics&quot;: it uses &quot;linear graph&quot; and &quot;linear logic&quot; in the same sentence. Unless you define &quot;linear graphs&quot; as &quot;graphs that are described by linear logic&quot;, but to the best of my knowledge, linear logic describes the structure of <i>computation</i> (that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s logic, it describes the proofs and you get code via Curry-Howard isomorphism), not of data. Unless you equate the graphs with their traverses? But again, that&#x27;s all highly non-trivial and non-widespread knowledge and terminology, unlike &quot;value is a piece of data&quot; and &quot;agent is an actor&quot;.')
