Messages sent but never received, no indication of why or what was going on. For my uses anyway, IM needs to be above all reliable - when I send a message I need to know the recipient will get it (and in a timely manner, modulo their availability).<p>Most of my network is on Telegram at my urging because it was the best option at the time, but I&#x27;m constantly looking for something better to replace it (as I&#x27;m aware of the downsides to Telegram). Currently I&#x27;m trialing Element with one of my contacts and I&#x27;d say it might be ready if I can get past the initial setup headaches, but Telegram just works so darn well and is so amazingly fast that it will be very hard to get buy-in for people to switch. Most people are overloaded with IM apps already, adding another one is tough unless it can completely replace and deprecate one they&#x27;re already using. Jami definitely is not that IMO.')
