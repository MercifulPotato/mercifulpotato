I hate systems that require a phone number, as they usually mean that I have a substandard experience when I&#x27;m not on my phone and I can&#x27;t sign my children up so that we have a general chat tool.<p>The only option ends up being massively over the top team style chats like Rocketchat, Mattermost, Discord, or Slack. So we end up back on Hangouts.<p>A bit shit for general family conversation.<p>[Edit] If they do allow signing up&#x2F;in with a username then I&#x27;ll probably be all over it. That would be awesome news.')
