I don&#x27;t think this is a microcontroller trick, as much as a data-resliliency trick.<p>The XOR-trick is how you implement RAID5 most efficiently. A proper discussion &#x2F; interview would probably describe the XOR trick, and then see if the engineer is smart enough to understand the difference between erasure and errors.<p>--------------<p>With a blog post describing the XOR trick ahead of us: now I ask you (the audience): what is the difference between an erasure and an error? Why can this XOR-trick protect against an erasure, but NOT an error? And how does this relate to RAID5&#x27;s known failure cases?<p>But at that point, I&#x27;m interviewing for someone who has passed a data communications class.')
