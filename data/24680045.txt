However, most people that do end up having one. I know a few people whose hobby is independent research and they don&#x27;t have PhD&#x27;s and yet their work is very interesting and could one day make an impact.<p>For example, there&#x27;s Ben from Lunar Homestead (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunarhomestead.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunarhomestead.com&#x2F;</a>) who presented his work (SPORE) at the Moon Society&#x27;s last conference. He&#x27;s done quite a job at educating himself and you wouldn&#x27;t know he wasn&#x27;t certified unless he told you. He&#x27;s proud of it though and tends to tell people that education and contribution to science is something you can achieve if you put your mind to it.<p>If you want to be in a research position alone, I don&#x27;t know what to say. There&#x27;s jobs around that let you work closely with researchers as an engineer. I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of those around lately here in Iowa, especially concerning crops.<p>Otherwise, the alternative is to monetize your research but then you&#x27;ll be doing a LOT more than research. Research would probably be 10% after all is said and done.')
