Java templates are much less powerful than C++ templates. In Java, templates were basically just a convenient way to do type erasure. That&#x27;s better than nothing, but the inability to specialize templates makes them quite limited. In C++, you can define a common base class if you need one, but being able to optimize based on the template type is very useful.<p>Function templates are great for writing concise, efficient math that handles half-precision, single-precision, double-precision, single-precision complex numbers and double-precision complex numbers (and more) with minimal duplication.<p>Templates are also what make interfaces like std::format efficient and easy to use.')
