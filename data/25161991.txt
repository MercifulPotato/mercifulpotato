Item(by='mds101', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1605889835, title='Ask HN: Quick refresher course on DS and Algorithms for an Interview', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi guys,<p>I have an interview scheduled in a week or so. Normally I generally decline interviews if they are the DS and Algorithms type (for a variety of reasons, none of which I wish to go into here). As such my &#x27;leetcode game&#x27; is pretty week. However I now have a pretty interesting opportunity, which unfortunately necessitates a leetcode style interview.<p>Is there a good refresher course on Youtube&#x2F;Udemy&#x2F;any other site, which could quickly get me back to the point where I can start working on leetcode problems?<p>I&#x27;m primarily interested in the DS like trees and graphs, and algorithms surrounding them, since this is something I&#x27;ve never really paid much attention to.')
