This is about to change, but since the 1990&#x27;s, there have been locations in the US where a majority of the population reject this.<p>California was the first, and eventually in 2014 you had Colorado become the first state to wholesale legalize it, in spite of Federal law.  Along with those movements, came a feeling of identity as a Californian first, an American second, that became particularly strong when the Feds raided businesses which complied with state, but not federal law. The people who really wanted legal weed increasingly viewed the Fed as an overreaching, far away tyrant. Imagine what it will be like in states that embrace low taxation if the Federal Govt is controlled for 3 consecutive decades by the party that represents city dwelling voters? Just like the reaction from Californians and Coloradans when the Feds raided citizens in their states for activities made legal at state level, it will help fuel anti-fed sentiment.<p>I think that&#x27;s the risk we run today:<p>City residents are upset with what they correctly view as an intransigent, backwards system that gives too much power to small states and rural residents.  They want to tilt this more in their favor, and correctly state the common sense &quot;every vote should have equal weight&quot; argument.  The issue is that the construct that ties these states together always assumed that each state would have some form of pure democracy, and that the coalition of states would funnel each state&#x27;s democratic desires into the Federal construct that was, by design, not democratic.<p>My view is that the majority of citizens, most of whom don&#x27;t even care to know about US history at a remotely detailed level, and don&#x27;t understand that the system they want will gradually erode the benefits of staying in for many states, and simultaneously raise the costs. Resentment grows, and next thing you know you have a secession movement.')
