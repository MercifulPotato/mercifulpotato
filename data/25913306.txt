Although I think a better goal would be to investigate errors and fraud and determine if the election results are accurate to a reasonable enough degree. (That is, don&#x27;t go in with a foregone conclusion of who won or whether there was significant fraud or not.)<p>&gt;I&#x27;m not aware of any individual claim that was debunked via substantiating evidence. They refused to answer, refused to report it in the media, and ran full speed in the opposite direction.<p>Here&#x27;s one of the big accusations against Dominon in the Antrim County case[1]:<p>&gt;We reviewed the Tabulation logs in their entirety for 11&#x2F;6&#x2F;2020. The election logs for Antrim County consist of 15,676 total lines or events. Of the 15,676 there were a total of 10,667 critical errors&#x2F;warnings or a 68.05% error rate.<p>&gt;The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is of 1 in 250,000 ballots (.0008%). We observed an error rate of 68.05%. This demonstrated a significant and fatal  error in  security and election integrity.<p>Ryan Macias, former acting director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s Voting System Testing and Certification Program said[2]<p>&gt;But that “is based on a lack of understanding of the voting system,” Macias wrote.<p>&gt; Macias told us in a phone interview that the “errors” described in the report are, essentially, entries of alerts from tabulation event logs — and that they don’t mean that something went wrong.<p>So this &quot;68.05% error rate&quot; I think is certainly debunked as not comparable to .0008%. You can&#x27;t compare what percent of a program&#x27;s log lines are warning logs to ballot errors. Also there&#x27;s a math error, 1&#x2F;250,000 is .0004% , not .0008% .<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.9and10news.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;Antrim_Michigan_Forensics_Report_121320_v2_REDACTED.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.9and10news.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;Antrim_Mi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;audit-in-michigan-county-refutes-dominion-conspiracy-theory&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;audit-in-michigan-county-r...</a>')
