When China informed the world that their capital was called Beijing rather than Peking, the world fixed their spelling and pronunciation. Why would this case be any different?<p>And of course there will remain spelling and pronunciation differences. I don&#x27;t expect English to use &quot;Nederland&quot;, but &quot;Netherland&quot; should be fine. Maybe also drop the &quot;Dutch&quot; and replace it with something like Netherlandish or Netherlandic. Because &quot;Dutch&quot; is another weird archaic holdover. Nobody in Netherland even knows why we&#x27;re called that in English. (I suspect it stems from the medieval name &quot;Diets&quot; for a group of predecessors of our language, which stems from well before the country existed.)')
