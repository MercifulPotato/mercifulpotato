While at the very core there is a hint of Black culture, I would say that it&#x27;s viewed through a very, very white lens, to the point that it&#x27;s more of a statement of white America&#x27;s views of Black culture than it is a piece of Black culture.<p>&gt; If they cared about racism they&#x27;d do a remake that keeps the beautiful art and reframes the context a bit.<p>The controversy is almost core to the current interpretation of the movie.  It&#x27;s the fact that the characters (slaves or not slaves, but free men, if you follow the book which establishes the setting as antebellum) seem happy, or at least unperturbed, by their relationship with their master and their status in society.  If you reflect the truth, that they were unhappy and being held down, that seems more like a new movie than it does a remake.')
