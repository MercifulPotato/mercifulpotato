I built a career for 10 years without a degree. I was fine during my entry level and mid-level positions. I was able to outperform people that had bachelors degrees and get jobs.<p>But as I started applying for High-level and VP positions, I found that not having a degree got harder. I was mostly competing against applicants that have Master&#x27;s degrees, and I don&#x27;t even have a bachelors. My dad went back to get his degree at 55 years old. He found the same thing, the high-level jobs are very competitive and not having a degree really hurts at that level.')
