I&#x27;ve had a few as I have celiac disease. Let&#x27;s say that you don&#x27;t have to worry about choking like with a gastroscopy, which I &quot;luckily&quot; had booked for the same day as the colonoscopy. I&#x27;ve never been sedated or had any anesthesia for either, it&#x27;s really only the air afterwards that&#x27;s painful, but that&#x27;s not worse than when your stomach is upset during a flu or something.')
