We should give a positive spin on the potential ways out from my point of view. At least I didn&#x27;t ever hear someone object against planting trees :)<p>I know this wouldn&#x27;t be enough to keep up with CO2 emissions, but it definitely wouldn&#x27;t hurt and it could give momentum to environmental protection initiatives.')
