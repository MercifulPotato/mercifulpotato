But I know the SEC made a few changes in the mid - late 2000s as a result of naked short selling rising to mainstream awareness: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press&#x2F;2009&#x2F;2009-172.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press&#x2F;2009&#x2F;2009-172.htm</a>. It became a pretty big point of discussion for regulating Wall Street which was amplified in the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis.<p>As far as outcomes go, there is this testimony from the SEC chair circa 2010: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fcic-static.law.stanford.edu&#x2F;cdn_media&#x2F;fcic-docs&#x2F;2010-01-14%20Mary%20Schapiro%20Written%20Testimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fcic-static.law.stanford.edu&#x2F;cdn_media&#x2F;fcic-docs&#x2F;2010...</a><p><i>&gt; In July 2009, the Commission adopted a rule which requires that “fails to deliver” in all equity securities be promptly closed out. “Fails to deliver” may, among other things, be indicative of potentially abusive “naked” short selling. “Naked” short selling, which is not per se illegal, occurs when a short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery. Sellers may intentionally fail to deliver as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security or possibly to avoid borrowing costs. Data indicates that since the fall of\n2008, fails to deliver in all equity securities have declined by 63.4 percent, and fails to deliver in securities with persistent and large levels of fails to deliver have declined by 80.5 percent.</i>')
