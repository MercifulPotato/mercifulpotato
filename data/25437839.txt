Item(by='dragandj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608081576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25437778, text='How is &quot;conv&quot; arbitrary? There is a function object that represents a convolutional layer in the network. It is bound to two symbols (because why not). You can either use &quot;convolution&quot; if you prefer full names, or &quot;conv&quot; if you prefer shorter. It doesn&#x27;t represent the operation, but the layer. There are functions (with longer names) representing the convolution operation, which follow cuDNN and DNNL naming schemes.<p>Regarding the magic, I believe you haven&#x27;t read my writings related to this. Exactly the opposite - there is no magic other than usual Clojure-fu, which I explain in a layered way.<p>But it&#x27;s difficult to exactly reply to your critique, because you haven&#x27;t given any example of an approach that would be good Clojure. Ok, give me an example of how you would do it in a comprehensible way (if what I provide is incomprehensible). You don&#x27;t have to actually implement it. Show a non-working alternative. How would it look like?')
