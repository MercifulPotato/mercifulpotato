So allow me to recount from my not necessarily trusty memory.<p>During an investigation of the impact of term limits on the California the times talked with former &quot;long term&quot; members of both the Assembly and the Senate. In that discussion the people who had served for longer terms felt that you needed the time to understand what made a law &quot;good&quot; versus what made a law &quot;bad.&quot; Examples of good and bad were things like it would not be found to be unconstitutional, or its interpretation would be clear to judges who were ruling on it. Things like that. Bad laws are ones that are ambiguous to the point of being unenforceable or are overturned at the first challenge. There was also some discussion of &quot;wisdom&quot; in terms of knowing what things would benefit most from change vs changing things that are easier but less durable.<p>They found that the time clock on legislators terms made them more eager for &quot;easy wins&quot; rather than tacking complex problems. This was especially true of legislators who were hoping to jump into national politics. So while a legislator had the freedom to introduce a bill to solve a tough problem many times over a long career, each time taking into account the feedback from others over how it was crafted, term limited legislators felt they could not &quot;waste time&quot; on something that they would not be able to see through in the amount of time remaining to them.<p>And while legislators have always had staffs that would help in the development and drafting of legislation, in terms of likely being able to get the legislation over the finish line, laws that came from special interests with the promise of providing &quot;good press&quot; to support it are seen as a better bet.<p>By the same token, I am not a California Legislator, nor have I been one (although I have considered putting my name in the running to develop some experiential learning there). As a result I cannot know for certain how much I read about the process is biased in a way that someone who was part of the process would easily spot.<p>Whether or not what I&#x27;ve read about the process is accurate, it is still an area that I am interested in and I find the &quot;dual&quot; between the legislature and initiative writers interesting in its own right.')
