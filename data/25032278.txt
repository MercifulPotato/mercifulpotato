If you turn (rotate) your head, that is computed locally, you just get shown a different part of the picture that&#x27;s already on your device (if you turn too fast, you may get a black cut-off edge until the viewport is updated from the remote machine.<p>If you <i>move</i> (translate), it needs to re-render for paralax etc. and that&#x27;s when you notice it and potentially get VR-sick. So games where you have to move your head a lot are probably not a good match, but e.g. Fallout works great.')
