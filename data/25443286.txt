I had a couple of failed attempts on Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu but NixOS made it so easy to switch to i3 and use XFCE as the desktop environment, which is great when you want to use i3 but not worry about setting sleep settings&#x2F;keybindings for volume and display, etc., so I recommend i3+xfce for anyone wanting to give i3 a try without investing too much time configuring.<p>Also, i3&#x2F;Sway handles external displays well, better than macOS IMO. When a display is disconnected, macOS merges the windows into the laptop display, but on tiling window managers they just stay in the same workspace number, which can be switched to on the laptop display, this is much more predictable and simpler.<p>[0]<p>I switched to Sway recently, the main reason being is that when you have an external display with a different DPI than your laptop display (which in my case is a HiDPI Retina Display), it&#x27;s quite hacky to get it work under X, but it works flawlessly in Wayland. See my user config[1] for more, let me know of any questions regarding program compatibility under Wayland.<p>The configuration syntax is essentially compatible with i3 as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;siraben&#x2F;dotfiles&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;home-manager&#x2F;.config&#x2F;nixpkgs&#x2F;home.nix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;siraben&#x2F;dotfiles&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;home-manager...</a>')
