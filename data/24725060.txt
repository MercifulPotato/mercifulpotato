The interface looks great, it is the UX I want. It boggles my mind why the major cloud providers who have parameter&#x2F;secret management don&#x27;t optimize their UX for the 90% use case of &quot;I have an app, it runs in multiple environments, I want to vary the config by environment, and expose the config as environment variables, all with a simple and easy to audit interface&quot;.<p>On the feature request front, I&#x27;d like to be able to vary the config by location (e.g., region, but could be zone, rack, etc.). It is common to have a production app deployed to multiple regions (as Doppler itself does), and it is likely that 80% of the config will be the same between regions, but there may be region specific settings.<p>Which leads to the next thing I want, a hierarchy of config precedence: app default -&gt; app+env -&gt; app+env+location. So that the common settings don&#x27;t need to be duplicated. Right now my guess is that to use Doppler with multiple regions I&#x27;d create environments like &quot;prod-us-central1&quot; and &quot;prod-us-east1&quot;, but then 80% of the config will be the same between them.<p>Another thing that can be nice is to have a canonical value, and have multiple apps point to that value instead of having their own copy of the value. For example if you have a &quot;production DB host&quot; you can set that once, and multiple apps can point their DB_HOST or DATABASE_HOST at the &quot;production DB host&quot; canonical value. That way when the &quot;production DB host&quot; changes, it only needs to be changed in one place.')
