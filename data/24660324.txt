Item(by='tekkk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601626734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24648363, text='Hah, Michel got me at the end with the plot twist.<p>If I could add a feature to MobX I would add a built-in easy way for serializing and deserializing state to local&#x2F;sessionStorage without having to reach out for 3rd party library (which aren&#x27;t even that good). I think that functionality is very vital for any web app.<p>After that, I guess my biggest issue has been the injection of stores into other stores. It feels a bit dirty and can get messy. Maybe if instead of injection, MobX could offer a context based solution. And then nudge people to build their stores around specific API route&#x2F;data to make them composable and smaller than the gigantic stores they sometimes come to be. Then you could easily separate the part of the store that is about how to fetch&#x2F;send data to the API and the part that formats&#x2F;modifies the data for the UI.<p>I don&#x27;t know, maybe that could work. Love MobX either way and hope they keep up the good work!')
