The exact length of filament that gets displaced for a given amount of gear rotation depends on how deeply the teeth penetrate, which in turn depends on how tightly the gear and filament are pressed together, the filament&#x27;s stiffness, ambient temperature, and probably all kinds of other factors.<p>It seems to me that you could solve this problem in principle by printing a toothed pattern into the filament itself, so that the gear teeth automatically align it to the correct position, instead of deforming it.')
