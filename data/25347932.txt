Or if you want to be around that kind of people (I hope everyone would, upon reflection).  Or if you believe in God (for which I have many reasons that I find compelling, even &quot;proof&quot; sufficient to my personal satisfaction), or if one wants to play the safe side of Pascal&#x27;s wager (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pascal%27s_wager" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pascal%27s_wager</a>).<p>Money is a poor companion compared to trustworthy, unselfish, kind people who know that you in turn can be trusted.  (And my experiences with social security and medicare, as well as everything I have read or studied in years, including the outcomes of communisms, family travel and degrees, language study, etc etc, strongly bear this out--we don&#x27;t want to rely just on institutions to care for us if we can have people who know us and who care, and whom we have trained by our example over a long time to be caring and have a service-oriented mindset of actual considerate love for others.  For example, close and extended family, neighbors, and strangers.  There is no real substitute.<p>Stalin, for one example, had &quot;success&quot; in terms of power, prestige, and something like adoration of the masses.  But if what I read, as I recall, is correct, he died neglected and miserable in a pool of his own waste, surrounded by false friends who cared only when fear required it.  And either way, I think the concept could be obvious.<p>If one just wants pleasure, power, and attention during your years of best health, and to fade &amp; die after you can&#x27;t maintain it, and thinks life is just the law of the jungle (dominate until you are dominated, rule or ruin?), then maybe you would consider that honesty and kindness don&#x27;t matter.  I strongly recommend honesty and kindness, treating others the way you would want to be treated, and a clear conscience for a truly happy life.  Much more could be said. :)')
