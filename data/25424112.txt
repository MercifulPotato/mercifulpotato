At the surface polite and accepting critique, but underneath that putting all the blame on the student that paid a ridiculous 30k for this. Generalised &#x27;most did like&#x2F;benefit from this&#x27; to discredit the specific critique while not engaging with the issue of why the issues weren&#x27;t fixed. Supposedly a 1:10 teacher:student ratio but no one fixed the problems mentioned by op or in the Reddit thread. Do they all only work 1h a month?<p>This post tells me all I ever needed to know about lambda. Clearly an irresponsible organisation more focused on image than value and with no respect for their supposed students.')
