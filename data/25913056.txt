Why, mused the industrial sociologist Alan Fox, would you want to give more prizes to the already prodigiously gifted? Instead, he argued, we should think about “cross-grading”: how to give those doing difficult or unattractive jobs more leisure time, and share out wealth more equitably so we all have a better quality of life and a happier society.” - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2017&#x2F;mar&#x2F;20&#x2F;meritocracy-inequality-theresa-may-donald-trump" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2017&#x2F;mar&#x2F;20&#x2F;merito...</a><p>“Jean Floud, Alan Fox, and Michael Young had a number of commonalities. Jean Floud taught at the London School of Economics while Michael Young was pursuing his PhD. Alan Fox was a member of that 1950s circle of left-leaning thinkers that included Jean Froud and Michael Young. Since all three are now dead, it&#x27;s tough to say which amongst those three coined the word &quot;meritocracy&quot;. Michael Young had already been evincing thoughts along the lines that led to his publication of The Rise of the Meritocracy since 1951. Most references go with Michael Young as the originator of the word. One last thing is certain: The term as coined by one of those three was anything but complimentary. It was instead quite derogatory.” - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skeptics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;34390&#x2F;did-the-term-meritocracy-originate-in-a-dystopian-satire#34399" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skeptics.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;34390&#x2F;did-the-t...</a><p>“the magazine Socialist Commentary (to which Young contributed) the industrial sociologist Alan Fox put the word in quotation marks and defined it as ‘the society in which the gifted, the smart, the energetic, the ambitious and the ruthless are carefully sifted out and helped towards their destined positions of dominance, where they proceed not only to enjoy the fulfilment of exercising their natural endowments but also to receive a fat bonus thrown in for good measure’.”.<p>1. Young says he created the word, and we have no reason to doubt that (as per Guardian link).<p>2. It was used in a negative sense in 1956<p>I think you are cherry-picking. If you wish to disagree with the generally held beliefs, then I think you should pick a better reference than one comment on an Internet page.')
