As soon as there is one negative article two positive must pop out to calm the Apple fanboys.<p>And no, saying &quot;if you don&#x27;t like the platform then don&#x27;t use it&quot; is not a valid argument. Thank God that it is not up to us on HN to decide what Apple can do, but to the court of law, at least I am putting my trust in the EU..')
