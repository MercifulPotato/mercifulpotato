He never attacked them for that. He debunked the nonsense that Tom Ritter was posting. The Tor Project never even considered using hardened_malloc either. I suggested that Whonix use hardened_malloc and so HulaHoop (another Whonix developer) asked if this could affect web browser fingerprinting on the mailing list. No Tor Project developer made any indication that they wanted to include hardened_malloc - quite the opposite.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.torproject.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;tor-dev&#x2F;2019-August&#x2F;013977.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.torproject.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;tor-dev&#x2F;2019-August&#x2F;0...</a><p>Have you even read these links or do you just want to mindlessly promote Copperhead?')
