Conway&#x27;s rules are &quot;simpler&quot; but far more rigid (e.g. tractable&#x2F;computable). In real life, we deal with not just plain ol&#x27; turbulence (Navierâ€“Stokes three-dimensional existence is yet to be proved), but also quantum effects (some of which might also not be computable, such as entropy in a Hamiltonian system).')
