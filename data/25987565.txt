I don&#x27;t think that analogy works. In the end, if your assets plummet in value, you don&#x27;t owe RH all the money because you have already paid them it, through a bank transfer or stock stale which is already completed at a known price before you could spend those funds.<p>It&#x27;s like a mortgage with a 100% deposit. You might technically owe money at some point, but you have already covered it completely. And the bank isn&#x27;t going to sell your house because they know the full value of the mortgage in cash is already on the way to them.')
