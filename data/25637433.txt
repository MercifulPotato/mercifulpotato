You can trade it for all sorts of things. Some of them directly. Some you make a trade. But it&#x27;s super liquid; accepted more widely than a lot of country-specific currencies (e.g. I could pay my friends in BTC because they can use BTC, but they&#x27;re not going to take rubles).<p>To your questions:\n1. You can&#x27;t know how many shares there are <i>going</i> to be for companies. Even if you choose to use some company&#x27;s stock as a long term store of value, that company will eventually fail at making profit and will issue new shares.<p>2. If the US banned BTC, it&#x27;s easy to move overseas with it; memorize the key (not easy, but possible) and just spend the money when you get overseas. Or if you&#x27;re going to stay in the US, you could just use it the way the dark web already does (not totally clear on how all that works, but clearly it does).')
