Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=[24678636], score=None, time=1601814962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678474, text='&gt;Child abuse is a physical act and isn&#x27;t speech.<p>A video is a form of expression that falls under speech for all intents and purposes. There is no general caveat to freedom of speech which states that one cannot create a video of some illegal act. Child pornography seems to be the only exception in the US.<p>Further, metaphysically, &#x27;physical acts&#x27; such as burning flags fall under freedom of expression, and all physical actions are themselves expressive. We prohibit child abuse because it is abuse, not because it is a physical act and therefore not speech.<p>The expression of copyrighted material, likewise, is speech. Disney is exercising its right to free speech by releasing a movie, even if that movie falls under copyright. Just as in the case of child porn, copying and&#x2F;or distributing such media is a restriction on speech, albeit a widely accepted one.<p>To me, there is no way to argue that child porn and unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material isn&#x27;t a kind of speech, or at least a kind of expression. It is absolutely speech, just as sharing a video of a murder or theft is speech, and just as sharing some public domain music is speech, and it is also speech that most people agree should be restricted.')
