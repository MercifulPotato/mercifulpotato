Python is a very flexible language that allows you to do all sorts of things, even if there&#x27;s a preferred, <i>pythonic</i> way. Reading it can be very hard depending on who wrote it ( it&#x27;s even worse if the person is very good with Python, because then they&#x27;d take non-obvious shortcuts )<p>Case in point, Golang. One of its raison d&#x27;Ãªtre is because Python was too complex to control and make readable, hence a language that doesn&#x27;t give you much choice and enforces good practices ( refusing to compile when you have unused variables or imports for instance).')
