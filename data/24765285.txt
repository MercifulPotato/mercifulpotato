This has happened a few times in the last months - including the <i>desktop</i> wanting to uninstall itself.<p>Of course I know how to behave in that context, and I don&#x27;t want to sound ungrateful since I get all of this quality software for free, but it somewhat saddens me that I still can&#x27;t recommend these kinds of distros to my family.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;9OeZsjW" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;9OeZsjW</a>')
