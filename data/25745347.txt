Item(by='stareatgoats', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610450290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25744178, text='First of all we don&#x27;t know the details here: quite possibly this could be one of the following (non-exhaustive): either a overzealous and politically motivated MAGA moderator who thought that barring Ron Paul could be a great way to make a point and cause a backlash that swings the pendulum back to giving conspiracy nuts a free rein again. Or, a politically ignorant moderator that wanted to score some points for achieving a perceived but misunderstood, objective. Or, an automated response to a coordinated flood of reports by an anti-libertarian brigade. Or, an automated response to a flood of comments calling for the execution of the VP, a flood of pornographic pictures by a community brigade or the like. Or, it could be a conscious effort by top brass on FB to punish Ron Paul on their platform for criticizing tech censorship. Out of which the last one seems the least probable, but in lieu of an official and forthright response from FB everyone is free to speculate wildly.<p>But agree, it is ironic that Ron Paul complains about it. It is almost as if he really wants FB to behave like a public utility type service. Maybe it&#x27;s time they did.')
