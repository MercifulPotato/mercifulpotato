IBM is exceptionally credible when it comes to actually putting hardware in your DCs.<p>This is why I wasn’t very excited by Altra Max benchmarks. Eventually we will have ARM suppliers that can churn out motherboards and associated components with the kind of magnitude that can put a dent in x86 usage, but in the meantime, the only company that seems to be doing it is Amazon, who uses their own custom ARM server designs.<p>Given enough time, suppliers for ARM servers will rise up, if the processors are competitive, but that won’t happen overnight. Certainly not just because of one new CPU.')
