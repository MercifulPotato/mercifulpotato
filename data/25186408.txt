The migration from 0.11 to 0.12 was a PITA and if you&#x27;re using any third party modules or resources, they still don&#x27;t have consistent support for 0.13. Usung 0.12 currently gives you the most consistent experience.<p>This is not bashing TF, it&#x27;s just reality. I wish I had time to update everything to 0.13. The third party provider support alone makes it valuable.')
