Item(by='oramit', descendants=None, kids=[25599914], score=None, time=1609443484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595547, text='I completely disagree. Downvotes and upvotes are the entire reason why I come here. They are not perfect but it&#x27;s a relatively simple way to moderate content. I don&#x27;t want to see every article submitted to this site or read inane comments. As a niche site there is still a good signal to noise ratio with the discussion here. Generally speaking the community does a good job of policing itself and I can&#x27;t see how removing the downvote feature will improve anything.<p>I agree that downvotes are crude so instead of removing them you could improve them. How about when you downvote you have to choose a reason eg:\n1. Comment is off-topic\n2. Poor argument &#x2F; source\n3. Combatitive &#x2F; abusive<p>Side note - there is no internet discourse more eye-rolling than whining about how you can&#x27;t express an &quot;unpopular&quot; idea. Just say what you want to say - I swear you are significantly less edgy than you think.<p>Also, you&#x27;re not allowed to downvote this comment. That would be suppressing my speech and such a chilling effect is disturbing.')
