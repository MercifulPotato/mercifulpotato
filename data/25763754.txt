Filling out codes so that insurance pays for things is a skill that good doctors develop rapidly. The proper codes can also change rapidly, and often there is no easy way to find out what price a procedure is or how much insurance will pay for a particular code. MDs do usually have a hand up on others in figuring this out because healthcare and insurance companies will return their calls. (They also discuss it among themselves)<p>If you are not an MD it may take 3-4weeks to find out what a code costs and what coverage will be. They&#x27;ll call you about the single code and coverage that you requested, when they get around to it. However, if they have mis-billed you (eg 45min for a 15min visit) then you can get them to reverse and rebill the procedure. Personal experience.')
