They will, for instance, refuse to bring up that they have another job offer in a salary negotiation because they feel it&#x27;s &quot;unfair&quot;.<p>One case of this was a friend who doesn&#x27;t want to leave a job where they&#x27;re being made to work 12+ hour days because &quot;they need me and the company might fail if I leave&quot;.<p>It feels they can&#x27;t even dive into and tease apart these choices and really evaluate them (&quot;Is it fair for me to bring up this other job offer in this negotiation?&quot;), and they also struggle to consider what the other side is capable of (eg negotiating with multiple candidates at the same time).<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not until these people get bitten a few times that they start to develop a stronger sense of being able to navigate these choice problems.')
