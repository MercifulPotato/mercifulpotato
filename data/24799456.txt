I&#x27;m visiting it regularly and there is always something interesting to read.<p>From the technical side I like that I can use `markdown` inside messages. Web version is also smooth and fast even on mobile Safari.<p>The platform reminds me of Reddit and will be great to get weekly or bi-weekly digests pointing out to interesting discussions in different groups. Also, Reddit has lot of NSFW groups and NSFW posts. I wonder if OpenLand can be used for NSFW content or NSFW groups?')
