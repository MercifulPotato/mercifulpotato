Precompilation time: Only once when you install or upgrade a package.<p>2. First running time (that includes compilation time): When you call a function like `plot` the first time in a session<p>3. Second and subsequent running times: The compiled code is now in the cache, and what you see is the actual running time.<p>Thus what you are reporting here as precompilation (1) is not something that a user will see every time. What they will see is (2) for the first time in a session and (3) on subsequent plots. Could you confirm this is what you see - to ensure that those following along understand the terminology?<p>Here are the usage times I see when I use Plots on a daily basis in a Julia session:<p><pre><code>  ~ exec &#x27;&#x2F;Users&#x2F;viral&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;Julia_Releases&#x2F;Julia-1.5.app&#x2F;Contents&#x2F;Resources&#x2F;julia&#x2F;bin&#x2F;julia&#x27;\n               _\n   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.julialang.org\n  (_)     | (_) (_)    |\n   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type &quot;?&quot; for help, &quot;]?&quot; for Pkg help.\n  | | | | | | |&#x2F; _` |  |\n  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.5.2 (2020-09-23)\n _&#x2F; |\\__&#x27;_|_|_|\\__&#x27;_|  |  Official https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org&#x2F; release</code></pre>\n|__&#x2F;                   |<p><pre><code>   julia&gt; @time using Plots\n   11.341632 seconds (20.21 M allocations: 1.108 GiB, 2.87% gc time)\n\n   julia&gt; @time plot(1:10,1:10)\n   2.291147 seconds (3.24 M allocations: 165.569 MiB, 7.80% gc time)\n   (Another 2 seconds for the window to be drawn the first time on mac)\n\n   julia&gt; @time plot(1:10,1:10)\n   0.000763 seconds (2.80 k allocations: 166.023 KiB)</code></pre>')
