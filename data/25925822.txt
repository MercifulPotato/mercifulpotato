E.g.:<p><pre><code>    data Role = User String | Moderator String [Area] NonEmpty Permission | Admin String [Area]\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not even saying that this is the best way of modeling it - but with Java you unfortunately can&#x27;t really define it.<p>&gt; (As an aside, I think one solution in Java would be to use the command pattern and pass an object (ModeratorCommand, etc.) to whatever code is processing your actions, so it can type check the command.)<p>The problem stays the same though: how do you know what kind of command it is that you just received? You cannot safely &quot;match&quot; on the command in the same way you can in other languages, because the compiler doesn&#x27;t know that there are only exactly 3 types of commands.')
