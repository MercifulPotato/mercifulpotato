This is the bed you made. It started from day one of Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign, where the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign against Hillary. Then came the completely fake impeachment trial, the fake and absurd allegations that Trump pissed on Russian hookers and all kinds of stupid shit. The years of one-sided MSM attacks against Trump that were almost entirely made up. The months of riots and deaths from Antifa and BLM that were sanctioned by the mayors of the democrat cities. The complete change of election laws so that now half of the country doesn&#x27;t trust the election because it is just dropping ballots off in a bin on the side of the road. The silicon valley cartel working together to ensure all conservative voices were silenced. Google literally not giving election day notifications to conservatives until they were caught out.<p>You brought this on yourselves, and now there will be nothing but violence and hell until America probably no longer exists. You elected a guy whose son is paid millions by China. You, the left, wanted to do whatever it took to get Trump out of the whitehouse, and that includes ending the republic itself. Half of the country no longer trusts any of these institutions.<p>Lie in the bed you made.')
