Not using the debug api and not exposing more than tabs, windows and URLs.<p>The reporting bit of the extension could be as simple as a bunch of listeners a la:<p><pre><code>  chrome.tabs.onSelectionChanged.addListener(\n    (tabId, props) =&gt; fetch(&#x27;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:8118&#x2F;report?&#x27;+JSON.stringify([tabId, props])));</code></pre>')
