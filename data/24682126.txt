If you&#x27;re not going to add anything please comment elsewhere.<p>It&#x27;s not a joke sub there are people who legitimately believe this. And the point it&#x27;s illustrating is that even if it&#x27;s a &quot;joke&quot; some &quot;jokes&quot; are more well tolerated by Reddit than others. My original point is that there is definitely ideological biases at play in what is&#x2F;is not bannable on reddit.')
