Meanwhile mens boobs are ok.<p>In some other cultures, women of all ages don&#x27;t even cover their boobs in public.<p>So basically something, that is a normal everyday thing in some cultures, for people of all ages, becomes morally wrong in our culture, and we censor it online, we also lock up people if those boobs are owned by a person younger than some arbitrary age, and even have wikipedia pages about that ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_sh...</a> ).<p>So basically, for some other culture, what we do is morally wrong, but we, as a majority, get to ignore their morality and impose our own (even if it&#x27;s stupid).<p>TLDR: we (as a group) support social networks deleting photos of female nipples, because showing and seeing those is morally wrong in our culture, even though it&#x27;s an issue that affects a lot more people than LGBT stuff.')
