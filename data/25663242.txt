That means you need to understand math, science, history, social science, etc. at a somewhat advanced level to make sense of these things.<p>America has been good at free speech, and we should never give that up.  But for free speech to result in advancement of society, rather than goons storming the Capitol, a good education is an absolute requirement, and the government has not given all Americans the opportunity to get a good education.  There will be pressure to censor speech because people aren&#x27;t equipped to process it -- we should resist that and focus on education instead.  This is where we should be spending our money; this is what the government exists to do.  Give everyone an equal standing to understand these sources of information.  We&#x27;re not doing that, and the results are bad.')
