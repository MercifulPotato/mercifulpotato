I&#x27;m also worried about nutrition -- meat and fish are absolutely <i>packed</i> with all sorts of compounds our body makes use of, different meats and fish having different sets of them, making variety important as well (e.g. beef vs. salmon vs. chicken). And it&#x27;s not reducible to just a handful of vitamins and minerals.<p>Is lab-grown meat going to have anything like that variety?<p>We have a long history of thinking we&#x27;ve identified all the important ones, only to make new discoveries of important things, whether it&#x27;s omega-3 fats, or compounds that fight free radicals. It remains to be seen whether lab-grown meat will be equally nutritious.')
