It worked just fine I can assure you. I captured many of my kids first moments on it. For it’s time, I was very happy with the camera. Sure compared to today it is a joke but so are many computing devices from that era. Also the point for me was I was a little upset I was sold video messaging and my phone couldn’t even do that. Not Apples fault the guy sold me something the phone was not capable of but it was the catalyst that showed me breaking the walled garden does have its appeal and uses.')
