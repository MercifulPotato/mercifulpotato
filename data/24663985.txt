They build tools for the government to browse information they already have. For example they build a tool to visualize the flow of monetary transactions between different people as a graph. They didn&#x27;t collect this information, the government already has this information on financial transactions.<p>Whether or not Palantir existed, the government collects the same information. Sometimes people make the argument that building better tools to make correlations between these pieces of information amounts to a threat to privacy. But that seems like a much weaker argument to me. The government already has the information being analyzed with Palantir, and if the people don&#x27;t think the government should have this information we have mechanisms in place to remove leaders and elect ones that will eliminate this data collection.')
