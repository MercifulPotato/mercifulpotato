I love writing Haskell, but Rust has become my daily driver, both at work (Cloudflare) and personal projects. It gives me the excellent type system, better domain modelling, great ecosystem (serde, actix-web, rayon, reqwest, diesel, tokio) and performance.<p>I&#x27;ve basically traded away some nice abstractions (functors, monoids etc) for the ability to debug error messages more easily, and not have to convince people to learn&#x2F;support an obscure language.
