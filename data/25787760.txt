Maybe two.  In fact, run as far and fast as you can, until you can cover your beliefs with your thumb.  Find a room and sit down for a long while.  Longer than you think you need to...however long you ponder, it’s shorter than death.<p>Ask yourself whether your beliefs are making you more kind and loving to everyone you meet, including yourself.  There is no reason why they can’t.  If they are aren’t, well, I think you should tell your beliefs your soul and spirit need more space and you want to start seeing other beliefs.  It’s not them, the beliefs, it’s you.  Whatever makes it easy on them.<p>But try not to die.  At the end of the day, beliefs are just a few neurons with an overinflated sense of their own importance.  Causes can be noble, or they can just be some personal egos scribbled on a poster.  You are more than your brain and those scribbles, and the rest gets a vote too.<p>This assumes, of course, meaningful freedom to choose.')
