It even generates ring voltage. (88 volts, 20hz). In this video of our old steampunk telegraph office, the phone in the foreground is fully functional. It&#x27;s tied to a cell phone and can be used to make and receive calls. It&#x27;s not really an antique phone, though; it&#x27;s a 1970s reproduction. Strangely, it came with the connector for Japanese phones, and I had to find the mating connector for that.<p>We let kids try it. One 7 year old said, picking up the handset, &quot;It&#x27;s so heavy&quot;.<p>At home, I have several analog phones tied to a VoIP box on Sonic. They use the old house phone wiring, which is no longer attached to the telco. Plugging the VoIP box into a phone outlet drives them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;97062822" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;97062822</a>')
