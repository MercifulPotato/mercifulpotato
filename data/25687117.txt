Counterfeit goods attempt to deceive consumers into believing the counterfeit is a genuine product of the brand owner, or to represent themselves as faux, replicas or imitations of the genuine product.<p>An unauthorized copy simply isn&#x27;t counterfeit unless it is promoted as official. There&#x27;s a legit copyright argument, but Twitter&#x27;s rules (correctly) don&#x27;t apply unless the copyrighted material is on Twitter.<p>&gt; Anyhow, another case of Twitter capriciously moderating content and quelling free speech. The worst part though is that Twitter HQ sets the policy to whatever suits their fancy.<p>The suppression of speech is the symptom here, not the root problem. I doubt Twitter is doing this because they have an axe to grind against SciHub. Likely, an executive got a call from the journals and then told the moderation teams to figure out how to ban them.<p>I think the root issue is that tech&#x2F;media companies are becoming a bit of a shadow-government where people with influence can shut down their competitors. And the journals probably feel they were entirely justified in &quot;lobbying&quot; Twitter, since SciHub is violating their copyright.<p>This isn&#x27;t new, businesses have always made private agreements to screw each other, and the only reason we don&#x27;t have smoke-filled back rooms these day is people don&#x27;t smoke much. What&#x27;s new is that big information &#x2F; infrastructure &#x2F; financial platforms are a far more influential feature of the modern political economy.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.twitter.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;rules-and-policies&#x2F;counterfeit-goods-policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.twitter.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;rules-and-policies&#x2F;counterfeit-g...</a>')
