We are products of our perception of reality.  I just didn&#x27;t want to get too deep in my summary.<p>I feel that people are manipulated on social media mostly by opinions&#x2F;narratives and not incorrect facts.  These opinions end up guiding how we feel about facts.<p>Example:<p>Fact -&gt; Maga protesters stormed the capital<p>Opinion 1 -&gt; &quot;These protesters will be looked at as heroes for trying to protect our democracy&quot;<p>Opinion 2 -&gt; &quot;These protesters are fools to do such a dangerous thing for a president that doesn&#x27;t care about them&quot;<p>I believe that depending on if you get more Opinion 1&#x27;s or 2&#x27;s on your feed, it probably will eventually shape how you feel about the fact.  Sad thing is most of the time these opinions are hyperbolic and not balanced.')
