Some of my friends had internet\nat home well before me during high school, but I only got it when I moved after\nHigh School (my parents weren&#x27;t so much anti-tech are completely outside of it).<p>So while I very well remember goatse, tubgirl and rotten.com, I only discovered\nthose as an adult.<p>Also note that I wasn&#x27;t singling out social media here. It&#x27;s the web as a\nwhole that seems very unsuited for a teenager without supervision, IMO.')
