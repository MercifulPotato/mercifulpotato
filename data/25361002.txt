You could use rsnapshot to a different machine (that needs to be just a little bit larger than the original one) and personally I would recommend borg backup, which can deduplicate, compress and encrypt and isn&#x27;t hard to setup. This could result in the backups being a fraction of the original - depending on the data. You can use AWS S3&#x2F; DO Spaces which is a lot cheaper or other compatible interfaces using rclone serve sftp + sshfs with borg or in the case of restic or duplicacy natively. You can also lookup tarsnap, rsync.net and others for remote backups.<p>In home scenarios, you usually care about documents, pictures a few specific videos and some music above everything else. This tends to be a fraction of the total capacity. The rest doesn&#x27;t change very often and is not such a loss but tends to be quite huge in comparison. So to backup all documents and pictures one or two external drives and&#x2F; or a cloud backup is sufficient.<p>Personally, for some important documents I use orgpad.com which I help build. I am personally responsible for the infrastructure - so the backups actually have at least three tiers, independent providers etc. That is just a side effect of having a SaaS platform with a reasonable and contactable team behind it.')
