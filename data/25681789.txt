Size dimensions or any?\n- does reading an article is impacted?\n- do carbon ads has a potential to generate above average revenue?\n- What&#x27;s the general perception of these ads?<p>My intent it to keep sanity of my blog and if in case reading is impacted due to ads placement, then will take a hard call. And do Carbon ads is a wiser decision or anything else (no google ads) i should look for?')
