I agree with him more often than not, but I certainly don&#x27;t always agree.<p>However, while the &quot;closed system&quot; thing is a valid criticism of Apple, I strongly disagree that its omission from Gruber&#x27;s article is a valid criticism of his writing.<p>Gruber writes for a specific and informed audience.<p>He is not writing articles for people who&#x27;ve never heard of Apple, or people who may not be aware that Apple runs a fairly closed ecosystem. He assumes that you know all of that.<p>Whatever you think about his writing as it exists today, imagine if he had to preface <i>every single blog post</i> with background information like that? Should the first 1,000 words of every post include a brief history of Apple and a discussion of open vs. closed ecosystems, and where Apple falls on that spectrum?<p>He knows that stuff. He knows that <i>we</i> know that stuff.<p>What&#x27;s the last article (or speech, or email, whatever) you wrote? Surely, when deciding what to write and what not to write, you considered your audience and their level of context and domain knowledge, as well as the constraints of your medium?')
