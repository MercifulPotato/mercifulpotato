Maybe that is the case in your country, but that&#x27;s definitely not true everywhere.<p>And it&#x27;s not just countries that might have a hint of socialist nuance: even the USA wouldn&#x27;t accept if you buy a ranch and then declare that on this property only the laws of the PRC apply (or that you declare it part of the UK). There are limits to what ownership allows you to do and those limits are very much subject to legislation.')
