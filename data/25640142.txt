Item(by='Domenic_S', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609805357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25639399, text='&gt; <i>But for the individual, it is rational to try to maximize their own share of the profit, is it not?</i><p>Depends on how you measure the profit. &quot;Profit per employee&quot; is an abstract measurement and for most people has little bearing to what they themselves do daily. Just because a company&#x27;s profit per employee happens to be $x doesn&#x27;t mean you personally generated $x - you could have generated a lot more, or perhaps been a net <i>cost</i> instead (projects fail and get cancelled all the time). You could make an argument that if you build a wildly successful feature you should get a big share of the profit, but only if you take a pay cut when things go poorly. Who wants that? This already happens to an extent in big companies btw, people on successful projects get promoted and more cash &amp; stock so in a way they are sharing in the success.<p>&gt; <i>And since we&#x27;re talking about immensely wealthy corporations, some of which have nice margins and billions of dollars of cash in reserve, it&#x27;s a bit of an intuitive step.</i><p>This is just another way of saying &quot;they can afford it&quot;, which I discussed previously.')
