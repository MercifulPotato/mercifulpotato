The issue here is that this provably false dump that NBC identified is pushing the same basic story the laptop email attempted to expose. You&#x27;re seeing domestically coordinated smear campaign. It was organized by a domestic PR firm and wrongly characterized as Russian disinformation. Certainly foreign assets (its not just Russia)have amplified it like anything else that is divisive, but at its core it was a plot to make an October surprise. NYPost broke embargo on the story and published ahead of the plan, and that kind of threw everything into chaos. They&#x27;ve been trying to get something out of it, but there is nothing but outrage over supression of a non-story. Emails are a remarkably verifiable thing, and ones these just aren&#x27;t.<p>Tony Bobulinski&#x27;s tale has not been corroborated, even by Murdock&#x27;s own WSJ journalists.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;29&#x2F;tony-bobulinski-hunter-biden-and-china-explainer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;29&#x2F;tony-bobulins...</a><p>I find this whole thrust rather remarkable anyhow. If true, Biden&#x27;s family committed nepotism and would do so again if they were put into power. Really? Coming from an administration which is openly profiting from the office and giving insane amounts of power to their family members?')
