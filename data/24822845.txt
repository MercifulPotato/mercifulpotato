To keep planting all year long, we run a “protect from insects” fine mesh over the entire garden and it feels significantly cooler while still allowing sunlight through. Not scientific enough, but we never thought to check the temperature drop or the sunlight reduction. I may do that this summer just to see how much light is blocked.')
