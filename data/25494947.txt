How much less profitable are ads going to be because people can opt-out of IDFA? I don&#x27;t know. But I&#x27;m sure many developers are going to think twice about developing free apps for iOS.<p>Conspicuously, Apple also just reduced it&#x27;s commission from 30% to 15% overnight for these developers. It seems to me like Apple really wants to nudge developers into creating paid apps. Is it because of privacy, or because it&#x27;s better for Apple&#x27;s bottom line? Probably both.<p>I&#x27;m glad Apple found a way to monetize privacy, but I didn&#x27;t mind installing a free app with a few ads if I knew that I&#x27;d only use it a few times.')
