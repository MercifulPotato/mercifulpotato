Then go to your talon home directory (click talon icon in tray -&gt; scripting -&gt; open ~&#x2F;talon). There&#x27;s a draconity.toml file there.<p>On the Dragon side, you need to uncomment and update the `[[socket]]` section to listen on an accessible IP.<p>On the client side (Mac in your case), uncomment &#x2F; update the `[[remote]]` section to point at your other machine.<p>You also need to make sure both configs have the same secret value.<p>From there, restart Dragon and look in the Talon log on the Mac side for a line like &quot;activating speech engine: Dragon&quot;.<p>To prevent command conflicts, I recommend setting Dragon to &quot;command mode&quot; (if you have DPI), and only adding scripts to Talon on the Mac side.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t work, you can uncomment the `logfile` line in draconity.toml on the Dragon side, restart Dragon, and look in the log to see what&#x27;s going on.')
