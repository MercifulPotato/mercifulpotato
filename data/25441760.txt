And this is not what this group is researching.<p>Also as a security researcher, this type of research is a real threat. Lots of DoD practice works on knowing exactly how outside and <i>inside</i> threats can exfiltrate data. If a secret facility had locked down networks, and ensured no insider could carry out CDs, but completely ignored threats like this, then insiders (and any outsider that gets something onto such a network) can exfiltrate data without detection.<p>There&#x27;s a reason DoD pays lots of groups to do work like this. He even mentions that common DoD practice of leaving phones outside secure facilities is not enough to prevent data from escaping (although some places I&#x27;ve been, but not all, have been smarter in putting phones in Faraday cages to lessen the issue).<p>As they say, attacks don&#x27;t get weaker, they only get stronger. Apply some proper modulation and signal processing, even with a custom receiver and antenna, and you can likely extract data at vastly faster rates, and, for some processes, perhaps even without on device malware.')
