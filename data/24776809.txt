They&#x27;ve had loads of shows that won raves upon initially airing but haven&#x27;t really stuck around much at all.<p>They haven&#x27;t managed to make sticky shows like Friends, the Big Bang Theory or even something more recent like Brooklyn Nine Nine that people can mindlessly rewatch over and over and they haven&#x27;t managed to make top tier prestige stuff (talking Sopranos&#x2F;Wire level here, they&#x27;ve made plenty a couple of notches below). The whole platform depends on a certain kind of novelty of the algorithm being able to churn up totally new stuff that&#x27;s okay.<p>As far as cancelling stuff goes, I get the impression Netflix moreso just doesn&#x27;t renew? HBO seem to have a formula where a cancelled show will get a special to wrap things up (e.g. Looking, Hello Ladies), always thought that was pretty savvy as it probably costs quite a bit less, makes that one episode into a bit of an event for fans and leaves the overall series a lot more enticing to people in the future.')
