If there are legitimate concerns over imminent violence, there is no legal obligation to halt service but there is absolutely a moral one.<p>And the free market allows others companies to continue providing service if they want. If the concern is over companies with massive market share then wouldn&#x27;t your concern better be addressed by antitrust laws?')
