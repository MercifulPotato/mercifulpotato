On the other hand losing traction in back causes oversteer, which is often very rapid in attack and severe in extent. For some vehicles it is essentially impossible for a non-professional driver to maneuver out of an oversteer event.<p>So for safety sake the best tread always goes on the back.  Most shops will refuse to do anything else.')
