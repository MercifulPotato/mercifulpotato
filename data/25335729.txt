That&#x27;s incorrect. Electron is just another browser, one that the web app developer happens to have more control over than they do Chrome. Every Electron app is a web app. Browsers have always handled the native bits for the web app and that&#x27;s exactly what Electron does. (On the mobile side of things, React Native via something like Expo would be the equivalent of Electron on the desktop.)<p>Together, the browser and the web app form a native app because a browser is basically a scriptable native app. So, your argument is that &quot;native apps &gt; scriptable native apps&quot; which makes no sense.<p>&gt; Maybe for your use case it&#x27;s better...<p>Web tech is absolutely better for every user-facing (GUI) use case. Even with 3D games which are streaming via browsers right now - performance might not be the greatest right away but since browsers have all the capabilities that any other native apps has (because they&#x27;re native apps themselves) - it wouldn&#x27;t be inconceivable that 3D web games could perform on par with native 3D games.<p>Personally, I develop all of my CLI&#x2F;server apps with web tech as well (that&#x27;d be JavaScript running under Node.js). There&#x27;s really nothing better - and that&#x27;s why JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world <i>by far</i>.<p>&gt; A web app is the Visual Basic of applications (but not really since VB is so much more useful!)<p>Having started my career with VBA I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. But even so, is VB (VB5&#x2F;6&#x2F;VBA&#x2F;VB.NET?) your go-to native development environment? Any of those choices are laughable IMO, but okay - I guess enjoy developing all of your apps in VB then :)')
