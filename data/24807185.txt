I don&#x27;t (a prior) trust the WHO, I don&#x27;t (a priori) trust the CDC, I don&#x27;t (a priori) trust the talk show hosts. (To be fair, I think this principle applies much more generally than public health matters.)<p>That&#x27;s not to say I behave irresponsibly: I wear a mask in public (because &quot;better safe than sorry&quot;), my family self-quarantined for two weeks when one of us got sick, etc. I just don&#x27;t assume what &quot;experts&quot; say is necessarily the truth. (To be fair, I also don&#x27;t trust <i>myself</i> to reach correct conclusions—hence my personal policy of &quot;better safe than sorry.&quot;)<p>I personally feel like too much of modern society involves idolizing experts and institutions—after all, it&#x27;s nothing more than the argument-to-authority logical fallacy (admittedly, even if it&#x27;s often a useful heuristic)... but that&#x27;s a discussion for another time :-P')
