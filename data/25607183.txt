Then it just become &quot;he said, she said&quot;, which is very difficult to prove.<p>They are experts at gaslighting, which ties in with the point above. Not only can the invalidate your claims about (difficult to prove) verbal abuse, but they can actually turn it against you, by claiming that you&#x27;re obviously mentally unstable &#x2F; hearing things due to workload &#x2F; not fit for the job &#x2F; etc.<p>Especially for narcissists, they tend to be very good at forming networks and friendships which benefit them - and in turn can produce cliques like this.<p>They know what buttons to push in the organization, to cover their own ass, and make the other party look incompetent. This includes creating extensive paper trails, frequent meetings to establish some opinion on a person, and what not.<p>Prolific abusers are hard to catch because they are very good at it, and because they create (or join) environments which are chaotic, and tie in multiple people on the abuse (whether want it or not - pretty much in the same way that bullies in school rarely do the bullying themselves, but form groups to do it).<p>In this case, it&#x27;s even worse - because there&#x27;s such an extreme imbalance of power. On one side you have a fresh hire, without any permanent VISA, completely dependent on the job. On the other side, you have established bullies in clique, with decades of employment in the company.<p>And not only that - it all happened within a company that enforces a strict culture of non-disclosure. It&#x27;s hard to go public with information which may include explicitly confidential work&#x2F;data.')
