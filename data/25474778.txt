If you want you can probably just run it all on one Droplet to save costs for now.<p>If you&#x27;re able, I&#x27;d recommend using a DigitalOcean droplet with dedicated vCPUs -- they&#x27;re a bit more expensive but you&#x27;ll have normalized CPU performance and won&#x27;t be choked out by noisy neighbor issues on the general purpose Droplets.<p>Good luck with your SaaS side project!')
