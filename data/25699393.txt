DKIM for instance. If your protocol is based on key exchanges (as Signal is), you don&#x27;t really need to rotate anything, because recipients can always fake messages coming to them. (Group discussions however may be another matter.)<p>That said, there are other reasons to rotate keys, typically to diminish the probability and the impact of leaks.')
