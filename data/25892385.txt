Some communities pull this out of me more. Some areas have good feedback loops. Sometimes I get depressed a bit, low energy, shyer, less confident and more paranoid, Im not as open to engaging.<p>Because of my experience, i feel less like not wanting to talk to others is less about being introverted, and more about feeling secure enough not to care about judgement. And ultimately you feel like every conversation is worth engaging in because they are more fuffilling. Does this resonate at all?<p>When you are with your friends, are you similarly asocial? Or does the confidence of their acceptance(knowing that the conversation will leave you feeling heard and wont be an unfuffilling transaction) allow your mood to relax and conversation flows?')
