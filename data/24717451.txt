I said that <i>maybe</i> companies are paying their employees much less than they could, and that <i>maybe</i> employees aren&#x27;t getting a good deal despite wages being high relative to other industries. I didn&#x27;t say that all of the value an employee generates should go to that employee - just <i>maybe</i> it could be more than does right now.<p><i>If not, then why should employees expect to make more than the market rate for the labor they provide?</i><p>&quot;Market rate&quot; is basically the median negotiated salary for similar roles. There&#x27;s an assumption that a salary is like a price, and supply and demand will drive that price up for in-demand skills. <i>This is the part I&#x27;m challenging.</i> I don&#x27;t know if price theory works for salaries where one side of the market (employers) has <i>far</i> more information and leverage than the other side (developers). If most developers are bad negotiators then getting a &quot;market rate&quot; salary means you, as an individual, are being paid the same as the other bad negotiators, and you actually lost out on getting a higher salary.<p>It could be that using the market rate to derive the appropriate salary for a job actually keeps developer wages lower than they could otherwise be.<p>At this point this is all just futile speculation though, and no one is going to change anything so we might as well just accept it.')
