What you are suggesting is straight up theft. Anyone should be able to buy as many properties as they want and keep it empty or live in them?<p>What the govt needs to do is build shelters and add beds. That’s the extent of public charity. Not handing out homes by penalizing those who managed to create value.<p>The only penalisation for empty homes should be upon foreigners buying homes and keeping it empty. Property taxes for foreign owned real estate ought to be higher as it exists at the cost of excluding local population from housing. It should be punitively high so foreign investment isn’t playing speculative games on real estate.')
