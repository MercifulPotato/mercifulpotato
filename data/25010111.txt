The ruling class in China is too busy jockeying for position in the plenums to be bothered to enforce the law and rein in billionaires that are running rampant through the Chinese economy. (Which law enforcement is your <i>job</i> by the way. Your job is not impressing your cadre.) These days the business class literally has to be doing something this outrageous to draw any of Beijing&#x27;s attention.<p>What will happen is that the rats will scatter and hide for a while until the ruling class goes back to power hunting. At which point they will come back out and begin engaging in similar outlandish behavior while trying not to wake the tiger.')
