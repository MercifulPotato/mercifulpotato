I wanted to learn something which required me to use my fingers differently than on a keyboard. But, as someone in their 50s with a lifetime of working on software I found it practically impossible to get my fingers to curve the way they needed to for the guitar. The physical pain eventually made me give up. If anyone has any tips to work around this limitation will be great to hear')
