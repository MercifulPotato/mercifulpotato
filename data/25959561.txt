Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=[25959727], score=None, time=1611939847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959414, text='A large part of Robinhood&#x27;s entire product is papering over the difference between a cash account and a margin account, and hiding the intracacies and timing of the underlying market.<p>&gt; Your cash is transferred and deposited.<p>When you open a new account, and start a transfer from your bank, that is not instantaneous. &quot;Cash&quot; doesn&#x27;t magically appear in Robinhoods&#x27; account. Until that deposit clears, you are effectively operating on margin.<p>If you recently sold something on Robinhood, and want to buy something else, &quot;cash&quot; isn&#x27;t in your account yet, because that original sale hasn&#x27;t settled. Robinhood is papering over that as well. This one in particular I&#x27;m not saying they <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> paper over, since I <i>believe</i> it&#x27;s less of a risk.<p>But each of these &quot;Robinhood covering your unsettled positions&quot; adds a little bit of risk. This risk adds up.<p>The suggestion of Robinhood only letting people trade with cash that is fully settled into their accounts would completely swap the underlying paradigm of Robinhood&#x27;s product.<p>Even so, <i>new trades</i> you want to make would have to settle. And as discussed elsewhere, Robinhood has to funds and deposits to cover potential risk associated with those trades until they settle.<p>There is a lot under the hood that is abstracted away by Robinhood, and now those intricacies are leaking out (and completely mis-understood, because one of the premises of Robinhood&#x27;s product is that you shouldn&#x27;t have to understand, or even know about, them)')
