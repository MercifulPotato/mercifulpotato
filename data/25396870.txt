Not all products can be reduced to a project in AirTable or equivalent. If you say you&#x27;re not going to write any code at all, I feel like you&#x27;re limiting the options of what you can build in a very extreme way.<p>Just want to build an &quot;information product&quot; where you&#x27;re doing some courses or something?
