More people will read that.&quot; We didn&#x27;t mean to suggest to use web pages instead.<p>We also didn&#x27;t mean not to use man pages at all. We just find more people use the built-in help and web pages, so if you have limited time&#x2F;resources, it&#x27;s better spent on those things.<p>In retrospect, perhaps it was worded a bit strongly. I am enjoying the debate, though. The meta point, and part of the reason for this document to exist, is that perhaps it&#x27;s a good idea to question our 30-year-old traditions and see if we can come up with better ways of doing things. This seems to have got people talking again. :)')
