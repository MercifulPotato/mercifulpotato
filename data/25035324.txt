Unluckily I didn&#x27;t find a way yet to keep the submission easy enough to keep people sharing their salaries but not too much to prevent trolls to post fake ones. Anyways I regularly cleaning the DB and removing fake submissions by hand, and some people are reporting them using the link at the bottom of the salary details Page.\nI&#x27;m open to ideas to make this site more trustworthy.
