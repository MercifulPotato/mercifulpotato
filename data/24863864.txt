I think it takes a certain amount of arrogance mixed with naivety for a person suffering from mental health issues to intentionally consume a mind altering street drug in the hope it will solve their problems.<p>If you are a mentally healthy person and want to take a trip to possibly open your mind up to new ideas and empathetic feelings, have at it.<p>Also the whole idea of micro dosing is a misnomer as the way acid works is by setting off a chain reaction along neural networks very simmilar to how the black widow spider&#x27;s venom works. It is possible to suffer from or enjoy a chronic condition from micro dosing LSD simmilar to how second hand smoke or air pollution affects you but that is a real stretch.<p>I would like to know. Are there are any &quot;micro dosers&quot; out there that have NOT also at some point taken an larger dose at some time? I bet they don&#x27;t exist.')
