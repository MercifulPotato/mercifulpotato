Continuing to post youtube videos of your unlicensed drone flying in controlled airspace after already receiving two written warnings from the FAA is pretty stupid.<p>Also this gem: &quot;These clips also revealed flight in hazardous conditions including heavy rain, fog, snow, and close proximity to buildings in downtown Philadelphia. There was also posted proof of the pilot intentionally losing radio signal, and control, of his drone.&quot; That goes way beyong &quot;innocent experimentation with your new drone&quot; and into &quot;deliberately endangering people and property&quot;, especially if you&#x27;ve been warned about it twice already. Youtube money must&#x27;ve been pretty good to keep going.')
