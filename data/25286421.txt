It&#x27;s straight-forward compared to dealing with telecom.<p>So you split Comcast into a dozen baby Comcasts. You just changed absolutely nothing (and plausibly made the situation worse for a lot of people, as some of those baby Comcasts will suck even worse over time) because it&#x27;s a physical location problem, it&#x27;s geographically limited competition (unless you redo the entire regulatory structure re telecom). Each baby Comcast will dominate their little territory and then the re-combination will begin again, as it did with AT&amp;T and the baby bells. Regulate that outcome away? That&#x27;s the part where the competence and legal standing is a huge problem. Make it so the pipes are forced open and lots of competitors can use them? Un huh. You would have to entirely remake the telecom industry in the US, get us entirely different Congress and regulators, and overall that isn&#x27;t going to happen for a few dozen reasons that would require paragraphs to explain fully. You know it&#x27;s not going to happen, I know it&#x27;s not going to happen, everyone knows it&#x27;s not going to happen. So what would going after telecom accomplish? Not much most likely.')
