The Pi4B is hard wired to a gigabit network, the laptop on WiFi AC. The Pi is using a Microsoft LiveCam USB webcam, the laptop is using the built in (1080p?) camera.<p>The Pi is running the Raspberry Pi OS desktop which I&#x27;ve just downloaded&#x2F;installed and fully updated and is using the Chromium Browser.<p>Laptop running Ubuntu 20.04 and Firefox.<p>The Pi decodes HD reasonably well with some occasional glitching but only encodes SD, Jitsi complains about the network being non-optimal but that appears to be a red-herring, all 4 cores are at 100%. If I lower the &quot;call quality&quot; slider to SD the network issue goes away.<p>The video received on the laptop from the Microsoft HD webcam on the Pi is 420x270. it&#x27;s smooth and the frame rate and latency is &quot;good&quot; but it&#x27;s pretty &quot;soft&quot; at full screen due to the low resolution.<p>In conclusion, I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re reasonably going to be able to get 720p or 1080p encoding out of it with Jitsi Meet in Chromium.<p>Anything else you&#x27;d like to know?')
