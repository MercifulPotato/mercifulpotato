Worked out really well, despite the horror stories I had heard.<p>Previous job (Tier 1-3 support to Java dev, startup SaaS, 2013-2018): Asked a friend how they liked it there, took a tour, met some people, was in for an interview the next week. First non-freelance or self-employed gig in many years but it turned out to be a great match.<p>Before Times: Post-college-dropout drift for a decade or so. Helped run a massive LAN party (dates it a bit, heh), did some PHP&#x2F;Java work for friends’ small consultancies, worked retail, repaired computers, freelance music writing and photojournalism, random open source project contributions here and there.<p>I love seeing other “non-traditional path” stories on here. Not everyone ends up in dev work, or their current job, the same way. :)')
