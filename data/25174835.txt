Student loan forgiveness is not universal basic income, medicare, food stamps, etc. It is not designed to overcome poverty. That&#x27;s a totally separate problem that needs attention.<p>Are you saying you expect every tax dollar to go to the poor first? Clearly you aren&#x27;t basing your expectations on the status quo: We spend $700 billion on defense, and $350 billion on welfare (not including medicaid).<p>Just because there are more important problems to solve does not mean we should ignore this one.')
