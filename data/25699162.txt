Would someone refusing to wear a mask, provably resulting in them asymptomatically infecting someone with COVID-19 be charged with negligent manslaughter?<p>It is not murder. There&#x27;s a concept called &quot;Negligent homicide,&quot; but even that is relatively well defined and requires intent to cause harm.<p>Don&#x27;t want to get into the rabbit hole, and I am not in agreement with all the laws the US has, but the point is that &quot;bad speech&quot; is <i>way</i> harder to define than murder&#x2F;homicide. Not only is it harder, it is arguably impossible to attain a good consensus on what it is.<p>PS: I don&#x27;t agree with the premise that we should regulate speech, but if you were to want to do it it would most likely backfire or be counterproductive because of these reasons')
