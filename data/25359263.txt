It must be management failing Boeing style.<p>ASML machines do not produce chips, they&#x27;re just ones doing the etching. There is a ton around what you do with it, and how all the rest of the chip is produced.<p>They don&#x27;t come with pre-programmed transistor gate templates. Each fab company has its own libraries of extremely specialized designs, doing different optimizations and tradeoffs. As mentioned plenty of times before, the consensus seems to be that Intel tried to pile up too many new improvements, which backfired. TSMC took a more incremental and safe approach. You have to appreciate that a defect that impacts high-volume yield today could have its roots in a design that was put on the roadmap years before.<p>&gt; As for the rest of Europe. Im sure they can politically do this. But where will the money end up?<p>If H2020 is anything to go by, the majority of that money will be salaries of people working on big research projects. At worst the project outcome is useless. I don&#x27;t see how any of the way these projects are structured benefit the pocket lining of managers.')
