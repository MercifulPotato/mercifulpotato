It&#x27;s more the other way &#x27;round. Common law concerning restraint of trade goes back hundreds of years before, and could really pinch, with no limits on remedies. John Sherman&#x27;s act LIMITED how much a railroad (etc) could be fined for it&#x27;s misbehavior, rather than introducing a legal risk. That risk already existed under common law under the rubrik &quot;restraint of trade&quot; [1] and could be extremely potent, in the years before the Sherman Act existed. \nThe advantage of a statute was that statutes overrule common law, sending the strong and expansive existing common law vs &quot;restraint of trade&quot; into the dustbin of history. To the great benefit of railroads, etc.\nIt&#x27;s relevant that his brother (General) William T. Sherman was the President of a (urban) railroad when the Civil War started. The Republican party (of John Sherman) was a strong proponent and friend of industry and infrastructure, not an enemy of it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Restraint_of_trade" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Restraint_of_trade</a>')
