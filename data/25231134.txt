The idea that people would always act in their own self interest was largely unquestioned, despite economics to that point having a ton of reproducibility problems (as far as I understand it).  Once we were able to think of humans as non-rational actors, it demystified a whole category of problems that economics thus far hadn&#x27;t been able to explain or predict.<p>Because this site has the focus that it does, I feel the assumption will be that this is about (or at least worth reading&#x2F;watching because of) the people that were gathered in that room, but among them, the most important&#x2F;influential person is Kahneman, in my view.')
