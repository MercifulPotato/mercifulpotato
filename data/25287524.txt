There are several times when I visit a web site using latest browser, but get an error while viewing a SSL page because OS CA is too old, and there is no way to upgrade it. I&#x27;m talking win xp days of course. But yeah why rely on the OS.<p>EDIT: kinda like how node_module thing got started in the first place.  But I can see how this can turn into another browser war with Google and Mozilla each starting to bundle their own CA bundles.  God, can we just please have DHT type for Root CA already?')
