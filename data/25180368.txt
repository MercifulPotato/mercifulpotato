In theory, it doesn&#x27;t, but in practice the risks imposed are large enough that platforms can&#x27;t viably choose to take them.<p>And exactly that could work in reverse too; a non-requirement strong incentive to leave content up, by tilting the liability scales the other way, or even by imposing additional civil liability by the platform to the poster (not the government!).<p>The point being not that that is likely to pass congress nor something to morally aim for, but rather that the first amendment won&#x27;t <i>prevent</i> it either: i.e. if congress wants to intervene, it has the power to. I&#x27;m not saying the original article has it&#x27;s details legally water-tight, but rather that it seems implausible that reasonable legislators couldn&#x27;t come up with a sufficiently first-amendment proof construction.<p>And the point of that is that we shouldn&#x27;t be distracted by first amendment issues. They&#x27;re not going to matter for regulating platforms, as the DMCA kind of proves, if that&#x27;s what congress wants. So what do <i>we</i> want?  What should we as a society want? That&#x27;s the hard question, and any (reasonable) answer to that is likely not going to impacted by the first amendment.')
