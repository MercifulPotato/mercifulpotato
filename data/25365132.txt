I&#x27;m not hearing simultaneous complaints that it is important for youtube to host these. &quot;debates&quot; so that the social media community can address wild claims and also that it is a worthless effort.<p>If random internet commenters can&#x27;t make productive change in the crazy beliefs held by some people then great! I actually agree that is the most likely outcome. This means that nothing is lost if youtube says &quot;we don&#x27;t want to be the home to this debate&quot;.')
