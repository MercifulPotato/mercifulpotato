There is no per-student subsidy as far as I am aware? Unis get the 9k a year, either cash or from the slc.<p>Also, international fees are unregulated. They&#x27;re totally down to the uni and the student. Central government doesn&#x27;t touch them. This is why there has been a big push to take on foreign students in most universities over the last 20 years.<p>Source:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.universitiesuk.ac.uk&#x2F;policy-and-analysis&#x2F;reports&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;2016&#x2F;university-funding-explained.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQ8KDAgsXuAhVM2qQKHXH9A-QQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pR--vjqalafEzuIRwa9hM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https:&#x2F;...</a><p>I&#x27;m glad to hear Imperial Chem is doing well.
