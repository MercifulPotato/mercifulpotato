You have a group with the motive, means, and MO to do so, you just need to find the proof.<p>Which is the definition of a conspiracy theory. Words have meaning and this is a technical term; and altho it is common knowledge that it is being used as a smear word, this doesn&#x27;t mean we have to play the same game here as well.<p>There is also no reason to pretend that the colloquial usage of conspiracy theory is more than opinion.')
