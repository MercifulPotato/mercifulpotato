I&#x27;m not a fan of dynamic mocks where the test code has the mocked implementation because it is super brittle. Instead, a &quot;fake&quot; (i.e. a mock as I understood them) is an alternatively implementation of an interface.<p>There are a lot of really good &quot;fakes&quot; out there. Fake file system which lets you simulate disk failures. Fake time and randomness to introduce determinism. Every API over network can have a fake. These are all good things to fake out as you can simulate the appropriate failures which are almost impossible to do via integration, acceptance, or E2E tests.')
