After the 2016 election, more than half of Democrats disagreed that the elections “were free and fair.” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.charlotteobserver.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics-government&#x2F;election&#x2F;article247121139.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.charlotteobserver.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics-government&#x2F;e...</a><p>&gt; Of registered voters surveyed, 53% said the 2016 election between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton was free and fair and 33% said it was not.... 39% of Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters said it was. Half of Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters said it wasn’t free and fair.<p>I’m not trying to create an equivalence between what Clinton said and what Trump is saying. I’m talking about the beliefs of the voting public, which are clear in the polls. Half of the people who lost in 2016 thought the election wasn’t fair, but democracy didn’t end.
