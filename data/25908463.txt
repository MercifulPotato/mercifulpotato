This is the same kind of risk that absolutely savaged WeWork.<p>For instance, if we take your 0.2% blended rate estimate for what you can get for your capital, that&#x27;s still a real yield of -1.8% accounting for inflation. Luckily that 2% inflation loss is born by your token holders, not you, however that creates a real incentive to exit the tokens once interest rates rise.<p>Let&#x27;s say interest rates rise to 5% due to a financial recovery - back to where they were in 2010. Now, not only have your token holders lost 2% value for each year you&#x27;ve carried the T-bills, you have to discount the notes by 3.375% (vs the current market 1.625%) to liquidate them should your token holders decide to redeem and move into bonds themselves.<p>To liquidate them you have to pay the difference in coupon rates, so a mark to market loss of $172M. If we take your 0.2% blended rate as an offset, even over a 5 year window, that still represents a net loss of $122M.<p>Borrowing long and lending short works until it doesn&#x27;t, then you can ask Mr. Neumann what happens.')
