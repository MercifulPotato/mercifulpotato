I remember at the time that everyone was worried Google was going to start adding ads. And they did it so soo sooo slowly. They did it so slowly that even today they haven&#x27;t been able to do a 30 second forced spot yet, like TV. It&#x27;s interesting actually, someone should write a book about the way they introduced ads on YT. They did it so carefully that you could tell they were very very carefully balancing not having any protest greater than a few hundred people at any time.<p>That was essentially the major reason people thought it was a bad deal - that you couldn&#x27;t monetize because people would run to the next platform, I mean it was essentially a doomed business idea because the belief was you couldn&#x27;t get the advertising dollar above the storage and staffing costs.')
