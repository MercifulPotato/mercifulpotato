I was thinking of either going with a hybrid (Rav 4), because of price&#x2F;range + extra hp. Or going with a something like a new corvette, because I figure these will become a collectible once the switch to electric is made on mass. Range anxiety, and having to worry about recharging is the biggest thing stopping me from pure electric. Plus I think they should be much cheaper, since its a simpler car to build (fewer mech parts), less interior space, worse interior and so on.')
