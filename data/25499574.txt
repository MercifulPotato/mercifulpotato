This still does not solve a lot of my problems with React. You still need the base ~97.5kb react runtime to render a &quot;server component&quot;.\nAnd if a component is a ~10kb in JS size and their new JSON UI representation is ~1kb in size then if you request 20 renders of that component then over the wire it would be 20kb of fragments than the 10kb component...?<p>Seems odd that they haven&#x27;t worked out how this works for routing yet (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;07dd4bc4807605020351606ffaf5e650f1284f07&#x2F;text&#x2F;0000-server-components.md#how-do-you-do-routing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reactjs&#x2F;rfcs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;07dd4bc4807605020351606...</a>) and that in the demo the whole app is rendered, not individual components. Just seems like turbolinks but for rendering to React VDOM rather than HTML. And I thought most people used React for CSR through hosting files on static buckets leaving out the server...?')
