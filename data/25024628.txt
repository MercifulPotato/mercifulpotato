Item(by='marcus_holmes', descendants=None, kids=[25024892], score=None, time=1604830592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023976, text='One of the big problems I&#x27;ve seen with multi-vendor systems that co-operate is if something didn&#x27;t work. It was never clear where the problem was because the system incorporated multiple products from multiple vendors. So if your resizer object didn&#x27;t work for some images after upgrading Photoshop, but it used to in the old version, how do you get that fixed?<p>In a single-vendor program, it&#x27;s clearly a bug in the program and you can hand it back to the vendor to fix it. When multiple vendors are involved, it gets way more complicated. Each has a tendency to blame the other, and not take responsibility for the problem. Each will claim that they are coding to the interface specification. And they might be, it&#x27;s just that the specification isn&#x27;t tight enough to make all interactions bulletproof.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a solution (apart from &quot;write a really, really, tight interface. No, tighter than that&quot;), but I&#x27;ve seen the problem enough to be skeptical that we can have this.<p>edit: I should add that I wish we could have this.')
