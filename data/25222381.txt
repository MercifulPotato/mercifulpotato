Someone was wondering why he&#x27;s getting called a racist, and I took a shot at providing an answer.<p>You just can&#x27;t go around making statements about race and intelligence, however delicate and nuanced, and not expect people to raise an eyebrow. Do you think he&#x27;d make that same statement in a room full of black people?<p>In case it isn&#x27;t obvious, not-racist people with a smidgeon of social awareness don&#x27;t even engage in those sorts of discussions on the first place, because they understand that nothing productive can come of them.<p>They&#x27;re his words, and I linked to the full thread to provide context. If you find &quot;this behavior&quot; &quot;very rude,&quot; I think many others here would disagree with you.')
