Somewhat absurd scenario, but interesting from a technical point of view due the the constraints you have to optimize for.<p>Depending on what assumptions you make about the effective bandwidth available on a 33 rpm lp record is somewhere between 225MB and 15MB. That is easily enough space to fit a full fledged implementation of Common Lisp on somewhere between 1 and 4 records (SBCL&#x27;s working tree is 40MB, and with its .git folder it is 152MB). There are countless other factors that would need to be considered, but I still like to imagine a sci-fi story about the search for the 5th record of lp-lisp needed to reboot civilization! The fact that someone has actually done something even remotely related to this is fantastic.')
