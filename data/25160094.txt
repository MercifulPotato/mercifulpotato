Both were data center class drives (Seagate Exios) and died within the first 2 months of purchasing them. I have over 20 consumer grade drives with &gt;50,000hrs of reported power on time, of which 3-4 are &gt;70,000hrs. They constantly see writes, but I’m definitely not pushing max IOPs by no means on a regular basis. I’d say around 1-2% of the time they are under very heavy read&#x2F;write activity, otherwise just constant appending of data at around 50Mb&#x2F;sec across the entire RAID pool.')
