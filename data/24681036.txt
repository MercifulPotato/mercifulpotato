The hyper focus on solving by hand puts the wrong emphasis on ODEs. Theyâ€™re supposed to be used as a tool to do quick modelling of a process to get qualitative insights to the behaviour of the system.<p>I recommend James Murray mathematical biology book for nice examples of how ODEs can quickly give insights into complex phenomena.')
