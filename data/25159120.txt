It served mostly as a mechanism for Americans to deflect from the real issues with their election: the Democrats fielded a corrupt, criminal candidate who could not defeat an also-corrupt, despicable ex-reality TV star.  So, blame Russia.<p>And therefore, a perfectly good example for why people should <i>demand</i> sources be revealed when it comes to issues of state election security.<p>Otherwise, we will continue to be ruled by duplicitous subterfuge instead of verifiable facts.')
