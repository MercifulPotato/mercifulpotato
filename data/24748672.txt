Item(by='TuringNYC', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602446952, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24747743, text='&gt;&gt; Lets compare to alternatives like dam and flood control infrastructure, better roads, rail, etc.<p>I&#x27;m going to provide a totally contrarian viewpoint as an engineer previously employed by Wall Street -- the difference to the alternatives is simple -- one exists and the other is theoretical.<p>The difference is is that Wall Street pays actual paychecks to engineers to do these things. Meanwhile, as much as i&#x27;d love to work for a better railroad company or what not, I did not find any engineering jobs there (computer science and statistics in my case.) Jobs and paychecks is how I am able to make car payments and pay for my daughter&#x27;s bicycle.<p>To continue the thought, if you really do feel dam and flood control infra is a better thing to spend money on (i feel this way), HN isnt really the place:<p>0. Be like Elon and start your own railroad and dam company<p>1. Invest your own money into a dam and infra startup<p>2. Lobby your senator and representative to put money into infra<p>Speaking down the folks who are <i>actually</i> giving engineers paychecks is not a great thing IMHO when there arent all that many alternatives. Same sentiment from most of my former colleagues with Physics PhDs on Wall St. Yeah, it sucks, but tell me that once you can land me a tenure track teaching position. Until then, let me eat.')
