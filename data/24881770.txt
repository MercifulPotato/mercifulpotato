The same Bolton who has never shown a problem with aggressively supporting lies, like the foundational lies used for the Iraq war, of which he was a big proponent. There is very little from someone like Bolton that can be trusted directly - which also doesn&#x27;t mean everything he said about Trump is false, it means there is inherently a severe credibility problem with anything he says.')
