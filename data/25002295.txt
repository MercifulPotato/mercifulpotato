I strongly suggest using CAI rather than the GCP apis, it simplify a lot the collection of data and you won’t hit a road block with quotas and hidden quotas.<p>Pulling data from the APIs won’t scale and it’s the exact reason why we migrated off Forseti (forsetisecurity.org) , which we helped build in the first place.<p>Feel free to ping me if you want more details, my contact is in my profile.')
