Look at France. They did not pay for their nuclear power through consumer taxes but through general taxes hence the price looks low. Somebody else paid in other words. French taxes are higher than German taxes.<p>Germany is a poor example as it shut down perfectly fine nuclear power, thus incurring a cost on replacing it.
