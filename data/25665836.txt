Item(by='dane-pgp', descendants=None, kids=[25670868], score=None, time=1609981900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25662230, text='Thank you for highlighting the need for electoral reform, and pointing towards the &quot;winner takes all&quot; nature of most US elections as being the poisonous tree from which these fruits keep falling.<p>A proportional voting system would both allow new parties to emerge and prevent extremist or divisive candidates from leading those parties.  That in turn would give people more options and make them more likely to vote (and less likely to excuse bad actors within their own party).<p>I would be careful about directing the blame at &quot;single member districts&quot;, though.  In the US, the most popular type of reform seems to be Instant Run-off Voting, which has its flaws, but avoids the potential criticism that multi-member districts face, namely that a voter&#x27;s elected representative may end up living much further away from them.  (Personally I&#x27;d rather a representative who is closer to my political viewpoint than to my physical residence, but I think that much of the criticism for multi-member districts are in bad faith anyway, and thus not amenable to reasoned debate).')
