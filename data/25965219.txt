There are a few countries who have heavily touted how many vaccines they&#x27;ve agreed to buy, but aren&#x27;t being nearly as vocal about when they&#x27;re <i>going</i> to actually have them in hand. Having contracts to vaccinate everyone in your country 4 times over doesn&#x27;t do much good if you don&#x27;t get those people any dose for another 9 months. It now seems plausible that countries like the US and and UK could  have vaccinated everyone who wants to be by the beginning of summer. There are governments who have been fairly smug about their handling of the crisis who may be many months behind that schedule.')
