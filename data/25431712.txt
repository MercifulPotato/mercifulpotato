Not partially hard-coded in partial scripts.<p>I suppose I could see a &quot;framework&quot; like:<p><pre><code>   .&#x2F;projX&#x2F;setup\n   .&#x2F;projX&#x2F;job1\n   .&#x2F;projX&#x2F;job2\n   .&#x2F;projX&#x2F;cleanup\n</code></pre>\nBut I&#x27;d still prefer setup and friends to accept a path (not PATH) as first argument or whatever. Rather than assuming a relative path.<p>Maybe even factor most of this into something that could live under &#x2F;opt&#x2F;bin or whatever.<p>Especially for cron I&#x27;d rather see:<p>&#x2F;opt&#x2F;projX&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;mangle &#x2F;opt&#x2F;projX<p>Rather than just the first part with an implicit argument of &quot;parent of containing folder&quot;.')
