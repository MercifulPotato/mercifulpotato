Not to mention auxiliary DSPs like video decoders (not sure if M1 has it as part of GPU or a separate block), power gating control and many many more.<p>They may have in order of 100 registers to talk to them and they&#x27;re horribly proprietary with pretty much no standardisation.<p>Reverse engineering that is hellish at best - you can see projects like nouveau which barely manages to get nVidia cores up and working without help from the manufacturer. And that&#x27;s after years and years of development.')
