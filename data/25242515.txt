I&#x27;d bet the money I&#x27;ll net after the lockup on an IPO I&#x27;m in that close to 100% of the value of &quot;his&quot; company was built on that bed of VC funds and their connections he <i>lucked</i> into.<p>He&#x27;s a cute anecdote for the company&#x27;s marketing--that&#x27;s the entire sum of his value. He&#x27;s not likely to build another company or achieve any further success outside the VC bubble.')
