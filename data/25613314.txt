A public goods argument can be made for strategic investments.<p>I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been conclusively shown that there have been &quot;repeated successes with this style of investment&quot;. Demonstrating that would require knowing what the opportunity cost of the spending for these projects was, which is impossible. Claiming it&#x27;s an open-and-shut case that these kinds of investments will yield positive results is just as ideological as you accuse dissenters of being.')
