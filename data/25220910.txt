Ultimately those voice assistants just act as a search engine for most queries, so they are going to respond in a similar way to a search engine. As long as they properly attribute the source of the response (I know Google Home does this, not sure about Alexa), I don&#x27;t see a big issue.<p>It would be nice if for major topics (ex.
