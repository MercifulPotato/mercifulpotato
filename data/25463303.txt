Actually, outdoor spaces were overcrowded, more than usual, during complete lockdown in WA where they were literally telling people to not leave the house except for critical tasks.<p>This argument always seems completely untenable for me. It&#x27;s highly improbable that the level of fear hits the sweet spot where without lockdowns it&#x27;s not enough to prevent the spread, but enough to ruin the economy.')
