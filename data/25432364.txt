I&#x27;ve personally noticed time and time again how git-based workflows discourage me personally from making small one-time changes like typo fixes compared to a wiki or similar. It&#x27;s just so much more overhead to have to start up a CLI, edit the document, push a commit, open a pull request etcâ€¦<p>This is not to say there aren&#x27;t advantages to the git-based workflow and it might be a valid choice for a technical audience like this, but to claim it as &quot;huge advantage in terms of contribution workflow&quot; seems questionable.')
