Item(by='sdwa', descendants=None, kids=[25728035], score=None, time=1610366077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727455, text='I understand and broadly sympathise with the sort of ~absolute freedom of speech outlined in the US constitution, but I am completely baffled by this recent push seen here on Hacker News and elsewhere that this freedom should be extended to in effect compel others to publish your speech.  This is not in the US constitution, and is in fact completely unconstitutional (1st amendment protects against compelled speech).  This almost seems like a push for speech without consequences, that no matter what you say everyone should be forced to provide you with services and support.   This would be both unprecedented and  also extremely unhealthy for society.  It wouldn&#x27;t even be conservative ideology, as at no point in US history has anything like this been the law, legalising compelled speech would be truly radical and unconservative politics.')
