This has been my dream for a long time, and it finally feels so close.<p>A few things:<p>- Having to dig out a cable to dock to the NexDock each time is a bit cumbersome. I have a small one but it&#x27;s still one more thing to manage&#x2F;keep with the dock. A mounting arm on the lapdock with something like Apple&#x27;s MagSafe (wireless charging+NFC to initiate a Miracast connection) would be very nice<p>- The available lapdocks right now... aren&#x27;t great. The one with the best touchpad I&#x27;ve found is the Elite x3 lapdock, but Samsung phones don&#x27;t seem to be compatible with it. Works with my PinePhone though, so it&#x27;s the one I hope I&#x27;ll be able to use with the Librem 5. (This is something I expect would be improved if lapdocks gained popularity)<p>That aside, though... connecting my phone to a dock and using it as my computer feels super futuristic and I&#x27;m loving it so far.')
