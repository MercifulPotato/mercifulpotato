Otherwise you&#x27;ll have to accept that some customers will be unhappy and leave a bad review.<p>I think this is a learning curve for many restaurants that are not used to this business model. Certainly in Europe it was not usual for restaurants to offer delivery&#x2F;takeaway, which was only done by some pizzerias for a long time. Now these platforms are booming and the pandemic has made them critical.')
