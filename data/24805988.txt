There’s no “market wage” at that point - there’s no such thing as “another candidate already with X years of internal experience” working at your current wage. The person’s current wage is, by definition, <i>the</i> market wage. Reducing it to match a competitive rate <i>for new hires</i> in that geographical region does not make sense, you’re telling someone paid <i>market wage</i> (for them, for the value they currently provide you, which is not a function of their location) to suddenly take a pay cut because a theoretical new hire from that region (who is not a substitutable alternative for this person) might take a lower wage.<p>Your objection makes no sense.')
