I&#x27;m not losing weight quickly but keeping it down and dropping slowly without any stress.<p>I did some calorie counting at the beginning but dropped it once I had convinced myself that I was indeed eating fewer calories.<p>One other thing I do is to delay breakfast until after I have done my morning walk.  Experience tells me that my appetite will be sharpened by the exercise so I will be tempted to eat again.  So getting dressed and walking straight out of the house for an hour of brisk walking saves me that temptation or perhaps puts it to good use.<p>But well done, whatever works is good.')
