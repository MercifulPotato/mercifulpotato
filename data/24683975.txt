Some factors I&#x27;m aware of in my locale:<p>* Poor kids are more likely to require special-needs programs and other kinds of extra attention.<p>* The district has different maximum class sizes for lower and higher income schools.<p>* On the other hand, the system lets teachers apply for transfers while keeping their seniority, so the higher income schools (where it&#x27;s easier to teach) end up with higher salary costs.<p>So I&#x27;d have to see a breakdown on actual costs to know whether the general level of funding is actually a measure of whether rich and poor schools are receiving comparable funding relative to their actual needs.')
