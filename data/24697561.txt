It&#x27;s the next version of .NET Core after v3.0 but jumping ahead to v5.0 and dropping the &quot;Core&quot; designation, and then merging in parts of Mono, AOT toolchain, and even more of the (upgrade) bits of the classic framework.<p>You might be able to get pretty far with just a framework switch. The RC is already out so try it. You&#x27;ll probably have to update the csproj&#x2F;sln files at a minimum and fix some known API differences but it&#x27;s unlikely you need an entire rewrite.')
