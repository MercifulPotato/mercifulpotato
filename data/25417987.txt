Thu Guardian is the equivalent of the New York Times of the Washington Post in the USA, that does not mean you can&#x27;t believe anything they print. News sources have biases, as long as you know those biases and (very important) <i>know and acknowledge your own bias</i> you can <i>and should</i> use those sources to get an idea of what the news really is. This is why I do not use a single source, nor a single aggregator as a news source but instead look at sources ranging from the Guardian to the Wall Street Journal as well as a bevy of &quot;alternative&quot; news sources. The &#x27;net makes this possible, use the possibility. Just squawking about the bias of sources which do not correspond with your own bias is a part of the problem, not a part of the solution.<p>By the way, it is disheartening to see the growth in the number of throw-away accounts used in discussions like these. Stand up for your opinions, dare to voice them, don&#x27;t hide for the cancel mob. Use your real account even if - or maybe especially if - you expect the mob to pounce. It is only when &quot;established&quot; users show they are not afraid to speak up that the mob can be beaten.')
