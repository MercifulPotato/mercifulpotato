It is profoundly irresponsible to presume ignorance and wait for there to be hard evidence. There is hard evidence that PornHub has repeatedly allowed underage pornography on their website despite significant public criticism, and hard evidence that PornHub (and therefore VISA and MasterCard) profited from its distribution. Moral and legal propriety compels action without giving PornHub executives a benefit of the doubt they do not deserve.<p>It is also not like these issues are new. Pornhub has been criticized for allowing underage pornography since at least 2009, when footage of men raping a 14-year-old girl was uploaded to the site and not removed for 6 months, despite the videos racking up hundreds of thousands of views and the girl’s family repeatedly pleading with PornHub to remove the video. This has been a known problem with PornHub for over a decade. Even if the executives are just profoundly ignorant and bad at their jobs, that is not a good enough excuse in a court of law.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s like saying we should boycott the telephone company because a child molester made a phone call.<p>It is really more like saying that we should boycott the phone company because the child molester ran a nationwide criminal conspiracy around sexual assault using a premium phone service, and the phone company did nothing despite the problem being repeatedly brought to their attention. In which case: yes, boycott the damn phone company and demand a criminal investigation of its executives.<p>A big part of the problem is people completely trivializing the issue. The EFF doesn’t even mention child exploitation! Pretending this is just about censoring legal pornography, or blowing small instances out of proportion, is completely dishonest and morally despicable.')
