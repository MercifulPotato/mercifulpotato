We do have a product called Jira Align that&#x27;s targeted closer to what you&#x27;re describing. I&#x27;d attribute more of the spread to the concept of &quot;Jira is the defacto&quot; fwiw.<p>Chuckled at convincing managers to track less data. Internally we subscribe to a &quot;less is more&quot; approach and try to limit required fields as much as possible. I bet we feel more willing to contact Jira admins to make changes, though, since we own the product itself.<p>Concur that migrating away from Jira is tough and probably helps keep people in the ecosystem. I haven&#x27;t met anyone at Atlassian, though, who ever wanted that to be the reason why people stay. I think Jira can be awesome when it&#x27;s set up well but some stakeholders can get a bit, uh, heavy-handed when deciding on &quot;the process&quot;.')
