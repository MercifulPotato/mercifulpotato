Item(by='k_sze', descendants=None, kids=[25987421], score=None, time=1612164354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986354, text='What I do is I make a list of vintage grail watches that I&#x27;m interested in, and I limit myself to those and stop looking at other ones. (Same thing with fountain pens.)<p>Right now these are missing from my collection:<p>- Seiko SCVF-009 &quot;Red Alpinist&quot; with green dial - I already have the cream dial (SCVF-007) and the black dial (SCVF-005) counterparts.<p>- Citizen 67-9356 Octagon chronograph, in both white dial and black dial configurations; I find this one interesting because it was like the only inexpensive hi-beat (28,800 bph) chronograph, complete with day-date and flyback mechanism, ever produced in the history of Japanese watch-making.<p>- Grand Seiko 6186-8000 VFA, in both blue-dial-and-long-hands, and white-dial-and-short-hands configurations. A ridiculously accurate Grand Seiko with a dial design that (I find) really stands the tests of time. Legend has it that the Seikos performed so well that the Swiss eventually gave up inviting them to the chronometer competition (because Seikos kept coming out at the top). I consider this model the pinnacle before Seiko resorted to &quot;cheating&quot; with the SpringDrive.<p>Curiously, I&#x27;m not really interested in Swiss watches.')
