Use hydrogen to heat water to turn a turbine to turn a genset to produce electricity, in the same way that we&#x27;ve been doing for ages now.<p>The real question is, say you have a natural gas power plant that&#x27;s been retooled (minimally) to run on hydrogen that they create on site. Now you&#x27;re producing a ton of water vapor and tossing it into the air. If <i>all</i> power plants run this way, that water vapor is going to be problematic as water vapor is an excellent greenhouse gas, so, if you&#x27;d like to avoid that, you&#x27;ll need to recondense the water and put it back into the cycle, which will harm efficiency if done in a 100% closed cycle.<p>That&#x27;s probably not a huge obstacle to overcome, because the water will likely have to be pure anyway in order to be usable, so, you could likely recapture waste heat and use it to distill water to a high purity and because your exhaust is likely full of higher purity water than you could otherwise get, it makes sense to recapture it.<p>Additionally, you could solve in part, the main issue with renewables, which is energy storage, by converting excess capacity to hydrogen made by electrolysis that you can then burn in traditional power plants. Sure it&#x27;s 70-80% efficient, and burning hydrogen is likely not going to beat ~62% efficient in a combined cycle plant (the current record for natural gas), it&#x27;s much better to take that efficiency hit than it is to waste power, or further complicate the grid, and you&#x27;ll get to keep ~40% of that energy based on my napkin math, which is better than 0% and you can put it anywhere, likely on the solar farm directly.')
