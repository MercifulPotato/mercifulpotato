Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603110370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24823895, text='I found some of Lex&#x27;s remarks and commentary during interviews insightful and intellectual.  Like, we&#x27;re listening to someone who thinks deeply in his own way about life, but doesn&#x27;t really talk about his own thoughts so much, so have only the occasional glimpse.  For me, this is enjoyable to listen to.  But I haven&#x27;t listened to all the interviews; perhaps I ended up choosing the ones that are more familiar subjects for him as well.<p>For example I really enjoyed the interview with Vitalik Buterin.  It felt as much like two people chewing the cud about ideas for what&#x27;s being created and what we might do in future, and around the economy and social development with an idealistic bent; the sorts of conversations we used to be able to enjoy in university, as it did an interview.  I miss those conversations in real life.  Nobody I know wants to have them any more.  Of course that was driven by Vitalik&#x27;s ideas, but it was a great setting to hear them; the interview was enjoyable for me.<p>I agree Lex&#x27;s voice is remarkable and at first I found it off-putting though intriguing.  But after listening for a while I found it different, and calm rather than off-putting.  It may have helped me that he explained why he wears black so often, about maintaining a calm and prepared mind.  I really respect thoughts expressed like that, I guess because I see myself as a mess (relatively!) and would like to be more like that myself.  Just having someone articulate and demonstrate a calmness of mind is a gentle, everyday inspiration.<p>That calm mind is reminiscent of meditation for me.  It makes other interviewers sound like they&#x27;re trying too hard to be entertainers, zany and interesting, when that&#x27;s not important to me.  Having Lex as a counterpoint, I realised I don&#x27;t like the zany interviewers at all.  I&#x27;m not looking for fun, and I&#x27;m certainly not looking for the auditory equivalent of razzle-dazzle.  I&#x27;m looking for calm and interesting thoughts with an air of intellectual curiosity in a calm and reflective timeframe.<p>I also really like the way the interviews have plenty of time to explore.  Hours.  It feels like they aren&#x27;t force-scripted to fit in X questions into Y preset minutes as other podcast interviewers.  I expect there is a fair amount of preparation, but it feels relaxed as a result.  I don&#x27;t have time to listen to them, to be honest.  But the length makes them more of a treat.  It&#x27;s like reading a long book: Rather than having one hit like a short story, it&#x27;s more like something which takes a week to read and is a bit of a treat at bedtime or at lunch, to read in pieces.  I&#x27;ll go back and listen to a single Lex podcast over repeated sessions.  The continuity makes it something to look forward to, and it&#x27;s pleasing to know the style of material will last me a while.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be densely packed to be an enjoyable listen, and this is a lovely antidote to the high-intensity workout of some other podcasts.')
