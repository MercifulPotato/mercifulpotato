There&#x27;s even a room in his house specifically for giving press briefings. To pretend that this is &quot;silencing&quot; him is ridiculous.<p>Debating, especially on the internet, requires a little generosity when interpreting your opponent&#x27;s words.  Be liberal in what you accept and strict in what you emit.  I know that the President wasn&#x27;t literally silenced.  Jeff Bezos didn&#x27;t send goons to the whitehouse to gag and bag him.<p>We both know that firing off a tweet to millions instantly is a lot easier than calling a press conference.')
