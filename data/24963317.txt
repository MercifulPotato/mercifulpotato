With Mint 20 I did have to revert the touchpad driver to synaptics (just do sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics), because the new driver does not work very well.<p>The first time I did a clean install and the second I did a dual boot with Catalina (just for fun, Catalina runs like molasses). So I definitely encourage you to try with Mint.')
