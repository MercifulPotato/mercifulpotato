Had I tested positive (or not tested) it would have sucked to be in a hotel for the whole stretch, and staying with friends would have defeated the purpose of quarantine.<p>The price was about 20% below pre-Covid peak prices, so not really much of a discount.  A quite nice hotel room would have cost about the same all-in.<p>I have to think there must be at least some of that factoring in: if you need to go somewhere and you might get quarantined there, you are going to plan ahead, and for lots of reasons quarantine in a 1BR apartment is way nicer than in a hotel.')
