In the data warehousing space an app could consist of client code, middleware, and database objects, and then there’s probably data in object storage, and ETL code to deal with.  There’s code in your workflow&#x2F;scheduling system to be updated.  The CI and test frameworks need to be updated.<p>And it all has to be deployed and tested in a synchronised way, especially if you want it to be reproducible.<p>I’d rather use a purpose built tool for this, than the mashup  of tools and scripts that I currently use.')
