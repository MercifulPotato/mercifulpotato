As a matter of fact, the borrower is encouraged to return more than the amount he borrowed as a show of gratitude, but it cannot be in the loan contract nor implied or enforced in any way.<p>&gt; Fortunately I donâ€™t abide by Islamic law.<p>Yet people keep crying at the wealth gap and inflation rates and the government printing money and only a tiny percentage at the top benefits at the misery of everyone else. Islamic law is there to make a stable and just society, not for us to be wolves and destroy one another, which humans have done time and time again and it&#x27;s never going to change.<p>&gt; Lenders are not even close to guaranteed to profit<p>They are contractually owed a profit. They can go after the borrower in case of default with the full support of the law and take not only the principal, but the interest on top. This would never happen if the loan were an act of charity. The fact that the entire banking industry exists is proof that it&#x27;s a very lucrative business to be in.<p>&gt; and a loan is a type of investment<p>This isn&#x27;t a strong argument because hiring a hitman is also an &quot;investment&quot; or &quot;business transaction&quot;. Islam places restrictions on investments. For instance, investing in a tobacco company or a casino is prohibited. Lending money with interest is another prohibited investment.')
