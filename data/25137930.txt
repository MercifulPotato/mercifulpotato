Shubh, Saps and Mehmet here from Airboxr (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airboxr.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airboxr.com&#x2F;</a>). We&#x27;ve built a Google Sheets add-on that lets you import and lookup data from external data sources without having to leave your spreadsheet.<p>We found most spreadsheet users (74% in our survey of over 900 users) are frustrated with all the data collection and cleaning they need to do before they can analyze data. Data today is distributed across various marketing, sales, financial, and operational sources. While power users can write scripts to collect and clean data, most business users end up applying a long series of copy-pastes and CSV imports to get their data ready for analysis. The process of importing data from multiple sources into a spreadsheet is complicated and unintuitive.<p>Airboxr is an interactive query builder inside your Google Sheets that enables you to import and lookup data across various sources. Much like SQL querying, it lets you filter and summarize data as you see fit, without requiring any SQL know-how.<p>In our current public-beta version, you can connect to any google sheet and start importing data as per your needs. The only requirement right now is that the google sheet you connect should have tabular data with headers in the first row.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick no-frills demo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airboxr.com&#x2F;demo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airboxr.com&#x2F;demo</a>) that you can play around with. If you&#x27;re looking for a marketing specific use case, try this demo instead (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airboxr.com&#x2F;demo-marketing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airboxr.com&#x2F;demo-marketing</a>).<p>Thanks for reading - we&#x27;d love to get your thoughts, feedback, and ideas!')
