That said, we are bad at predicting the future so who knows?<p>I never said we should forget about the average people or normal people as Yang calls them in his book &quot;The War on Normal People.&quot;<p>Even if we don&#x27;t have AGI we will have narrow AI such as self driving&#x2F;factory stuff&#x2F;textiles which will displace millions. I&#x27;m all for UBI or some sort of equivalent social safety net (I&#x27;m not an economist so I don&#x27;t want to be prescriptive here as I have heard some drawbacks to UBI).<p>The technocrats have already created platforms that are tearing our social fabric apart by promulgating conspiracies and radicalizing our youth while reducing long-form literacy an increasing anxiety and depression.<p>What we need is some sort of social revolution that in my opinion could only be obtained by an authoritarian government that protects people from themselves and the exploitive tech corporations. Ban facebook to reduce conspiracy promulgation. Ban tiktok and ever increasingly addictive video games to prevent our youth from becoming dopamine junkees. Ban drugs so the listless and ever-growing welfare class remain mostly docile.<p>None of these changes are feasible in a country whose identity revolves around personal freedom&#x2F;choice.')
