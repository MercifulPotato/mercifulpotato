Occasionally I&#x27;ve had some growing pains, but I&#x27;ve found using a model that&#x27;s at least 12-18 months old is more than sufficient for patches to have made it upstream.<p>Obviously if you have some specific need for a rather new model, then going for something like the Dell XPS line or some other &quot;Linux Certified&quot; line is a better plan. But for my needs, anything within the last 6 years will likely be good enough in my book. I tend to kick intensive jobs off to my local server or set up a one-off in the cloud.')
