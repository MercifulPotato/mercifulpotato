I don&#x27;t make money off of music, and with work and family rarely have the time to spend on it. Live&#x27;s high upgrade costs seemed wasted on me. With FL Studio, it&#x27;s a single lifetime licence. Mind you the UX is not nearly as nice as Live and it&#x27;s much more geared to in-studio producing than live use, so obviously won&#x27;t work for everyone.')
