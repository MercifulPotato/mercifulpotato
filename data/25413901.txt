The press is the easy part. The special watermarked paper, the color-shifting ink, the security threads... all of that requires a functioning industrial infrastructure, dispersed over a large geographic region. And that&#x27;s exactly what would <i>not</i> be available.<p>If the U.S. goes down, the whole world goes down with it.')
