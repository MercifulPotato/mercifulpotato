But I think there are some higher level pieces where Quic is more flexible, and which can lead to higher performance on lossy links. E.g. has the ability to repackage data that was assumed lost in previous datagrams, and combine it with new data - leading to less total transmitted data in that cases. It doesn&#x27;t have to retransmit every packet in exactly the same fashion. Some Quic implementation make use of this ability - while others don&#x27;t.<p>And it might also have a bit more flexibility when to retransmit (but I&#x27;m not an expert).')
