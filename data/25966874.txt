There&#x27;s a lot to be said for locking down phones and shopping locally, but taking control of the assets those orgs hold is where it really pays off no matter who you are.<p>Migrating email is intimidating, but alleviates the highest cost risk and is actually pretty painless. In my own case, I started a Fastmail account and told it to use my own domain and sync from my gmail account. I didn&#x27;t have to commit to anything until I felt like it. After a couple of weeks I started lazily updating a few subscriptions as they got forwarded from gmail, and replying to people with &#x27;hey, check it out this is my new email&#x27;. Now, Fastmail could vanish and I&#x27;d be temporarily inconvenienced for only as long as it took to staple my domain to some other email host. Losing access to my gmail account before making that switch would have been a disaster.')
