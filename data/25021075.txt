We see this now where those with no education and very little wealth are out there saying &quot;Trump isn&#x27;t hurting the right people.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter the level of education someone has in that scenario - they&#x27;ve already decided on an &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality and will believe what they want to justify their actions.<p>There are very well-educated, well-informed, and critically-minded white supremacists - they use that knowledge and intelligence to further their racism. No amount of education will help them.<p>They&#x27;ve already decided they want to hurt other people, and just take all evidence and back it into either &quot;supports my stance of hurting others&quot; or &quot;this is fake.&quot;<p>I think we&#x27;re spending too much time on the pity party of the uneducated. That if they just had the chance of the college dream, they&#x27;d open their eyes and want to help others. I think the vast majority have already decided on their tribe, and we as a society need to be aware of this and structure accordingly rather than insult these groups by saying they&#x27;re just stupid or misinformed. They know exactly what they&#x27;re doing and are more than happy to achieve their goals because the ends justify the means.')
