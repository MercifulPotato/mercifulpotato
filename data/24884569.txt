The World fair, the Jetsons, world music etc, the visions of the future we had was the Flintstones or the suburb on Mars including a robot maid, and the Fallout videogame franchise did a very good job of pointing out of much of a boring, contemporary version of the world that was, just relocated into space.<p>Today we have <i>many</i> visions of the future, we just don&#x27;t have <i>one</i> vision of the future. On the frontpage of HN right now is a great article about Solarpunk, emerging out of cyberpunk. Which I never considered to be &#x27;dystopian&#x27; in a negative sense of the term, but in contrast to the World Fair GM aesthetic, genuinely transgressive, rather than utopian or corporate.<p>And in the real world we have countless of futures too. From change in China that is so rapid you can physically see it every two or three years, to a wholesale restructuring towards renewables, kids in rural India getting access to social media and changing how we communicate, agriculture incorporating technologies in diverse ways all over the world, autonomous cities, virtual reality, and so on.<p>What we indeed don&#x27;t have is the science fiction world as imagined by guys in the 60s in America, nobody&#x27;s forcing you to hang onto it or not to go look somewhere else for a vision of the future though. When people make this take about the lack of futuristic visions almost exclusively what they seem to be looking for is a sort of retro-futurism and nostalgia.')
