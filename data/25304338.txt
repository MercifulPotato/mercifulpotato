I guess I&#x27;m learning new things every day.<p>(The link I shared is all CPU leaning performance tests.)<p>Nanoreview? Really dude? In the &quot;Pro&quot; section for the 865+ it lists two more cores (factual but largely irrelevant) and in the &quot;Pro&quot; section of the A13 it lists &quot;Compatible with the latest DirectX 12.1&quot; (laughably hilariously untrue).<p>I love how nano review has become the Android fan bible, despite its very obvious flaws.')
