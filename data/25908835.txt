One of the technical issues that was mentioned in it was that the satellites had to correct for the Doppler shift in the frequencies they used to talk to each other because of the high relative speed they were traveling at.  I wonder if these satellites have a similar problem or if lasers are so directional they can afford to not be too discriminate in what frequencies they accept.')
