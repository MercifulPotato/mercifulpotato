Many are worried in the short-term about the spread of COVID-19, but after we come out of it the government has more power.  I think it&#x27;s important to understand and respect that other people have different priorities.  In this case, the US was born out of fighting tyranny and that is a bigger concern to some because a tyrannical government could lead to more suffering and death than caused by COVID-19.<p>I liken it to the war on drugs, which used fear-mongering and propaganda to convince people that drugs are bad and that we need to lock up people that are making decisions regarding their own bodies and minds.  Instead of educating people on the unbiased pros&#x2F;cons of recreational and medical drug use, so that people are actually informed about the decisions they&#x27;re making.  Instead, we have a war on drugs that is fueled by corruption and labels non-violent offenders as criminals.<p>When it comes to the pandemic, there is a similar approach of fear-mongering and forced coercion.  Those that refuse to wear a mask may just be people that have everyone&#x27;s interest in mind because they believe they are rebelling against government trying to get more power, which they think is worse in the long-term.<p>I respect the mask requirements when, for example, entering the grocery story, but I also feel uncomfortable by the forced coercion, re-goalposting, and increase in government power.  I believe the best approach forward is setting a good example and informing people on all aspects of the facts without bias.')
