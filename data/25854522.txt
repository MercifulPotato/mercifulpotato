Turning off a computer doesn&#x27;t completely turn it off. Specifically, ATX power supplies have a standby +5V output, even when the computer is off. (This is how Wake-on-LAN works, for instance.) So it&#x27;s quite possible that you needed to disconnect the computer to get it to fully restart.<p>As far as discharging capacitors, that&#x27;s an issue if you turn the computer off and on rapidly; the power supply can continue supplying power for a few seconds due to its capacitors, so the system might continue uninterrupted.')
