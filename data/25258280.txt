If you get more experience with those other languages you&#x27;ll definitely encounter that with projects which aren&#x27;t carefully following semantic versioning. In particular, this goes back to your previous confusion about C&#x2F;C++ — if you&#x27;re having a problem with those toolchains, the underlying problem is that they don&#x27;t have a package manager at all and every downstream tool has to compensate for that.<p>The one part which is worse in Python than some of those other languages is that the default tool doesn&#x27;t track all of the dependencies when you install a new package. If you&#x27;re not using something like pipenv, poetry, etc. you can add &quot;foo&quot; to your requirements file and have it work now but break in the future if you aren&#x27;t using a tool to pin specific versions (e.g. pip-tools). Some other tools like NPM or Cargo avoid that by default but that&#x27;s certainly not true of all languages and it&#x27;s something which is widely acknowledged as an area for improvement by the people recommending or working on the aforementioned tools.')
