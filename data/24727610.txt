Item(by='adrian_b', descendants=None, kids=[24742923], score=None, time=1602227735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725363, text='I have used an older ASRock MB with the first generation Zen, and it was OK with ECC.<p>With Ryzen 3xxx, I have used ASUS Pro WS X570-ACE ($315), which is sold as a workstation board, so you definitely should expect ECC to work without problems, and also the Mini-ITX MB ASRock X570 Phantom Gaming-ITX&#x2F;TB3 ($230), which also worked OK.<p>I expect that the other ASRock MB&#x27;s (most of them or maybe all of them specify the support of ECC) also work OK with ECC modules.<p>The ASrock Rack server board should also not have any problems with ECC. IIRC that server board supports only up to DDR4-2933, but until now faster unbuffered ECC memory modules were not sold anywhere, so that is not a disadvantage.<p>Edit: I have looked again at the ASRock site and they have updated the memory support specification. If you use only 2 UDIMM modules (i.e. up to 64 GB total), then you can use up to DDR4-3200 (which I have never seen offered anywhere until now; 2666 is easy to find, 2933 is also supported by Intel since March, so it should become available soon).')
