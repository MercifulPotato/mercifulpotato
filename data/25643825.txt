Grounding theories to experiments is literally the only thing that separates science from crackpottery.<p>It&#x27;s also pretty weird for the article to criticize &quot;logical positivism&quot;, when the most common contemporary views on the topic of philosophy of science (e.g. Popper, Kuhn, Putnam) don&#x27;t actually agree with logical positivism.')
