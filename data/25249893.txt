Jargon is, by definition, meant for communication within a discipline, and inappropriate for interdisciplinary conversation.<p>That said, translating jargon to English is a skill, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect these developers to be able to just flip a switch and turn off the jargon. OP is going to need to gradually transition them to better explanations. A good way to do that is to constantly ask for definitions to terms you&#x27;re unfamiliar with, and use the non-jargon versions yourself.')
