Now that&#x27;s an angle I did not expect on this release. Sounds exciting!<p>Edit: just to clarify, the Neural Engine itself is not really &quot;new&quot;:<p>&gt; The A11 also includes dedicated neural network hardware that Apple calls a &quot;Neural Engine&quot;. This neural network hardware can perform up to 600 billion operations per second and is used for Face ID, Animoji and other machine learning tasks.[9] The neural engine allows Apple to implement neural network and machine learning in a more energy-efficient manner than using either the main CPU or the GPU.[14][15] However, third party apps cannot use the Neural Engine, leading to similar neural network performance to older iPhones.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple_A11#Neural_Engine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Apple_A11#Neural_Engine</a>')
