Of course, there are just so many wonderful things in EGB that this is not a fatal flaw by any means.<p>There is a fantastic book called &quot;The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing&quot;\nby Martin D. Davis that makes a very good job of explaining the context of Gödel&#x27;s theorem, the theorem itself and the relation with computing in an accesible way. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone interested either in computers or in Gödel&#x27;s theorem.')
