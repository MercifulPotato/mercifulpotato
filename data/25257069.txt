Currently it&#x27;s a finite resource that all network providers have to negotiate for and involves more than just the big tech companies. But as workloads continue shifting to the cloud (leveraging the cost efficiencies such as AWS Graviton chips), I&#x27;m expecting companies to vying for greater ownership of this external network bandwidth.<p>I&#x27;d be curious of any behind the scenes negotiations being made with Starlink, to leverage its growing satellite constellations to address this.')
