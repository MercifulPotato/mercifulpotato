You accept the limited control you have -- this is how Stoics reconcile the pursuit of mental imperturbation with the pursuit of outcomes. To Quote Cicero, remaking on the Stoics:<p>“If a man were to make it his purpose to take a true aim with a spear or arrow at some mark, his ultimate end, corresponding to the ultimate good as we pronounce it, would be to do all he could to aim straight … whereas the actual hitting of the mark would be in our phrase ‘to be chosen’ but not ‘to be desired.&#x27;”<p>So a Stoic might try to effectuate a particular outcome in, say, her political life -- choosing actions that align with the outcome, but does not &quot;desire&quot; it -- meaning her self-worth and happiness is tightly bound with whether she gets it or not.<p>It&#x27;s a fair thing to ask how psychologically tenable this is. Some people may struggle with this kind of framing. I personally have found it liberating.')
