There&#x27;s a crosswalk there so I checked and the crosswalk was vacant, made the turn and proceeded to get up to speed on that road.<p>And then immediately did a hard brake because a woman was illegally crossing the road around a bend, covered by trees, with a kid being dragged behind her, 40 feet from a crosswalk that clearly indicated DO NOT WALK.<p>There&#x27;s a reason we have signs. Follow the signs. Having the right away is not the same as being impervious to being struck by a moving vehicle.')
