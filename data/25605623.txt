Nation states can fabricate this easily.

Not saying Apple is same as Theronas, mind you; the point is that newspapers such as WSJ do thorough investigations compared to some random anon account on Medium.<p>I’ve just become increasingly aware of misinformation after this the US elections drama. I take everything with a grain of salt.')
