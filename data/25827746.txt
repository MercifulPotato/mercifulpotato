Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611010699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823290, text='&gt; I thought I believed in free speech, to the point where I started a company dedicated to providing privacy and communications products that were not subject to control by any central authority (that turns out to be very hard!) But watching the events of the past few years unfold I am no longer convinced that this would really make the world a better place.<p>I&#x27;ve gone completely the other way. At one point my thinking was that private companies running these platforms weren&#x27;t a problem as long as there wasn&#x27;t a monopoly. So government censorship is a problem (monopoly on force), Apple and Google are a problem (duopoly &#x2F; two &quot;regional&quot; monopolies) but there is no reason to criticize Twitter for removing anything because they actually have competitors.<p>Recent events have led me to believe that removing central control from the distribution of information is an imperative.<p>Because having more alternatives only matters if the alternatives are actually different. Uniform obsequiousness to the party about to be in control of the government isn&#x27;t a marketplace of ideas.<p>If I want to try to be ideologically consistent, there is still an antitrust argument to make. Uniform behavior when the alternative would attract a large contingent of users implies collusion, or government censorship via capitulation to some not so veiled threats from legislators. But one way or another this is a threat to democracy.<p>MSNBC is now arguing that Comcast et al should stop carrying Fox News. Comcast is the parent company of MSNBC.<p>The answer has to be disintermediation. Which also solves the <i>real</i> problem, which is centralized platforms purposely promoting controversial content to increase engagement. QAnon came from Facebook, not Parler.')
