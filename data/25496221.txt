The pace is slower than I expected and I have ADHD. I struggled at first especially since I want to respect other’s WLB. Sometimes I’d do a weeks worth (or more) of work in a day or two, but I try to spread that work back out so that it seems like things are more consistent. Some days I just can’t&#x2F;won’t? focus on work. I think it’s because it’s not engaging? Does anyone “have it all,” ie working on interesting things at a challenging, yet decent pace? Has anyone been in a similar position? Do you have any advice?')
