I countered that perception by pointing out that it is a very minor gift given by someone in a position of much larger power than the employee. I felt compelled to make this comment as I perceived this praise to be an inaccurate perception of the actual relationship between worker and employer. I&#x27;m calling attention to that as a form of thinking that can harm the employee but than can be improved. Working for an employer may be necessary, but adapting your thinking to praise the employer and their power is often not and needlessly decreases some of your freedom or power to get a better position. Take for example workers who feel guilt at leaving an employer, whereas the employer might discard them without any second thoughts if needed.<p>I compared it to feudalism for illustrative effect, but I believe the comparison also has merit in itself as de facto feudal power was further bolstered by cultural constructs that further limited the scope of analysis in favor of the status quo. We operate under similar constructs with hustle porn, by-your-bootstraps, CEO worship and so on. Of course, this is a matter of subjective and cultural perception but I wouldn&#x27;t call it naive.<p>Nowhere did I propose a complete framework to radically improve all of society, nor was it necessary to do so for the scope of my argument which merely cautioned against needlessly submissive (and naive!) ways of looking at employment that add burdens way beyond what physical reality or the organization of society bestows.')
