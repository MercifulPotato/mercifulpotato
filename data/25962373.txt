I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s and just have started learning by doing some basic mutual fund investment through my bank last year and to just help drive my wandering attention bought a couple of shares...Tesla a couple months ago and two days ago bought one symbolic share of GME.<p>I log in today to get a chuckle, across all of my mutual funds and two stocks, only one is in the green from yesterday.
