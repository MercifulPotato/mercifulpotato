It&#x27;s a bit ridiculous to some, but it slows down the pace that I actually learn and engage with the content. A textbook usually takes me a couple months to type, and I&#x27;m never in a rush though finishing chapters is satisfying and an easy goal for an evening. I find it similar to as if I were to attend a lecture on the topic.')
