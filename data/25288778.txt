Gebru routinely makes slanderous and offensive allegations against specific individuals, not Google as a whole.<p>That said, Garrett makes clear his ideological sympathies on Twitter. Undoubtably comments like this one don&#x27;t endear him to his management chain:<p><i>When @computerfemme was fired, the VP of security at Google Cloud sent out an email to the security organisation containing one absolutely false statement and one misleading statement, both of which portrayed her acts in a more negative light.</i><p>Pretty serious stuff. He doesn&#x27;t elaborate on what those claims were. The woman in question was fired from the security team for violating IT security policies: in her words, &quot;All I did was make a popup to share the labor notice Google has to share with its workers&quot;, something that Google seems to have recurrent problems with staff doing. In other words she was rewriting the contents of web pages to meet her own political objectives.<p>If I were the VP of Security at Google I would have serious concerns at that point about insider threats from sympathisers on the security team. You can&#x27;t be publicly slamming your own VP as dishonest for firing someone who subverted IT policies if you actually work in security.')
