Maybe for RPi, butâ€”it has poor paint performance as well.  It will flash if you try to do animation or scroll a complex screen.  Bit of a toss up on the that front.<p>Anyway I find it useful for testing terminal sequences, but it&#x27;s a tough sell as a daily driver.  Things like tabs and a proper scrollbar are a minimum for me.')
