Item(by='belval', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608498434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487730, text='It&#x27;s a high-end card for sure, but &quot;pretty close to the best money can buy&quot; is a big hyperbole.<p>The RTX 2070S beats the 1080Ti by a comfortable margin, while the 1080Ti beats the 1080 by a strong margin as well. I left out the RTX 3000 as they are hard to come by, but it&#x27;s beaten by the RTX 3060Ti which, at MSRP is a $400 card.')
