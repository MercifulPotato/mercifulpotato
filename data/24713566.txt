Build quality is not good, and every service-center visit leaves you feeling like they are stuffing the service centers with way more issues than the people there can handle. Even with all this, the drive feel of my MS is insane and the screen&#x2F;app are lightyears ahead. I honestly enjoy driving again, even pre-pandemic with crazy traffic. Their offering is so good it outweighs the crappy support.\nIf some other car company would step up to the plate and try to complete with similar tech but offering higher reliability, I would go for a test drive immediately.<p>Side-note: service at Tesla used to be golden. When they first started, they all knew they were pricy cars and everyone expected some growing pains leading to QC issues. It was great - they would loan you a top-model performance tesla while your car was in the shop (great up-sell!!!), they were doing far more of their &quot;mobile service&quot; (super handy, they drive to you and fix the car where you are), and you would get one agent that called you almost daily with an update.<p>As they have expanded more towards mass market they have gone the way of google - trying to automate humans out of the loop. It&#x27;s basically a miracle to talk to a human at a service center now, everything is &quot;schedule it in-app where you get 200 characters to explain your issue, we send over an estimate, you can&#x27;t call to discuss it either approve or don&#x27;t, drop your car, use our SMS platform for 100% of communications because email might &quot;violate your privacy&quot; (read: leave a data trail), handle the fact that different agents get your SMS at different times and some have no idea what the history is, handle that agents now &quot;have to reply to all messages before they leave&quot; and you&#x27;re getting hurried &quot;here&#x27;s my panicked update&quot; messages at 11:30 at night.<p>I personally feel they missed an opportunity to offer &quot;luxury service lanes&quot; for folks buying the luxury line when they went mass market.')
