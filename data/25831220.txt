In this case you could have said “found the Canadian” and I still wouldn’t know what point is being made.<p>So, to my point, HN has international readership, some of which is Canadian, having people on HN point out some of the specifics about practicing engineering in Canada (or any other country for that matter) seems to be a useful addition to the commentary. Some HN readership is still in high school or early into their college or university studies and not everyone has access to the same resources, mentors, or even knowledge of where to research answers to their questions. Sharing on HN is a great thing and can be beneficial to these people. I know I’ve personally benefitted a great deal from HN comments.')
