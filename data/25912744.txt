Charge voltages, and discharge timing? Odds would be you could probably make it go boom in a more controlled manner than what happened in past accidents when the bombs exploded after hitting the ground.<p>The trouble would be getting past the tamper-proof barrier, because the modern bombs are probably made to self-destruct, from what I&#x27;ve read, so instead of a nice ready-made bomb internals waiting for a simpler arduino control circuit for a fireset, you&#x27;d be dealing with a <i>hot</i> mess, after trying to get in.<p>Just some uninformed thoughts.<p>I also found some images of fat man firset online: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lanlmuseum.pastperfectonline.com&#x2F;webobject&#x2F;3D33BB7F-ABB3-4D52-A7C2-678145610359" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lanlmuseum.pastperfectonline.com&#x2F;webobject&#x2F;3D33BB7F-...</a> Interesting device. :)')
