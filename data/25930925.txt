It is hard to explain how far off the mark you are...I know financial services can look like a black box....but what is happening is much more boring than you might think.  All the drama is happening on Reddit...the SEC is worried about retail investors creating a bubble and losing money....hedge funds and traders just want to make money.....they may take a loss here and move on quickly to the next thing. Doing crazy sheeeeet like you suggested would have them potentially lose all of their investors money or be blacklisted....')
