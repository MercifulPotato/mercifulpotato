For ~$1500&#x2F;year I insure that. It&#x27;s not cheap, but it would pay out until I was 65 at some reasonable percentage of my normal salary in the case I was severely injured, or otherwise unable to work. Anywhere from an ergonomics caused hand&#x2F;arm injury, a bike-riding caused head injury, a wood-shop caused eye damage, etc.<p>Consider grabbing it while you&#x27;re young and working in a lucrative career.')
