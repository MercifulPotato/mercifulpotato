You could equally be right about what ends up going from Stripe&#x2F;Braintree&#x2F;etc to Visa&#x2F;Mastercard&#x2F;etc, though comments&#x2F;links about Level 3 payment data make me think that the itemized level of detail will increase in usage, and also as you say transactional data is certainly bought and sold outside of the payment networks.')
