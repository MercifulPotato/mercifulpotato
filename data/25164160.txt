I have been able to cope with just about every other part of the Linux desktop experience, but the pointer sensitivity is atrocious. I wouldn&#x27;t make a big deal of it but it&#x27;s so obvious every time I do anything in a GUI. I&#x27;ve tried trackpad and corded mice and they&#x27;re all the same:<p>When I turn the sensitivity down low, it caps the max &quot;flick&quot; speed to be sluggish. When I turn the sensitivity up high, even tiny delicate mouse movements lurch my pointer halfway across the screen.<p>More than anything else, I want a mouse acceleration curve that works like macOS or Windows. Both those operating systems come out of the box good defaults and good configurability. Linux has neither.')
