It adds up quick if you pay retail like that. Meanwhile, if you can reduce that by an order of magnitude, the number of projects that will take advantage of it will increase. As for hobbyist projects vs commercial products, many hobbyists have created businesses from their projects, and that goes from woodworking to baking to electronics. Seems like 6-7 years ago there was a lot of excitement around the idea of &quot;desktop manufacturing&quot; and realizing the promise of 3D printing for small batch electronics. Maybe that was a little early in the hype cycle but I very much would like to see this sort of thing take off. Every $ counts in making that a realistic possibility.')
