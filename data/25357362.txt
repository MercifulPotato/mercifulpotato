Would you mind to put a bit more, eg an example, than just following three lines there?<p><pre><code>  from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead\n  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;mbien&#x2F;recipenlg&quot;)\n  model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained(&quot;mbien&#x2F;recipenlg&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nFYI, I got this from running above lines:<p><pre><code>  ...AutoModelWithLMHead is deprecated and will be removed in a future version...\n</code></pre>\nFYI2, I just entered on your huggingface page &quot;Get salt, apples and sugar and you get&quot; and got &quot;Get salt, apples and sugar and you get a soft, sticky mess. Then add water, add a lemon or lime and add a 1&#x2F;8 teaspoon vanilla. Add a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. When you are ready&quot;, where is the recipe, what is this?? A bit more docs would be nice...')
