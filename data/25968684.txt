Whether it was the merit of the language, interpreter, rest of the stack or anything else is immaterial. I&#x27;m just demonstrating that it didn&#x27;t have performance problems. The reason I preemptively mentioned performance not being an issue is because <i>you</i> are not putting forth any arguments for why you dislike it.<p>While we&#x27;re here, cherry-picking one sentence of a post and putting it out of context to try to invalidate all my other opinions is not arguing in good faith. You seem to be trying to prove that I&#x27;m &quot;ignorant&quot; or something, but you&#x27;re the only one displaying any ignorance here, since you&#x27;re not putting forth any argument, but rather just parroting that something is crap and trying to &quot;win an argument&quot; using fallacies. There is nothing to be learned from your posts at all, no different perspective, no justification of your opinion, no insights into why you dislike it. You&#x27;re just doubling down on a preconception that you have no justification for.')
