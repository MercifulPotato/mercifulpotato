Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24770172], score=None, time=1602620073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24765872, text='<i>&gt;  I&#x27;ve lived in a wealthy suburban community that used single-dwelling zoning to exclude apartments, townhomes and low income housing</i><p>I agree that such communities exist. However, that does not mean all communities that have some parts of them zoned for single-family dwellings are like that. Every community I have lived in that had portions of it zoned for single family dwellings also had townhomes and apartments, all in the same community and all within similar reach of whatever amenities were provided. (I have also been on both sides of the divide you draw, living in townhomes and living in single family homes.)')
