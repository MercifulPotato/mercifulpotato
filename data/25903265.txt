Keep in mind that they would still have to compete with Tesla at somepoint which has a best car platform vs &lt; X car company&gt; in the market.  Not to mention they already have close to 1 million cars with all the hardware(their claim, i still feel tesla TPU v2 with TSMC 7nm is a must have) and they are on track to producing 500k cars in US with these capabilities. while no other car company is even trying to integrate &lt; X lidar autonomy startup&gt; in mass production Today . Not to mention that currently the primary hindrance for Tesla is software which can scale much better in comparison to a ground up redesign of a car plant to accommodate lidar based systems .')
