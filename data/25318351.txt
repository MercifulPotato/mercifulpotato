Concise data from the 1930s isn&#x27;t super easy to come by, you are going to have to look at broader economic trends and make your own conclusions.<p>I don&#x27;t really need concise data, just some rough numbers.  How much did they project the revenue act would raise, how much did it actually raise.  How much did it impact investments, spending, choices etc.<p>Without so much as numbers its really hard to argue its impact.  You could say going off the gold standard was much more impactful.<p>&gt;Regardless of whether FTT would work or not, it&#x27;s a single tactic (small picture), when we already successfully tax wealth in various ways (estate, property taxes).<p>Man... it isn&#x27;t regardless.  If an FTT doesn&#x27;t work we&#x27;re taking one step forward and several steps back.<p>&gt;The big picture is breaking the power of concentrated financial power, and taxation is an obvious method.<p>Yea... and sometimes obvious things are not the best things.<p>&gt;Nit picking specific policies seems to be a favorite bad-faith tactic to avoid acknowledging that the issue is an issue, which would then require the nitpickers to suggest ideas themselves, instead of just criticizing.<p>Then why would you bring up the Revenue Act?  That is literally a &quot;specific policy&quot;.\nDo you want me to show dozens of examples of FTTs failing?  Do you simply need more?<p>I&#x27;m &quot;nit picking&quot; this because 1) I have knowledge on it as I&#x27;ve researched it. 2) It would personally impact me. 3) It is a ridiculous policy because it has been tried so many times and never in its history has it raised as much money as it has projected to raise.  They are constantly repealed shortly after they are enacted because people realized they messed up.<p>Its hardly nit picking when its pretty much one of the major policies of politicians wanting to &quot;redistribute wealth&quot; or &quot;fix inequality&quot; - Bernie Sanders has talked about it at great length.  Andrew Yang proposed it as one of his policies.  There&#x27;s nothing to nit pick.  Every single time it has been tried it has been repealed after terrible results.<p>I&#x27;m saying I see a very high chance of the wealth tax doing the same exact thing.')
