Based on all the problems in our system I don&#x27;t know that the U.S. deserves to be called a democracy, unless the word has lost much of its meaning.<p>Candidates are effectively preselected via funding by .02% of the population before people can vote, and gerrymandering districts is rampant so that political parties are selecting voters, instead of the other way around [0].<p>Would you say that things like that make the U.S. a de jure democracy, also?<p>I think the problems with our so-called democracy explain why Trump has had the following that he does. He had the money and media experience to get elected based on the outrage so many people have for all other politicians who do not really represent them. The establishment seemed more interested in getting rid of him than addressing the sentiment that brought him to office. I&#x27;m not a Trump supporter myself, and I loathe his demagoguery, but I think that understand why he got elected. He&#x27;s popular with a lot of politically apathetic people because they really believed he would &quot;drain the swamp&quot; and that he wasn&#x27;t like every single other politician - not another Bush, not another Clinton, another insider, not someone who was going to bail out Wall Street again, etc.<p>Apologies for nitpicking and spouting off a bit, but like I said this has all very much been on my mind lately. I know that I may be tilting at windmills here, but words are important and shape our thoughts, which led me to throw my original comment out there.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PJy8vTu66tE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PJy8vTu66tE</a>')
