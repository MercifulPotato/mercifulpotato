But perhaps unlike other frameworks&#x2F;libraries, I think Rails has solid abstractions. Of course they&#x27;re not perfect, but much like abstractions provided by an OS, they <i>are</i> complex, and you mostly don&#x27;t have to worry about implementation details. (And when you do, that&#x27;s okay, because the documentation is solid too and the code is available.)<p>I&#x27;ve been working with Django lately and I definitely had to learn to let go and trust stuff like the ORM. But after watching migrations get handled automatically and easily adding foreign key relationships to tables, I was hooked. I used to be firmly in the &quot;almost never ORM&quot; camp, but that&#x27;s changed.')
