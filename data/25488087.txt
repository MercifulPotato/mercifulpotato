Not necessarily so in nations such as China, India, and many other developing countries.<p>The opposite state of this is poverty, a condition in which humanity has lived for 99% of its existence. In the modern day, technology and evolution in economic-political systems have enabled us to produce wealth at a large scale, enough to support hundreds of millions of people living with more material comforts than any medieval king. It took a hell of a lot of work to get here.<p>To argue that &quot;Work is the source of nearly all the misery in the world&quot;, then, is to put the cart before the horse. Work is precisely the attempt to alleviate ourselves of poverty. Work, coordinated well and magnified in its output by technology, which itself progressed due to a combination of work and the play of creative-minded individuals, creates the wealth we enjoy today.<p>I think this essay provides too many fancy words and not enough details about how to achieve this utopian vision of a world of all play and no work, in which economically productive activities are perfectly aligned with our human pursuits so as to produce wealth, leisure, and comfort for all.<p>For example, this following passage, in which he proposes the abolition of the auto industry:<p><pre><code>  Next we can take a meat-cleaver to production work itself. No more war production, nuclear power, junk food, feminine hygiene deodorant — and above all, no more auto industry to speak of. An occasional Stanley Steamer or Model-T might be all right, but the auto-eroticism on which such pestholes as Detroit and Los Angeles depend on is out of the question. Already, without even trying, we’ve virtually solved the energy crisis, the environmental crisis and assorted other insoluble social problems.\n</code></pre>\nWhat does this even mean? We need automobiles to get around — to drop kids off at school, to transport food from the farm to the granary to the supermarket, to visit mom and dad&#x27;s over the holidays. I take issue when this essay hand-waves away these concerns. I&#x27;d rather see a proposal for what might alleviate these needs — better public transport? Electric cars? Logistics handled by swarms of flying drones?<p>I am all for being an optimist, and all for evolving culturally so that we can work more happily and efficiently, and all for employing technology to achieve these things, but this essay isn&#x27;t it. It would make sense if we lived in the Culture of Iain M. Banks, cared for by hyper-intelligent AI, but that&#x27;s so far away in the future as to be barely worth considering right now.<p>As of today, work and a culture of work has produced our rich society. It&#x27;s also produced its share of problems — rich diseases, soulless office cubicles, environmental degradation — but abolishing work culture is not the answer. The problems you mention of distribution and recycling of surplus is going to be solved with — dare I say it? — more work.')
