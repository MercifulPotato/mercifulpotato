The vast majority of people served by food pantries are not homeless.  Most people who can&#x27;t afford to put a roof over their heads are sleeping under somebody else&#x27;s.<p>I do get it.  When people think about homelessness, when they cast a ballot, we don&#x27;t want them to think about the &quot;hardcore&quot; (as you put it) unsympathetic homeless.  We want them to think about the more relatable people experiencing transitional homelessness.  People who are leaving an abusive situation, people working a job that didn&#x27;t cover their rent, etc.  The Rosa Parkses of homelessness.<p>And that sucks.  It sucks that the &quot;hardcore&quot; homeless are so stigmatized that the only acceptable way to talk about helping them is to frame a larger problem in which they can be hidden away as an unrepresentative minority.')
