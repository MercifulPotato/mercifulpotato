Item(by='LeifCarrotson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604960465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25040540, text='For in-stock, Prime-eligible, fulfilled-by-Amazon products the delivery has nothing to do with the seller. The shipping vendor (to me) is Amazon, the warehousing vendor is also Amazon, and they&#x27;re using the typical UPS, USPS, and sometimes FedEx suppliers.<p>I&#x27;m choosing between pictures, descriptions, and reviews of products on Amazon. In that context, the individual seller (and there might be a dozen for an individual product, though typically only one marked Prime) has nothing to do with the delivery, and it&#x27;s a question of the quality of the actual product.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I have Prime, live on the end of a private cul-de-sac and have zero problems with package theft, typically filter by Prime-eligible products, and have bought thousands of dollars of stuff on Amazon. I can think of two instances where the products didn&#x27;t get to me, and one of those was an exception to my Prime-eligible filter. The other time, I waited a week for my 2-day shipping, contacted Amazon, and they shipped a second unit. A couple days after the second unit arrived, the original also made its way to me at the end of a long, tortured journey through the wrong state, no idea what happened there (I contacted Amazon when it arrived and they said I could keep it...good service!)')
