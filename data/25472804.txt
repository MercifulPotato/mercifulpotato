This is actually bad system architecture. Whenever you have a timeout for something that involves a major config change like this, the timeout must be short (like less than a week). Otherwise, it is very likely people will forget about it, and it will take a while for people to recognize and fix the problem. The alternative is to just use a calendar and have someone manually flip the switch when they see the reminder pop up. Over reliance on automated timeouts like this is indicative of a badly designed software ownership structure.')
