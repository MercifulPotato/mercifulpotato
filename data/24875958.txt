And the download offline feature has always worked great for me, a 100 songs uploads periodically to match what I&#x27;ve been listening to, so I don&#x27;t run into the classic issue of using the same &quot;I don&#x27;t have service&quot; music playlist.<p>Not that I don&#x27;t get why people complain about the move (it is a dramatically different app), but Google is the only one with the actual usage numbers, and honestly I&#x27;ve never met someone who has used it. I&#x27;m guessing they weren&#x27;t the best, while Youtube has some of the best usage numbers of any Western service.')
