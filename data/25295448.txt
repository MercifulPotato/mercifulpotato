The Dark Knight rises had similar issues with sound mixing, especially with Bane&#x27;s voice in certain scenes. I remember Interstellar having issues as well. Funny enough, Googling his last few movies (ex: &quot;Dunkirk sound mixing problems&quot;) all lead to articles around the time of the movie&#x27;s release and the audience complaining about sound problems.<p>Slightly off topic, but I personally use subtitles for everything I watch now because I got tired of missing dialogue for different reasons. More movies being on demand is a blessing for me in this regard.')
