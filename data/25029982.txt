It uses a slightly different technique for registering keypresses but looks about the same on the inside as the Model F. It worked great. After 3 days, I decided to clean it up and open it. I then quickly destroyed it by using a bit too much water during the cleaning. It got into the plastic tubes with the springs [0] and that was the end of most of the keys. I tried drying it with a hairdryer, but without success. The black plastic visible on the image is attached to the board by melted plastic joints, so removing it without destroying it is not possible. Congratulations to the author for not making the same stupid mistake as me.<p>Of course, you can still experience the clickiness of the Model M without owning one with the great emulator [1].
