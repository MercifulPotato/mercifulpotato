Now, obviously, any black person is technically capable of tuning into the Fox News channel where Dave Ramsey has a show, or dial their radio to conservative radio stations where Dave Ramsey is broadcast.  But in practical terms, Dave Ramsey is unavailable to black people.  And they are actively discouraged by our culture from even finding out that he exists.<p>I became aware of this in a discussion with a black friend i which she believed something that was &quot;sort of&quot; untrue.  It was something approximately like she believed that white people grow up in homes where certain concepts like basic personal finance are taught.  This was so bizarre sounding to me, because my actual life experience was so different.  I grew up in a poor &quot;white trash&quot; household.  My parents were&#x2F;are buried in debt up to their necks.  Basic personal finance, the Ramsey flavor or otherwise, was simply not in the ether.  I didn&#x27;t grow up with Fox on the TV either, or anything even pretending to be news.  I still don&#x27;t generally watch Fox News, but am a Ramsey fan.<p>I believe my friend was technically wrong, but maybe directionally right.  She was directionally right in the sense that even though Dave Ramsey wasn&#x27;t in my household, it was culturally at least acceptable.  If you&#x27;re far enough left wing to where you can&#x27;t bring yourself to listen to Fox News&#x2F;conservative radio, you can maybe get by with Clark Howard combined with Planet Money.  Still extremely white in culture and audience.<p>I hope we figure out some way to get past this.  Because even the pitiful tools that are available aren&#x27;t available to everyone.')
