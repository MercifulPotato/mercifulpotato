You can say that&#x27;s more fair than a price on the car itself, as then it punishes frequent drivers more than people who drive less. In general though, your individual CO2 production doesn&#x27;t matter that much, instead the population&#x27;s emissions matter. And on a population level, you can create statistics about how many km each bought car will drive on average, and base the different car prices on that. Whether you want to punish frequent drivers or everyone who buys an ICE car is a political&#x2F;social discussion. In general, a tax on gasoline is not helpful in getting people to switch if there is no EV car around they can switch to. In Germany, gasoline is already extremely heavily taxed, and still people drive a lot. Even in the current stage, where there are few EV cars compared to ICE cars, economics of scale still favour ICE cars, so there is still an effect in favour of EV cars. Maybe that&#x27;s what such measures counteract?')
