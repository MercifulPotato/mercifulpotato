The current works to implement oneAPI for AMD and Nvidia hardware don&#x27;t use OpenCL (hipSYCL and sycl-cuda). IMO, that some people think oneAPI is the future is an indication that OpenCL is &quot;falling apart,&quot; not evidence that it is improving.<p>Vendors which have had decent OpenCL implementations for a long time (i.e. Intel) will implement oneAPI on top of OpenCL, others will not (if they implement oneAPI at all).')
