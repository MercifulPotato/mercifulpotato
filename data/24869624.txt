I think the alien species it explores is much more interestingly non-human than the one in Deepness in the Sky and that the bad guys in Deepness are kind of comically over-done. They suffer from a common problem where the bad guys have to not only be bad for main reason X but also are sadistic rapists, torturers, etc. on top. As if we didn&#x27;t already get the &quot;they&#x27;re bad&quot; memo already. Plus all the action happens in the finale and, to a large extent, outside of our view. Still, both are great books, but I&#x27;d recommend Fire to anyone first.')
