I&#x27;ve read everything she&#x27;s written on the issue including the long message she wrote to the brain group, and her tweets where she shared what Google said when they accepted her resignation. These latter make specific reference to the ultimatum, which was the ultimate reason for her departure.<p>As I pointed out in the previous discussion she may have faced some sort of disciplinary action upon her return from vacation due to the content of her message to the brain group.<p>However, when she resigned what Google managers did (and this is no great leap of logic) is figure out that if they made her work her notice period she&#x27;d probably only cause more trouble in the meantime, so they brought it forward and made it effective immediately.<p>This might or might not be unusual behaviour for handling a resignation at Google, but it is fairly common practice amongst different organisations for a variety of different reasons that usually boil down to mitigating some kimd of risk to the organisation.')
