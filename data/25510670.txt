This is going to come off as condescending and rude to Nintendo gamers, but I find most modern Nintendo games to be glorified demos than serious games.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but they&#x27;re a crowd with different priorities.<p>Although Nintendo hasn&#x27;t been as bad about this in recent years, I vowed to never give them money again after they wiped out countless numbers of YouTube channels with walkthroughs for games they don&#x27;t even publish anymore.  It&#x27;s like, WTF, you have these people promoting your games for free, games you don&#x27;t even sell anymore, and you&#x27;re punishing them for showing other people how great your games are.  It comes off as so &quot;old man get off my lawn&quot; that I can&#x27;t ever reward it or respect it.  As far as I can tell, Microsoft doesn&#x27;t DMCA remove videos featuring Halo: Combat Evolved, a game that&#x27;s nearly 20 years old, but Nintendo ruthlessly removed tons of videos that showed games like Goldeneye 007 under fair use, which are now gone forever.  That&#x27;s an abuse of the public space.  <i>Screw Nintendo</i>.  (Ironically, Microsoft owns Rare now, but I&#x27;m pretty sure Nintendo has both rights to James Bond and the N64 game)')
