I think this also is relevant to our &quot;no nuance&quot; conversation. Defining a moderate now is relatively difficult and I think more people think they are moderates than actually are. Are we talking about moderates from a fairly objective viewpoint? American standpoint? That of the state? Are we talking about the moderates that the DNC describes and are the Joe voters? Are we talking about the moderates that the RNC describes? The moderates of today or the moderates when that skit was written? While I agree with you of the loophole of moderates since many self-label as moderate (even if they aren&#x27;t by any reasonable metric) as a means of &quot;feeling good&quot; and having moral superiority. That kind is the same pitfall as the extremists, but I think just lumping all moderates into that bin (and subsequently having a total of 3 extremist bins) isn&#x27;t helpful and makes it difficult to heal the divide that we have.<p>That said I&#x27;ll admit I have a bias that I&#x27;m against parties since I feel they make things too simple for a well functioning democracy but you&#x27;ve also probably seem my passionate comments about voting.')
