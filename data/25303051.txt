But converting it to a markdown&#x2F;HTML is downright absurd. I think the current approach of improving it step by step is the most reasonable. Wikipedia is a project which can afford to sustain its own custom syntax (because of history, compatibility concerns and wikipedia&#x27;s special needs).<p>I think the biggest issue isn&#x27;t technical in nature - it&#x27;s the actual task of building the encyclopedia - to decide together on its scope, decide what is notable and what isn&#x27;t. To fight against brigading from interest groups, fight against attempts to game their rules. All of these are intrinsically difficult tasks and of course wikipedia has made many mistakes.
