Personally I&#x27;ve had great luck with Digital Ocean and Linode for basic&#x2F;affordable VPS hosting, with AWS being a great cloud provider with an incredible tool-box at your disposal. Hell, GPC, Azure... there&#x27;s just so many better options.<p>IMO Rackspace has been on a steady decline for years. They were a choice provider back in the early 2000&#x27;s when a managed&#x2F;unmanaged beige box&#x2F;shared cPanel&#x2F;Plesk hosting was common. Back then their support was incredible. Sometime around 2010 though things started to go down hill, and I experienced more and more support issues with them. These would range from annoying all the way to &quot;that shouldn&#x27;t happen&quot; (like losing volumes, which happened to me).<p>The final straw was when a dedicated server was turned down by mistake, causing a major outage for 20+ of my clients at the time. This was 10 years ago and I&#x27;ve never looked back. They did a pretty good job at turning me into an advocate against their services.<p>Oh and the Slicehost transition was crap too. That sucked to get over to a first-gen VPS provider only to have it sucked right back into the beast that you were trying to escape from in the first place...<p>Sorry for the mini rant. I&#x27;m still not over the PTSD that Rackspace has caused me.')
