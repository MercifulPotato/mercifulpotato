This place is... odd. (as I&#x27;m sure you know!)<p>If I formed my opinion only from HN, I&#x27;d think most engineers love: big-tech, advertising, electric cars, Apple, tech-enabled tracking (autos, web, cell-phone, watches, exercise machines, music players - it&#x27;s ok if business profits!), and tend toward self-righteousness, narcissism, and virtue-signalling.<p>Of course, most of us are just living our lives and trying to get by. I don&#x27;t know where this self-important insufferable attitude comes from, but I suspect it&#x27;s a few folks who are very noisy. Most &#x27;normal&#x27; people don&#x27;t spend much time posting to sites like these, so there is a selection bias. Sadly, I also suspect that this attitude is an advantage in today&#x27;s environment. It is a mirage of self-confidence, and telling the two apart can be very hard (especially for a potential employer).')
