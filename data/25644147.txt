The petro-dollar was fairly obvious in the late 20th century, but now things are more subtle.<p>The key thing is ensuring that all exchanges of wealth only occur within a currency controlled by the authorities. They are not really concerned about minor instances of tax avoidance; the primary concern is that large scale economic activity could start occuring outside of a government controlled credit market place.<p>The goal here is to ensure that Bitcoin is <i>financed</i> in USD, and that the finance of this asset remains in government controlled credit. You can borrow bitcoin sure, but its in USD credit markets.<p>You can&#x27;t at this stage get a bitcoin-mortgage, or a bitcoin credit card that never references USD. Imagine if you could transact in bitcoin all the time, and post assets as collateral to get bitcoin loans with interest pay-able in bitcoin. This would be a point where people stop measuring bitcoin in USD and start measuring things in bitcoin, and is something the US regulators seek to avoid at absolutely all costs.')
