Alternatives include:<p>* Setting aside parts of the profit for future investment<p>* Getting a loan from a bank or your local credit union<p>* Community or owner funding<p>Do you honestly think that if it wasn’t for investors businesses would just stop existing? In a world without venture capitalists businesses would need to stand on their own merits, if it is not profitable it will go bankrupt. If it is a popular idea though, a competitor will find a better way of making it profitable, and share that profits with the owners and the workers (and not a shareholder because we don’t need them).<p>Arguably the existence of venture capitalist markets makes stupid unprofitable businesses out-compete better run businesses, simply by merit of being able to persuade investors.')
