Packer itself would be totally replaced with something like OPS - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ops.city" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ops.city</a> as ops produces machine images for the various hypervisors - but to be clear - you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use ops but nothing else gives you a cloud deploy in 2 min and 2 commands.<p>OPS allows you to pass quite a lot of configuration related switches&#x2F;options&#x2F;etc: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanovms.gitbook.io&#x2F;ops&#x2F;configuration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanovms.gitbook.io&#x2F;ops&#x2F;configuration</a> and config files that you need on disk can be copied in at build time too. Env vars and such can be injected as well.<p>If you want to keep using a secret store like Vault that&#x27;s totally fine and up to you and your application needs. As mentioned in the article some companies use volumes to rotate certs every few hours&#x2F;day via volumes so the sensitive stuff is separated from deploys.')
