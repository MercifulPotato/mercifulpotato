If we as a community are against personalized ads it gives two things:<p>1. Cheaper facebook ads as people pull out from advertising on Facebook since they see less effective targetting<p>2. An opportunity to do better optimization on our end, which currently Facebook offers to everyone including our competitors.<p>From a cynical point of view, the average HN-user at a VC-run startup could benefit from this.<p>The hurt given to regular small businesses is irrelevant because <i>we</i> aren&#x27;t Mom &amp; Pop firms. It isn&#x27;t in the nature of business people to care about all businesses anywhere. Rather you care about your business, and aim to bury your competition.<p>Additionally the people who run ad-supported sites outside of Facebook will welcome this change, since it reduces the effectiveness of Facebook&#x27;s competition.')
