They&#x27;ve happily accepted ad spend from Trump, as-if the past four years were any different. Google is the problem, not the solution. They&#x27;re an advertising and surveillance company - the last company to be trusted on &quot;vetting&quot; anything. They&#x27;re entire business model is to get people to click on ads and open their wallet based on &quot;marketing&quot; - which itself is a form of manipulation.  For me, Google is at a negative trust level.')
