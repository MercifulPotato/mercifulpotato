Tesla&#x27;s stock price is around 450 times its cash flow, which is an order of magnitude beyond insane for a public company. Apple is around 30. The average S&amp;P500 company is around 15. For Tesla&#x27;s stock to be worth the same relative to the company&#x27;s business as Apple the stock should be 15X less than it is now. To justify this price they would have to sell 15X more vehicles. Apple&#x27;s gross margins are like 30%, cars are probably just a few % due to the complexity of making something as big as a car. Unless Tesla becomes the only seller of cars in the world, there is no way it will ever be worth the current price.')
