You are enforcing a functional style by discipline. Additionally a huge portion of benefits of the functional style are lost on untyped languages. If you&#x27;re not using typescript you&#x27;re dealing with a lot of unnecessary bugs.<p>If you guys moved to a fully functional paradigm where the language enforces the functional style you will see greater benefits.<p>Unfortunately for the front end the ecosystem for functional languages outside of TS&#x2F;JS is not that great. But an easy one to try out to actually see the benefits I recommend writing a little app with ELM. With something like ELM, the functional style is enforced by the compiler. You will see that 90% of the bugs you typically deal with in JS&#x2F;TS will disappear. One type of bug that will disappear is runtime errors. Runtime errors are not possible in ELM.<p>I find a lot of JS programmers haven&#x27;t fully grokked the functional style. Example: You&#x27;ll find JS programmers who talk about how much they like functional programming but don&#x27;t understand why for loops don&#x27;t exist in functional programming.')
