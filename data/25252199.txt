I think they are, but it doesn&#x27;t matter as much we tend to think, and it has less impact than what would be expected.<p>For instance I agree with you that outward hostility is extremely rare, or any racism explicitly verbalised. It also have basically no effect to foreigners above a certain living standard. To put it bluntly, if you&#x27;re rich or at least middle class, you would be hard pressed to find signs of discrimination.<p>It&#x27;s on the lower part that it becomes more apparent. To follow on your point:<p>&gt;  For instance, renting apartments can be an issue for foreign residents with poor Japanese language skills<p>It&#x27;s not the language skills most of the time, although if you&#x27;re crazy good at negotiation you might be able to dig your way through it. In my experience it&#x27;s more that if you want to a flat at the same basic conditions than an average Japanese worker you will only have access to 5 or 10% of the offers. Those flagged &quot;foreigners OK&quot; for whatever reason.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, if you&#x27;re a dude with no guarantor you won&#x27;t have the same conditions as student girl backed by her gov. worker parents, as well.<p>In contrast, if you&#x27;re ready to shell 200k a month on location and work at a prestigious place, you will be mostly welcome whatever your gender or race.<p>And of course a lot of things work the same. If you&#x27;re looking for a job, trying to work at low wage job might be harder as a foreigner than applying to an IT department or financial institutions. The lower you go the more people will care if you&#x27;re a foreigner or not.')
