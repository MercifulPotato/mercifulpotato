The Smithsonian puts this in context of previous discoveries, that the BBC has no mention of. The BBC claims that the &quot;platform would have provided a vantage point for visitors&quot;.  In fact, the Mirador Natural <i>has</i> provided such a vantage point for some years, and there are plenty of tourist photographs of it on the WWW.  The path mentioned was part of renovations.  The access road now comes in from the south, as you can see in the video.<p>The Mirador Natural is some distance to the south of the Torre Mirador that is marked on on-line maps, which is actually the <i>old</i> observation tower, a new one (which you won&#x27;t find on on-line maps) having been opened across the road from it in February 2020.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andina.pe&#x2F;agencia&#x2F;noticia-lineas-nasca-nueva-torre-mirador-contribuira-a-incrementar-turismo-la-region-ica-783940.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;andina.pe&#x2F;agencia&#x2F;noticia-lineas-nasca-nueva-torre-m...</a>')
