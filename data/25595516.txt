A pixel-based physics simulator, like Powder Toy from long ago, with spellcasting and a ton of secrets.  One run, I can focus on incrementally improving a wand that shoots a simple bolt like a machine gun.  The next run, I&#x27;m tunneling through the ground and popping up like the monsters from Tremors.<p>Dying repeatedly means I&#x27;m forced to cobble together different strategies.  I had a run where I save-scummed, mostly to see parts of the game I couldn&#x27;t reach at my skill level.  But relying on the same build for boring, and I haven&#x27;t save-scummed since.')
