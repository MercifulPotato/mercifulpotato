Like how stoicism can get you more help.  So what you do is you say you&#x27;re feeling great.  Spend time with others talking about nonsense.  Then you ask for help only when it really counts.<p>This seems selfless but it quite shrewd really, most people actively enjoy helping somebody occasionally but loathe becoming an actual martyr for somebody.  When you&#x27;re vulnerable you can&#x27;t really let your health depend on somebodies honor and grace under pressure.<p>The help you receive is a limited resource.  If you piss people off or stress them out until they&#x27;re sick themselves you&#x27;re gonna be vulnerable when that tank is on empty.  You can&#x27;t evaluate if it&#x27;s worth to take a day off sick or ask for help without considering the impact it will likely have on others. You have to ration and time things correctly using stoicism.  It may seem a bit lonely and fake but it&#x27;s what&#x27;s best for everybody.')
