So the complexity grows over time and makes it less likely that anybody even reads the rules, much less implements them.<p>This also differs by industry or even by which rule book it is. If you have reasonable policies for handling hazardous materials, people follow them because if they don&#x27;t then <i>they</i> get hurt. But even in the same company, the company policy on other things only gets followed if it gets enforced, and only gets enforced if not doing so caused trouble in practice.')
