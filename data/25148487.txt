If you find that such impact is minimal locally, then from a political consideration, it is a waste of your time to spend energy on &quot;Russian threat&quot; or any other geopolitical narrative (many dating to 19th century.) You should focus on your local issues.<p>Geopolitical policy is opaque to uninitiated and uninformed.  It is not clear to me why the elite make a show of discussing geopolitics for the public at large. Join CFR in a meaningful capacity and you may get a whif of what actually are the dynamics and issues that drive international relations.')
