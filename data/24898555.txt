Why are you attributing those to the effects of lockdowns, rather than the effects of the pandemic? You don&#x27;t think that the risk to personal health of a potentially lethal virus, seeing older friends and relatives dying, and worrying about the risk of health systems collapsing are causing any of the above?<p>In March, someone I know in Italy passed on the virus to his grandfather, who died at home. All the ambulances in the area were tied up for hours. You can imagine the effect on his mental health. I doubt the impact was comparable to the effects of intermittent lockdowns.')
