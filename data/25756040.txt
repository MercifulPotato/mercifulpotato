Like the &quot;small web&quot; movements popping here and there now, but this one is in fact actually spearheading a completely new platform! And I think the way it&#x27;s integrated in the browser is brilliant, and unexpectedly to me suddenly puts the Hyper protocol&#x27;s ecosystem possibly ahead of IPFS in user-friendliness and fun-factor at this moment. It&#x27;s the kind of a good race&#x2F;competition between decentralized technologies and their communities happening now, that is so inspiring and awesome to watch and be a spectator to, or maybe even part of! Huge thanks to the authors of the Beaker Browser for putting so much love and care into creating it! &lt;3')
