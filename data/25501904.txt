If you want to be able to express the business logic as functions then you need to use monads to encapsulate the complex parts of the implementation (or you&#x27;ll end up with an ad-hoc, informally specified, bug ridden implementation of half of them), and once you&#x27;re comfortable with them you&#x27;ll probably find them useful for giving you explicit-but-not-too-verbose control over IO as well.')
