The demonstrated method and tool to &#x27;program&#x27; the robot arm was terrible, and the resulting  arm motion was excessive.<p>My takeaway was Tesla needed experienced staff to optimize the arm path.<p>&gt;[1980s GM quote] As Hamtramck&#x27;s assembly line tried to gain speed, the computer-guided dolly wandered off course. The spray-painting robots began spraying each other instead of the cars.... When a massive computer-controlled &#x27;robogate&#x27; welding machine smashed a car body, or a welding machine stopped dead, the entire Hamtramck line would stop. Workers could do nothing but stand around and wait while managers called in the robot contractor&#x27;s technicians.<p>This seems like a solvable problem.')
