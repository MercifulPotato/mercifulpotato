They act as a persistent, physical reminder to socially distance.<p>The presence of Covid is an infringement on my freedom of movement. I&#x27;m happy to try something that might work, if it may help me get that freedom back, particularly if there are no major downsides. Compared to the massive restrictions on personal freedom in a pandemic, an ever so slight difficulty in breathing with a mask is nothing.<p>&gt; But donâ€™t forget there just is not a whole lot of convincing evidence masks and especially the kind used by the general population actually have any effect on the spread of COVID-19.<p>This is still a very new disease. Conclusive studies conducted with statistical rigor will take a long time. Right now, we have a plausible explanation for why cloth masks or N95s without outlets work (they block large droplets from being emitted), and lots of anecdotal evidence in favor. Masks look like a decent bet to make, compared to the alternatives. If we find out later they don&#x27;t work, we haven&#x27;t lost much by trying them.')
