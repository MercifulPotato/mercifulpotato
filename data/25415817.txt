The word retains an aura of taboo and evil and one of the worst things a person can be. Then you redefine it to use it against a broader set of people but continue to harvest the power of the previous connotation. A variant of the euphemism treadmill. Instead of dropping a tarnished word and transitioning to a clean fresh one to describe the same thing, you keep using the tarnished word but for a different thing.<p>Closely related is the &quot;motte and bailey&quot; tactic: depending on the situation you sometimes use the word in an milder sense (new meaning of racist, &quot;we are all a little bit racist&quot;, it&#x27;s just unconscious biases or beliefs about any difference between races), but when people aren&#x27;t looking you switch definitions (old definition, worst possible thing, &quot;some races must be subjugated and kept away from our social circles as they are subhuman and incapable of participation by their nature and will poison our bloodline&quot;).<p>Indeed many critics of the new social justice movements would have this as the main argument: that SJ uses equivocation in this way as the rule, not the exception.')
