They&#x27;d just be irritated by it.<p>Nonetheless that&#x27;s not political speech (unlike the YouTube vids) . It&#x27;s basic libel.<p>Goebbels was in favor of free political speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you’re really in favor of freedom of political speech, then you’re in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise - whether that&#x27;s Trump or whomever. Otherwise, you’re not in favor of free speech.')
