Here is one completely made-up example that I created just now for this reply:<p>&quot;Apple can&#x27;t lock this down further without breaking open() calls in the majority of existing applications; therefore, they made a pragmatic choice to allow this issue to exist until their long-term roadmap plan to remove direct disk access to protected folders ships in a future macOS update; while declining to share their decision with the reporter, as is completely normal for Apple.&quot;<p>If you define &quot;security theater&quot; as &quot;any practice that would not stand up to a human attacker&quot;, then all security is guaranteed by definition to be security theater, since all security protections will be found to have weaknesses, compromises, and design decisions that could be theoretically exploited. That definition is clearly non-viable in reality, and so all security decisions — even Apple&#x27;s — will have unpalatable outcomes that do not invalidate the relevance of security.')
