They&#x27;ve shown CTE in people that never played past high school football, and they didn&#x27;t get a dime for playing the sport.  We don&#x27;t let kids in that age group buy cigarettes or alcohol, why do we let them play a sport that has a pretty high possibility of causing long term health effects?')
