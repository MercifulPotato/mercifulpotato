Where I work (and for some reason I expect this is the case in plenty of other places), APIs don&#x27;t grow into being shit because the programmer doesn&#x27;t know that &quot;returning comments on the response of GET user&#x2F;1&quot; is bad, but because their manager asks them to implement that feature as fast as possible. Given that requirement, of course the guys will just throw the comments in that already existing endpoint instead of building &quot;GET comments?user=John&quot;, right?<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of the saying &quot;complexity has to live somewhere&quot; and I think that&#x27;s exactly what GraphQL is doing: moving the complexity to another layer.')
