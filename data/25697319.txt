Yet look at what some of those voices are calling for now. Crying about &quot;de-platforming&quot;--no it&#x27;s a private company making a choice. As expected, most people have no actual principles and really only claim to believe in something for as long as it&#x27;s serving their own interest. If you suggested we have some mandates around communications companies and government access to them right now a bunch of &quot;republicans&quot; would be on board even though it stinks of state controlled media.<p>Also, it&#x27;s quite interesting how much of the seriousness of these blows for this administration stem from their painting the &quot;mainstream media&quot; as an enemy. The POTUS has a significant communications apparatus available to it <i>outside</i> of social&#x2F;new media&#x2F;, but this administration has alienated those other sources so significantly they cannot even use them effectively.')
