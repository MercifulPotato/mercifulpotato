What he describes isn&#x27;t anything special - the &quot;Evas_Object&quot; (aside of the weird name) sounds like a HWND in Windows or Window in X. The part about layouts sounds like similar to sizers in wxWidgets which are used so that you can avoid using heavyweight native widgets just for layout that some other toolkits do. The event callback sounds like it uses a generic messaging system - again not much different than something like WndProc in Windows.<p>EFL is written in C so it does have to work within the limitations of C but -non-toy- GUIs are inherently object oriented so things will be a bit more complicated than Qt that can lean on C++&#x27;s support for object oriented programming. Especially since apparently EFL also supports bindings to other languages which may also make things a bit more complicated.')
