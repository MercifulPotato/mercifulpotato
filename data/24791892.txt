Since presumably something has pushed me to click this button, I&#x27;m going to have to type something into the box that will take more than five seconds to type, and then wait for (hopefully?) a real person to respond, or else play with the chatbot to find the right keywords to redirect me to a real person.<p>With that, I don&#x27;t think waiting three to five seconds would hugely impact my experience in the scheme of the conversation that&#x27;s going to follow it. However - since this is a 3rd party add on to my site, I would certainly appreciate it having a smaller footprint. Can&#x27;t argue with that.')
