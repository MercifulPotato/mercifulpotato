People have been saying &quot;x year is the worst&quot; increasingly for the last 4 years, and 2020 is the only recent one that actually fits.  Tomorrow isn&#x27;t going to shift anything, it&#x27;s just how we keep track of time.  Expecting a year to contain itself is what leads to this yearly disappointment everyone seems to experience.  What I find frustrating, is that all people can say about most deaths now a day is &quot;this year is the worst&quot;.  No sentiments, nothing about the person who&#x27;s passed.  Just self absorbed focus on how this year sucks (they all suck apparently if I were to listen to people yearly).  I wish we&#x27;d celebrate the person by default instead.<p>MF DOOM was one of the greats.  One of the only reasons I could get into hip hop.  Really heartbreaking.')
