Eventually people will figure out the reviewers writing &quot;it works too good!&quot; or &quot;it has no problems!&quot; as negatives are fake. Even if the bots manage to get around the automatic detection (i.e. IP + activity tracking) they&#x27;ll still be submitting negatives which will hopefully balance out their positives and incline the user to examine each argument instead of being subconsciously manipulated by the 10&#x2F;10s and 5 stars.')
