Compile times explode and every time you get a tiny type error (which is impossible avoid, because the library is very persnickety about types) you get a bazillion pages of template errors.<p>Concepts and modules (supposedly) fix these issues, and I&#x27;m not going to use ranges again until those two are very mature features of C++. Even if you ignore this stuff, it&#x27;s incredibly &quot;C++ified&quot; in just the worst way, with incredibly obtuse templates and type concepts all over the place.')
