I have 15 years of emails, including deeply personal stuff. I&#x27;ve deleted all the unread mailing lists. I&#x27;ve deleted the big files. I&#x27;ve gone through numerous social and advertising emails and mass-deleted. Yet I&#x27;m stuck on like 14.98 Gb and every time I hit the threshold, Gmail starts bugging me to do more. How can I even tell if I have that much email? They could just be saying &quot;oh, you have 14.98Gb&quot;.')
