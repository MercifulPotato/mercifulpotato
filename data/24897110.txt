What I see on page 14 is a map of the same data I shared. It shows that there&#x27;s a small number of net producer states, and a larger number of net takers. If you look at page 17, you&#x27;ll see that most states actually fall into the low tax and low spending quadrant. So while they may need to raise taxes by some amount, they&#x27;re hardly being hypocritical the way it seems you want to paint them.')
