Our team actually decided to implement gRPC + gRPC-gateway in a green-field project at work, as part of an initiative to &quot;PoC&quot; that it could be done and bring us lots of benefits. We got auto-gen&#x27;d docs, clients, all the works that gRPC + protobuf in Golang promises.<p>Between a few breaking upstream changes in grpc-gateway (iirc), learning a new framework vs the stdlib + chi router setup that had already been proven in the greater team, feature shipment dropped through the floor. Couple that with the fact that, as stated, these benefits come with well-iterated data models; conversely, our _not_ well-established data models proved to be a constant PITA when having to regenerate this file and that file. No one used the auto-gen&#x27;d docs because they were constantly changing anyway. And integrating with our CI&#x2F;CD pipeline was a nightmare.<p>Between providing value with a team&#x27;s previously proven tools and spending innovation tokens, I&#x27;d definitely suggest weighing carefully if you need this to be one of them (bi-directional streaming and a well-established project seem like good candidates though).')
