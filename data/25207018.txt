These were fresh ETH, recently withdrawn from Coinbase. Immediately after freezing 23 days ago, Coinswitch demanded KYC, which I immediately submitted. Then, the stalling began. Eventually, 13 days ago, they claimed that the first KYC video was blurry, so I immediately resubmitted the video. Ever since then, Coinswitch has continued to delay, saying that there&#x27;s no ETA at all, refusing to return the ETH to the original address that I sent them from.<p>This is despite their TOS suggesting that they should&#x27;ve refunded my ETH within 72 hours (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinswitch.co&#x2F;terms)<p>What happens to the funds they seize and refuse to process KYC on? -- They pocket them, of course.\nNo wonder their founder Ashish Singhal has said in recent interviews that they have no need to ever raise investment money again.\nVery nice scam.<p>MANY similar accounts, seemingly at an increasing rate lately, along with many of their positive reviews appearing to be faked, as they review only coinswitch and nothing else:<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Bitcoin&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ei0h8m&#x2F;coinswitch_exodus_scammed_6500_euro_coinswitch&#x2F;<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;icorating.com&#x2F;coinswitch&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;failed-order-no-refund-166718&#x2F;<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustpilot.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;5fbd774c44c93b001a51925e<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustpilot.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;5f67ddc5b7e94014a9bfeb7a<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustpilot.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;5fa411015e693f06f87abd9a<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustpilot.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;5f44b70302e85708c8d81cf1<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustpilot.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;5f2fab9e1a5a69026845fb9f<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trustpilot.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;5f05f02a3f06f20a94dc262b<p>+ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;icorating.com&#x2F;coinswitch&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;this-website-is-stealing-peoples-141616&#x2F;<p>Sequoia - Is this the type of company that you back?<p>HN - Is this the newest crypto startup scam?')
