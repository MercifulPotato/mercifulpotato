Decentralized systems trade off a little bit of hypothetical efficiency (again, it depends on the central planner being competent) in return for guaranteed antifragility.<p>If what you&#x27;re saying is accurate, then we really ought to have a global government (say, the UN) coordinate distribution across the entire planet. Countries like Israel, Taiwan, New Zealand, and Singapore shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to set up their own distribution systems, rather they should all play into the same globally centralized distribution system. It&#x27;s a global pandemic after all, right?')
