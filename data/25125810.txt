Will there be a Servo browser that integrates the servo rendering engine with some open source components (for instance from Firefox, WebKit or Chromium) that will let us use the engine stand-alone, or is it &quot;just&quot; going to be an engine for embedding in third-party programs?<p>The former seems like it would be a huge amount of work, but if it&#x27;s the latter I fear for the long term survival of the project because it&#x27;s going to be hard to build a community around such a project IMO.<p>Or is there a possibility that Firefox will try to integrate Servo even if it&#x27;s developed outside of Mozilla? Seems unlikely to me.')
