The name &quot;tailwind&quot; is really apt once you get the feel for it.<p>The authors did decide to &#x27;fix&#x27; some css naming, such as Tailwind&#x27;s `hidden` class is `display: none` rather than `visibility: hidden`, which seems wrong at first. But when you see that `visibility: hidden` is `invisible` in Tailwind, it does makes sense. I still can&#x27;t help but think just following the existing naming might have been better, about my only teeny tiny gripe so far.')
