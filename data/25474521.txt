As hard as naming may be, adding the level of abstraction often ends up helping keep each method working at a single level of abstraction.<p>In my experience, the biggest messes I’ve inherited were a result of not being DRY enough: the cases of incidental duplication I’ve run across have been comparatively easy to unwind.')
