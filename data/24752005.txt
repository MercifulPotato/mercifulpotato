It&#x27;s not necessarily about using less resources in the neighborhoods, but about using them correctly.<p>How about this: if you don&#x27;t want to <i>dismantle</i> something, then don&#x27;t use the word <i>dismantle</i>. Perfectly good words already exist for what you suggest, such as <i>reform</i>.<p>If you say <i>dismantle</i> you should expect people to interpret it as its plain ordinary meaning: to take apart, to destroy, to get rid of, to make it not exist anymore.')
