I much prefer dwm[0], which will do window arrangements for you. The tagging features are also much more robust than virtual desktops (&quot;mail folders&quot; vs &quot;gmail tags&quot; is a perfect analogy - you can assign multiple tags to a window, and display any arbitrary combination of tags on the screen at a time).<p>That said, in spite of my alignments with dwm&#x27;s ui principles, for the last five years I&#x27;ve almost exclusively used i3. Unlike dwm, I don&#x27;t have to modify C code in order to configure my window manager, and I don&#x27;t have to pull in patches that haven&#x27;t been upstreamed[1] in order to include basic features.<p>I think there&#x27;s room for a window manager with the ease of configurability found in i3, but the dynamic tiling (i3 is _static tiling_, which means the wm will not assist you in positioning windows) and tagging features of dwm. I would move to it in a heartbeat.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dwm.suckless.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dwm.suckless.org&#x2F;</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dwm.suckless.org&#x2F;patches&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dwm.suckless.org&#x2F;patches&#x2F;</a>')
