Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=[25493574], score=None, time=1608505891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25489822, text='&gt; I think the moralistic argument makes much more sense.<p>I find it absurdly laughable that you think that there is <i>any</i> moralistic response from Silicon Valley VCs who have funded outright theft and lawbreaking--and who also funded YouTube when it was primarily a porn distribution system.<p>People <i>have</i> made lots of money from porn over the years.  The porn tech conference used to occur at the same time as CES--and often it was <i>more technical</i> than CES--things like Laserdics, DVDs, the web, online credit card tech, etc. all were at the porn conference long before the mainstream ones.  One could make an uncharitable comment about it being more profitable to sell shovels in the gold rush than to be a miner&#x2F;performer ...<p>The big issue with porn sites is that they only scale so far, and then it&#x27;s a race to the bottom, and when you hit the bottom the law starts knocking on your door.  So, you have to switch off porn before the race to the bottom starts if you want to scale further.  And if you make make that change at the wrong time or in the wrong way, your site dies.<p>OnlyFans is in the race to the bottom now.  There is <i>always</i> another girl who looks just as good who will do whatever thing you want for 10% less than that other girl.  Do you really think that people really care whether they&#x27;re watching Porn Star A or Porn Star B--or whether they care that Porn Star B is $10 less per &lt;whatever&gt;?<p>Sure, there will be some exceptions where a bunch of people want to see some famous Disney tart&#x27;s naughty bits.  The rest of the performers, however, are in the swamp.<p>OnlyFans broke the monopoly.  Great!  But then it will become the monopoly.  The wheel simply turns.')
