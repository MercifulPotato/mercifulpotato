It’s not as easy to get started with as unity is, but if you are good at figuring stuff out then it’s just a powerhouse. The renderer is incredible, the workflows are modular, you can work in a data driven way, you can modify skeletal animations in-engine, performance is amazing, etc etc etc. It’s also stable,  and non-production ready features are clearly identified as beta or experimental.<p>I wish this was next week so I could post a link to my alpha build at the bottom of this post')
