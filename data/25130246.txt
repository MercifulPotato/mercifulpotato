Item(by='aidenn0', descendants=None, kids=[25130585], score=None, time=1605649102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25129208, text='One thing that gets lost in these articles is they deal in absolute numbers of complaints, not complaints relative to other officers (probably because those numbers are also not public).<p>I would suspect the base-rate of complaints against police-officers varies greatly from place-to-place and is non-zero pretty much everywhere.  If we assume the dozens of complaints against Ferrigno is indicative of a &quot;bad&quot; officer, how does it compare to the base rate?  Is there enough signal in the noise for that to be useful for oversight?')
