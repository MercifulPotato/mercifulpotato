Things like jeans really only need to be washed a couple of times a year unless you&#x27;re spilling stuff on them or being very active and sweaty in them. Growing up, the conventional wisdom was that you always had to wash something after it was worn once, and you were being a slob if you didn&#x27;t (for some reasons hoodies were exempt), but it turns out that isn&#x27;t true.')
