Seeing what other people are saying about a topic. Maybe asking a question, maybe getting a response etc.<p>&gt; Hacker News has done a good job of formalizing certain things and that keeps the signal-to-noise ratio high here even though the sense of community it once had when it was smaller is no longer something it seems to have.<p>Yeah, I think that this is essential to a successful forum but also brings up exactly what the issue is, I think. If you&#x27;re optimizing for signal to noise, you&#x27;re already beyond the scope of &quot;community&quot;, in that you&#x27;ve already got too many people and too much content to ingest. Optimizing signal to noise on a forum is great with the microblog&#x2F;RSS lens I apply, because it means I&#x27;m not seeing offtopic or irrelevant content in my feeds.<p>I also kinda think that a part of community (when thinking about community being defined as a group of people that are connected and feel involved in eachother&#x27;s lives to varying extents) _is_ offtopic conversation. &quot;How are you doing?&quot; &quot;How&#x27;s your grandpa&quot;, etc. You can&#x27;t allow this type of post&#x2F;behavior on HN, because if you open those floodgates you&#x27;re getting way too much noise to handle, but I also think that&#x27;s why the shift has gone the way it&#x27;s gone. You can&#x27;t learn about eachother beyond subject matter that&#x27;s attached to the topic of an individual post.')
