Item(by='Toutouxc', descendants=None, kids=[25818710], score=None, time=1610918410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810948, text='The thing that makes me uncomfortable when reading all the details is the fact that Boeing is using trim to move an aerodynamic surface that is not intended to be used for direct and immediate control of the aircraft, to induce an aerodynamic force on the actual control surface (the elevator) which then manifests itself as a force on the control column.<p>It&#x27;s basically all backwards. It&#x27;s like implementing lane assist in cars by rotating the whole transaxle so the driver gets phantom forces in the wheel that keep the car centered, instead of sending some signals to the power steering unit that&#x27;s already there and already messes with the control forces. (Or going all fuck-it like Airbus and doing drive-by-wire with an Xbox-sourced steering wheel.)')
