Item(by='pbhjpbhj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603810862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24905920, text='Well I learned something that&#x27;s not in the article.<p>I thought browsers requested a domain lookup (gethostbyname()) and basically got back a &quot;zone file&quot; which would have the cnames in. So, I was confused, when people complained about Twitter forcing a domain lookup &quot;on the wrong domain&quot; as I was assuming this would at least cache the domain lookup: It&#x27;s the right domain, of course, but the lookup for an address on a subdomain includes the subdomain and then gets the cname directing wherever.<p>It always confused me that dig&#x2F;nslookup didn&#x27;t seem to provide all the info. They can, using nslookup &#x27;ls example.com&#x27; or &#x27;dig example.com -t AXFR&#x27; but the server in general refuses to serve the zone file (seemingly for security by obscurity reasons).<p>So, for example, if the browser looks up example.com it doesn&#x27;t get that there is a cname from www-&gt;example.com . It only gets that relationship from looking up &quot;www.example.com&quot;.<p>So, TIL, and now results provided by dig&#x2F;nslookup on the command line make more sense!')
