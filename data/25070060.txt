I&#x27;d love to see something around the performance and power efficiency of the M1 without it all needing to be built into a single chip. The M1 definitely gets a lot of benefits from being all packaged together, but it unfortunately leads to fewer options since you can&#x27;t mix-and-match CPU, GPU, and RAM.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful that M1 will drive both AMD and Intel to do better in the mobile space.
