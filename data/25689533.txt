Item(by='giantrobot', descendants=None, kids=[25690185, 25689911], score=None, time=1610135887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25689017, text='The lady that was shot was attempting to enter a hallway through a window while people in the hallway were pointing guns at her. Just because she didn&#x27;t have a visible weapon doesn&#x27;t mean she wasn&#x27;t a threat. Climbing through a broken window into a hallway protected by a makeshift barricade is itself a threatening action. No one at the head of a mob climbing over a barricade ever did so for innocent and non-threatening reasons. Suggesting otherwise is ludicrously stupid.<p>Having seen multiple videos of the event it&#x27;s clear the shooter was <i>not</i> firing wildly into the crowd. They were aiming specifically at the person trying to break into the area. She&#x27;s dead because of her own actions.')
