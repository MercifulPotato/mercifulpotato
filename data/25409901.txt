That&#x27;s neither here nor there. My point is it is not a good developer experience for anything <i>but</i> client apps on their operating systems - things like iOS apps and consumer programs, not web design, backend engineering, high performance computing or the slew of other kinds of software that Macs are getting worse at.<p>This goes deeper than developer tools. The documentation for their core frameworks have been purged from official sources and is relegated to deprecated sites and comments header files tucked away in &#x2F;Library. Kernel modules are being deprecated. There&#x27;s no alternative to IPP or MKL on ARM for the M1 chip. Docs for plugins architectures are being more and more hidden away, and Apple&#x27;s Developer Conference consistently only focuses on consumer facing applications - while support for professional applications and advanced computing is only available if you work for a partner organization, making it less accessible.<p>The reason I say that Apple is making their platform harder to use for general purpose computing is from my experience shipping code on MacOS for the last decade. It&#x27;s fine if you disagree, but that hasn&#x27;t been my experience. Every year it costs me more time and money to target Macs than the year before.')
