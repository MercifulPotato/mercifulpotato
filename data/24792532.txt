Sometimes tradeoffs have to be made. Personally, I would tend to say that a single concentrated pollution event is less important than global runaway climate-change.<p>Another interesting example of environmental trade-offs is the plastic bag ban (where the disposable, ultra-light-weight plastic bags at supermarkets are banned in favor of heavier, reusable plastic and paper bags).<p>The lighter bags:<p>- break more easily, making them harder to re-use<p>- tend to blow around and get stuck in trees, rivers, etc, causing visible pollution<p>However, the heavier bags:<p>- emit a lot more carbon through their transportation (because of the extra weight)<p>- put more total plastic into the world at the end of the day unless everyone reuses all of them (which many people don&#x27;t)<p>Just like there&#x27;s no single definition of &quot;healthy food&quot;, there&#x27;s no single definition of &quot;good for the environment&quot;.')
