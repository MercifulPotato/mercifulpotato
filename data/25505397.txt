With newer Canon DSLR bodies you can use the Canon Webcam Utility[1] to directly get the video feed show up as a webcam, with just a USB cable.<p>I&#x27;ve been using the EOS R as my webcam with the RF 35mm F1.8 lens and it&#x27;s working pretty great. I just hook it up with the USB-C cable and it shows up as a webcam.<p>The only annoyance that I haven&#x27;t been able to get around yet is switching batteries. There&#x27;s a Kickstarter project[2] for a battery that is hot-swappable, but among those features it also allows you to just use the power while plugged in, which I&#x27;m eager to try out.<p>I haven&#x27;t tested the audio quality of the camera, so I can&#x27;t say much about that. I&#x27;ve always just used my headset. I would expect it to be somewhere between meh and ok-ish. Of course you could invest in a proper mic plugged into the Camera[3].<p>I have it set up on a tripod behind my desk. One thing I have been considering is getting some kind of a monitor arm style setup for the Camera, but so far I haven&#x27;t found such a product.<p>The setup of course is quite expensive depending on the Camera, but I already had the camera and tripod since I do photography as a hobby, so I was pleasantly surprised when Canon came out with the webcam utility.<p>Is it worth it? Probably not if you just want something that works all the time. I mostly use the camera to take photos, so I have to re-mount it every time I come back from shooting, and keep the batteries charged, etc. but people do notice and it&#x27;s fun to see their reactions and getting accused of being a YouTuber every once in a while.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usa.canon.com&#x2F;internet&#x2F;portal&#x2F;us&#x2F;home&#x2F;support&#x2F;self-help-center&#x2F;eos-webcam-utility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usa.canon.com&#x2F;internet&#x2F;portal&#x2F;us&#x2F;home&#x2F;support&#x2F;se...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;x-tra&#x2F;the-camera-battery-re-invented" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;x-tra&#x2F;the-camera-batter...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makeuseof.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;best-shotgun-mic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.makeuseof.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;best-shotgun-mic&#x2F;</a>')
