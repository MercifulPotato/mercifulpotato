There were many others around that time who were fanning the flame, on both sides. But nobody was held accountable then, and certainly nobody was banned, so it&#x27;s concerning that POTUS is banned across social media for this, and the damages were much less this time. I&#x27;m not a fan of censorship like this, regardless of the side. It controls the narrative and stifles free speech through discord.')
