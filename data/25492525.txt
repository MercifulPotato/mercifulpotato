The interactivity and the implementation are actually as important or possibly more important than the book text.<p>This could lead to a dramatic shift in how technical books are created.<p>Imagine a new website that didn&#x27;t offer videos or text or tutorials, but actually was integrated with all of those things together?<p>So in your case, the book can be read or listened to, as you work on the example implementations. Using a little ML, you could probably even offer suggestions to roadblocks.<p>Just got sidetracked on this thought.<p>I&#x27;m a DDD guy, but have never personally implemented CQRS and event streams. I love the idea of separate read and write streams, but what is the best mesh of tech to do it well? (rhetorical question)<p>I&#x27;ll buy the eBook. Thanks for working on this.')
