Might have been an interpreter issue, but it was enough for me never to want to touch it again.<p>SystemVerilog is a good examle of an organically grown language with no &#x27;benevolent dictator&#x27;. A few pet peeves:<p>* Why is the simulation delta cycle split into 17 regions? Exactly when does the Pre-Re-NBA region happen and what assignments take place there?<p>* Why can&#x27;t a function return a dynamic&#x2F;associative array or a queue? This is clearly possible, since the array find functions return a queue, but it&#x27;s not possible to define a user function with this return type.<p>* It has way too much cruft. E.g. what problem does the forkjoin keyword solve? Who thought that was necessary and why? Not a fork-join block, the forkjoin keyword.<p>* Why can&#x27;t you have a modport inside a modport? This would be great for e.g. register interfaces, but modports are not composable.<p>* What is the difference between a const variable and a localparam and why does the language need both constructs?<p>* Is a covergroup a class or what? It behaves very much like it is, it has a constructor, some class local information and at least one class local function (the sample() \nfunction), but you can&#x27;t extend it.<p>* Why are begin-end used for scope delimitation everywhere except in constraints where curly brackets are used? I know it was a Cadence donation, but why wasn&#x27;t the syntax changed before it was merged? Backwards compatibility can only justify so much...<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;rant off<p>edit: formatting')
