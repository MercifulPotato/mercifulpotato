Every week a newer, faster processor is released. Hardware gets cheaper and we can just throw more chips at the problem.<p>That was until 2010, now we&#x27;ve hit the wall with pure single threaded speed and parallel programming is much harder to scale.<p>When you get a faster CPU your software doesn&#x27;t need to change, but when you want it to run on more cores or machines it becomes a nuanced discussion depending on the algorithm, memory access pattern and networking.<p>We&#x27;ve come full circle and now we need to focus on the software again, to further improve performance.')
