But I also think this reflects the differences between how science and engineering progress -- our ability to exploit a natural phenomenon (or class of phenomena) often outstrips our ability to explain what&#x27;s going on.  As examples, I&#x27;d argue that for much of aviation history (and perhaps now too, I don&#x27;t know), our ability to build flying machines far outstrips our understanding of how birds and insects (or even planes) fly.')
