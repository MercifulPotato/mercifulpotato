Are these specific to work like filling out time sheets or other TPS reports? Home tasks like laundry&#x2F;dishes&#x2F;trash? All of the above? As a non-ADHD person, I hate all of the above tasks and only do them because it&#x27;s part of adulting. Can&#x27;t get paid without time sheets (this is my biggest hate). I&#x27;d rather do laundry (folding&#x2F;ironing) than fill out time sheets. I have no rational explanation as it is a rather simple thing.')
