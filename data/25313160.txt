You&#x27;ll pay until you&#x27;re dead.<p>They don&#x27;t have programs like this for other loans because they don&#x27;t need them. If they look at your finances when you apply for a mortgage and think you&#x27;ll need an income-based program, they don&#x27;t loan you the money.<p>If something happens and you can&#x27;t pay, they can repossess your car or foreclose on your house to get some of their money back that way. For unsecured debt, even if they don&#x27;t have special programs, you can usually negotiate a settlement if you can&#x27;t pay the whole thing. They&#x27;d rather get something than nothing. And again, you can discharge it in bankruptcy, so that gives them some incentive to work with you. For rent, there are income-based rent assistance programs in every city I&#x27;m familiar with, not sure how it is where you are.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t need these programs for student debt if you could declare bankruptcy and have the loan discharged that way. It wouldn&#x27;t be something you would do lightly, but the threat of the possibility would incentivize the banks to make sure that paying the loan is less of a burden than declaring bankruptcy.')
