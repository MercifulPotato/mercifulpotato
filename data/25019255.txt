The excuse they keep repeating is that &quot;1 in 10 chance Trump can win. That&#x27;s about the same chance as rain in LA, but it does rain in LA!&quot;. 538 seems to have forgotten in their condenscencion is that we are not look at you to explain the odds. <i>We are looking at you to provide an accurate probability estimate</i>. Their defense is completely ridiculous. I follow betting odds which had Biden&#x2F;Trump at 60&#x2F;40 split before the election day - what&#x27;s the point of polling when you can look at people putting money on the line, let the incentives work for you.')
