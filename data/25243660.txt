(Which I would say most homesteaders and farmers have)<p>Joel Salatin is number one in my opinion<p>Justin Rhodes would be next, he has a good Youtube channel and produced a entertaining documentary called &quot;The Great American Farm Tour&quot; which will give You lots of ideas.<p>Another source of information on homesteading and building a successful, profitable lifestyle is Jack Spirko. He produces an hour or so long podcast 5 days a week but he is an aquired taste.<p>This episode will most likely give You some good ideas but like I said You need to take a grain or two of salt with him, eventually he grows on You and has a large loyal following of 250K+ daily listeners.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thesurvivalpodcast.com&#x2F;content-based-business-freedom" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thesurvivalpodcast.com&#x2F;content-based-business-fre...</a>')
