Ironically, many of the people objecting to Hawking&#x27;s dismissal of philosophy offered, as counterpoint, the claim that Hawking&#x27;s own work had philosophical components!<p>And there are a few philosophers, such as Tim Maudlin, who know the science well enough to persue its philosophical questions. Despite these exceptions, I think it is not unreasonable to ask if 21st. century academic philosophy has chosen to turn away from the philosophical issues of 21st. century fundamental science.<p>No-one is stopping philosophers from contributing to science.')
