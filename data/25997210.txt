I&#x27;m seriously handicapped and there are a lot of things I simply cannot do.<p>That&#x27;s a lousy argument. I use myself as an example for various reasons, but the reality is this a widespread problem and the state of journalism is a real problem, as I noted above.<p>I&#x27;m well aware of why people don&#x27;t like hearing they basically want slave labor. I&#x27;ve listened for years to the reasons people on HN do not like ads, do not like content marketing, etc. I removed ads from my sites and I don&#x27;t typically use affiliate links.<p>I use myself as an example in hopes of elucidating the problem space and making it clear that I&#x27;ve studied this for years and I&#x27;m not blowing smoke. It&#x27;s not just me. Writing generally has terrible pay even when it&#x27;s good quality, etc.<p>Find some way to help writers pay their bills. The fact that writers exist and that&#x27;s what they know and there aren&#x27;t other middle class jobs with good benefits they can readily apply for is an actual issue which negatively impacts the world.<p>Gig work is up. Benefits are down. Lots of people are underpaid, underemployed, etc. It isn&#x27;t just writers.<p>As for medicine, our medical system is probably even more messed up than what we do to writers. We actively incentivize a system of keeping you drugged up and limping along and yadda.<p>But I&#x27;m sure people are even less interested in hearing that than in hearing &quot;If you don&#x27;t want the shitty internet we&#x27;ve chosen to create, then make other choices that support some other outcome.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t intend to spend a whole lot of time arguing it. I&#x27;ve been here a lot of years. I know people don&#x27;t like hearing this, quickly turn to dismissive personal attacks and ugly justifications. This is hardly some original rebuttal to my points.<p>I chose to say it anyway because I know most folks here are business people or IT people and haven&#x27;t thought it through as much as I have. Each individual case of criticism of how people here don&#x27;t want to support writers seems logical and not a problem in isolation. Most folks here are not on the receiving end going &quot;Wait a minute. This is part of why I remain poor. There&#x27;s no good means to get paid for what I do, though there is certainly demand for good writing.&quot;<p>This is me telling folks I write, the world makes it really hard for writers to make ends meet, that&#x27;s part of why you get certain kinds of garbage on the internet.<p>People can do with that info what they choose, including nothing at all. I&#x27;ve occasionally said such things for years and it seems to make no difference.<p>But I will likely continue to say something from time to time anyway, even though people think it&#x27;s appropriate to attack me instead of taking my points seriously. And that&#x27;s why I say it boils down to an expectation of slave labor because, yeah, people basically get mad at being told &quot;this is why this goes on&quot; rather than going &quot;oh, I had not thought to connect those dots. I shall have to keep that in mind going forward.&quot;')
