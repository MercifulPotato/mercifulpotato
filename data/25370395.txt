I mean, I know WOW is running on a nearly 20 year old engine, but that engine has seen a hell of a lot of refinement over the years, and many advanced features have been added.<p>The M1 is a testament to Apple&#x27;s engineering team. I really look forward to seeing what they could do if went buck wild and gave themselves a 95 - 180 watt TPU range to compete with Ryzen 5000 &#x2F; Threadripper 3000 series parts.<p>We&#x27;ve seen that the M1 is competitive in low power scenarios... I want to know if it can be scaled up and be competitive when power is no concern.')
