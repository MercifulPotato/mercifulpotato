The survey itself involves looking at bare breasts, so is &quot;NSFW.&quot;<p>Breast cancer runs in my family. Two close relatives have had it more than once starting at early ages.<p>My impression is you are barking up the wrong tree. What is &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot; to random strangers according to some survey is of little importance.<p>If she is in a serious committed relationship, her partner&#x27;s opinions will be really important to her decision-making process.<p>If she is really young, this will tend to matter a lot more to her than if she is older.<p>Scarring is not just about aesthetics. It&#x27;s about pain and swelling and limited movement and things like that. That tends to get short shrift by people in the business of selling you surgery for the purpose of improving your appearance.<p>I started the survey but didn&#x27;t finish it. It&#x27;s boring and repetitive and I thought images were weird, starting with the detail that there are no arms. Like I&#x27;m supposed to care about a woman&#x27;s breasts and not be bothered by the fact that she has no arms?<p>As a woman who gets tired of some people acting like I am only a sex object and the only parts of me that matter are the parts covered by a bikini and as someone with a serious disability, I find details like that pretty insensitive and disturbing.')
