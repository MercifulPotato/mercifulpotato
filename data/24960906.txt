I once watched a short video by an accent coach teaching how to make an Irish accent, a Scottish accent, an Australian accent etc. He talked about place of articulation and made pretty decent (although clearly not native) approximations of the pronounciations. I found his attempts at actively voicing things out quite helpful. I&#x27;m fully aware this is just an approximation, but in a way I found that teacher to be more effective at conveying what makes a given accent peculiar, more than what just listening to a native speaker would. Probably it all depends on what you&#x27;re interested in.')
