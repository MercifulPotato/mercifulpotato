Many see it as an editor with advanced capabilities, and then they start comparing it to IDEs or editors like VS Code and the like, and finally they think Emacs falls short in comparing to these tools.<p>The thing is: Emacs is so much more than editing. Just to give an example: I keep a list of meds for my retired parents in on org-table, and every few weeks I need to request a prescription from their doctor and order the meds from their pharmacist. I have a few lines of Elisp to select the meds that my parents need, generate a message for the pharmacist, generate a Fax document for the doctor, and a bunch of tasks (* TODO Send fax to Doctor, * TODO Waiting for prescription from Doctor, * TODO Send prescription to pharmacist, * TODO Waiting for meds from pharmacist, etc) in my org-agenda task list. Triggered with one key combo. By being able to start python or shell scripts from within Lisp code, I am able to automate everything that I run on my Mac, and pass data from one workflow to another.')
