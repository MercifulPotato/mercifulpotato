If you kiss me, I&#x27;ll revert back to my human form and be forever grateful?&quot;, the programmer smiles and puts the frog back in his pocket.<p>Again, the frog says, &quot;But I really am! I would even marry you if you kiss me and turn me back into a human!&quot;, the programmer chuckles and puts the frog away again.<p>Ten minutes later, the frog says, &quot;Look, if you kiss me, I&#x27;ll have sex with you all day, every day. Deal?&quot;, the programmer laughs and puts the frog away again.<p>He gets home, takes the now severely depressed frog out of his pocket and sets it down in an aquarium. The frog looks up at the coder and says, &quot;What the fuck is wrong with you man? I offered to marry you, I offered to screw you, but STILL you won&#x27;t turn me back into my human form.&quot;<p>The programmer says, &quot;I&#x27;m a programmer. I don&#x27;t have time for relationships, or sex - but a talking frog? SO COOL!&quot;<p>=====================<p>credits to: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Jokes&#x2F;comments&#x2F;8ylptx&#x2F;a_computer_programmer_finds_a_frog_by_the_side_of&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Jokes&#x2F;comments&#x2F;8ylptx&#x2F;a_computer_pr...</a>')
