But if your codebase is pervasively, implicitly multithreaded, then it&#x27;s impossible to maintain without locking everywhere (and difficult even then), and combining async with (blocking) locking does not work well.<p>In a codebase where concurrency is carefully controlled and constrained, an async system that gives you visibility into where the yield points are is very valuable: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glyph.twistedmatrix.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;unyielding.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glyph.twistedmatrix.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;02&#x2F;unyielding.html</a> .')
