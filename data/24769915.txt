That segues right into the question of relative safety per unit distance traveled. A quick google search brought up this article from the washington post [0] which gives the following:<p>Motorcycle: 212.57 fatalities per billion passenger miles<p>Car: 7.28<p>Ferry: 3.17<p>Train: 0.43<p>Subway: 0.24<p>Bus: 0.11<p>Plane: 0.07<p>Granted this is skewed by cars being the only viable last-mile rural transportation method but we can examine that too. According to USDOT, urban motor vehicle crash deaths overtook rural crash deaths in 2016 in a reversal of the previous longstanding trend of deaths being 60% rural and 40% urban [1]. You _do_ still have the problem of people dying as a result of private industry, but the rate at which people die per mile is an order of magnitude lower if you take the bus versus a car. That&#x27;s almost 90 lives saved per day if we all rode the bus. I suspect this rate is tied to CDL and bus maintenance standards and would remain largely unchanged if buses became the transportation method of the majority.<p>&gt;I&#x27;d argue that this is both a tiny proportion of deaths and a tiny influence.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some data but given what I&#x27;ve seen of the local street racer scene and how they view certain movie franchises that glorify their subculture I think the influence is significant. Would society be better if we straight up banned everything that shows people doing bad stuff? Probably not, but media still has a tremendous impact on how people behave. It&#x27;s again a case where an industry offloads negative externalities onto society.<p>&gt;I think governments could reduce the number of deaths far more greatly by having more stringent licensing guidelines (including regular re-testing), safer roads, saner zoning policies, better public transit options, etc. than by silencing any speech that suggests a correlation between speed and fun.<p>Forcing manufacturers to deal with the externalities we&#x27;re discussing would also incentivize them to encourage safe driving, no? I used to be a vocal proponent of not yielding an inch of freedom as well but I&#x27;m less and less convinced about that as time goes on. Just because the harm isn&#x27;t as immediate as people getting trampled 30 seconds after one yells fire in the crowded theater doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s still not real harm that could&#x27;ve been avoided. There&#x27;s a significant amount of internal propaganda here in the US about how amazing freedom is but I&#x27;m really not sold on the idea that the average person&#x27;s life here is better as a result of it compared to a society that recognizes the complexity and interconnectedness of the world and responds to it with structure rather than &quot;individual freedom&quot; and a literal world-leading number of people sitting around making license plates in jail.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;wonk&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-safest-and-deadliest-ways-to-travel&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;wonk&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-s...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;fatality-statistics&#x2F;detail&#x2F;urban-rural-comparison" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iihs.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;fatality-statistics&#x2F;detail&#x2F;urban...</a>')
