Then again, this sort of debugging it already possible on less locked-down OS&#x27;s with valid paths to licensing them. I like the end result, but not the means by which this ruling gets there: I&#x27;d rather something like compulsory licensing under reasonable terms for certain purposes like this, something along the lines of the system used for compulsory licensing in music.')
