I can’t even come up with a good reason for the utility of a measure of alcohol without it being a ratio of how much can be processed in an hour.<p>That’s why the NHS metric is better suited for discussions about how much alcohol per unit of time one can&#x2F;should drink, or to discuss the effects of different rates of alcohol consumption over time.<p>From the NHS website:<p>&gt;One unit equals 10ml or 8g of pure alcohol, which is around the amount of alcohol the average adult can process in an hour.')
