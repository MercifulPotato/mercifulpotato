One might say that it increases security because it allows TSA to check the contents of people&#x27;s belongings more easily, or that it decreases security because it can allow anyone with brief physical access to a bag to steal its contents.<p>Edit: the sibling comment also points out a likely use about recognizing your own devices. If you let Google spy on you more, it can more accurately determine what is usual or unusual for you, in order to distinguish you from an impersonator. You might also not want Google or others to have this information.')
