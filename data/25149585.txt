Thank you!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;biology-everywhere-foundations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;biology-everywhere-foundation...</a><p>I recommend this as an entry level course series, I actually attended Dr. Peffer&#x27;s lectures on campus (as a non student) after nearly 10 years after completing my BSc in Cellular and Molecular biology. She holds a post Doc and research position on Campus and really likes Ed-tech and the &#x27;gamification&#x27; of Education as a whole; she is what I wished I had when I was doing my undergrad.<p>When you want to get really into, head over to Josiah Zayner&#x27;s, The Odin [0], where he takes Bio-hacker methods to Gene Editing and synthetic Biology. He sells kits and has weekly podcasts [1] of his experiments and observations for people to follow along. They did a COVID vaccine trial on themselves, and then moved on to making lab-grown meat, which was actually very cool way to get into the space and the community.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-odin.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-odin.com&#x2F;</a>?<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC-aCKd4djOAf_0BzyUMJ5FA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC-aCKd4djOAf_0BzyUMJ5FA</a>')
