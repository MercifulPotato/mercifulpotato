Technology doesn&#x27;t have a mind of its own. Yes, it can be more conductive to good (vaccines) or bad (fighter jets), or neutral (knives), but it doesn&#x27;t go out there doing things on its own, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or disenfranchise people through its own existence, it doesn&#x27;t pollute the Earth by virtue of being pictured on a blueprint.<p>No, it&#x27;s people <i>making these decisions</i> to commission and use particular technologies for ill. Sometimes they make them in full understanding of the bad consequences. Sometimes they only learn too late, but they still <i>make a decision</i> to not retract the use of a technology.<p>Technology is a red herring. The real issue is the usual problem of people being selfish, living in a system that doesn&#x27;t regulate the selfishness away, but instead amplifies it, consequences be damned.')
