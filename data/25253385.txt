It did the opposite, and you simply can’t operate a business (or government) where more than half of your revenue is gone and your expenses keep rising.<p>Just like you wouldn’t invest in a business laden with outsized debt obligations from projections that didn’t come true, you wouldn’t want to put your name on a title to take on the obligations of a city who had lost 50%+ of its people and revenue.<p>Supposedly, this was attempted to be fixed in 2014’s bankruptcy rulings, so we’ll have to see if that brought the expenses in line to make it a worthwhile investment.')
