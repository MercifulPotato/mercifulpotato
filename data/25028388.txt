Apple can and will simply revoke your app for fickle reasons. iOS is a pretty dumb term for cloud apps and the web, and that’s it.<p>That being said I do have an iPhone... because for my phone that’s all I want and it works well and has better privacy than most Android devices. I basically want web, email, texting, calls, and maps, and maybe occasional apps like Uber or whatever. I don’t use it as a “real computer.” I have a real computer for that.')
