Seinfeld, The Office, It&#x27;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, the list goes on.<p>TV execs really care about the product.  By contrast, I don&#x27;t think Netflix cares about the product.  I think Netflix cares about the data about the product, which ultimately means dropping an original after 2 seasons.<p>It works I guess, but I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had a Netflix subscription in a while, and on those occasions where I do renew it I just take a peek for a month before leaving again.  More than enough time to watch 2 seasons of TV.')
