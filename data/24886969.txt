Without fixed sized pages the OS has to search for appropriately sized areas to satisfy allocation requests. Fixed sized pages solves this problem.<p>Edit: you would also then suffer memory fragmentation, not just lookup latency.<p>For already mapped pages latency would be an issue as you described.')
