Currently trying to figure out how to improve my DB performance as Spring&#x27;s default pagination seems to be quite slow and my site is getting hugged to death at the moment. If anyone has any tips for that especially I&#x27;m all ears.<p>At any rate, your suggestion seems easy enough to put in, so I&#x27;ll put it in ASAP! Thanks again')
