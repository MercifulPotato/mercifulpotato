That depends on the traffic, but we are positing that detection of &quot;is this a real user&quot; is not possible, right?<p>Couldn&#x27;t the price just be based on the actual payoff the advertiser gets (aka increased product sales)? The publisher is incentivized to set the maximum price that the advertiser will pay, and the advertiser is incentivized to get the most bang for their buck, so at the very least they would never pay more than what the ad brings them in terms of revenue.<p>Over time, this should reach an equilibrium. Niche publications may have to charge low prices at the start as they build their reputation among advertisers, but I think that&#x27;s a worthwhile price to pay if it means better privacy and eliminating a problematic advertising model of CPM&#x2F;CPC (where fraud is possible and tracking is required to battle it).')
