The laws of the land largely assume the president is fundamentally a good actor with the nation&#x27;s best interests at heart, which I think was sometimes the case with Trump and sometimes not.<p>We should require a fuller disclosure of a candidate&#x27;s finances before we allow them to serve. Trump may be deeply in debt to foreign powers. He may not be. We do not know. <i>That is a problem, and it should not be a partisan issue. It is mind-blowing that anybody is okay with not knowing.</i> Let&#x27;s not let that happen again. That should be the easiest law&#x2F;amendment to pass, ever. (Of course it won&#x27;t be)<p>We obviously have legal machinery in place to remove a president if the need arises, but it is necessarily slow and ineffective.<p>His term also (further) exposed big flaws in the way we put people on the Supreme Court. We should go back to the old system of a 2&#x2F;3 majority required. No more 50&#x2F;50 simple majority, as the Democrats instituted a while back. I find that a disaster.<p>The old 2&#x2F;3 majority generally ensured that people who were competent centrists got onto the court. Both parties were equally happy with the candidates... or at least equally unhappy!')
