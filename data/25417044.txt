My wife&#x27;s Honda tall Civic (CR-V) has a &quot;service required&quot; light, which is different from the check engine light. This can be reset by the owner, following the process in the owner&#x27;s manual (presumably after doing the oil change and other service items).<p>My wife&#x27;s car can also get a genuine malfunction from a too low oil level, which does light the MIL. This cannot be durably reset by user action (other than remedying the underlying condition).')
