Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’<p>So this is not truth. But what I don’t know is if Gevers just read that online from a jokester, or if Trump’s people are actually claiming this.')
