People have been free-associating between symptom and disease on the internet since long before Covid, and the quality of the conversation hasn&#x27;t improved in 2020. So it&#x27;s one thing to choose to believe that a group of people are <i>sincerely reporting symptoms they perceive to be true</i>, and something very different to believe their attributions to cause. You can&#x27;t do the latter based on stories from an internet forum.<p>Do you have the virus in your brain? It&#x27;s unlikely, if only because you&#x27;re not currently dead of viral meningitis. Moreover, fixation on one limited aspect of the immune response (IgG), ignores the fact that the brain has <i>other</i> immune responses. The immune response is far more sophisticated than IgG alone, and humans have been recovering from viral infections for a long time.<p>If you have tinnitus, it could be any number of different things, ranging from medication (common!) to hearing damage from loud noises (common!) to stress&#x2F;tension (common!) to post-viral symptoms (rarely). A small percentage of people are reporting similar symptoms after Covid, but then, a <i>very large percentage</i> of people have Tinnitus, in general. It&#x27;s like the old saying goes: when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.<p>Point is: if you&#x27;re worried about it, talk to your doctor, not to reddit.')
