I don&#x27;t doubt you one bit about the performance difference, but, given how much fun I&#x27;ve had toying with MicroPython the BBC micro:bit (16MHz ARM Cortex-M0), I just don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m comfortable with C, and have had plenty of fun with Arduino, and I would happily switch to it if my performance needs required it. But, insofar as MicroPython lets me get from idea to working thing much more quickly, and insofar as my ideas are never something that require much performance, MicroPython boards have become the thing I reach for first when I&#x27;m looking to have some fun after dinner.')
