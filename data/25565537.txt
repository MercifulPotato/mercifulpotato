And as MaulingMonkey said, a cache doesn&#x27;t need to keep <i>everything</i>, just enough things to improve performance. And if the cache is costing you performance versus recomputation, then don&#x27;t do it. I mean, just like anything else in life, if it hurts don&#x27;t do it. If it costs you performance in a way that you care about, use an alternative.')
