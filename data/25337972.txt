Demand for talent in key markets goes down (as companies in those markets start looking for non-local talent[1]), but demand for talent in <i>any</i> market goes up (as non-local companies seek local talent).<p>So it would follow that overpriced talent in high-demand markets would see a decrease, where underpriced talent in low-demand markets would see an increase.<p>This would be the same concerns with offshoring as well, but that hasn&#x27;t led to massive salary drops. Because there&#x27;s still a big cost to switching people. If you could fire all your SF SWEs today and replace them with identical, knowledgable, fully-ramped, culture-carried SWEs in $secondary_market for half price, you would. You <i>can&#x27;t</i>, so you threaten and you try to convince your SF SWE that you <i>could</i> just enough to keep their expectations low, but not so much that they actually quit.<p>I see a lot of companies still trying the &quot;CoLA trick&quot; on employees moving to secondary markets. &quot;We can hire your position in $market for cheaper,&quot; so the argument goes. The best move there is to call their bluff: &quot;go do it then&quot;. Most people won&#x27;t do it because a) conflict is hard and b) finding a new job on top of moving is annoying. So they&#x27;ll take it on the chin and just resign 6-12 months later after they&#x27;re settled.<p>[1] In the old world, there&#x27;s still a premium to <i>convince talent to relocate</i>. So companies in high-demand markets (e.g., SF) either have to pay +x% to tap non-local talent and get them to move to the high-demand market (where they become local talent).<p>Even in the new world, non-local talent isn&#x27;t going to sit by and let themselves be underpaid. &quot;I&#x27;m doing the exact same thing, delivering the exact same value, but someone is getting paid 30% more to sit in the office? Oh, and you don&#x27;t even pay for <i>my</i> home office?&quot;')
