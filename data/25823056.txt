Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25832916], score=None, time=1610985777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822971, text='&gt;&gt; it&#x27;s the mandated minimum for electronics in EU law AIUI.<p>It&#x27;s such a common misconception I&#x27;m really shocked that EU has never made a better effort to clarify it.<p>EU does not enforce <i>any</i> warranty period by manufacturers. Zero. What it does enforce however, is the seller&#x27;s responsibility for the product they sold. And this responsibility is at least 2 years(it&#x27;s actually 6 years for most electronics and other products), but....it only covers <i>manufacturing</i> defects. That is the key word here. Any defects found in the first 6 months are presumed to be the result of manufacturing issues and the <i>seller</i> has to fix&#x2F;replace the item for the buyer without asking for any proof of how the defect occured. But after 6 months, the responsibility shifts - it&#x27;s the consumer who has to prove that the defect is a result of manufacturing problem. As I am sure you can appreciate, it&#x27;s extremely difficult for most items. In theory you could call upon this law even after 5 years after buying a bulb and say that the bulb broke due to a manufacturing defects and the seller would have to replace it - but it&#x27;s up to you to prove it.')
