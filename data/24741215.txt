Re-reading (i.e. parsing by the preprocessor) an include file isn&#x27;t so bad either, as it is already cached.<p>I find this focus on compilation speed curious.  At my last workplace a full built took a good share of the day (!) and was typically done overnight.  Building during the daytime was discouraged, as it happened on our workstations, slowing down everything else.  We found ways to cope, chiefly learning which subsets are autarkic, i.e. finding the least general Makefile which when invoked would catch your recent changes and wouldn&#x27;t traverse too much of the tree.  Not ideal, but workable.')
