The kid explains that their friends had an ongoing dice game, and sometimes Snot would try to steal the money that was on the table. They would chase him down and beat him and go back to the game, and the next night Snot would just do it again. McNulty is incredulous, “if he always tries to steal, why do you let him play? If you keep beating him up, why does he come back?” “You’ve got to let him play. This is America.”<p>It’s easy to draw the parallel between Snot and the various players of the drug trade, who all play the game, some working their way higher up the ranks than others, but inevitably being beaten down, but they keep playing because it’s the only game in town. But <i>that’s also the cops</i>. Half of the are crooked and the there’s no “exit” and they’re fighting a war that can’t be won. <i>Everyone</i> in this game is Snot Boogie.<p>The set-up for the second season is even better, and the scene with Snoop and that nailgun... god<p>I’m going to give the series another watch alongside this podcast that goes through the episodes one at a time. Haven’t listened yet so I can’t vouch, but I’m intrigued. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;overcast.fm&#x2F;+Zg-euhrSU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;overcast.fm&#x2F;+Zg-euhrSU</a>')
