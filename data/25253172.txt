Let me explain.<p>Apple has the performance edge now because it purchased ALL of the 5nm chip fabrication capacity of TSMC. This does not mean:<p>- they will be able to do so forever<p>- someone else won&#x27;t be doing 5nm in the next couple of years<p>So, the same sort of performance will come to other devices in the near future. The best Apple can hope to do at this time is to get enough attention to get some new users and hopefully lock them in into their cozy eco-system.<p>Most importantly, most users don&#x27;t care about an expensive powerful devices. Highest selling consumer devices are still budget devices and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Servers on the other hand will continue to demand powerful hardware, and Apple isn&#x27;t doing anything there.')
