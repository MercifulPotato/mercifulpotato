Item(by='roblabla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604257744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961386, text='Getting DMCA&#x27;d doesn&#x27;t mean anything more than somebody submitted a letter saying &quot;I believe this content infringes my copyright, please take it down.&quot;. It does not establish guilt.<p>Just because the RIAA cries foul doesn&#x27;t mean there is actually anything wrong here. Piracy is illegal, but youtube-dl is not a piracy tool, just like VHS recorders were not piracy tools. Making personal copies of videos is absolutely legal, and seems to be the prominent way to use youtube-dl (Why else would you use it? The content is already available for free on youtube itself!).<p>So what you should call youtube-dl is &quot;Something the RIAA doesn&#x27;t like&quot;, basically.')
