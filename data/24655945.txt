It&#x27;s never been one-or-the-other.<p>We can either admit that prison sentences aren&#x27;t actually meant to rehabilitate criminals and they exist solely as a way of inflicting punishment (as you imply), or we can take the folks coming out the back end of that system and give them opportunities to rejoin society as a productive citizen. The attitude of &quot;you made a bad choice, therefore you&#x27;re no longer worthy of opportunity&quot; is exactly why the United States has the highest imprisonment rates in the world: when folks come out of prison and have every door to rebuilding their life shut, what do you expect is going to happen?
