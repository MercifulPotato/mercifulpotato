And it is a bit funny to see how they clearly bent over backwards in their announcement e-mail to wrestle with the wording until they&#x27;d managed to come up with some form of why the force-opted-in user may possibly need or want this. Just when we&#x27;d started to tell people (who already had very little trust) that Amazon isn&#x27;t always listening, they do that sort of thing and just take co-ownership of the uplink and share it with others. I get the concept of a virtual interface, but that is beside the point. It also allows Amazon (I&#x27;d think) to map out your neighbours, who may not be as interested in sharing location details, as you and your IP are.')
