For Facebook, the effect is like refusing to serve a customer their coffee at a coffee shop.<p>I suppose that&#x27;s the real problem with these kind of issues; you see the same on e.g. YouTube where even fairly large channels acting in good faith can run in to problems. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any malice involved, but it&#x27;s just too much effort to fix, there are other things going on, and they&#x27;ve got enough money anyway: so why bother?<p>Even just a few years ago, Facebook&#x27;s revenue was a lot smaller, so that would explain why they were more outgoing at the time.')
