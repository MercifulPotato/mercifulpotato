The games launch, but in my testing, have all kinds of glitches or issues that go away when running on X11. For example, one game doesn&#x27;t receive any input, another one has graphical artifacts but otherwise runs fine, another runs at a suuper low frame rate. All of these issues go away when running on X. For all I know its a driver issue or something else in my setup.<p>But things are improving, so maybe in a few months (by the time I get a desktop with some luck) it will all be resolved. I may give wine-wayland a try too if it&#x27;s not. Or its my setup and it may just work on new hardware.<p>Either way, I&#x27;m quite impressed by Proton, but haven&#x27;t been able to run it on Wayland properly yet.')
