And then each polling station (county?) provides numbers separately, so to push the vote a huge amount you&#x27;d need multiple polling stations to lie to move the vote more than .5% (as I understand it, not an expert).<p>That said, I&#x27;d love if the full process was disclosed somewhere for public scrutiny. There should be numerous safeguards (e.g. two random people counting the same stack of ballots) in a good system.')
