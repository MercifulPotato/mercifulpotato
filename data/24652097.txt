She&#x27;s young, I hope this exam going wrong really is the absolutely worst thing that&#x27;s happened to her so far.<p>And considering the 10&#x27;s of thousands of pounds&#x2F;dollars of debt students are routinely getting into, and considering how highly fought collage, university and job placements are at the moment, I think she&#x27;s got every right to be broken.
