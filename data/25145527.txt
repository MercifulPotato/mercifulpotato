Thankfully our house has PEX piping, so no burst pipes for us.<p>Sealing and insulating those areas has made a tremendous difference, even in the interior areas of the house. Since the subfloor is wide open, a cold breeze from one spot can suck the heat out of the entire floor with surprising effectiveness.')
