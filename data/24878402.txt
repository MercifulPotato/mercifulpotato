Ultimately, I found <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;radicle-dev&#x2F;radicle-link" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;radicle-dev&#x2F;radicle-link</a> , following the link &quot;browse the protocol&quot;, which mentions: &quot;WORK IN PROGRESS - In fact, there is nothing substantial to see here yet&quot;. Is it a yet unreleased software? (that would explain why I can&#x27;t find a way to try it out).<p>If it&#x27;s the case and if anyone from the project is reading this, it would be helpful to mention it on top of landing page.<p>Also, the landing page is mentioning ssb, is this related to git-ssb?<p>&gt; how do you handle issue&#x2F;comment spammers?<p>I love how ssb is handling that : it&#x27;s not a problem because you create a &quot;web of trust&quot; and only content from people you trust and people they trust reaches you - and trust can be revoked in case of problem. Obviously, it creates an other problem, though : how a benevolent total stranger can reach you?<p>By the way, yet an other alternative is hypergit ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noffle&#x2F;hypergit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;noffle&#x2F;hypergit</a> ). It uses hyperdb&#x2F;dat. I used it a few times to share code with friends, I loved it because it was the most straightforward for them to install and use.')
