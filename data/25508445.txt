I would assume it&#x27;s either native resolution or at least 1080. But to be fair I&#x27;m mostly recording in 720p 50fps, since the 4k is cropped with the EOS R and I felt more fps is better for webcam footage (the other modes are capped at 30fps (25?) or have a crop). Besides, people don&#x27;t need to see my face in more detail.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable delay in the footage so far, but now that you mention it, I&#x27;ll definitely keep an eye on that.<p>The EOS R can draw some power from USB, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly enough, or it doesn&#x27;t work while recording or something.')
