Unintended consequence for sure. We already had COVID in March so felt the risks were acceptable for us, and as you&#x27;ve said Disney was extremely serious about mask requirements, and so many of the things little kids would be interested in were closed down. They really don&#x27;t want a super spreader event at &quot;The Happiest Place on Earth&quot;.<p>And to preempt people who think I&#x27;m acting irresponsibly, you&#x27;re right. It was a spur of the moment trip and sort of a mental health crisis, I felt trapped and crazy in my home in the middle of winter, if I could go back in time I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go. The airplane was completely full and I&#x27;m guessing drink sales are way up on planes because that&#x27;s the only reason you&#x27;re allowed to take off your mask. Also prices were insanely cheap for flights, $250 for round trip tickets for me and my five year old daughter.')
