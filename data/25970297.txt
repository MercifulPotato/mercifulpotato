Focusing only on shallow hot topic issues like who uses which bathroom feels good, but universities should be exploring the depths of social justice issues from a more holistic place.  I went to university and never had to take a women’s studies class or an African American history class, so I didn’t take one.  In fact no courses on diversity were required, I believe that has been to my detriment, and I’d be a much more thoughtful well rounded individual had I taken those courses.')
