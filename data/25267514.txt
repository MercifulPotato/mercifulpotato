I suspect the reason that Linux ARM support is as good as it is currently has a lot to do with devices like the Raspberry Pi.  In 2010 (i.e. before the Pi) I was using a BeagleBoard-xM and things were both rough and spartan.  Today the ARM packages in the repos are nearly at parity and things work much better.<p>However, the Pi has never gotten much beyond being a forky port of Linux software (back then they had to: they were an arm6hf device in an arm7hf world) and since they seem determined to stay forked (i.e. they no longer need to be a fork, but rather seem to want to be), I don&#x27;t expect much more from the project in terms of broader Linux enhancements.  I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong on this.')
