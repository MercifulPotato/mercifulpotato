Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611533491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25893647, text='&gt; In the real world<p>Do we just live in the different real worlds? Because in my real world, deadlines are almost always arbitrary and fungible so long as the right kind of communication is made -- the only times I&#x27;ve seen that not be the case for me&#x2F;folks in my network is 1) when they&#x27;re working on something that&#x27;s actually time critical (rare but does happen) and 2) when they&#x27;re working in a dysfunctional, top-down environment (far more common).<p>I can&#x27;t help but raise an eyebrow at the idea that you might lose a client by missing a deadline by 2-3 weeks (rather than not selling them well enough). Is this a hypothetical situation you&#x27;re talking about? Sometimes, 2-3 weeks is as fast as they&#x27;ll get back to you with a single hop of communication. The other example of engineers get down-evaluated for ending up jumping on the grenade of a task that gets significantly longer (sometimes by months) \n -- I do see that happen from time to time but whether the manager down-evaluates is often inversely correlated with that manager&#x2F;management chain&#x27;s capability. The good managers understand that scope creep and an unforeseen gotchas happen; they don&#x27;t want to take those instances as failures but rather .<p>&gt; When I made the final push for my PhD thesis corrections, I stayed up 4 days straight right before the deadline dotting my &#x27;i&#x27;s and crossing my &#x27;t&#x27;s. 6 years into the &quot;real world&quot;, I often look back on that time as the good ole days.<p>Why? That sounds like unproductive, unhealthy self-martyrship. It&#x27;s the complete opposite of how a competent professional works through things. Do you simply like to suffer? There&#x27;s a reason people don&#x27;t work like that in the &quot;real world&quot; and it&#x27;s because there are actual real dollars on the line and competent organizations understand that such behavior purely results in expensive unforced errors.')
