But also really&#x2F;truly remember not to really put all your eggs in one proverbial basket.<p>Password managers are not without dangers:<p>1. If you forget your master password or secret key (you need both to setup a new device), you are screwed.<p>2. If the password manager cloud sync service (like 1password) decides to cancel your account for whatever reason, you are screwed.<p>3. If the password manager allows silently keeping replicas on devices you don&#x27;t know about, you are screwed.<p>4. If your password manager logs your sign-in access patterns along with your IP addresses (even from behind your fancy VPNs), you are screwed.<p>5. If you are storing your password, your 2FA secret, and your recovery keys - all in the same password manager, you are royally screwed when that password manager is compromised.<p>6. If you lose your device, or device gets damaged etc and you don&#x27;t have a copy of your vault, you are screwed.<p>Remember â€“ supply chain attacks (example: password manager company&#x27;s office gets hacked, and their signing key gets stolen and a trojan update is delivered to your machine) will happen some day  (may have already happened) and all your passwords will be stolen. Just assume that and behave accordingly.')
