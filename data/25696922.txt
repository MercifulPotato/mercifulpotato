That&#x27;s <i>intent</i> to intimidate, even if the residents managed to get evacuated before we could prove that they weren&#x27;t just comfort props from people who were merely cosplaying as terrorists.<p>Here&#x27;s a copy&#x2F;paste legal definition where I removed a lot of extraneous examples:<p>&gt; Under federal law, the activity or attempted actions which could fall under terrorism charges include:<p>&gt; government official kidnapping;<p>&gt; arson or bombing property;<p>&gt; use of explosives;<p>&gt; attacking a federal facility;<p>&gt; conspiracy to murder, kidnap, or maim;<p>&gt; take a hostage;<p>&gt; bombing public places;<p>I mean, <i>they brought molotovs and bombs</i>.  And <i>zipties</i>.  I&#x27;d say an attempt was made.<p>Then of course there&#x27;s the fact that one of them murdered a cop by bashing his head with a fire extinguisher.')
