However w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t the investment firms, imo many investment firms can grow revenue without hiring only when the bottleneck constraint on their revenue is just their reputation.<p>As their reputation grows, investment firms are often able to do the same thing but with a larger quantity of investor money. Perhaps their reputation also helps on the other end; maybe some can make the same quantity of deals per unit time but as their reputation grows perhaps they become better connected so maybe the deals get bigger and&#x2F;or more profitable.<p>In other industries you have to produce a higher quantity of goods or services in order to get more revenue, so this may not generalize.')
