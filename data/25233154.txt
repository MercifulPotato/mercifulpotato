Instead, you brought up a story about a woman who had cardiac problems, which totally shifted the conversation away from Neanderthal DNA.<p>If the story you brought up was supposed to be an allegory for people worrying about Neanderthal DNA, then there are a couple things to consider:<p>1. No one is equating Neanderthal DNA to cardiac disease as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality.<p>2. Choosing not to worry about cardiac disease as a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality is clearly a bad idea, even if some people with cardiac disease don&#x27;t die to COVID-19.')
