Mostly (to my understanding) this is based on the lack of separation of powers found in the GDR.<p>The &quot;dictatorship&quot; question is regulary a topic of more or less philosophical but most certainly emotional debates with each side being sure they are right. I cannot tell the percentage of &quot;dictatorship&quot;&#x2F;&quot;non-dicatorship&quot; proponents.<p>(I am no history nerd.)<p>edit: pls replace &quot;that the GDR was is in fact seen&quot; with &quot;that the GDR is in fact seen&quot; in your mind')
