Voyagers have the highest path loss of any communications link, over 300 db. NASA uses 70 m dishes. We can assume that they have cut the transmit power (or raised the data rate) as much as possible, so you would also need at least a 70 m steerable dish, or more if you don&#x27;t have NASA quality low noise amplifiers. I don&#x27;t know what one of these costs, but the one at Goldstone weighs 3000 tons so you probably can&#x27;t afford it.<p>The Russians have a couple 70 m dishes, so your best bet might be to make friends with someone who works at Yevpatoria or Galenki.')
