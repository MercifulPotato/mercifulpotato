Classic paging is such a thorn in our side, but almost everyone uses it for their v1 unless they ask us for guidance first. We have guides about why pagination is bad, and discourage it in our API rate limits, but it still persists.<p>Looking back, I would exclude classic pagination from a public API and go full cursor. Possibly include an optional total count that can be requested (counts are expensive in PG though).')
