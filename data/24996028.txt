Push a button, get a prize is not very rewarding in the long run.<p>I disagree. I installed Home Assistant, got some smart plugs and ESP chips and bought a solenoid. Sitting on the deck and seeing the sprinkler go at sundown +30mins or getting the Slack alert as it turns on and off is very satisfying.<p>There is plenty of hard work to do, but I really believe that automating the watering is more efficient when done by my automation. It was quite inexpensive too.')
