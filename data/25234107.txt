I would instead look at the relation between exterior algebra and GA.<p>Differentials are a concept that the comes from doing calculus on manifolds, and exterior products of differentials are just used for tracking information about oriented volumes.<p>To answer your question (switching differentials forms for for exterior algebras), you wont miss anything, as the wedge product is part of a GA.')
