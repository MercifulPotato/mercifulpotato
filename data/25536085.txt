Item(by='rm445', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608899411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535878, text='Great post, but in the context of &quot;Where is everybody?&quot;, each &#x27;we won&#x27;t&#x27; or &#x27;we could&#x27;, where we haven&#x27;t actually done it yet, is potentially part of the solution to the puzzle. Perhaps filling the universe with undying, exponentially-spreading probes, that don&#x27;t stop spreading due to values drift, is harder than we think. (Personally, an early filter feels more likely to me, but if it&#x27;s not that, it&#x27;s gotta be something).')
