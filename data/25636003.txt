They are practically running the hate-filled cesspits like 4chan, and we saw the results last summer when they burned down the inner cities to stop the peaceful protests against white supremacy and George Floyd.<p>When I&#x27;ve tried to bring attention to this, right-wing extremists have called me a malicious collaboration hypothesizer, but I just report them to the mods and that&#x27;s that.<p>Hopefully under Biden, and with new technology that respects people of all backgrounds, all this disinformation can be dealt with legislatively once and for all, so that you&#x27;ll be able to trust the news and what you read online, and never have to deal with any racist fascist misogyny ever again.')
