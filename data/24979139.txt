It&#x27;s good if the parts lifespan is twice as long as you need. However, it&#x27;s even better if you could make it four times the amount you think you need, as long as it isn&#x27;t horribly expensive.<p>I would tend to assume they&#x27;ve thought of that though, and stuck with this part for reasons. Maybe there werent other space-ready alternatives or something.')
