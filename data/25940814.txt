Item(by='throw0101a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611835389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25939253, text='Yes, I am aware of Velben goods (as well as Giffen goods): if you go into my comment history you&#x27;ll see I actually mentioned them just in the last week.<p>&gt; <i>You didn&#x27;t break economics with your &quot;why are luxury goods so expensive even though they&#x27;re not better&quot; argument, unfortunately.</i><p>I do not see (a) where my claims imply breaking any economics principles, and (b) did not claim they&#x27;re not better. As someone with an engineering degree I was taught all about trade-offs in design. Different situations may call for a need for different characteristics of a design: one person&#x27;s situation  may call for VW (simple commuting) while another&#x27;s a Porsche (dealing with a mid-life crisis).<p>My point was that different items, which have different <i>prices</i>, have different <i>value</i> to different people. So to say what something is &quot;worth&quot; can be completely arbitrary, independent of price. Similarly, various people can find the same item &quot;worth&quot; differently, depending on what they <i>value</i>, so each is will to pay a different <i>price</i>: this is what auctions are all about after all.<p>In the case of GME: the people who actually care about the retail company may value it one way, and thus are willing to pay a particular price for each stock; while the people who care about fulfilling their (shorting) option contracts may have a <i>different</i> value and are wilting to pay a <i>different</i> price. What each stock is &quot;worth&quot; is different to each of them.')
