Google may have just been complying with the law, but that doesn&#x27;t meant they had to be quiet about it.  Unless they had a gag order, they should have publicly stated that the US government was compelling them to hand over search records.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; Google declined to disclose how many keyword warrants it&#x27;s received in the last three years.<p>They did not say anything about a gag order and, given Google&#x27;s track record on privacy, I&#x27;m not inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt here.')
