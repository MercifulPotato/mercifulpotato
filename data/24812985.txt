What sank us was that the government capitulated, patted themselves on the back for a job well done and removed the requirement for masks on public transport, in shops, in offices etc. In the last week they&#x27;ve since had to clamp down severely and it&#x27;s going to tank the economy where I live. I&#x27;m not going to pretend it was rosy under the restrictions, many businesses were hurting but weren&#x27;t completely crippled, but many had found a way to survive. And we&#x27;ve since gone from being the envy of continental Europe to having some of the highest per-capita new cases per day in the world.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what else you <i>can</i> do other than try to keep things under control while a potential vaccine or at least treatment is developed. Give up and just let it spread through the population, whoever lives wins?')
