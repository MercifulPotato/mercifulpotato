I already have my company mail at GSuite so I&#x27;ve got lots of storage but well I think I should start looking into other options as well. Maybe Zoho Mail for emails and Mega.nz for cloud storage. But guess we&#x27;ll see about that given Google does provide extensive support for GSuite so it shouldn&#x27;t be as big of a problem as it is for the normal accounts. Most of all, for my personal account which is the one normally signed in everywhere, I&#x27;m switching it totally to iCloud with some parts still on Google however none of them being the ones I&#x27;m too reliant on.')
