Item(by='monkeydreams', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603755805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894149, text='&gt; this is a strawman argument.<p>I&#x27;m reading this as a header declaration.<p>You are arguing a range of items without actually touching on my point - that health data patterns require a link from encounter and observations back to a patient record. I think that you are arguing a number of these points with incomplete information (i.e. that you have little understanding of the pressures which result in the continued existence of Windows XP within the health ecosystem), and on other points you are completely missing the point (storing patient data on the cloud is a <i>whole</i> different argument).<p>&gt; Data is money today , so industry is not interested in better safety of medical data either, preventing aggregate collection will loose a lot of value for med tech companies.<p>The data has relatively minimal value for the makers of patient record systems. The value of these systems are in the licensing and ancillary&#x2F;secondary services.')
