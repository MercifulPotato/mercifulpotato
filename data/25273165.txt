NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform. If you&#x27;re looking to join a team of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other, discuss past mistakes openly as we adapt to the challenges that come with progress, all while realizing our mission, then you&#x27;ll be excited to learn more about us.<p>Our colleagues span six time zones, California to Berlin and points in between, with lively discourse flowing freely across Slack, Zoom, and the office when we&#x27;re able to be there. Wherever we&#x27;re working from, we&#x27;ve always deligted in our work to ship new features—beginning with our curriculum and product teams, designers, through to testing by our dedicated quality assurance folks—that put teachers and students first. [1]<p>Our engineering team [2] takes prides in producing innovative, maintainable software. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our front-end development. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, though we&#x27;re actively moving toward Haskell services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure configured with Chef and OpsWorks, though we&#x27;re migrating towards orchestration using Kubernetes. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. We&#x27;ve also developed and maintain several useful open-source projects. [3] You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog. [4]<p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness.\nIf that&#x27;s you, you can learn more about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6], and you should definitely apply through our jobs page!
