Item(by='bigyikes', descendants=None, kids=[24844707], score=None, time=1603248536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843909, text='&gt; I think its much better for a beginner engineer to learn the methods from first principles and develop an appreciation for them. They can then learn the distinction between what&#x27;s true and the intuitive language people use to describe a phenomenon they don&#x27;t completely understand but can pattern match to.<p>This seems super meta, because I am a beginner engineer and your comment is totally pattern matching to distillation, but for humans instead of models. Maybe beginners should start with those “functional“ (read: distilled) truths and train from there :)')
