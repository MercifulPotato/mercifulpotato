I think you are misunderstanding our points.<p>&gt; <i>They say &quot;this seems to be geared towards beginners who are not intending to understand the underlying primitives&quot;</i><p>What I said was that this library is geared towards <i>people</i> (not beginners, anyone) who do not understand and don&#x27;t plan on learning the concepts that are extremely important and fundamental in the use of a language. You make good points with abstraction, but what I said was based on the context. The context is that we&#x27;re talking about something (concurrency) that fundamental in knowing when using something else (C++).<p>As I stated in my original reply,  &quot;<i>A concurrency library is useful to have to avoid boiler plate code....</i>&quot; I agree with you that libraries are good for abstraction for things we either repeat or already know. They are <i>not good</i> when used as substitutes for the lack of knowledge, when that knowledge is as foundational as concurrency is in C++.<p>&gt; <i>I also disagree with that premise. There are lots of hard things in programming. Concurrency is one of them, but so is memory management. There are footguns all over. It&#x27;s possible to misuse most abstractions, and the reasoning could often be chalked up to &quot;not understanding underlying primitives&quot;</i><p>The actual variable we&#x27;re using here to determine of what should be understood and what&#x27;s not that important to be understood is how closely the two subject matters are related and (here it comes, my favorite word) fundamental to each other.<p>&gt; <i>I think the first post was saying something like &quot;you should learn concurrency primitives; if you know concurrency primitives, then this library is overly pedantic.&quot;</i><p>I might be sounding like a broken record, but just to make sure I&#x27;m clear on what I meant. Use the library by all means, unless it&#x27;s to avoid learning something fundamental (buzzword of the day folks).')
