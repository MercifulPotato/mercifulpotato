I&#x27;d guesstimate that roughly 60% of the recommendations I get from YouTube are for videos I&#x27;ve already seen. (To be fair I &quot;watch&quot; a decent amount of music on YouTube, so maybe I&#x27;m disproportionately likely to rewatch videos I&#x27;ve seen before.) Another 30% is content based on misinterpretation of my political beliefs, like &quot;you watched a critical analysis of a Prager U video, maybe you&#x27;d like these 6 Trump-stanning videos from Newsmax&quot;.<p>The political thing seems like an obvious blindspot in the YouTube recommendation algorithm to me. Going all the way back to 2015 YouTube seems unable to distinguish between &quot;critical of establishment Democrats&quot; and &quot;intellectual-dark-web &#x2F; pro-Trump&quot; interests. I&#x27;ll watch one lefty &quot;breadtube&quot; video that&#x27;s critical of someone like Biden or Pelosi or complimentary to someone like AOC or Sanders and get Newsmax&#x2F;OAN&#x2F;Fox-and-Friends video recommendations for a week.<p>More generally it seems to me that YouTube&#x27;s recommendation engine is far too volatile and heavily influenced by recently watched content. A one-off, slightly out-of-character view will noticeably taint my recommendations for a week or two.<p>In contrast I&#x27;d say Spotify, Google Music (before it was folded into YouTube), Netflix, Twitter, Amazon Prime, or even Pocket-via-Firefox does OK - not great but acceptably well - so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m especially inscrutable. I&#x27;m curious about your experience with this. I have moderately broad interests, I feel like it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to come up with something I would find interesting but it virtually never seems to happen organically on YouTube.<p>I&#x27;ve always just assumed they were optimizing for something other than things I would consciously find interesting or engaging. For example I&#x27;m guessing that triggering &quot;outrage&quot; is probably a good way to drive engagement (comments, shares, etc.). I don&#x27;t really do either of those things regardless but I&#x27;m pretty sure that strategy works in general.<p>Do you find that YouTube frequently recommends novel content you enjoy? Is that even what they (or your company) is <i>trying</i> to do?')
