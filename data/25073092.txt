They look almost as good as accelerated animations.<p>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t really commit to using Safari on desktop because they don&#x27;t have good ad blocking extensions (please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). Really like FF for this.<p>But I really appreciate how Apple is committed to improving and highlighting Safari. After totalitarian regimes, browser engine monoculture is the greatest threat to Internet freedom I can think of.')
