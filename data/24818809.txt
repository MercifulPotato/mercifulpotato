The bill presumes that platforms using open protocols already (like email) are fine. Facebook and itâ€™s messenger platform is likely to be the only one meeting the threshold.<p>I&#x27;m not American, but if you are and you care, I would suggest you to call your representative and explain why you support (or not) this bill. Remember that as it goes through congress, it can, and most likely will, be heavily edited or gutted to fit the many competing interests whispering in their ears. If you think the bill is good as is, tell them that! Personally, I think the bill is perfect, except for the 100M user threshold to start demand compatibility, which I think should be lowered to 10M.')
