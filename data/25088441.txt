If I have &quot;some&quot; drinks (eg, more than just 1 or 2 small ones), I can easily see how RHR is high and my recovery doesn&#x27;t even BEGIN until say 3am. When you start tracking and watching those stats every day, you can see how different you feel when you get a good night&#x27;s sleep. Vs an alcohol-aided-but-not-drunk-not-hungover sleep.')
