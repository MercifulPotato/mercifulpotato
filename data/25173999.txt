Frankly the whole argument is sexist, unnecessarily so.<p>What&#x27;s ultimately underrepresented are people with small hands, PERIOD.<p>As if it&#x27;s fine that men with small hands can&#x27;t compete (very common too btw), but oh-boy, since it&#x27;s especially affects women, now it&#x27;s a super big wrong that has to be corrected.<p>No, it&#x27;s wrong on a more fundamental level - there&#x27;s no good reason to exclude small handed people at all from reaching the highest level, regardless of sex or anything in between.')
