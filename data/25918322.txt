The reason that the web is slow now is javascript. That is, treating a webpage like an application instead of a document. This analysis just assumes all websites are JS-application monsters and only differentiates between them. It misses the point.<p>What makes it even slower is the practice of serially chain loading JS from multiple domains. Once you&#x27;re 3 deep in that it doesn&#x27;t matter how &#x27;fast&#x27; your webserver is or how fast and clean your JS code is, the serial loading will slow things to a crawl.')
