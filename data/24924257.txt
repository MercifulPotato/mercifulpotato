I find the cost in maintainance and initial setup quite low.\nTelegraf is super easy, just uncomment the things you want it to collect from the config file. Influxdb is just adding the correct users and a database, never touched it since.\nGrafana can be a time sink if you want to bikeshed your dashboards, but there are a lot of pre-made ones that handle common usecases.<p>It&#x27;s really nice to have some metrics when for instance a service goes down. It&#x27;s super easy to spot a OOM situation or other vertical scaling issues.')
