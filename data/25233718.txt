If someone else can get i7 level cpu performance and gtx 1050 level gpu performance at those levels of power consumption then absolutely. I just wonder how much work was being done in that direction before the M1, i.e., are we a year away from seeing an early version, or 3 years? If it&#x27;s closer to 3, Intel and AMD have some breathing room, or at least enough runway to launch their own similar efforts. (though at this point I seriously doubt Intel&#x27;s ability to execute, and they are very far down the road of path-dependency in the choices they&#x27;ve made)')
