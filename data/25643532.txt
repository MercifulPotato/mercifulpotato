There&#x27;s no doubt that this will massively improve podcasts, radio, etc.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine watching a video that&#x27;s been chopped up like that would be a particularly nice experience though. Editing video to remove unwanted sections and not have it look like people&#x27;s heads are jumping around weirdly is really hard. Cuts are really noticeable. If they&#x27;ve managed to fix that with ML it&#x27;s going to have a huge impact on the cost of video production.')
