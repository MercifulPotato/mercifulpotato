Item(by='xenocratus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608022544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25417624, text='I had a look at Code Project but looking at their Articles dropdown, I couldn&#x27;t find much related to security (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m quite biased towards security to begin with). I find this odd given the avalanche of problems being discovered on a constant basis.<p>The section that I did find (&quot;Security and Cryptography&quot; in  &quot;General Programming&quot;) seemed more geared towards crypto - there was even a subsection for Steganography (?!). I actually think this is a bit concerning given that C++ is one of the most discussed languages on the platform...<p>EDIT: There is actually a Web Security section, but none for desktop development (or any other section, including development lifecycle)')
