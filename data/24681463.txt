Item(by='lumost', descendants=None, kids=[24681858], score=None, time=1601838347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678976, text='While I agree with the strong towns assesment overrall, I think this analysis may rely on some assumptions on the distribution of wealth and tax revenue within a population.  Ultimately the &quot;once per generation expense&quot; in all of these towns was funded once per generation in the past.  This money came from the federal government, and not the local tax payer - ultimately with the federal government taking on long-term debt to fund it.<p>While this seems like a ponzi scheme of perpetual growth, there is nothing that would prevent the federal government ( or the local government ) from repeating this exercise to rebuild the infrastructure.  If we can&#x27;t redo this exercise it means that<p>- Despite economic growth, the cost of replacing existing infrastructure is higher than it was a generation ago e.g. Cost disease: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baumol%27s_cost_disease" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baumol%27s_cost_disease</a><p>- The balance of payments in the economy is not well calibrated on a generational scale, profitable economic activity is not attributed on a local scale with free cash flows diverted elsewhere by rentiers&#x2F;global financial flows e.g. a factory in annaheim california sees all profits recognized in Delaware&#x2F;Ireland.  The federal government&#x2F;central bank may have more capability to provide local governments with finances than we would expect in such a scenario by rebalancing payments.<p>- The current US city landscape has real long-term economic costs that drain capital on unprofitable activities, immediate pivots in city planning are required to avoid economic fallout.<p>I suspect a little bit of all three options are at play, but I would be curious for more exploration on items 1&amp;2.  A great irony of the modern world is that the City of Flynn borders several pipe manufacturers.')
