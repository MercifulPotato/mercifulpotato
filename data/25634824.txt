Corporations and the people who do their work for them are not cut from the same cloth. When the owners of the world&#x27;s productive capacity collude to fix prices, that&#x27;s a trust. When laborers who (by definition) do not own the productive capacity, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a union. These are two different words for two different concepts about two fundamentally different kinds of entities (capital and labor).<p>Thinking of the wage relation as a bargain between equals is a cope. You&#x27;re not as powerful as Google.<p>There is a reason we don&#x27;t talk about employers (especially enormous ones Like Alphabet that are becoming so deeply integrated into modern life and politics that it&#x27;s now difficult to fully conceive of) and individual working people as if they are the same kind of thing.<p>One is a supranational bohemoth that owns an enormous productive capacity, the other relies on wage labor to live. (That&#x27;s not a sob story, just a true fact. You can rely on wage labor and still live pretty comfortably. I do.)')
