The EU introduced a cap on such fees in 2015 after concerns they pushed prices up for consumers and unfairly burdened companies.&quot;<p>&quot;Mastercard is implementing the rises simply as it&#x27;s no longer bound by the restrictions imposed by the UK being in the EU.&quot;<p>Thus proving the caps were indeed necessary. If MC was making money with a 0.3% fee the other 1.2% are pure sweet profit margin.')
