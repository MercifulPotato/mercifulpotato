I&#x27;m 99% on his side but I would have loved to hear responses to the idea, how do you distinguish this from hunting for ghosts, souls, E.S.P., telepathy, etc...  Someone who believed in those things would pretty much make all the same arguments (eg, have an open mind).<p>I&#x27;m sure there are good arguments to distinguish why searching harder in the directions Avi wants things to go is different from searching for ghosts.
