The platform itself was not inherently about spreading objectionable material. It was about being more free than Twitter.<p>&gt; And I have yet to hear anyone discuss how &quot;anything goes&quot;<p>&gt; and social media do not mix.<p>As with all free speech, it had legal limits, such as threats of violence. We can argue about how effective the moderation system was in Parler, but I know for a fact that they repeatedly removed material that broke the law.')
