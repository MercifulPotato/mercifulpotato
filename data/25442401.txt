Most people do not trade stock directly - they use a middleman, called a market maker.<p>This is computer now, but back in 1890 (picking a date where there were stock markets, but obviously no computers) there were people who worked on the floor of the various stock exchanges called market makers.  They own a bunch off shares of one company, and agree to buy or sell to anyone.  When some broker (ie agent for a trader who may not live in the same city) walks on the floor wanting to buy stock they don&#x27;t have to wait for someone else walking on willing to sell, instead they go to this person who is always willing to sell stock.  Latter when broker (again agent for a trader) wants sell stock the market maker will buy their shares. This is much quicker than the two traders needing to find each other and agree to a price.<p>The market maker makes money be the spread.  When the two traders above buy or sell with the trader they don&#x27;t get the same price. Instead if the stock is listed for $10&#x2F;share the person buying is really paying an extra price, $11&#x2F;share (for example it is almost always pennies), and the person selling actually is getting $9&#x2F;share (again an absurd example). The market marker is thus making $1&#x2F;share for every share of stock traded.<p>The spread thus clearly is taking money from the traders. This is above the money you have to pay your broker to make the trade for you.')
