Firewall vendors will go hunting through kernel code for jump targets and structs to plug into hidden interfaces, and Apple will remove and change them, causing crashes and instability. Apple has some leverage if they have a program like WHQL, but even then driver writers will commit shenanigans. \nPush them out of the kernel altogether and now only Apple can engage in shenanigans and break user trust. Which they already have.')
