Modifications have been done across every layer of the stack, across hundreds of companies of differing goals.<p>You only go to that much effort, at that great a cost, if you are hoping for DRM to actually work, rather than just be a thing you can hold up in court and say &quot;we tried to protect it your honor, we really did&quot;.')
