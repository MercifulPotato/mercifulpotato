You could say that it isn&#x27;t a story, but just life..<p>Life is unfair, and life just happens, the best thing we can do is try to live the best we can.<p>Have to say, that really is a wonderful bookshelf, I just hope to see a picture when it is full of books.. I cannot even fathom how heart breaking it must be, every time you see the bookshelf, you remember your dead wife and her life wish she didn&#x27;t get too see fulfilled.<p>This kind of stuff just hits you differently.. \nI have also always wanted to have a home library where I can hide away and just read books for hours on end, guess this could be a kind of wake up call to go for it sooner than later, since you never know when your end is coming...')
