Where one half of the populace believes the nation itself to be fundamentally good , worthwhile or indeed &quot;the best&quot;, and the other believes it to be rotten to the core not just now but since its very beginning. Where one half believes that the 2020 election was genuinely stolen from them by socialists and communists, and the other genuinely believes they&#x27;ve just defeated something in line with Adolf Hitler, who himself stole the 2016 election thanks to Russians with a couple million of FB ad spend.<p>I hope to be wrong.')
