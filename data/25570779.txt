Item(by='rzwitserloot', descendants=None, kids=[25574294], score=None, time=1609256581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569418, text='The article does cover it, but a bit later: It talks about e.g. WiFi lightbulbs and the like, still running on IPv4, and covers Postel&#x27;s Law pretty well, considering it not &#x27;a good idea&#x27; so much as &#x27;you may not like the law of gravity, but the law does not care&#x27;. Postel&#x27;s law is not a principle you should apply. Postel&#x27;s law is a thing that will be done to you, regardless of what you think of Postel&#x27;s Law.<p>In other words, some numbnut with an old wifi lightbulb is going to write some cruft to attempt to make their IPv6 only router somehow route their stuff to IPv4.<p>Whichever clowny moron sells a router that actually enables this numbnut wins the fight, because said numbnut will buy the clown&#x27;s product.<p>I&#x27;m just rephrasing and repeating that article as I understand it. Point is: Yes, the bout of pessimism is covered. And covered again, and in a better way, in the followup article linked at the very end: It&#x27;s the application of the notion that Postel&#x27;s Law is a force of nature and not an applied principle.')
