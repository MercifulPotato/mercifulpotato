There is that popular fallacy though, but I&#x27;m not aware if it has a name, where people think that the truth is always in the middle (the golden middle).<p>And you could say that this is it, <i>but</i> given the strong polarization and extremism around topics that involve politics it might be a good measure in this case. (Of course, depending on what exactly &#x27;everybody&#x27; means.) By definition extremists of either side will see independent actors as hostile. But, of course, this is just a measure, not a proof.')
