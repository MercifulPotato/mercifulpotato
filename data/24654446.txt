As long as most devices are A, most ports will be A as well. And until C ports are more common, it&#x27;s no use making C devices. That&#x27;s made even worse because adapters for C female to A male are explicitly forbidden by the specs, so there&#x27;s no cheap way to support both. A manufacturer could put a female C port on the device and ship both C-to-C and C-to-A cables, but that&#x27;s expensive.')
