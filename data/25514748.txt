Stocks don&#x27;t operate in low-entropy hypothetical planes of existence, they trade on markets. If your ask has no bids you lower your ask. Sellers will keep lowering it and if there&#x27;s no bids it will get very near zero in which case the exchange will likely de-list the stock. A hypothetical where you sell one flying car doesn&#x27;t illustrate a comparable dynamic.')
