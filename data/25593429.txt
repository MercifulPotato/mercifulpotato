Protein folding is very complex; what AF2 has in the training set and CASP in the test set are proteins which were accessible to structure determination up to now at all; most proteins were measured in crystallized (i.e. not their natural) form, so the resulting static structure is likely not representative; and not to forget that many proteins get another conformation than the one to be expected by thermodynamics etc. e.g. because they&#x27;re integrated in a complex with other proteins and&#x2F;or &quot;modified&quot; by chaperones; so it would be quite naive to assume that from now on you can just throw a sequence into the black box and the right structure comes out.<p>This article two clicks away from the referenced one is much more relevant: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moalquraishi.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;08&#x2F;alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home&#x2F;amp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moalquraishi.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;08&#x2F;alphafold2-cas...</a>')
