It changes how you build the app, and you just never have to worry about the network. Everything is fast _by default_. It&#x27;s great.<p>The app uses CRDTs to sync and it&#x27;s unlocked a lot of powerful stuff like a robust undo system. We also offer end-to-end encryption.<p>On the negative side, over time I&#x27;ve stepped back a little from being truly local-first. The mobile app used to connect to the desktop by pointing the phone&#x27;s camera at a QR code on desktop, and it would literally sync peer-to-peer. Maintaining that was nightmare and users had endless networking problems. Our network infrastructure unfortunately is not built for truly peer-to-peer apps. Maybe ipv6 will help, I don&#x27;t know. My app now has a &quot;centralized&quot; server but it&#x27;s really just a backup that gives some convenience - the app is still totally local but syncs through a single server. You can work on it for weeks offline and then sync up. In the future when p2p is ready, I&#x27;ll be ready for it.')
