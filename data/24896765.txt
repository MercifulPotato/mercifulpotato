Item(by='jjk166', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603723936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894915, text='&gt; Why would being racist make someone an unworthy sinner? Racism is just treating others differently based on their race. It’s not weird or evil. In fact, it’s perfectly normal and even understandable. Humans have probably always separated themselves into groups. Even chimpanzees do it. I think that’s what the trainings try to get at.<p>Chimpanzees murder. Just because primates have been doing something for millions of years doesn&#x27;t make it acceptable. We have the capability to rise above our instincts and make rational decisions about who we want to be.<p>Treating others differently based on their race is fundamentally unethical. You&#x27;re not an irredeemably broken person just because you&#x27;ve done something unethical in the past, but saying &quot;well everyone does it&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s just natural&quot; is just refusing personal responsibility.<p>Maybe some people honestly can&#x27;t accept the idea that they have done something wrong, and would cling to a belief that deep down they knew was wrong if they didn&#x27;t have such an &quot;out&quot; to preserve their view of themselves. They&#x27;ed rather double down on racism than admit they&#x27;ve knowingly treated people incorrectly.<p>For most people though, acknowledging a problem is the first step to solving it. Everyone alive today has spent the vast majority if not the entirety of their lives in a world where the idea of racial superiority has been thoroughly discredited. The emphasis on certain features like skin color over others like hair color in segregating people is an entirely learned behavior. For racism to endure to the degree it does today, enormous numbers of people must have actively chosen to learn this behavior and refused to change. It hardly seems unreasonable to conclude that for many, telling them that something is normal and natural robs them of their imperative to change.')
