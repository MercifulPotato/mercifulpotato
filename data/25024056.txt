Item(by='tuatoru', descendants=None, kids=[25024435], score=None, time=1604823277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25020256, text='Very pretty!  Thanks for showing it.  What I&#x27;m going to say I hope will be taken as constructive, for those who are a bit more OCD about their electronics.<p>Safety: -<p>The mains safety earth (chassis bolt) should only ever have one lug: the mains input earth. Put a separate bolt an inch or so away from the mains safety earth bolt for the chassis connection of the bridge centre ground. (People have killed themselves doing repairs by ignoring this, and having faulty mains wiring.)<p>Fuses on the transformer secondaries are recommended if the transformer is expensive. If the bridge rectifier or an amp output stage fails, it&#x27;ll almost certainly fail short, and the transfomer will heat up until its internal thermal fuse melts -- or if there isn&#x27;t one, until it catches fire.<p>Likewise fuses on the DC rails will help protect the expensive smoothing capacitors from amp failure. (Yes, the TPA3251 has built-in protection - but that might also be damaged by the surge that caused the output stage to fail.)<p>I hope the polyester cap across the transformer secondary is X2 class.<p>Other points:-<p>A snubber across the mains switch will reduce arcing on switch-off and prolong the life of the switch. 10R-50R 3W in series with 100nF, X2 class, will do it. (The wattage rating is a proxy for both voltage rating and surge current rating.)<p>From the scale it looks like the transformer is a 120 or 160VA model. That&#x27;s seriously undersized for an amp module rated at 350W (circa 550 VA with a traditional mains-frequency transformer). Transformer secondary fuses are <i>strongly</i> indicated.<p>OTOH, going up to a 500VA toroidal transformer means you&#x27;d need a soft-start circuit to prevent your house circuit breakers popping on start-up, from the initial transformer saturation inrush current.<p>I&#x27;m amazed you don&#x27;t get RF interference with all that length of unshielded wire on the input side. I just have to leave one inch unshielded to be plagued with EMI - unless I use filters on the input terminals (100R &#x2F; 220pF RC filter).<p>You don&#x27;t have DC blocking on your volume control. I guess none of your sources have any DC offset. If not, changing the volume will be scratchy.<p>References: -<p>1. Bob Cordell, <i>Designing Audio Power Amplifiers</i>.<p>2.
