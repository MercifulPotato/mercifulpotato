It&#x27;s possible they have other peering arrangements in place they&#x27;re not advertising to. Or maybe they&#x27;re single homed. They also only have a single IPv4 &#x2F;24 from ARIN. No IPv6. Not terribly robust or impressive.<p>I&#x27;ve never used Gab or looked at their infrastructure before. A quick look shows they&#x27;re behind Cloudflare. No clue where they&#x27;re actually hosted or what the infra looks like but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they just snatched up this &#x2F;24 &quot;because they could&quot; and are just sitting on it.<p>I doubt this is where their backend actually is. Single homed isn&#x27;t a great idea in the first place and if HE pulls the plug they&#x27;re lights out until they can get new peering arrangements in place - which usually isn&#x27;t a quick process in the best of times.')
