It was played on my school in Munich, Germany.<p>The rules were: if you look through the loop, you are punched in the upper arm. The puncher has to draw a bull&#x27;s eye first, then punch, then the recipient must say &quot;thank you&quot; and the puncher must reply &quot;you&#x27;re welcome&quot; (of course in German, i.e. bitte, danke). Any deviation from the rules is punished by a punch, to be administered in accordance with aforementioned ceremony.<p>Where did you grow up?')
