This is so obstinate it doesn&#x27;t even seem genuine to me.<p>At the risk of feeding the trolls -- I grew up in the midwest. I can tell you that I both experienced racism myself and saw a lot of it in my high school both in students and from my classmate&#x27;s parents. Of course everyone isn&#x27;t racist, and most folks are friendly and accepting. But comments like this downplay the experience that many people in these places <i>do</i> have. In my experience, it takes a relatively small number of racist people and a whole bunch of folks who don&#x27;t call that shit out to make it less comfortable for someone who isn&#x27;t white in their day to day lives.')
