Yes, you certainly learned more things, but whether those things will be useful to you, particularly, is unclear and only time can tell.<p>If you and your parents, however, have a thorough discussion about what allowed them to lead a happy life, as in the second scenario, both pushing and pulling, trying to discover what it really was and looking to find consensus regarding attitudes, processes, ideas, roadblocks, etc, you might learn a framework what will be useful forever, regardless of the concrete circumstances you are faced with.<p>Nevertheless, this comment of yours is spot on:<p>&gt; people who succeed rarely have much luck identifying which selection of choices got them there.<p>Therefore, I really emphasize that not only the mentor should share the reasons and methods behind their success, the listener must be able to understand why and whether they were as useful as the mentor portrays them.')
