I have been to Wuppertal about 5 years ago, and it&#x27;s ... well, not beautiful. Great people, though! \n2) The appetite for engineering, for creating things, and the audacity of the late 19th century, early 20th century. A freaking flying train for a city of less than half a million of people. Contrast this to the changes over the past two decades in my hometown, which is about the same size as Wuppertal. The changes were marginal; a cancelled train route is what pops to mind.')
