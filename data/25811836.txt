They should be broken up, Apple, Google, Facebook, Oracle, Etc. All the major companies in all the major sectors of the economy collude with one another. I remember when the secret Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Oracle collusion came out. On Hacker News people from the fast food industry stated that they engaged in the same practices between McDonalds&#x2F;Burger King&#x2F;Wendy&#x27;s etc. So even the lowest rung of labor in the U.S. has the same collusion and illegal practices.')
