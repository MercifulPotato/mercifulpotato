I think I was watching it all on ABCs World News Now. I forget the order, but stuff rolled in with some primitive island that was like the first to get the dawn, then in rolled over to Samoa and Guam, and things were looking great, no issues. But I figured maybe they didn&#x27;t have too much reliance on computer equipment and networks etc, I&#x27;ll wait for the big one with Japan and see how they do. Then when they hit Japan and reported from Tokyo and all was fine, I was like &quot;man this was bunk, I&#x27;m going to bed&quot;. It was so underwhelming and I remember worrying somewhat about the end of the world lights out scenarios. Dang fake news man come to think of it.')
