And good luck if you tried to order to a non-standard location (like a college campus building).<p>Ordering from the website removed all these issues, plus you could pay with a credit card beforehand so no cash transactions required. This combined with<p>&gt; Keeping it around long enough and word gets out that Domino&#x27;s is good again, which means more sales and growth.<p>and the ubiquity of Domino&#x27;s locations made it the default option in many cases. It was good enough that it wasn&#x27;t worth it to see if the local pizza place was better.')
