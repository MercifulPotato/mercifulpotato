Item(by='selfhoster11', descendants=None, kids=[24729299], score=None, time=1602237186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24728230, text='That won&#x27;t be possible unless full-brain emulation with live data sync gets invented.<p>Knowledge workers are all about the knowledge that they build up over time when working with a particular environment (be it an industry, a system, or a person&#x2F;group of people). That knowledge is non-deterministically synthesised in the brain based on the experiences of that person, and being non-deterministic, no AI will come to the same conclusions about every item as this particular human would.<p>In that case, an emulated personality that is meant to make themselves available as your replacement will be an impostor. One that is less of an expert than yourself at best, and at worst one that is misinformed or misled on various issues (which in turn causes other people to be misled or misinformed).')
