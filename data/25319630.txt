Perhaps you can ding them for inconsistency....<p>I don&#x27;t know of any religions which <i>require</i> adherents to own slaves, so it is not inconsistent for a fundamentalist to not own any.  (In particular, Christians are commanded to obey the laws of their country[0], in general, so owning slaves would be inconsistent).<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know why you think churchgoers would have a problem with disabled people.  Jesus healed the sick, and didn&#x27;t stone anyone.  Perhaps you&#x27;re thinking of the story of the woman caught in adultery, whom Jesus saved from being stoned.[1]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=1+Peter+2%3A13-14&amp;version=ESV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=1+Peter+2%3A13-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=John+8%3A1-11&amp;version=ESV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=John+8%3A1-11&amp;v...</a>')
