Also have you heard of Lehman Brothers?  Hell, just watching Cramer get upset is enough for me to realize the rich aren&#x27;t happy with what&#x27;s happening.  It seems pretty obvious they&#x27;re worried.  Why else would they pay for ads claiming to have closed a position for which they supposedly no longer have an investment stake?<p>&gt; And my point is that the losing side of this is inevitably going to be the majority of people long $GME.<p>I said the same thing about TSLA way back when.  So did David Einhorn.  I still believe TSLA is more than 10x overvalued, and people continue to get rich despite my &quot;rational&quot; obstinance.<p>Also you&#x27;re completely missing the point.  Do you not even understand most of these people aren&#x27;t trying to make money?  If you don&#x27;t understand that, then you don&#x27;t even have a basis to start the conversation.')
