If you went for the 1241v3 you lost the iGPU and 4 watts of power usage but gain +100mhz base clock.<p>And that gen of CPUS had low power T-series chips rated at 65w where today it&#x27;s 35w. The power drop is part of why I&#x27;m happy with my SFF setup as the thermals are quite good on 14nm locked CPUs like my 7700.')
