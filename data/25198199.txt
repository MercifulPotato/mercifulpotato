Item(by='jwalton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606224278, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197322, text='&gt; mostly thanks to the big online marketplaces.<p>I see you&#x27;ve never tried to shop online outside of the US.<p>Let&#x27;s take an example; my daughter has an Easy Bake Oven - it&#x27;s a little plastic oven with essentially a 100W heater inside, with a little tiny baking tray about the size of your cell phone.  There&#x27;s an optional &quot;cupcake tray&quot;, which is again a tiny metal pan about the size of your phone, only Walmart up here in Canada sells the oven, but doesn&#x27;t sell the cupcake pan.<p>Amazon.ca today has a cupcake pan for $52 [0] which a) is lower than I&#x27;ve seen it on Amazon.ca before and b) this isn&#x27;t even the &quot;real&quot; one from the manufacturer, it&#x27;s an after-market knock off.  There&#x27;s another one listed for $89.  It&#x27;s actually cheaper for me to buy the cupcake tray from Amazon.com [1] even with the $9 shipping and the currency conversion, and I get the cupcake tray and a second regular tray and a bunch of cupcake liners.<p>This is not the most egregious example I&#x27;ve seen by a long ways.  I assume a lot of this isn&#x27;t actually malice but instead robots trying to sell products and setting prices that are just clearly insane.  I&#x27;ve seen products with 1000% markup over MSRP before, and sometimes it&#x27;s stuff that&#x27;s easy to buy locally.  There&#x27;s just a lot fewer sellers on amazon.ca, so it&#x27;s easier for a robot to climb it&#x27;s price to infinity with no competition.<p>(And that&#x27;s not to say <i>everything</i> is like this in Canada - most common stuff is priced reasonably.  But if you want something a little out of the ordinary or sometimes if the &quot;main&quot; seller of something goes out of stock, suddenly it costs you a kidney to get a kid&#x27;s basketball hoop.)<p>[0](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Replacement-Cupcake-Muffin-Easy-Bake-Ultimate&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00RY499SY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;Replacement-Cupcake-Muffin-Easy-Bake-U...</a>)\n[1](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Easy-Bake-Ultimate-Replacement-Cupcake-Liners&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00O1FGND8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Easy-Bake-Ultimate-Replacement-Cupcak...</a>)')
