I agree with the fact that it can be used like that in the English language, but I disagree with the idea behind it.<p>In the pothole analogy - it&#x27;s like saying potholes are the reason for all these people&#x27;s cars being damaged.<p>If no cars were driving over the pothole then the pothole wouldn&#x27;t be a problem as no damage would ever be caused! It&#x27;s an inanimate f----- object. It&#x27;s just <i>there</i>.<p>It&#x27;s the fact that <i>people are driving cars on a road that has potholes</i> that causes their cars to be damaged. It&#x27;s some action that was taken that causes an effect to occur.<p>Then we get into the murky world of who is actually responsible and what is the solution. Which I don&#x27;t have an answer for.')
