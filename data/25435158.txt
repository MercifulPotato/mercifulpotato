In particular, can a large group of citizens affect who holds power within the EU and vote out those individuals they don&#x27;t want, so any individual office holder has some degree of personal accountability to the electorate?<p>In theory, yes. But it would take a <i>huge</i> group of people. Which is practically impossible these days.<p>So you are right, there is a serious deficit of democracy, not only in the EU, but everywhere imo.')
