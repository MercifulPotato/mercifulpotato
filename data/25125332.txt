The entire system power of the M1 mini under load was 28W.<p>This is a very misleading statement. They primarily only used the 5950X in single-core tests, and in those tests it doesn&#x27;t come remotely close to 105W. In fact per Anandtech&#x27;s own results[1] the 5950X CPU core in a single-core load draws around 20w.<p>Take the M1&#x27;s 28W under a multi-threaded load, that&#x27;s going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4-5w&#x2F;core for the big cores probably (single-core was ~10w total, ~6w &quot;active&quot; - figure clocks drop a bit on the multi loads, and then the little cores are almost certainly much less power draw particularly since they are also much, much slower). In multithreaded loads the per-core power draw on a 5950x is around 6w. That&#x27;s a _much_ closer delta than the &quot;105W TDP vs. ~28W!&quot; would suggest.<p>M1&#x27;s definitely got the efficiency lead, but it&#x27;s also a bit slower and power scales non-linearly. It&#x27;s an interesting head-to-head, but that 105W TDP number of the 5950X is fairly irrelevant in these tests. That&#x27;s not really playing a role. Just like it&#x27;s about as irrelevant as you can get that the 5950X is 4x the big CPU cores, since it was again primarily used in the single-threaded comparisons. Slap 16 of those firestorm cores into a Mac Pro and bam you&#x27;re at 60w. Let it run at 3.2ghz all-core instead of the 3ghz it appears to now since you&#x27;ve got a big tower cooler and that&#x27;s 100w (6w&#x2F;core @ 3.2ghz per the anandtech estimates * 16). That&#x27;d be the actual multi-threaded comparison vs. the 5950X if you want to talk about 105W TDP numbers.<p>Critically though the M1 is definitely not a 10W chip as many people were claiming just a few days ago. You&#x27;re definitely going to see differences between the Air &amp; 13&quot; MBP as a result.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16214&#x2F;amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested&#x2F;8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16214&#x2F;amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-di...</a>')
