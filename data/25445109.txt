At its max supply, each bitcoin would be worth well over 10 million USD (in today&#x27;s value of USD). And it would keep increasing in &quot;value&quot; because of its deflation scheme (unless of course conscencius vote for upping the supply limit for whatever reason)<p>So, we have a fiat currency on one side, manipulated by (at best) incompetent politicians, suffering inflation in the near term with all the stimulus we absurdly accept, a growing global debt, without a solution to repay in the horizon. And on the other side, a sane monetary policy system backed by a very solid network (all those farms + battle tested software).<p>In a 5+ years, these comments will look funny when people will argue that a 100k bitcoin is overvalued.')
