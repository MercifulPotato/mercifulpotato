If one enters into an contract using an e-mail, then DKIM can be used as a proof to the court of law that the contract was accepted by both sides.<p>It would make a good TV drama plot, but courts don&#x27;t work this way in real life. If that were the case, courts wouldn&#x27;t be able to enforce contracts with wet signatures (which are straightforward to forge), or verbal contracts (which are valid contracts and regularly enforced).<p>In practice, you don&#x27;t need to check DKIM in order to use an email as evidence of a contract, because the courts would more likely just use the many other threats and tools at their disposal to ensure that the email is not fabricated.<p>This is why, even though most contracts are <i>not</i> executed in a cryptographically secure manner, most contract disputes that land before the courts hinge on matters like breach of contract (&quot;we agree on the original terms, but disagree on whether our actions upheld them&quot;) or disputes over the intended vs. actual meaning of the contract (&quot;we agree on the text we both signed to, but disagree on the correct interpretation of that text&quot;).<p>Disputes over whether the text of the executed contract is authentic are rare in real life.')
