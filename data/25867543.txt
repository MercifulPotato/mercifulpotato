It&#x27;s not as if Big Tech getting in on the act is a unique or original move.

If their services aren&#x27;t all that and competitors can readily step in to provide a similar value to society, as various comments here have already suggested, then this strategy by Google is doomed to fail and will also leave them in a considerably weaker position when it comes to playing poker over other regulation in the future.')
