It is a reflection of the failure on the part of software engineers, product managers and standards bodies.<p>Your personal assertion makes no sense. This is a purely technical problem, not a project management one. If you need to load a page and load a script and load data, and each load takes you around 100ms, then you don&#x27;t change any of that with project management changes.<p>Technical problems are addressed with technical solutions, and this article shows you one: prerender the content on the server-side to avoid having to wait for data fetches to get the initial page load to finish.<p>&gt; We are using a document markup language to create interactive UIs.<p>Your remark makes absolutely no sense and has no bearing with either the problem domain or the discussion. The markup side of things is not a problem. Parsing and rendering HTML is not a problem. HTML does not even feature in this discussion at all.<p>Please bear in mind that you are posting comments on a discussion on, to put it clearly to you, procedurally generated websites. This is about a server-side rendering technique for React applications. In case you are unaware, React is a javascript frameworks that is used to generate and manage the DOM. The &quot;markup language&quot; side of things barely even registers as  boilerplate to specify the entry point. It&#x27;s the javascript script that you run after the HTML is loaded that assembles the document tree.<p>&gt; You&#x27;d think that people would recognize that the web was not meant for what it is used today<p>Your comment makes zero sense, and reads like a non-sequitur rant.')
