Left-pad is a 2015 problem. In 2020 we already have padStart in every evergreen browser and in Node.js, and it&#x27;s been there for years.<p>The reason the JS library is slimmer than Pythons is because it&#x27;s mostly a client-side language. It doesn&#x27;t have to handle Unix filesystems, web crawling or even security, because the client-side is not really the place for it, so comparing Python to JS is not really useful, because Python is mostly used in the server-side, and most server-side JS projects already use very few dependencies.<p>Most of the complex things like URL Requests and HTML parsing are handled by the browser or the DOM.<p>And it&#x27;s the client-side projects that are bloated and using hundreds (if not thousands) of dependencies. But those dependencies are not there because the language is lacking. They&#x27;re there because popular packages like Babel, Webpack, ESLint and others chose to use NPM modules to organize themselves, instead of using function and classes like everything else.')
