But another is just flat out poor urban planning in the U.S. Walking and bicycling should be more viable forms of transportation. But there are only a small handful of cities (arguably just one) where that&#x27;s currently feasible in the U.S. It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous that we&#x27;ve spent the past 100 years designing our cities around the least efficient, least pleasant, most dangerous form of transportation in existence. Like you, self-driving and electric cars don&#x27;t interest me a whole lotâ€”I feel like they&#x27;re largely missing the point.')
