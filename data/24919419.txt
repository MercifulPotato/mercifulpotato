Almost no standard library but it does use namespaces. (almost) no templates. Lots of pointers and arrays. Lots of explicit begin&#x2F;end or push&#x2F;pop functions instead of more idiomatic solutions like RAII&#x2F;scope guards etc. va_ macros instead of variadic templates or fold expressions.<p>Also while ImGUI is great and the guy follows good coding practices - it&#x27;s not at all what I would recommend for learning C++. Not only is it technically not C++, but the problem it solves (GUI-Framework and immediate on top) leads to some pretty hard to follow code with a lot of hidden global state.')
