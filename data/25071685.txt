Keep reading how the compiler allows static type checking and superior tree-shaking at build time but I&#x27;m just not seeing any sort of fruition after years of promises.<p>Every ngconf there&#x27;s talk of the magical 2kb hello-world and bundle improvements with every major, yet the only bundles getting reductions are the hello-worlds and monster projects.<p>It seems we&#x27;re in the medium bundle category and it&#x27;s just disappointing that every version our bundle size hasn&#x27;t moved or increased slightly.<p>We&#x27;re currently at 2mb main&#x2F;vendor after spending A LOT of time optimising and making everything lazy and then a team of 1 at our sister company release a Next.JS&#x2F;React app with a main bundle about 1.3mb than ours using zero effort.<p>There&#x27;s never anything obvious when it comes to analysing the bundle and it seems we&#x27;re using everything we need: Angular, Material, RxJS, ApolloClient. Most of our forms use Formly (huge savings from repeated HTML)<p>All of our competitors are running React and have bundles about 1mb smaller than ours.<p>Every year I install the VSC Language Service plugin and have to disable it the same day due to it continuously crashing and killing the editor so it seems we&#x27;ll never get to benefit from that.<p>Then I see a continuous stream of core developers leaving the Angular project due to toxic behaviour from Igor and it feels hopeless and depressing.<p>The one saving grace is that the entire ecosystem is written in TypeScript and it&#x27;s nice seeing everything typed to perfection.')
