I&#x27;ve used the most popular packages (dj-rest-auth, which uses simple-jwt for JWT under the hood) and I&#x27;ve had to tweak way more than I would like to make it all work. I&#x27;ve been shocked to learn that this is not a solved problem in one of the world&#x27;s most popular web frameworks, and I&#x27;d definitely consider using external auth in future projects.<p>The Firebase experience on the other hand has been outstanding. The front-end SDK is great and so is the documentation. I had to implement SAML SSO for a massive corporate customer using Microsoft AD and was able pull it off in an afternoon without a hitch. The ability to add custom claims and the like is also great - the whole thing feels really feature-complete. But then there&#x27;s the fact that I don&#x27;t trust Google with my user data and that I fear that at any time they could start charging onerous amounts for the service, or worse.<p>In both cases, the most painful bit however has been by far implementing the React front-end. Wiring the views, Redux async actions, etc. That&#x27;s the part I wish I could get rid of. I see you provide some sort of front-end, but if you provided some sort of adjacent, standalone React library offering views and auth state management out of the box you&#x27;d surely get my attention - I&#x27;d possibly consider contributing code to it, too.<p>Overall I think the whole idea sounds great and you may be on to something: in summary, I feel that Google can&#x27;t be trusted, Auth0 looks eye-watering expensive, Keycloak looks a bit complicated for certain projects, and popular web frameworks like Django may not be as good at token auth as we would take for granted.<p>I must be honest in that I wouldn&#x27;t put your tech into production right now because I&#x27;m never a tech early-adopter, but I&#x27;ll keep an eye on it, I&#x27;ll seriously consider it for personal projects, and if it gets decent momentum in a few months I&#x27;ll definitely consider extending it to client projects.<p>Congratulations for launching - I really, really wish you the best of luck.')
