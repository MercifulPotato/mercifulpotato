You need to get to the point where you&#x27;re not focused on your footwork in order to be able to focus on the arms&#x2F;leading.<p>Also, find a place where the partners swap &#x2F; dance around, ideally during the lessons as well, you&#x27;ll learn more and won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re boring everyone.  You&#x27;ll also recognize more people and possibly be more willing to ask people to dance.<p>I did much better when sticking to one style, getting it down, then starting the next.   I found that mixing them just got them muddled.<p>I also found I greatly preferred swing, both the music (former sax&#x2F;clarinet player) and the crowds.  Swing dancers seemed more focused on having fun and generally less snobby.<p>As for leading, I improved greatly when I:\n1: found a few partners who could back lead to show me what I was doing wrong.  Its generally poor technique, but it greatly helps with getting the strong connection needed to telegraph the moves.\n2: Understood the connections and flow enough to vary the patterns on my own.<p>It&#x27;s a great way to make up for all the time stuck sitting a computer.')
