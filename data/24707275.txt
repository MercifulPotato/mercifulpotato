Wipe your SSDs and storage buckets? Remove your DNS records? Should it be permanent? If not then they&#x27;re just subsidizing the costs. If it&#x27;s soft-limit then its just a warning, and if you just want a warning then billing alarms already exist in every cloud.<p>You know. When I hit the storage limit of my SSD it doesn&#x27;t wipe my data. It just ceases to store more data. When I rent a server for a fixed price and my service is under a DDOS attack then it will simply cease to work for the duration of the attack. If there is a variable service like lamba that charges per execution then lambda can simply cease to run my jobs.<p>You can neatly separate time based and usage based charges and set a limit for them separately. It doesn&#x27;t even need to be a monetary limit, it could be a resource based limit. Every service would be limited to 0GB storage, 0GB RAM, 0 nodes, 0 queries, 0 api calls by default and you set the limit to whatever you want. AWS or Google Cloud could then calculate the maximum possible bill for the limits you have chosen. People will can then set their limits so that a surprise bill won&#x27;t be significantly above their usual bill.<p>Your comment is lazy and not very creative. You&#x27;re just throwing your hands up and pretending there is no other way even though cloud providers have created this situation for their own benefit.')
