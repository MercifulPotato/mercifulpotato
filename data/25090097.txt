But much of the stuff <i>on</i> the computer, whether software or content, you don&#x27;t own. The OS belongs to Apple. The apps belong to ISVs and the books, games, movies, and music you download or stream belong to the publishers of those things. So you really have no right to any more functionality in the device than is advertised and provided; and not only that, but the various rightsholders are entitled to the protection of their rights.<p>To the creative class, there are few evils greater than piracy, and to allow for devices that can perform arbitrary computation without restrictions that protect their interests is to give free rein to Satan himself. Such devices are to authors, as the saying goes, like the Boston Strangler is to the woman home alone. And most end users don&#x27;t care how locked down or DRM&#x27;d their devices are. So this is the new reality.<p>In fact, it is not preposterous to imagine a world in which general-purpose computers are flat out ruled illegal by a court. The only thing that saved the VCR in the Betamax case was the fact that it could be used for time-shifting which, under <i>very limited</i> circumstances, could be considered fair use. A court may decide that in an environment where most users&#x27; computing needs are met by locked-down devices, those who sell devices that are not locked down are committing contributory infringement.')
