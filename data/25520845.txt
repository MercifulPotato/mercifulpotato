I looked up a howto a few weeks ago, and my recommendations are still 25% Fortnite related content, even though I only watched one video one time.<p>It&#x27;s been happening for years. I looked up one old Norm Macdonald standup bit, and my recos changed immediately to Joe Rogan and adjacent talking heads. I watch one MKBHD video, and I&#x27;m overwhelmed with recos for unboxing and tech reviews.<p>The stuff I genuinely care about, music theory, is impossible to keep in my home page because YouTube doesn&#x27;t value that engagement.')
