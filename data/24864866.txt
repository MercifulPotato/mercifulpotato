These are the more important factors, not IPR considerations.<p>Fortunately, we landed on a good compromise with a textual language that maps closely onto SPIR-V semantics. A lot of the hard work remaining is to achieve the level of safety and interoperability required for the web. Even in an approach of using SPIR-V as the syntax, a similar level of effort would have been required on safety and interop aspects.')
