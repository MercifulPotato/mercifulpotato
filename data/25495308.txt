We get to see geology in action, a short time scale ice&#x2F;glacier action on land and sea floor.  I find the kinetics of what would happen fascinating.  “Some” of the local penguins will undoubtedly perish, yes.   But I dont think anyone is predicting this to be an extinction event for them, i think the overall danger to them is overblown.  Not saying its not bad, but we have “rational” people here suggesting unleashing nuclear weapons to save a fraction of a small animal population....?<p>I see this as nature in action.  Our environment is constantly in flux.  Yes, this was indirectly caused by human activities, but we would get to witness first hand how this changes the environment.  And maybe some good would come of it.')
