I came up with analyses pieced together from the publicly reported information and think that piece is a little disturbing.<p>Sure, you can come up with some standard numbers in an hour. But it wouldn&#x27;t be the most thoughtful analysis, and the decision isn&#x27;t really about a single efficacy estimate anyway.<p>I guess I figure if you&#x27;re going to go down this route of pissing matches over how fast you can do an analysis on how big of a dataset, why the hell even have an FDA anyway? Just require the company post all their information and get rid of the regulation entirely. I actually think this isn&#x27;t an unreasonable argument, even if I don&#x27;t necessarily agree or disagree with it. It certainly seems more reasonable to me than &quot;we should have a regulator that just rubber stamps things.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m fine with the FDA taking their time. The problem with risk in decisions is people forget in high stakes high risk decision making, it&#x27;s about the process. This whole discussion about the FDA taking too long will look a lot different if a year from now the vaccine turns out to have some horrible long term effects (which it could, even though I think it&#x27;s unlikely, just, you know, &#x27;cause).')
