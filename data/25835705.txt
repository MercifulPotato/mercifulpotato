So, that&#x27;s why he needs to offer convincing evidence. It sounds like he offers none (I haven&#x27;t read it, just relying on the summary above). &quot;Pulsing&quot; is not exactly a new idea in radio technology, is it? There&#x27;s only like a century or more of radio systems that do that. As for modulation, does he know what the M in FM radio stands for? The claim that these are new innovations that &quot;biological scientists can&#x27;t keep up&quot; is just obviously false on its face so what is he talking about?<p>If you plot rates of cancer on a chart you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s actually stable or declining for decades:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;progressreport.cancer.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;din1.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;progressreport.cancer.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;graphs...</a><p>Even as ever newer mobile protocols were rolled out (and really they&#x27;re more like protocol upgrades than changes to the basic physics), cancer rates were stable for women and declining for men. If mobile tech caused cancers then we&#x27;d see it in the statistics by now, there&#x27;s been plenty of time. We don&#x27;t.<p>BTW this guy is an epidemiologist, and I&#x27;ve been ranting for the past 8 months on HN that these guys <i>definitely</i> have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about. The standards in this field are just ludicrously low, so I&#x27;m not surprised at all to discover one of them thinks 5G causes cancer :(')
