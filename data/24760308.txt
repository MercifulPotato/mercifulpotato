So understanding helpful mappings is key.<p>For example, I switched to iTunes when it was first released on Windows mainly because of the “artist | album | song” as a row of lists interface.  It wasn’t a new interface: Smalltalk used something like it for code, and OSX had it as a display option for file browsing before then too I think.  But it was such a big improvement over Winamp for quickly finding the album or song I wanted to hear.  IIRC Winamp at the time was a direct map over folders, and they were just vertical trees.  When I switched, I had to do a bunch of tagging, but it was still worth it.  If iTunes had used a gmail-like “tag and search” interface, I don’t think it would have been as compelling.  I’m still waiting for something like it in Windows Explorer.')
