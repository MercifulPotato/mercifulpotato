Over the course of a month it is normal to visit hundreds of sites (I have counted for auditing a job), sometimes over a thousand.  That&#x27;s without giving it any thought, just following links and reading linked content.<p>(Heck, when reading HN I sometimes read more than 33 HN stories in a single sitting, but to be fair I don&#x27;t often follow the links to the articles themselves ;-)<p>If I had to monitor my usage to keep it down to 33 sites in a month, I could do that but it would be a very different reading experience than I currently have.<p>Like back in the days when we had to pay per minute of online access (outside the US, using audio modems).  The change to a single monthly subscription with the freedom to read as much as you want, as long as you want, was liberating and transformative.  It would be a little sad to go back to having to self-police reading in order to keep costs down.')
