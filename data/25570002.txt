Technically ipv6 is designed to solve a real problem. Except the people who are charged with using&#x2F;delivering service with  IP addresses hate it with a passion.<p>The majority of network folks I have interacted with joke about it.<p>IPv6 is a terrible solution because ipv4 is so much easier for people to write down, remember, and actually use.<p>An ipv6 address is more like a MAC address in that it exists and it’s supposed to be unique but no one is reciting their MAC address every day.<p>Phone numbers, mailing addresses, and email addresses are all memorable. IPv6 is not and will not succeed as a result.<p>Yes, I’m acutely aware it’s being forced on the industry because ipv4 is running out and there is no other option. However, the price of ipv4 blocks shows how badly people don’t want to switch to this miserable standard.')
