In three years of immersing myself in my passion (pentesting&#x2F;vuln research), I&#x27;ve tripled my income and vastly improved my quality of life. A lot of it was just going after my area of interest vs listening to other people tell me what I &quot;need&quot; to do before I go there.<p>Again, probably not the route if you aren&#x27;t interested in it though... Not saying you need to wake up, hack, sleep, repeat, but you probably won&#x27;t be able to &quot;tough it out for a paycheck&quot;... There needs to be a substantial level of passion&#x2F;interest in the subject for it to work. IMO, that&#x27;s where it goes wrong for a lot of people.
