We could implement network stacks, sound and video processing, etc... It can start a TLS handshake as soon as the electrical signal hits the ethernet port, while the CPU is not even aware of it happening. It can timestamp MIDI input down to the microsecond and replay with the same precision. It can process position data from a VR headset at the very last moment in the graphics pipeline. Maybe even do something like a software defined radio.<p>Basically every simple but latency-critical operations. Of course, embedded&#x2F;realtime systems are a prime target.')
