The results are NOT close, unless you think &quot;Yes that&#x27;s a white male&quot; is close. The hair color was wrong, but that could have been due to using a picture of Pitt where his hair is dyed blond but his black roots or showing, or just due to shadow.<p>I guess they have many hundreds or thousands of images pre-generated, and when you upload a photo, they find the closest ones.')
