De-platforming the alleged figurehead is just going to make the problem worse. Big tech is playing a really risky game, and I&#x27;m not alone in that opinion. It is a popular opinion that Trump &quot;incited&quot; the siege, but I must respectfully disagree. Most people realize there is a deeper cause, and humbly believe that using Trump as a scapegoat is a short-term bandaid and will only allow the wound to continue to fester.<p>I hate to say it, but I think that big tech feels responsible for radicalizing folks, and Trump is the <i>perfect</i> scapegoat. Is it really crazy to believe that tech wants to continue using their algorithms (known to cause radicalization) and are using Trump as a scapegoat?')
