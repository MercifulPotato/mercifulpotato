Sure, multiple users can do a git push but don&#x27;t neglect that git is also offering a higher level abstraction, basically a storage system. That&#x27;s no different from running any other storage system, like a filesystem, except you name it differently.<p>There are also other hacks to go around it but none of them is a simple solution abstracting away the complexity. Not a clean filesystem that a novice developer could start using without messing it up. They all greatly increase mental complexity.')
