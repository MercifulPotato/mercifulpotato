He had to quickly scramble to take his testing materials outside and used his cell phone to access the exam.<p>It worked out for him but easily could have been a disaster. We live at the edge of the school boundary and it was a localized outage due to a car hitting a pole, so he was the only student in his class that was affected. Good luck convincing the teacher if you don&#x27;t have alternate access to  the test.')
