Recently an Australian COVID-19 vaccine candidate trial was halted due to participants developing antibodies to proteins in the vaccine that were taken from HIV genome, causing false-positive on a HIV test. [1] Such false-positives could easily be co-opted by anti-vaxxers especially in light of the the famous Soviet Union disinformation campaign &quot;Operation INFEKTION&quot; [2] that falsely suggested the HIV&#x2F;AIDS is a man-made virus created by the United States to cause genocide of Africans. In rural Pakistan, health workers have been killed by villages who see the polio vaccine as a Western conspiracy to sterilize Muslims.<p>Global mandatory inoculations using a safe and effective HIV vaccine that causes false-positive results on HIV antibody tests would be a field day for anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists everywhere.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;australia-covid-19-vaccine-false-positive-hiv-tests.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;australia-covid-19-vaccine-false...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_INFEKTION" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Operation_INFEKTION</a>')
