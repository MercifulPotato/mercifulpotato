Item(by='patio11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602188059, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723149, text='A quirk of Silicon Valley culture is that senior employees on the inside of it tend to be rather sophisticated about how they think about equity, and they also tend to be rather reticent about talking about that externally, because of factors such as legal and PR risk.<p>This is immensely frustrating to me, because thinking lucidly about equity is incredibly important for career planning for engineers who are startup-adjacent, work at AppAmaGooBookSoft, or who are in markets where those firms&#x27; offers set market terms. I think this sets us up for a continuance of the class system, where people who talked about this subject around the dinner table or have a frat brother who was in Google in 2004 know the score, and people who grew up in Chicago and didn&#x27;t know what Google was in 2003 do not, even when they&#x27;re evaluating career options which are heavily dependent on correctly valuing equity.<p>I did not always think lucidly about equity, and overly trusted the representations of folks on Internet watering holes who said that equity was likely to be nearly worthless. I would like to think I&#x27;ve learned a bit over the years.<p>I apologize for being indirect here; feel free to ask me about equity in some place where it will not be reasonably read as a comment on a firm I owe various duties to.
