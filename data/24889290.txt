This was a great success, there were studies that pointed at a marked decrease in suicides among people in same-sex relationship over time.<p>And while it&#x27;s progress for psychology itself, and good for society, it&#x27;s certainly not an achievement. People were killing themselves and being institutionalized because psychologists were calling them insane, and this stopped happening when psychology chose to stop calling them insane. I can&#x27;t claim an important discovery in abuse prevention if I choose to stop abusing someone.')
