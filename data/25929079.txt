Reddit and 4Chan?<p>I use Facebook, everyone (that&#x27;s people I know in person) is extremely nice to me on there, never got any contempt at all. We share pictures and funny memes and plan events on there. I used Facebook to reconnect with a childhood friend who I lost touch with and now we talk all the time.
