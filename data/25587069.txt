I&#x27;ve had Javascript disabled by default for a couple of years now. I love it. I&#x27;m a technical person. I can handle (and have the patience for) fidgeting with settings to get sites to work.<p>My non-technical friends and family can&#x27;t do that. Trying to impose that upon them would just frustrate them (and, for my family, increase tech support calls to me).<p>All my banking and insurance sites are useless w&#x2F;o Javascript. Squarespace sites, Twitter, Imgur, don&#x27;t work worth a damn without Javascript. I just gave up and mostly gave Google properties a pass to get Youtube to work. (I don&#x27;t use Gmail so I have no idea how bad it would be.)<p>A site better be pretty damned compelling before it rises to the level of getting opened in an unconstrained browser setting. I just end up not opening a lot of stuff (or just closing it again when it lights-up &quot;NoScript&quot;).')
