You run it as a command-line tool and it will fail the build if the types do not resolve, like a compiler or linting tool.<p>For runtime-checking based on PEP484 type hints, one can complement this with a library like Pydantic&#x2F;Enforce.py&#x2F;typeguard&#x2F;typesentry.\nEnforcement of the types is typically opt-in per function call, often by adding a decorator.')
