(Which is barely at all. But still.)<p>As for 2024 - it is <i>obvious</i> now that the only way the GOP can win another election is by dismantling democracy.<p>There is no chance whatsoever that the GOP can win again without wilfully disenfranchising tens of millions of voters. In spite of the bot mob on Twitter trying to create the impression there&#x27;s some kind of enraged far right majority agitating for representation, the reality is the numbers just aren&#x27;t there for a clean win.<p>So that is what is happening now. 2020 is the last chance for the far right, and they know that - which is why they intend to take the shot well before 2024.')
