And if you look at the overall concept, it does <i>not</i> become meaningless.  To get to meaninglessness <i>requires</i> you separate the two.<p>&quot;Unambiguous&quot; is a much much higher bar that we don&#x27;t need to worry about.  Something can be 5% ambiguous but still very meaningful.<p>&gt; Bringing that back to the original thing this is true of any concept or law, including reviewing some remote apps and not others based on what they are for not that they are remote. I&#x27;m not saying I agree the way Apple regulates these is good I&#x27;m just saying I agree the fact some remote apps are regulated and others aren&#x27;t isn&#x27;t proof alone the regulation is contradictory.<p>It&#x27;s not proof by itself, but if you can show that there&#x27;s no good reason for the distinction then it&#x27;s a strong mark against Apple.')
