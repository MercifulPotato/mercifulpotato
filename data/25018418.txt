So the President (staff? apparently not him) gives a final press conference in the parking lot of a suburban store. It would be like watching the Emperor of Japan surrender in a dinghy because somebody brought the wrong <i>Missouri</i>.<p>Unforced error. Abandonment of dignity. Refusal to acknowledge the situation. Hallmarks of the administration.<p>(News accuracy notice: while it appears to have been an official press conference only Guiliani was actually there and not Trump himself)')
