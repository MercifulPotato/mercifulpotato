The earth rotates really fast!<p>The earth is also orbiting the sun pretty fast, but it&#x27;s my understanding (I&#x27;m not an expert) that you don&#x27;t need to account for error here, since the Orion nebula is so far away. Think about how the sun stays in the same place in the sky even as you&#x27;re driving fast on the highway. The nebula is <i>unimaginably</i> far away compared to the sun, and relative movement between the earth, the solar system, and Orion are all undetectable at these scales.<p>I&#x27;ve read that even the Hubble telescope doesn&#x27;t need to account for parallax error for such far-away objects during long exposures, which can last up to 20 minutes. Maybe someone here on HN can do (or point to) the math for us.')
