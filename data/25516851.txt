If the shoe was too big say it had to have a distance between the toe and the end of the shoe of about one finger width.<p>In reality you should actually try on shoes until one actually fits comfortably.<p>I highly doubt this machine was actually used for finding better-fitting shoes as opposed to being a magical contraption used to give authority to the shoe salesman so he could sell more, more expensive shoes faster and with less work.')
