They talk as if they&#x27;ve invented some new form of computing when they&#x27;re another centralized document SaaS graph database that&#x27;s a step up from notion&#x2F;quip. I think there&#x27;s real value there building a nice interface and they&#x27;re probably better than existing options (features around links, etc.), but there&#x27;s also a ton of bullshit from them that sets off alarms for me. They think they&#x27;re xerox parc, but they&#x27;re more like snapchat.')
