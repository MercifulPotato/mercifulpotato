Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25797346], score=None, time=1610745981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25795209, text='&gt; For all the same reasons you should worry about cows being expensive (even if milk is still cheap), you should worry about real estate being expensive (even if rents are low).<p>I would argue that the only reason you should consider cows being an expensive an issue if milk is cheap is in regard to it making some other bovine product expensive; cows aren’t important in and of themselves,  but as instrumentalities in the production of milk and other products.<p>&gt; In the case of a household, those mean that you can’t take some of your production, and save it for the future in capital goods<p>No, asset inflation absolutely does not mean that. Increasing the minimum buy in for asset investments would do that, but we’ve got mature enough financial markets that a general increase in asset prices doesn’t increase the minimum needed to enter productive investments.<p>&gt; In the case of a central bank, those mean that the injections of money aren’t (currently) effective for stimulating economic activity<p>No, it doesn’t; driving money into productive investments and out of cash (which, as an expected side effect, produces asset price inflation) is part of the mechanism by which loose monetary policy is expected to stimulate economic activity. Asset price inflation does not indicate that that is not working, it is what you expect if it is working.<p>What would indicate that it is not working is if output figures did not exceed what was expected without the policy.')
