Focusing now on the size you will find it&#x27;s large or small, but the color becomes indeterminate. It could be red the next time you look at it.<p>When you take your entangled marble, look at the color and see it&#x27;s red you know the other marble is in the &quot;blue&quot; state (and the entanglement is broken). If someone looks at the color of that marble you know they will find it&#x27;s blue. But if they look at the size before looking at the color it could be large or small (and looking now at the size of your marble will tell you nothing about it) and if they look at the color later it could be red or blue.<p>In the classical case, if there is a large red marble in one envelope and a small blue marble in the other it doesn&#x27;t matter in what order you look at the color and the size. You will always know what the other person found.<p>In the quantum case, if both look at color first they will find complementary colors. If they both look at size first they will find complementary sizes. But the second measurement will be uncorrelated. And if they make the measurements in a different order, everything will be uncorrelated.')
