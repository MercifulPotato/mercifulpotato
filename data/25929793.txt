Once they&#x27;re decimated (ie forced to buy shares at higher prices than they anticipated), I suspect a good deal of novice traders are going to still be holding shares at elevated prices. At that point they&#x27;re basically holding shares worth very little compared to what they likely paid for them.<p>The same hoard trading phenomenon seems to be happening with Blackberry. A number of insiders have already dumped shares, meaning anyone buying those shares isn&#x27;t buying shares from a short seller, they&#x27;re buying from people who recognize the price is outrageous compared to business fundamentals.<p>Bottom line, short sellers are definitely going to suffer, but so are a lot of robbinhood kiddies.')
