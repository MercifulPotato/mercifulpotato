In my humble opinion it is a very limited mindset.<p>I consider myself to be generous person, and also slow to anger. As a result, there are people who think they hit the jackpot and found a submissive pushover who is like a flimsy tree that will bend over at the slightest breath of wind.<p>Of course it&#x27;s much more like being water; moving around obstacles, yet always forward and unstoppable.<p>What matters is showing people that there can be real kindness and strength in the world. Sometimes it plants a seed for others to also have the courage to be kind. I believe that&#x27;s how to make the world a better place. It sure makes life worth living.')
