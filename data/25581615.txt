It&#x27;s not a particularly dangerous road by the standards of the region.<p>The other commenters is right that the name comes from the prisoners who died building it.  Allegedly they were buried in the road.  I say &quot;allegedly&quot; because everyone who&#x27;s ever built a road knows that the road base is key to longevity and that adding things that will decompose to it is the opposite of what you want to do.')
