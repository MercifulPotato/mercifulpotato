I use Perkeep, DayOne, IFTTT, LifeCycle, Exist, Gyroscope, RescueTime, Pinboard, Pocket, OwnTracks, and probably some others I&#x27;ve forgotten to track everything I possibly can and keep it logged.  Why?  Because a) I forget things and it&#x27;s nice to have an external memory, and b) I like to play around with the data and do things like &quot;what&#x27;s the biggest geographical span I&#x27;ve visited per month in a given year?&quot; or &quot;which roads within a 2km radius have I not yet walked down?&quot;<p>Just because <i>you</i> don&#x27;t have a need for a project or understand why other might doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &quot;a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;.')
