If Netflix did the same, I doubt people would have a problem with it.<p>edit: it&#x27;s also purely a matter of opinion, but I got a lot more pure enjoyment from the US version of the Office than the UK one.  They had more time to develop the characters and figure out what was truly funny about the show.  Sure it devolved into sentimental fan service in the last few seasons, but at it&#x27;s peak I was laughing way harder at the American version than I ever did for the British one.')
