Couple of misnomers you might want to clear up:<p>* depending on your area, a PhD may not touch much &quot;technology&quot;, if any at all. There will be a lot of writing, a lot of reading, a lot of math, and a lot of hard conference&#x2F;journal rejections that you put 6+ months into apiece. And that&#x27;s if you can land a fully funded position. You will have to teach, and skimp on niceties and luxuries, and &quot;just barely get by&quot; on a stipend. If you&#x27;re not deeply motivated by the learning and willing to endure a monk-like existence, do <i>not</i> take this path.<p>* if you have a Google offer, especially as an intern conversion, <i>TAKE IT</i>. You will have access to the true cutting edge in technology (certainly way more than 99.9% of academic labs). You will learn rigor, elegance in code, how to critique and take criticism, and how to build truly scalable systems. It is very much like an &quot;industry PhD&quot;...it will change the way you think.<p>* you will still be &quot;young&quot; after a few years at Google, but you will be immensely more technically mature. If you do a startup now and burn out in 2-3 years, that Google interview will be immensely more daunting, and you might not be able to swing it. You&#x27;ll also have a couple of years of RSUs saved up to tide you through the rough startup moments.<p>TL;DR--Google.')
