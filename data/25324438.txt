Most affilates have to reach a minimum and 90% never do.  The small % who do are worth the 20%.<p>You trying to cut them out.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in the sites best interest to offer people like you (cookie killers),a discount.  If the affilates find out and they feel cheated they will move on.<p>Remember the affilate never gives one person at 20% (if they do they never hit their minimum) they give dozen&#x2F;hundreds&#x2F;thousands of customers.')
