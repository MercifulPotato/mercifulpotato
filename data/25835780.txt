If you&#x27;re fine with that, then there&#x27;s no problem. Perhaps OSS has achieved its goal, namely creating a free and open software ecosystem for nerds and by nerds.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a single OSS project used (directly) by a large number of the general public that does not have a company behind it.
