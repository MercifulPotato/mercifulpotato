So perhaps AV folks just couldn&#x27;t imagine getting the hardware budget to complete effectively?<p>It&#x27;s also worthwhile I think to point out that at that time, it wasn&#x27;t settled that &quot;search engines&quot; as we know them today (like Google) were _the_ way to use the Internet. There were alternatives such as Yahoo (curated directory), and browser-side catalogs (netscape.com home page) that were much more popular. So it is possible also that AV folks weren&#x27;t exactly thinking &quot;We have to light the afterburners to go after Google in this immensely important internet search space&quot;. They might have been thinking &quot;odd, someone spent $xxxM on hardware to run a search engine, that&#x27;ll never work out&quot;.')
