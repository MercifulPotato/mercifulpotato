If you demand that certain topics be <i>banned</i> from discussion, you must explain, as a matter of implementation, who gets to decide what is banned.<p>&gt; Do you agree that there are objective facts that should be accepted by the society<p>What, <i>concretely</i>, do you mean by &quot;should be accepted by the society&quot;? To use an extreme but historically common example, does it mean that people should be <i>executed</i> for having different beliefs? You need to be more specific.<p>&gt; If you do not believe such object facts exist<p>I <i>do</i> believe the Earth is round. I <i>do</i> believe it’s a fact. I <i>don’t</i> believe people should be banned (or worse) because they think otherwise.<p>In fact, flat Earth theories are interesting, because they challenge my assumptions and ultimately clarify <i>my</i> understanding of the subject.<p>This is why freedom of speech and the free exchange of ideas is so important: It is the only mechanism by which we can correct our own epistemology and keep it in check, both at the individual and at the societal level!<p>&gt; there must be some mechanism that raises certain statements into the status of &quot;facts&quot;<p>Sure. What does this have to do with censorship, though? The topic of discussion was <i>policy</i>, i.e. what is to be imposed on other people.')
