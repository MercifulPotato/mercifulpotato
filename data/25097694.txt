A $500K McKinsey employee is not an entry level consultant. They are likely leading a large team and working regularly with C-level executives at enterprise businesses. They are going to have presence and gravitas because credibility is a huge part of their job.<p>What kind of business does $200K in revenue per year? It&#x27;s very likely to be a sole proprietorship, maybe 1-2 employees at most.<p>I realize that there may be cultures and subcultures that truly believe the independence of the business owner makes them more respectable (although I personally believe that independence is a bit of an illusion), but I think more people would subconsciously assign a higher status to the first person and that it probably wouldn&#x27;t be close.')
