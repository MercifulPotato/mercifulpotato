Because Lemonade loaded a bit of code that played music and I could figure out how to play notes and durations once the magic code was loaded but not how to do the magic code myself.  It took quite a while and a book on 6502 assembly and my high-school&#x27;s Franklin Apple clones (Franklin had a built in assembler in the ROM) to figure out how to make that speaker beep actually play notes.  My first great hack was finally being able to write a program that played music on the other Bell &amp; Howell Black Apple machines.  Then I got an Amiga and that musical note playing became trivial.  Article seems a bit bogus by not going down to speaker-on&#x2F;speaker-off and delay loops.')
