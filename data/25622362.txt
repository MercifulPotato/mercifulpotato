A quick look at Google would solve my problem quickly but I didnâ€™t bother to do that. I have somehow disabled the location access for the Watch Faces. So while all the other faces shown no problem, Solar Dial NEEDS my exact location to calculate the sunrise and sunset and other related times and therefore could not work properly. Problem solved. Everything now is correct as it should be.')
