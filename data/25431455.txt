Item(by='jsmith45', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608048148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425658, text='Civil Asset Forfeiture stems from older in rem cases, which were intended as a remedy when the owner of some object is unknown, or potentially not subject to the country&#x27;s jurisdiction, and thus prosecuting the owner is not feasible.<p>I&#x27;m fine with use of in rem based seizures in the following cases:<p>1. The object in question is unlawful, or creating a problem, and nobody claims ownership of the object in question. (E.G. police find a stash house full of contraband, and the actual owners don&#x27;t want to claim it for obvious reasons.) Please note that I would allow for in rem to be used when the owner is obvious if said owner claims &quot;not mine&quot;. This of course would not prevent separate prosecution of the obvious person if the state feels they can prove ownership.<p>2. The owner is known (claimed), but is not subject to US jurisdiction, and is unwilling to subject themselves to US jurisdiction. (e.g. somebody from overseas owns a boat to be seized for non-payment of fees, or somebody from overseas is found to be unlawfully flying a drone in the United Sites and the drone is to be seized and auctioned because we cannot do anything to the actual owner.)<p>Notice how neither of these are even remotely like the common scenario in civil asset forfeiture.')
