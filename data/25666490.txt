The idea being that the officials check the signature on the outer envelope, if it&#x27;s valid and non-duplicated they open it and put the now-anonymous envelope with the sealed ballot in the pile of votes to be counted. This is then opened by the vote counter, and this person who has no idea of the origin is the first to see what the contents of it are.')
