I decided to only tweet about updates and new content from my side. And then to find others that work in areas I care about and follow them. Trouble is - nobody else seems to use twitter like that. They post memes, retweet things, share their political opinions, ask questions, get into discussions, and I see all of that when I follow them. It&#x27;s just too noisy, currently haven&#x27;t deleted it but heavily considering the option.')
