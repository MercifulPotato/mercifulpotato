Item(by='Jetrel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610438888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742186, text='As an observation, I think a great deal of this is because of the &quot;depth of features&quot; of things a really good service (like Discord) gets insanely right.  There&#x27;s just this mountain of really important quality-of-life things, or needed features available out of the box.<p>For example, I was scared when I started using discord, because it&#x27;s entirely reasonable to think if I&#x27;m logged in in two places and start a voice chat, surely it&#x27;ll start playing that audio anywhere I&#x27;m logged in, right?   Everything else follows a &quot;you do it on one machine you&#x27;re logged in on, and you do it on all the others as well (such as writing a partial message, and not posting it - the same partial message is right there waiting if you grab a different device).<p>Well, not only do they correctly handle that one use case (audio chats) with a totally different &#x27;you&#x27;re doing it only in one place&#x27; model, they even track which machine you&#x27;re currently live on.  If you&#x27;re actively using your home machine, they don&#x27;t ring your phone - your phone which you might have left home.   Or the session you accidentally left running on your office machine.  They know you&#x27;re actually live on a particular machine, and don&#x27;t annoy or embarrass people by making the others ring.<p>There are just a lot of really, really important things like this they get right.<p>Forums did have a little bit of shared standardization, since a lot of people tend to use only a handful of highly popular forum apps, but kinda like the old 90s-style thing where there was always a roster of &quot;must have&quot; OS tweaks and apps you&#x27;d install on a new machine (and get to thinking &#x27;geez, why don&#x27;t they just make this part of the OS) - there&#x27;s a similar thing with forums where there are a lot of sidecar things that ought to part of every forum, but simply aren&#x27;t standardized.  (Some of these are critical to doing certain jobs; some of them are, like accessibility features, critical to certain users, and difficult to make forum admins care about if they don&#x27;t personally have the problem).<p>That, and what you&#x27;re saying about &quot;having it all in one place&quot;.  It has a lot of benefits, like being able to cross-communicate and deeplink between communities.')
