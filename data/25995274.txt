Item(by='Shynobi', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1612220184, title='Ask HN: Would you pay to effectively validate your ideas?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Description: We&#x27;re building a platform that helps startup founders test if their idea is potentially profitable. Founders communicate with our AI (Valii) about their startup idea, using that information, we create a preorder page and advertise it. Potential customers for the idea can then place a preorder. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valii.co&#x2F;<p>More details: We&#x27;re almost done with the MVP, aiming for 12th Feb. For the MVP we are excluding the advertising feature and the AI integration. We are instead simulating the AI experience by asking detailed questions and using it to generate the preorder page. We believe the major feature is the preorder validation. Finally you only receive the money for your preorders a few days after you launch, to give your customers a bit of time to confirm their satisfaction with your product&#x2F;service.<p>Is this a service you would pay for and why? Any feedback is appreciated!')
