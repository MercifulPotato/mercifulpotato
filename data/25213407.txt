Meanwhile Tom was in his own kitchen with a glass of wine. That would be a better experience than he&#x27;d have had in any hotel conference room.<p>And another friend wrote about a conference he attended:\n&gt; I think anything online is almost by definition ‘short attention span theater’ and the organizers took note of that with shorter panel sessions. Instead of a half hour to 45 minutes, these ran 10-15 minutes with four panelists. Extremely brief introductions, right to the point, on-topic questions, and so it went. Pretty effective even for fairly weighty topics like impact of AI on business.')
