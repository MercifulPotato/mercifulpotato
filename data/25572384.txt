The NSA has been pursuing what they called a &quot;total information awareness&quot; program since the late 90s &#x2F; early 2000s. The goal is to collect all digital data about all of the world citizens, so it can be used later in case that&#x27;s deemed &quot;necessary&quot; for &quot;national security.&quot; Basically like Facebook+Google, plus geolocation and mobile phone data and information from national police registers, credit card companies, and travel agencies. All of this integrated and searchable in real-time.<p>It&#x27;s a realistically attainable goal for an agency like the NSA. However, the Snowden revelations put it into jeopardy because their prior policy was that merely storing data about Americans is constitutional if it is not queried in an unconstitutional way. It is not. But they are allowed to store anything about anyone else, and they probably still do that. I mean, advertising companies do this at a city block level in many countries already.')
