Item(by='alblue', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611427371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25883419, text='Java bytecode allows for Debug attributes, which are produced by default in most build engines, and say which field maps to which item on the stack and for how long. Even if that information is removed, the fact that you have the return value of an invokedynamic called `object.getName` means that you can often have a much better chance of redeeming the information than in other compiled languages.<p>The key difference is that fields and methods maintain all their names in the bytecode; in C, non-public symbols are usually stripped leaving only the calls to libraries present.')
