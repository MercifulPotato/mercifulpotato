Bitcoin went from $0 to over $300 billion in market cap with no company or organization to market it. It&#x27;s been the best performing asset for the past 5, 10 and 12 years.<p>Now that it&#x27;s large enough for institutional investors, family offices, ETFs and hedge funds to get involved, that&#x27;s happening. Yes, 401ks, IRAs, company treasuries now have bitcoin in them.<p>Meanwhile, every fiat currency (except twoâ€”the dollar and the pound) has failed at one time or another. Now that it&#x27;s been 50 years since going off the gold standard, the dollar isn&#x27;t looking so good for the long haul. Trillions of dollars have been printed this year; that erodes the buying power of the dollars we already had.')
