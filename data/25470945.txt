Americans just have to be convinced to care about civil asset forfeiture more than they care about other things. Most people probably think of it as something that happens to other people who were probably crime-adjacent anyway (I don&#x27;t agree with this line of thinking). If you got enough single-issue voters who cared about civil asset forfeiture, it would go away.')
