This is almost useful.<p>There is a simple mechanism to model multiplication of vectors represented using elements of an orthonormal basis. Each (multi)vector is a linear combination of terms, and each term is an ordered sequence of basis elements. Multiplication of (multi)vectors works as usual. Multiplication of terms simply concatenates the 2 terms, then canonicalizes using identities vv = |v|^2 and uv = -vu. There is a cost, the number of terms in a (multi)vector is O(2^n) for an n dimensional space, but that&#x27;s OK.<p>And then I&#x27;m lost. How does this map back to geometry? What does &#x27;2 + 3xy + 5yz - 7xyz&#x27; mean geometrically speaking? What does multiplication mean geometrically speaking? Can&#x27;t build an intuition, not even for R^2 or R^3 :(')
