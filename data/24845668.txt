She called me, but couldn&#x27;t explain or tell me her location and me being terrible with directions drove around aimlessly and couldn&#x27;t find her. After this, she decided it was best we both share our locations so we know each other&#x27;s location just in case something like this happens again.<p>The geofencing thing would be so I could time when to start cooking dinner and have it ready for when she gets in. I work from home so it&#x27;s easy for me to cook and I just like to have it ready and stay warm by the time she gets in.')
