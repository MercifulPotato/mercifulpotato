That misses out on meaningfulness and familiarity, but those are expensive - by dropping those requirements, you gain easy SEO, trademarks, domains, etc.  A big company knowing they&#x27;re going to sell millions of copies can spend 5 figures on a domain and 6 figures on SEO, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it for most startups.')
