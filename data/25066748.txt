When this article first came out, I had read it and started tracking my own numbers. It pretty much matched what the article is saying perfectly.<p>It was a long time ago and I certainly don&#x27;t have the data anymore. IIRC, there used to be a tell on the site where careful inspection of the user&#x27;s profile page would tell you whether or not they had a full, paid profile (it was something like the background color of one of the fields being slightly different).<p>Once I discounted the unpaid profiles from my numbers, it was actually a pretty high percentage of people that would respond, go through the several layers of canned intro questionaires, a few back-and-forth messages, and finally agreeing to a date.<p>The end result was something like 25% of the people with whom I matched whom also had paying profiles would end up in a date. But if you were just tracking &quot;percentage of &#x27;matches&#x27; that lead to dates&quot;, it was something like 0.1%.<p>Basically, it boiled down to eHarmony&#x27;s system giving out less than 1 paying profile per day out of the 5 or 7 or 10 or whatever they gave you. You had to be diligent, working it every day, to get that number above 1 per week. Filter that down to 25%, it was about a date a month.<p>It was exhausting. I had better luck talking to random people at social events. I met a few people through Craigslist by gamifying my posts, stuff like &quot;to prove you&#x27;re not a bot, you have to decrypt this ROT13 message and copy it in your email to me&quot; [0]. I actually dated a woman for a little while whom I met when she came to my door looking for donations for some charity.<p>But really, getting out of bars and going out to specific social events, getting into a group of people with whom I became friends, and letting them introduce me to women, was the ultimate key to finding my wife of 6 years.<p>[0] Aaaah, Craigslist personals ads. It&#x27;s all fun and games, until you meet the crazy one who tries to get you into a fight at a biker bar.')
