It is incorrect.<p>In fact, if the software tells you that either of the strings is either 8 or 10 letters wrong, then either way the software is incorrect - those are both obviously 6 letter strings.<p>Now, does UTF8 help you discover they are 6 letter strings better than other representations? There are certainly text-oriented libraries that can do that, but not those that simply count the UTF8 code points - they must have an understanding of all of Unicode. Even worse, the question &quot;how many letters does this string have&quot; is not generally meaningful - there are plenty of perfectly valid unicode strings for which this question doesn&#x27;t have a meaningful answer.<p>However, the question &quot;how many unicode code points does this string have&quot; is almost never of interest. You either care about some notion of unique glyphs, or you care about byte lengths.')
