But more than that, the rate of growth in hospitalizations and deaths also follows the same pattern almost perfectly but with a 5 day and 16 day delay, respectively!<p>What locale is this graph from?  Because it does not at all match.. let&#x27;s say, the US, where there&#x27;s now been 3 peaks and the number of daily cases doubled each peak, but the daily deaths was highest in the first peak.  They are not growing at remotely the same rate over here, even with a 5 or 16 day delay.')
