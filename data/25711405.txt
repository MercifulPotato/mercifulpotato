Such a tool may provide incorrect results for even perfectly well-written HTML. There is no know what it takes to make all the broken parsers out there happy.<p>I know you made a point about ETL tools[1] where XML parsers are used to parse HTML but there is no way to cater to such absurd use cases anyway. Using an XML parser to parse HTML5 is not going to work correctly anyway even if you do retain the optional tags because it would fail on other HTML5 tags that do not have closing tags such as &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, etc., empty attributes like &lt;input disabled&gt;, &lt;input required&gt;, etc. Web developers from all around the world are not going to start writing self-closing &lt;img &#x2F;&gt; tags just because these broken ETL tools have decided to use an XML parser to parse HTML5.<p>There are plenty of good HTML5 parsers out there for almost every mainstream programming language. Just use them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25708209" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25708209</a>')
