Get a procedure done in another country that turns out not not be covered and they presumably will bill you for it.<p>The mess comes about because of attempting to control prices with networks and pre-approvals, which is a fairly recent mess as they tried to control prices and govt layers requirements and escapes&#x2F;loopholes on them. It would be better to just wipe that all away and get policies that say if you get sick you get a flat payment to spend as you wish. I.e., actual insurance.')
