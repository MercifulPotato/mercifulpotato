The intuitive metric of views is not what is good for Netflix&#x27;s bottom line, quite the opposite. The best customer for Netflix is the one who stays subscribed but never uses it.<p>I believe the reason most people miss this is that for traditional networks, more viewers are strictly better; more viewers result in more ad revenue, and the marginal cost of an additional viewer is zero. For Netflix however, this is inversed: an additional viewer does not add any revenue (assuming they were already subscribed), but still adds cost.<p>The economic model of Netflix seems to be at odds with user interests.')
