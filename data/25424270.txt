China’s electronics industry relies on U.S., Taiwanese, South Korean, and Japanese suppliers for many key components, but the most strategic of strategic technologies is the microprocessor. And despite years of strategic investment, China has (so far) been unable to master the production of these highly specialized but utterly ubiquitous computer chips....<p>&gt; The only serious Chinese rival to these advanced U.S. chips is the HiSilicon Kirin 9000, designed by Huawei’s own in-house “fabless” chip-design subsidiary. In the arcane lingo of semiconductor manufacturing, a fabless chipmaker is one that lacks its own fabrication facilities, known as “fabs” or “foundries.” Until this year, Huawei’s HiSilicon chips were actually made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, but tightening U.S. sanctions put an end to that. Broader U.S. export controls on chip design software and foundry machine tools mean that Huawei now has little chance of developing an advanced fabrication capability of its own. As a result, the Kirin 9000 is effectively stillborn.<p>I think the headline is misleading.  It hasn&#x27;t <i>succeeded yet</i>, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s failing.  I mean, by this standard, the <i>US is also failing in this exact area</i>, because Intel and other US chipmakers have fallen behind TSMC.  Also, I think articles like this might re-enforce dangerously overconfident attitudes in the West: focusing on your few remaining strengths is a great way to distract yourself from the need to reverse your own stagnation or even decline.<p>If anything, this is a wake up call for any nation that has allowed globalization to make it dependent on supplies from countries that are not politically aligned with it.')
