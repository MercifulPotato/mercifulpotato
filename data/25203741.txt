As an exec, you would ask that person to come for maybe the first two or three meetings, tops.<p>Then you acknowledge that said person is lazy, condescending or something else but definitely not a team player that&#x27;s for sure. And you move on.<p>Then you attend a decision-making meeting where you are to recommend a handful of people to your exec peers for equity, raises, spinoffs or carveouts.<p>Guess whose name won&#x27;t even come to your mind when assessing the company&#x27;s rising stars ?<p>Edit: &quot;I neglected meetings that seemed unnecessary&quot; see that? That&#x27;s condescension. Neglect. Laziness. No conspiracy needed when self-undoing is a certainty.')
