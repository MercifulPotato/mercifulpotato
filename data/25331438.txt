I didn&#x27;t invest in the stock market or houses, as I thought that they are overvalued. Then one day in 2013 I saw that in Cyprus the banks just took away money from other people, who saved all their lives. It felt close, because I&#x27;m also from the EU, and Cyprus is not a 3rd world country....that&#x27;s when I bought Bitcoin with a part of my money, because I understood it that if I keep the private key secure, nobody can take it away from me.')
