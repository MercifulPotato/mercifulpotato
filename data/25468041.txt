Went to work in state government as a developer at 47+.  Could not be happier.  I feel that the obligation of helping tax payers get their moneys&#x27; worth is &quot;old school&quot; internet.  Being able to present government information the easiest and cleanest way possible on the net.  Started doing web dev back around 96 and felt like the ethos have evolved into something I just couldn&#x27;t ethically believe in anymore.  Found a second life doing what I love in state government...oh and they treat me like a human being.  Excellent insurance, more time off than I can use, and people (other developers) who believe in what they are building.')
