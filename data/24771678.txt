IANAL but that sounds like &quot;deliberately lies&quot; to me.<p>From the lawsuit: <i>for years, Google has known that the user experience they designed misleads and deceives users. The evidence obtained from within Google—such as internal emails, presentations, and memos—is overwhelming in this regard</i><p>They knew that they were deceiving users, and liked it that way.<p>An example of of how Google uses this data: Google will track if you click an ad for Cheesecake Factory and later physically visit one. This allows them to charge higher rates for ads. This isn&#x27;t a secret, they brag about that capability. It&#x27;s why they use so many dark patterns to push users to enable location tracking.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;google-ads&#x2F;answer&#x2F;6100636?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;google-ads&#x2F;answer&#x2F;6100636?hl=en</a>')
