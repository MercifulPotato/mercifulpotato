It writes on paper but records what it writes, time-stamped, with sync to Evernote, gdrive, and others.  The app that backs it will also let you see what you wrote when, so you can electronically see your notes from a particular meeting.<p>It also tries to sync notes against calendar entries, but I don&#x27;t remember much about that feature.<p>For notes for myself, nothing beats a nice fountain pen and a high quality notebook.  It&#x27;s relieving how well my thoughts just fall out of my head onto paper.')
