Item(by='jaegerpicker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610741486, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794000, text='&gt; I contend that the problem $PATH solves has nothing to do with programming. $PATH is a solution for finding programs when you type their name on the commandline, nothing more. Windows and Mac programs don&#x27;t really use or need it for the vast majority of tasks. Programming does not fundamentally require $PATH.<p>Do you write programs that don&#x27;t load libraries? That don&#x27;t interact with files? $PATH is required (or something to search along to find those libraries or files). I&#x27;ve been programming for 25+ years and I can&#x27;t think of a serious actual application that I&#x27;ve written that doesn&#x27;t need something like $PATH. Even simple data formatting console apps generally need to load a JSON library or something similar. It&#x27;s impossible to bundle every library needed for an app in every app. People keep saying that $PATH isn&#x27;t needed but location services of some kind is absolutely needed! I&#x27;d argue that $PATH is the result of 50+ years of engineering&#x2F;science and research and is the best known way to address that issue as of now.')
