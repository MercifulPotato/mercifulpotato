I&#x27;ve seen references to cams used in certain screw-cutting devices. But not a detailed description of how exactly those cams worked or how people were actually measuring the error in the first place back then.<p>&gt; though presumably that&#x27;s not enough to machine a better screw, otherwise they&#x27;d do that ;)<p>These days it&#x27;s probably cheaper to just program the compensation curve into your CNC controller than to actually build a better screw! The really accurate machines often use separate distance encoders anyway, rather than rely on a ball screw that&#x27;s being stretched and compressed by both load and temperature effects during use.')
