The customer will then insert their card and enter their pin, the transaction will take place (as you say, ultimately down to the issuing bank), and the device will indicate whether the transaction was successfully or not (printing a receipt as well as an indication on the screen). Some places have tighter integration with tills etc, but to my knowledge it&#x27;s down to the POS device (which is assumed secure) to communicate the status of the transaction to the till.<p>My suggestion is that given full control over the POS device (i.e. your card triggers buffer overflow in the POS and you get code execution), you could make it behave as if the transaction had been successfully processed (by showing the same message and issuing the same receipt) without <i>actually</i> debiting any accounts or making any actual transaction.')
