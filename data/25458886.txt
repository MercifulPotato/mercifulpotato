Item(by='ChuckMcM', descendants=None, kids=[25459690], score=None, time=1608231248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25458206, text='It is a really good question :-).<p>I came across his work because I noodle occasionally on a thread of questions that started with &quot;is there a maximum RF frequency?&quot; and the implications that leads to.<p>My hypothesis is that there must be such a limit, given that EM waves propagate at the speed of light, thus their wavelength is the c (ms)&#x2F; f(Hz) and I could not really imagine a wavelength that is shorter than the Planck constant. But a related question is the propagation of the E and B fields, which change with respect to frequency, and so what is the limit to their change rate (first derivative) with respect to the speed of light (or looked at another way, the ability of space-time to accommodate that change), all very interesting corner cases like looking at gravity on the event horizon of a black hole.<p>Anyway, you start going down this rat hole you find a lot of &quot;interesting&quot; ideas (and begin to wonder if maybe you&#x27;re one of the crazies and you just don&#x27;t know it yet :-)). There are a lot of easily composed questions in that space, like &quot;Can you conduct a current in a wire that is thinner than an electron?&quot; Which have simple answers like (there is no metal smaller than compressed hydrogen so you can&#x27;t create such a wire so you can&#x27;t get there from here,) And less simple answers, &quot;What are the electrical properties of a wire made out of compressed hydrogen then?&quot; (which was the focus of one of the room-temperature superconductor experiments).<p>You may find, as I have, you sometimes get math that &quot;works&quot; in that you&#x27;ve not violated any mathematical principles in deriving it, but doesn&#x27;t represent a physically realizable system.<p>My guess, is that this guy ended up down one of those paths and has a nice, mathematically sound, derivation which, <i>if realized into a system</i>, would have some pretty interesting attributes. And yet the tricky bit is that last one. Sort of the mass-less pulley problem. So many interesting things are possible if you can precisely bend (or smooth!) spacetime, but how you get there from here is a still strictly in the realm of science fiction.')
