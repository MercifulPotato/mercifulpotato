The landlords have just signed the eviction papers for the old tenant, and they just survived an attack from the dogs he let loose on them. Should the old tenant get to stay in the apartment 10 more days, and wreak havoc?<p>Worse, the old tenant has the nuclear codes.<p>I wanted to ask what if something big happens now, like an ISIS attack, but I suppose this administration has been so dumb the last 4 years, someone else lower in the chain of command can deal it it.<p>On the topic of chain of command, from Obama&#x27;s latest book:<p>&gt; What I was quickly discovering about the presidency was that no problem that landed on my desk, foreign or domestic, had a clean, 100 percent solution. If it had, someone else down the chain of command would have solved it already. Instead, I was constantly dealing with probabilities: a 70 percent chance, say, that a decision to do nothing would end in disaster; a 55 percent chance that this approach versus that one might solve the problem (with a 0 percent chance that it would work out exactly as intended); a 30 percent chance that whatever we chose wouldnâ€™t work at all, along with a 15 percent chance that it would make the problem worse.')
