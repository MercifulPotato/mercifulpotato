(Bandar Mahshahr in Iran hit a wet-bulb temperature of nearly 95°F during a 2015 heat wave, which translates to a heat index of about 163°F (73°C).) But South Asia poses the bigger concern in terms of threats to people, as it is home to one fifth of the world’s population and is an area of deep poverty.<p>“That combination is what makes, what shapes this acute vulnerability,” Eltahir said.<p>Eltahir and his colleagues found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current trajectory, parts of eastern India and Bangladesh will exceed the 95°F threshold by century’s end and most of South Asia will approach that threshold.<p>If emissions are substantially curtailed and global temperature rise meets the 2°C (3.6°F) limit agreed to in the Paris accord, no place in South Asia would exceed 95°F, though wet-bulb temperatures over 88°F would be widespread. Such temperatures can still be deadly, especially to already vulnerable populations like the elderly.[..]<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livemint.com&#x2F;mint-lounge&#x2F;features&#x2F;climate-change-tracker-the-rising-threat-of-humid-heatwaves-11597852162995.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livemint.com&#x2F;mint-lounge&#x2F;features&#x2F;climate-change...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climatecentral.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;extreme-heat-india-most-vulnerable-21672" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climatecentral.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;extreme-heat-india-most-...</a>')
