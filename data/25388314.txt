No offense to Bob Ross fans but Ross was not an artist. His paintings were not of high quality amongst the field of what is considered art. This assertion goes beyond subjective tastes. His paintings were amateurish, but much better than people who do not paint.<p>Bob Ross was a wonderful figure who democratized the act of painting to the mass consumer demographic. The level of fame he attained is much higher than the quality of his paintings.')
