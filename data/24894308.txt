Laptop died last may, I got a new one, and... it&#x27;s still reasonably good.  However, I&#x27;ve been far less mobile in the last few months, and that will likely stay that way for a long time.<p>I&#x27;ve been primarily on laptops for the past 12-13 years or so.  Much of my work involves traveling and meeting clients, sometimes doing some work on their premises.  This was not an every day thing, but it was enough that I considered the laptop the primary tool.  And I would typically get the higher-powered laptop models when I&#x27;d get new ones, as it&#x27;s the main day to day tool.<p>The last 6+ months have changed most of my movements.  I haven&#x27;t met a client in person this year.  I don&#x27;t expect I will for at least another year.  If it&#x27;s sooner, it&#x27;s sooner, but probably not.  Being forced in to being non-mobile, my thoughts are turning back to desktops.  I&#x27;ll still <i>want</i> a laptop, but price&#x2F;performance, I know I can get some more from desktop, and I&#x27;m considering switching to desktop as &#x27;primary work tool&#x27; in the next couple of months.  I&#x27;ll keep current laptop (18 months old now) and it will serve fine as a secondary tool.<p>I&#x27;m curious how covid will impact other peoples&#x27; decisions in this area.  I can&#x27;t be the only one in this situation thinking about this decision.')
