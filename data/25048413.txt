I wish to obfuscate that function so that no one can determine how I arrived at the result, even if they themselves are executing the program.<p>In simple terms, why is FHE different from iO? I’ve read your reply a few times, but I don’t understand the concrete distinction. What is the “best possible result” of input + 42 obfuscatabiliry?<p>Note that I am using + 42 as a trivial example; please mentally substitute with “for example, a bunch of matrix operations to compute a super secret formula result.”')
