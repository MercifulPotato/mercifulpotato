It&#x27;s free, and it seems to fit my fairly minimal needs.  In particular, it allowed uploading everything I dumped from GPM (~7k tracks, apparently), and allows specifying which songs should always be available offline on an Android device.  Presumably it has the usual streaming features and online music acquisition features as well, but I don&#x27;t use any of them.<p>The client has an option that claims to do some normalization that I hoped would prevent large deltas in volume between tracks - in practice this seems worse than what I got from the GPM player.  I mostly listen to long heterogenous playlists on shuffle, so this probably wouldn&#x27;t matter to people who listen to full albums.<p>I believe they have some monetization plan involving allowing higher bitrate playback, but I don&#x27;t think I can really tell the difference.<p>I did try migrating to Youtube Music first and gave up after one too many annoyances.')
