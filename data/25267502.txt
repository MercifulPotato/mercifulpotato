We&#x27;re building a platform that allows analysts, data scientists and management to build and collaborate on better decision making. From no-code model building, through scenario simulation, data comparison and generating actionable insights into the systems at work.<p>The challenges involve building highly interactive and data intensive interfaces in a Simulation IDE, spanning the gamut from UX concerns through to low-latency compilers. We&#x27;re also building out the infrastructure to enable simple data connectivity for models, real-time analysis, and scale-out for compute intensive workloads for analysis and optimisation.<p>We&#x27;re currently 5 people, have recently secured VC backing (pre-seed) and are building out a core engineering team, with positions open on frontend and backend. Technology stack is TypeScript (Next.js), Rust, Hasura, and deployed on GCP. We&#x27;re interested in Go&#x2F;Java engineers with DevOps experience for the backend role.<p>More info on our careers portal at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.sheetless.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.sheetless.io</a>')
