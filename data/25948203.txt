The thing is, RobinHood refused “buy” order that were completely inline with the margin requirements, and <i>that</i> caused the share price to dive.<p>Seems to be a coordinated move among all retail browsers (including IB according to people on this discussion - despite publicly claiming they are just hiking margins).<p>Basically, as of this morning, retail clients could only sell, whereas institutional clients could buy and sell as they wish.<p>Doesn’t sound remotely ok.
