What about performance or bulk editing? From that program&#x27;s perspective, the ideal is probably to have a single file (SQLite DB for example).<p>But now you don&#x27;t have granular sharing mechanisms except through a clumsy export which requires you to give a name to the thing and put it somewhere and open it in the other program.<p>Meanwhile I hit the share sheet on my phone for the Contact. Some apps know about this form for data and can ingest it. Others fallback to text. It&#x27;s the clipboard model, not the files model.<p>Files are _fine_, and it lets you do stuff like reverse engineer the format and do cool stuff. But it&#x27;s clunky as hell when you have something relatively ephemeral.')
