Our ML algorithms help reduce bias in hiring decisions and we can show a direct line between us and their wallet. Active in over 1,100 facilities in the US and branching out into other verticals.<p>We offer flexible work schedules, copious work from home, a 401k, actual healthcare plans, vision and dental coverage. Overtime is frowned upon and vacation is unlimited. We are based around 2 metro hubs and looking to grow in St. Louis.<p>You won&#x27;t be tested on data structures or algorithms (that&#x27;s memorization.) No one will make you write code with a sharpie (it&#x27;s all online, anyways.) It&#x27;s a phone screen, code sample and then one &lt; 4hr interview session.<p>Infra is hosted on AWS. Typescript on the front end, Python and Clojure on the back end. We still have a lot of OCaml if you&#x27;ve ever wanted to dabble.<p>See our posting: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arena.applytojob.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;rAyPGHntCs&#x2F;Data-Engineer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arena.applytojob.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;rAyPGHntCs&#x2F;Data-Engineer</a><p>Or email me owein at arena.io (no 3rd parties, please)')
