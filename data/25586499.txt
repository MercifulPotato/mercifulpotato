The sensors do pick up on things, and if you are actively paying attention and ready to take over at a moment&#x27;s notice, it is probably a net positive.   Though on average, for me, things like the forward collision warning tend to be more nuisance than help.  Startling, and of the half dozen times it&#x27;s activated for me, once was me needing to notice that traffic ahead and suddenly stopped, the rest are things like right-turning drivers that are way out of the way but the car panics about them.  Even on &#x27;late&#x27; mode.<p>The technology will certainly improve, however.  Probably going to be quite a while, if ever, before I let it do <i>all</i> the driving, though :).  At least partly because I enjoy driving.')
