Even people who agree 100% with the nyt&#x27;s point of view should be offended by it. I&#x27;m more interested in facts than confirmation bias of what I believe. I don&#x27;t consider them a reliable source of news.<p>Note that an article can be disinformation even if all the information in the article is correct - by simply cherry-picking which facts to present. An example from several years ago: &quot;Half of All Corporations Paid No Income Tax&quot; which was factually correct. Another fact omitted from the many articles on this was &quot;half of all corporations lost money&quot;. Income tax is not owed when losing money.')
