Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=[25278018], score=None, time=1606926283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277620, text='&gt; This fake meat produt has THE SAME ISSUE AS MARGARINE HAD: people think it&#x27;s safe because a few &quot;experts&quot; say so. This is what happened to margarine.<p>Sometimes experts are wrong, that does not mean that they are not still our best hope of being right about things. Otherwise we may as all just listen to the village idiot&#x27;s twitter account and inject bleach.<p>&gt; In reality artifical food is always a bomb waiting to go off inside of you.<p>It really isn&#x27;t any different than &quot;real&quot; food just because it is made in a lab. It may not have the same exact qualities as its natural equivalent, but &quot;natural&quot; by no means is the same as &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;healthy&quot; anyway. Do you want me to show you pictures of giant puss-filled cysts in a cow carcass? Or should we talk about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease? There is nothing inherently good about &quot;natural&quot; and evil about &quot;artificial&quot;, as your posts seem to imply.')
