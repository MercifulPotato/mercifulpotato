Item(by='bird_monster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609310019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578935, text='&gt; We donâ€™t want to live in a country where that would be enough evidence to invade and search his property without consent.<p>It might make sense to switch this to &quot;should be&quot;, as innocent people&#x27;s privacy gets invaded by unlawful search and seizure all the time. Between civil forfeiture, DUI checkpoints, stop and frisk, etc, America is a country in which invasion of privacy under the guise of searching for nonexistent malicious intent happens very frequently.<p>It&#x27;s all the more interesting that it happens so frequently without any evidence at all, and yet was not acted upon with actual evidence. Almost as if there was a bias modifying police behavior. You&#x27;ll note, Anthony Warner was white.')
