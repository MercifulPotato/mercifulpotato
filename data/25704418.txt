You enter a contract and delegate your copyright to CC, CC adds your work to a maintained list. After 14 years (or 28 years if renewed), CC grants permissions to allow unrestricted uses of your work by others. Tim O&#x27;Reilly was a prominent supporter, a few O&#x27;Reilly books were supposed to be published under this program [1]. Unfortunately, this program is no longer active. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I guess it was due to maintenance cost.<p>The new experimental Copyleft Next License [2] also includes a Sunset Clause. It&#x27;s a strong copyleft license, but 20 years after the initial publication of a work, the copyleft requirements no longer apply, it automatically degenerates to a MIT-style license. I like the idea - If nobody cares about a long-obsolete version of a copylefted program, you may as well to maximize its remaining value by allowing unlimited uses (as long as new code is still being written, the copyleft of the current version remains in effect). Perhaps not good for all programs, but suitable for many.<p>AFAIK, a general license suitable for all works doesn&#x27;t exist yet. But it should be easy to write one, for example...<p>&gt; Copyright (C) 2021 segfaultbuserr. All rights reserved.
