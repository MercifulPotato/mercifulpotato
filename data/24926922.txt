Presentations are a public dialogue about topics; that&#x27;s literally their purpose. By presenting on a topic, you are putting your ideas and viewpoints into the public sphere for discussion, sharing, critique, criticism and further development.<p>Hiding one side of that conversation makes no sense whatsoever. You can disagree respectfully with someone in public. That&#x27;s pretty fundamental to progressing the dialogue. Hiding it means people don&#x27;t then get to evaluate opposing viewpoints and understand the relative merits of each.<p>My colleagues and I disagree about our work - in public, in front of each other - all the time. The trick is to do it politely and respectfully, which is overwhelmingly the case. This is how we all learn from each other and develop a higher overall standard of output.<p>And <i>all that</i> considered, in this particular case why not just ask the original presenter how they feel about it? Surely that is the authoritive answer to whether there&#x27;s even an issue here.')
