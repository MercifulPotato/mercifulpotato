I didn&#x27;t have any of the physical issues that the author described (despite almost endless wet conditions underfoot and frequently from above too). I had trained for and finished an extremely hard 50km trail race in the Colorado Rockies 2 weeks before the hike started, and was in excellent shape even before we started.<p>Nevertheless, it was only my brother&#x27;s inability to even imagine quitting that got me to the end. I was variously bored, confused about the why, and&#x2F;or simply willing to call it quits. I wasn&#x27;t in pain, I didn&#x27;t dislike walking all day with an insanely heavy pack on, I hadn&#x27;t even minded a 30&#x27; fall down a mountain. But it still took everything I had, plus more from my brother, to get me to want to keep going.<p>People who can do that easily have my respect, admiration and envy (like ... my wife!)')
