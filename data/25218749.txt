And it worked, it was an incredibly collaborative device that could be passed around, drawn on, and used effectively in group settings.<p>It enables things that are simply not possible on a laptop, and as the platform matures, that will hopefully become more obvious. One standout app for me is Concepts.app, allows me to draw and diagram and demo all in one go. It helped improve team and client relationships straight away. Admittedly, this method of working has vanished completely with remote, but I hope to get back to on-site and face-to-face working next year sometime.')
