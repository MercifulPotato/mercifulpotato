I would like this software to be developed for PC. I live in Dallas, TX, USA and want to play DFS ie. draftkings&#x2F;FanDuel but TX is one of the few or so unavailabe states. I have used VPN&#x27;s but sites will not allow me to play because I need my location enabled . The plugin we&#x27;re looking to get over is called Geo Comply, it&#x27;s mega advanced, does more than 350 checks on you every 20 minutes, eats stuff like VPN&#x2F;RDPs for breakfast and a few experienced developers I&#x27;ve contacted failed already.<p>They have a lot of information on their site about the methods they use and after reading it, you might get a bit discouraged as experienced as you might be. I want a software or a solution that can bypass all their checks and for me to stay undetected while being out of state. I need to appear to be located within New Jersey.<p>I wanna work with serious and experienced developers only, as I said this is far from an easy task that many so-called old IT dogs failed and gave up on. Your effort will be rewarded and I might have future jobs for you too if you can somehow manage a solution for my problem.<p>Looking forward to working with you.')
