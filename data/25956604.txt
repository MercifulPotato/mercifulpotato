I&#x27;ve never worked for a small firm nor a FAANG...I have always only worked for large enterprises - many with names that are easily recognizable globally, and maybe 1 or 2 jobs with enterprises that are major names only in U.S. markets...but those firms ran the gamut with respect to industry (and none in the FAANG or silicon valley&#x2F;startup sector)...so as other folks have stated, the ability to succeed in these types of negotiations can vary greatly by size of company, seniority of role, perceived value to team or org., etc.')
