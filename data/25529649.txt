Item(by='neilv', descendants=None, kids=[25530928, 25530718], score=None, time=1608832142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526237, text='BTW, you can cable an old-school RS232 terminal much easier than in the photo there. The terminal will most often have a DB25 connector for RS232 to the host (your computer), and there are cheap cables on eBay with integrated adapters that will turn RS232 one one end to USB Serial on the other.  These cables are usually DB9 to USB-A, and may sometimes include a very common DB9-to-DB25 adapter.  They cost only several dollars on eBay (if possibly trojan USB devices aren&#x27;t a concern).<p>I used such a cable for testing a silly terminal library with some vintage terminals: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilvandyke.org&#x2F;racket&#x2F;charterm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neilvandyke.org&#x2F;racket&#x2F;charterm&#x2F;</a><p>Warning: If you see a cable that&#x27;s DB25 to USB-A, check that it&#x27;s an RS232 serial adapter, rather than PC parallel printer port adapter.  Early PCs used 25-pin connectors for both serial and parallel interfaces, maybe because the DB25 connector fit better out the back of the card cage than a Centronics parallel printer connector would (and the DB25 connector on the PC would then require a cable that went to the Centronics connector on the printer), and just distinguished the serial and parallel DB25 connectors by gender.  Eventually PCs moved RS232 to a DB9 connector.')
