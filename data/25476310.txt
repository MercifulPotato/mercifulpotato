[1]\n  - Objects and transformations of objects can be expressed by the same multivectors. In the computer graphics of today you would have let&#x27;s say: Vectors for points and translations, quaternions for interpolatable rotations, matrices for chaining up transformations and you would have separate objects for rays, planes, etc. But in geometric algebra all of that can be expressed by one class: The multivector. [2] [3]\n  - It generalizes the same way in all dimensions (which is not true for e.g. vector algebra and the cross product).\n  - One can easily derive geometric calculus from geometric algebra, thus have derivatives and integrals (which is a lot harder to do when you have 6 different frameworks and notation systems)\n  - Bonus: Because it is unified, it has less edge cases and you need less workarounds, possibly making it also more stable &#x2F; robust.\n</code></pre>\nIt would be interesting if anyone could contribute if there are serious downsides except for not being widely used (mostly for historic reasons I guess).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geometric_calculus#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Geometric_Calculus_Family_Tree.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geometric_calculus#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File...</a>\n[2]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projectivegeometricalgebra.org&#x2F;projgeomalg.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;projectivegeometricalgebra.org&#x2F;projgeomalg.pdf</a>\n[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bivector.net&#x2F;3DPGA.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bivector.net&#x2F;3DPGA.pdf</a>')
