I agree that the homeless people you describe are in the direction of repulsive. I can give my answer to your question.<p>&gt; &quot;so the homeless there to me always seemed like they are homeless due to their own bad choices.&quot;<p>Contrary to your perspective, when I see a homeless person (or anyone) who is being unreasonable, hostile or indecent to me: I try to reflect that they did not have the resources and upbringing that allows them to be decent. I did not choose my upbringing therefore I did not choose my capacity to be a decent human being. It doesn&#x27;t change them from being repulsive, but I begin to see how I could have been them if I didn&#x27;t have the resources I had during my upbringing. Resources does not just imply financial capital, but also includes social capital (good relationships, family life), environmental capital (health, nutrition, safety.) So yes you can grow up &quot;poor&quot; (financially&#x2F;materially) but become a decent human being.  Your parents had good virtues instilled in them to not steal or do dodgy things.. I wonder who instilled those virtues in them?  I&#x27;d like to thank them and make their practices ubiquitous.<p>Some rhetorical questions I ponder about:<p>Why am I a decent human being? Am I a decent human being? How much of my inherent decency is from underlying cultural fabric that I may be unaware of and take for granted? What I am doing do insure that I continue to be a decent human being?<p>.. do I have &quot;blinders&quot; on as the actor in the video suggests. What am I taking for granted that could be taken away?  For all I know I could have a future medical condition that breaks me psychologically, or fall to some financial scam that puts me into ruin and I could become an indecent person. How do we create a society that makes it very difficult to become an indecent person? How do we create a society that protects everyone?<p>When I see an indecent homeless person: I see that society has failed them. Society might fail me too.')
