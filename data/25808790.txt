It&#x27;s like they ignored the elephant in the room. Ubuntu also runs on tablets. (edit: this is based in Ubuntu!)<p>Besides that point, Apple is pretty much the opposite of free computing. It&#x27;s a gross comparison.<p>Edit: Looking at their Reddit timeline, it appears as though they&#x27;ve made a lot of progress in a few short months, so I applaud that. I just wish people would stop trying to copy Apple at everything. It&#x27;s a turn off.')
