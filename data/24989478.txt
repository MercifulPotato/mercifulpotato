My thinking has evolved since that video; my blog at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raphlinus.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raphlinus.github.io&#x2F;</a> is a good place to check.<p>As flohofwoe suggests in a sibling, combining an imgui-like API with an actual retained widget tree would be something of the best of both worlds. That is indeed pretty close to what the Crochet prototype does. We&#x27;re not trying to <i>exactly</i> match the imgui but it&#x27;s pretty close. In particular, getting actions back from widgets (like button presses) is the return value from calling the widget-creating function. That&#x27;s a notable difference from, say, Jetpack Compose, which is fairly imgui-like on widget creation but pretty much uses callbacks for those actions. Crochet does solve the page tearing problem (though the current implementation is hacky, don&#x27;t look too closely under the hood).<p>Another note - the Dear ImGui implementation has become a lot more sophisticated over the years, and is no longer a simplistic implementation of the immediate mode GUI concept. It has unique id&#x27;s for widgets, its text processing has become better, etc.')
