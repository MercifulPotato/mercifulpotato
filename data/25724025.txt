I have personally seen people around me click the first result that shows up without even stopping to read what is written on it. They just assume that &quot;I asked for Signal and it is Signal&quot;. That is the amount of trust they have. It is only when they get fooled do they go through multiple stages of confusion before they finally realize what is up: Hey why do I have this app? -&gt; I never downloaded it -&gt; Is this a virus? -&gt; Have I been hacked? -&gt; Let me ask my relative&#x2F;friend who is a computer geek -&gt; Oh it is something I download myself? -&gt; Oh this isn&#x27;t Signal? -&gt; Oh okay I get it now -&gt; Shall I uninstall it? -&gt; Okay I&#x27;ll uninstall.<p>There are some who skip this and just assume that the app they downloaded is Signal even if the app clearly says Facebook Messenger.<p>^ This is how scamsters take advantage of the elderly and those who do not have basic tech know-how. You&#x27;ll be surprised to know that there are millions like that.')
