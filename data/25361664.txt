The open-core model is really built around maintaining installations of software on your own hardware (or virtual hardware). &quot;Paying for pro&quot; made sense in that world. With many things you would have installed and maintained on your own hardware moving to a SaaS model and PaaS model, there&#x27;s really not much of an opportunity to &quot;sell the pro version&quot; outside large enterprises who are 10 years behind the curve. My latest startup owns zero servers. Costs scale on user count (for office stuff) or utilization. Licenses? I get calls from software vendors, and it&#x27;s hard to even understand what they are selling because I don&#x27;t buy licenses anymore.')
