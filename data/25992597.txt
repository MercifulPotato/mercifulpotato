We use a large web software stack to manage thousands of routers in the field. Retail location will use our routers as a failover to cellular if their primary DSL&#x2F;Cable goes down. We also build vehicle mounted routers. City buses use our routers to provide customer Wi-Fi. FEMA uses our routers in the field to provide Internet in disaster areas. We&#x27;re also investing heavily in the new 5G and FirstNet rollout.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the status is of hiring remote.
