Toys &quot;R&quot; Us had a working business model and were gutted by VC&#x27;s. So I wouldn&#x27;t say they were quietly laying down, they were actively raided for their accumulated wealth and this left them unable to compete.<p>Best Buy is probably best example of a company that figured out how to pivot and survive. They basically turned into consumer electronics consultants that tell people what to buy to solve their problem (at a gigantic markup). Amazon.com can&#x27;t compete with that model as it&#x27;s not built for the consumer that doesn&#x27;t know what they want&#x2F;need to solve a problem (or are afraid of knockoffs).')
