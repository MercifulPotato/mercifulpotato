Item(by='spurgu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603545254, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878894, text='&gt; - It does not say anywhere that this is open source and I can host it myself, plugged in with a storage such as AWS S3 or Wasabi or any other cloud that I can backup&#x2F;store etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t, which sucks. I was hoping for the exact same thing. It only says that the client is open source, so you can verify that your photos are actually encrypted.')
