Just like the medieval term &quot;quarantine&quot; proved that it works, 500 years ago. They&#x27;re very effective at stopping infectious diseases. You don&#x27;t have to be a brain surgeon to figure out why they work.<p>The side effects of lockdowns suck A LOT, but less than uncontrolled spread of a virus amongst 8 billion people. Besides the fact that it would completely destroy out healthcare systems, in which case we&#x27;re back to the Middle Ages, we&#x27;re a few mutations away from a much deadlier disease. It would be ultimately irresponsible to allow Covid to run rampant.')
