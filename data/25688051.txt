This is usually for bypassing local legislation<p>That alone should be a red flag.<p>I know there are a lot of narratives about people in repressive governments using Bitcoin to take their meager savings out of the country or carrying their net worth across borders in mind wallets, but Tether isn&#x27;t targeting these people.<p>Tether has very high minimum purchases. They cater (supposedly) to extremely wealthy clients who, for whatever reason, would rather use a questionable intermediary instead of going straight to any one of the major financial institutions offering BTC to purchase their bitcoin. If you had told me in 2015 that it was difficult to purchase BTC as an institution, I would have believed you. In 2021, there isn&#x27;t much reason to do end-runs around regulations unless you&#x27;re deliberately trying to launder money and&#x2F;or dodge taxes.')
