Item(by='1996', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607182310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300122, text='&gt; I would argue it is you who are falling for black-and-white thinking that all trust is bad and that currency should be trustless.<p>I think our differences boil down to one thing: I don&#x27;t share the belief than trust is better than trustless. Actually, I believe the opposite is true in most situations, because trustless allows abstractions in a simple manner.<p>For handling exceptions (ex: ETH DAO), we can revert to trust mechanism, but most of the time, we&#x27;re better off without.<p>&gt; &gt; Actually, at the bare minimum, it removes political control of the monetary supply, leaving only fiscal policy, which may enable better long term control of public deficit by implementing a Milton Friedman like rule (whether it&#x27;s constant inflation, deflation, or nothing, all is good as long as it remains constant and predictable)<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t agree with any of that. I don&#x27;t want any of that.<p>Yet I don&#x27;t think you are an economist, so I&#x27;m afraid your wants are biased. Most people don&#x27;t want to wait - they want to break open the cookie jar. They want to eat the seed corn.<p>It&#x27;s a human bias, with an economic name: the time discount factor, which has been researched in how it leads to substandard outcomes (ex: not saving for your own retirement)<p>At the society level, 401k and the like is a way of removing trust in your saving ability: the decision is taken for you in advance.<p>Of course, there are exceptions (ex: you&#x27;re out of work or sick and need the money now), but that&#x27;s when the &quot;exception&quot; of trust comes in handy.<p>&gt; &gt; To be clear I think all narcotics should be legal. It is the narcos who create the harm. I&#x27;m 100% pro dugs and 100% against allowing narcos to thrive.<p>I 100% agree, but yet I think it&#x27;s better for me not to have vodka and cocaine at home - because if I&#x27;m extremely tired but can&#x27;t sleep, I could be tempted to take the former, then if I have to fly somewhere and it&#x27;s important I&#x27;d be tempted to take the latter the morning after.<p>So I don&#x27;t buy any - another way of favoring a trustless system. If I want booze, I go to a bar as needed.<p>Crypto can offers many features like that, and I believe a smart contract that would automatically save to your retirement account (while exactly equivalent to a 401k on paper) would be better, by sheer virtue of removing the needed trust in the government: I could see a government plundering retirement accounts in a grand announcement of a more redistributive retirement made available to everybody past some given age.')
