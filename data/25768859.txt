A larger community will for sure help with filling in knowledge gaps, but those gaps stem from the documentation not covering something in enough detail.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me but whenever I read Elixir, Phoenix or Ecto&#x27;s docs I can&#x27;t really relate to them. It feels like they are written for a completely different type of person and very rarely do they focus on practical applications of something. Most of the docs feel more like a reference guide to a library&#x27;s API and if you&#x27;re lucky you&#x27;ll get an example or 2, but there&#x27;s not enough context written around it to figure out how to apply that to your specific problem. That and the docs are rarely linked to a meaningful result when Googling for stuff.<p>It&#x27;s a much different world than Python, Ruby and PHP IMO.')
