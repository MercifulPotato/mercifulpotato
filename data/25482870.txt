Item(by='matz1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608425781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482429, text='&gt;But Florida&#x27;s policy approach has killed over 20 thousand people already, and shows no sign of stopping.<p>Keep in mind that the 20000 death number is highly inflated because it include death with covid not just due to covid. People who happen to be covid positive during the death is included in the number.<p>Most importantly with the current death number, i didn&#x27;t say florida government handling it perfectly but I much much rather to live in this place if I have choice.<p>If you think its a horrible way to live then only thing i can say: to each their own.<p>&gt;and shows no sign of stopping<p>as more and more the virus spread, more people develop natural immunity<p>as times go the treatment method improve<p>and then there is vaccine coming<p>&gt;But Florida actually has 650k.<p>Keep in mind that unemployment number is not all solely caused by lockdown<p>But for sure some unemployment is caused by lockdown due to simple logic: if you don&#x27;t allow business to open due to lockdown, the worker wouldn&#x27;t have job.<p>My simple cost-benefit analysis:<p>The risk&#x2F;cost of covid :<p>less than 1% death rate and mostly skewed to older population<p>The lockdown risk&#x2F;cost:<p>Some unemployment, some bankruptcy, some mental health issue, some delayed treatment of other illness, kids can&#x27;t attend in person school, etc<p>At least for me The lockdown risk&#x2F;cost is much more than the risk&#x2F;cost of covid<p>&gt;So so far your cost is twenty thousand extra friends and relatives dead, and your &quot;benefit&quot; is fifty thousand extra unemployed.<p>More accurate example would be: 1 people I know dead due to covid, benefit : life continue as normal for the rest of people. \nPretty damn worth it to me.')
