Many states allow mail-in ballots as long as they have been postmarked by election day, which means there can be a week or more lag before the precinct receives the ballot. Additionally, provisional ballots are usually counted last, and the number of those isn&#x27;t known until they start counting them.<p>The process is dragged on for days because Republicans prevented the States from passing legislation that would allow them to start counting the mail-in ballots early, among other reasons.<p>The deadline is December 8th.<p>A ton of states are still counting, see California for example. People are only interested in the swing states though.')
