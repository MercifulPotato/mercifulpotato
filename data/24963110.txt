You have a theory that there is a conspiracy between Microsoft and the NSA. No such conspiracy exists. Skype started to forward wiretap data to the FBI in 2010 (presumably from owned supernodes and POTS gateways), and Microsoft continued that work after the purchase. There is no evidence that either Skype or Microsoft worked with the NSA on Skype wiretaps, and there is no evidence that either took a multibillion dollar payout for it.')
