Overall, the same experience for years - most games would have some issues, and many simply wouldn&#x27;t run, so I kept Windows for gaming.<p>Proton was a dramatic change for me. A few clicks to enable Proton for a particular game, and then it just seamlessly runs and works. Granted, not all games do (check ProtonDB) but all the games I&#x27;ve wanted to play for the last couple of years have worked. I&#x27;d say Proton is the most significant thing to ever happen for Linux gaming support, and it did more for me overnight than many years of trying with Wine.<p>Modern multiplayer games with anti-cheat are mostly broken, some popular ones like Rainbow Six Siege are impossible to play. But if you mostly play other games, give Proton a try.')
