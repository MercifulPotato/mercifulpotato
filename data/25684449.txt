The shortfall of $850m was allegedly printed by Tether and given to Bitfinex to cover up the losses Crypto Capital created. It is speculated Bitfinex and Tether can&#x27;t submit any documents without revealing their cover-up. This will result in the conclusion that Tether isn&#x27;t backed 1:1 by USD by a lot of investors and will results in more investigation by the attorney general. Tether is unaudited at the moment, meaning no one checked the bankroll of Tether if there really is $23b USD there.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;CryptoCurrency&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ksdfne&#x2F;why_tether_might_tank_the_crypto_market_on_jan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;CryptoCurrency&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ksdfne&#x2F;why_...</a>')
