I recall that my car seat as a kid was a hard vinyl upright contraption that made me carsick whenever I rode in it for a long time.  My mom actually sewed fabric covers for it so it wouldn&#x27;t burn me on hot summer days.<p>My kid&#x27;s infant car seat was a click &#x27;n go bassinet with a soft fabric liner.  His convertible car seat stays in the car, but it still reclines better than any adult seat, with more plush padding than the car itself.  He actually prefers the car over the bed for naps.  Only problem is that he&#x27;s still rear-facing and his legs are getting a bit too long for the seat, but he solves that by putting his feet up.<p>Kid stuff is one area where I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by how technology advanced when I wasn&#x27;t looking.  Car seats, strollers, baby gates, and toys are all way more advanced (and cheaper, inflation-adjusted) than they were in the 80s.')
