Presumably, at some point they&#x27;ll need to buy a new license anyway, and the issue will be moot, right?<p>It sounds like Intel produces an implementation of this thing that works on Intel and makes it available for free, whereas ARM don&#x27;t (although another comment suggests Apple actually do), so you have to buy an expensive third-party implementation instead. That&#x27;s not a difference that&#x27;ll go away in the short term, and you can see why a processor company might legitimately choose one or the other approach.')
