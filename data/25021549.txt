Even if it incentives good behavior (which is debatable), the good behavior it incentivizes is to lower one person&#x27;s enormous compensation so that it&#x27;s slightly less enormous but still quite large.<p>What the law <i>should</i> promote is upward pressure on the lowest earners&#x27; compensation rather than downward pressure on the top earners&#x27; compensation. Minimum wage hike, for example. Much greater potential to improve the lives of the lowest-paid workers; businesses often threaten to compensate via layoffs but usually don&#x27;t follow through, at least not enough to completely offset the change.')
