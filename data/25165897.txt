Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[25165991], score=None, time=1605911727, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25165575, text='I mean, I agree with the specific case, but I really don&#x27;t see how entirely disenfranchising a political party for the views they <i>usually espouse</i> isn&#x27;t a slippery slope that leads to non-democratic results (i.e. major parties being silenced; or one government being arbitrarily declared &quot;legitimate&quot; while another is declared &quot;illegitimate.&quot;)<p>Note: I&#x27;m <i>not</i> talking about censorship of individual posts they make for the views expressed <i>in those posts</i>. That&#x27;s what Facebook was doing here, and I fully support that. (I&#x27;m from Canada; the concept is enshrined in law here!)<p>I&#x27;m just talking about the idea that you probably don&#x27;t want third parties like Facebook to be responsible for deciding whether to censor <i>people</i>, rather the much &quot;safer&quot; question of whether to censor individual posts. Especially when those people are current political candidates, and the people calling for their de-platforming are people opposed to their election, who are perfectly willing to libel them if it silences them at a time crucial for swinging an election.<p>Facebook, unlike a government, does not have a concept of due process, and so is not equipped to deal with complaints from people who have motivations (like swinging an election) strong enough to be willing to &quot;take it in the chin&quot; for libelling someone, as long as their libel causes the desired de-platforming effect at just the right time.<p>This is why we tend to want censorship to be a legal matter: courts have well-built, well-thought-out mechanisms to allow the recipient of a complaint against them to fight back. Meanwhile, what kind of arbitration system does Facebook have? Or, more abstractly, what kind of arbitration system are they <i>required</i> to have? Are there any requirements at all, for how Facebook and other networks should work with people, when others are asking for them to be de-platformed?')
