Item(by='mittermayr', descendants=None, kids=[25061373], score=None, time=1605119834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25060973, text='While I instinctively knew Google is not to trust with the word &quot;free&quot;, especially since &quot;you&#x27;re the product&quot; isn&#x27;t applicable as easily here as with other products, I still decided to thoroughly test Photos for a long while to see if they&#x27;d introduce some limits. They are a corporate entity out to make money (and externally pressured to make more quarter by quarter), so I fully get it. But for Photos, it almost seemed like it could be a long play for them. A fantastic place to upsell users into all the other Google products. One that could just possibly stay free, forever. So, the fool I am, I started recommending it to just about anyone. Helped onboard relatives, many friends and so forth.<p>And now, this. We&#x27;re at the next step of a funnel they could&#x27;ve (and should&#x27;ve) been more transparent on from the start: they&#x27;re starting to apply force to add &quot;a form of payment&quot;. After which, naturally, they&#x27;ll be able to keep on raising those prices freely with such an impressively solid lock-in at hand. The more data stored inside Google Photos, the harder it&#x27;ll be to migrate it away.<p>I am, once again, contemplating to give up entirely on the &quot;cloud&quot; and figure out something else. The issue isn&#x27;t paying for services, but I do have a problem with intransparent funnels. It&#x27;s not about paying a buck or two a month, it&#x27;s about them now being able to raise prices without mercy, regardless of actual storage pricing going down!<p>To migrate away will be quite the effort once we&#x27;re storing past 100 GB+. Frustrating. Fully to be expected, but still. Google is acting so desperate, their struggle with milking the good ole&#x27; advertising cow is becoming more obvious by the minute. I wonder how long Chrome (not Chromium) is going to survive until it&#x27;ll end up in a monetisation funnel.')
