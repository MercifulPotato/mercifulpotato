In the projects I saw where SQL code was encapsulated by stored procedures the business logic was inconsistently split between the application and the database making maintenance much more complicated than it should have been. I am in favour of stored procedures to avoid several roundtrips to the database but only when performance really matters. The case on tweaking SQL performance does not convince me. Where I work we execute performance and load tests before every release of the application and we are expected to meet performance targets that are documented in the release notes.')
