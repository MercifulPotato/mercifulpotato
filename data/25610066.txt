Other violent crimes such as murder occur compulsively, and therefore do not respond to rational thinking such as &quot;jail really sucks bro&quot;.<p>Think of it like this though: If harsh, dehumanizing punishments were an effective deterrent, crimes would&#x27;ve gone <i>up</i> when we stopped chopping off people&#x27;s limbs for stealing, and in fact we&#x27;d have more stealing in modern day than at any time in history because public mutilation is not an acceptable punishment now.')
