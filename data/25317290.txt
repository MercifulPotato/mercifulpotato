I replaced my old DSLR with a mirrorless Canon M50. I did get a T-Ring adapter to fit it to the scope in the future so I will definitely be giving that a go. As you say, some objects can&#x27;t really be seen with a standard telescope whereas a camera with long exposure can soak in the light. In fact you don&#x27;t even need a telescope for many of them, a 200mm quality lens will do fine from the pictures I&#x27;ve seen.')
