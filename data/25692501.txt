Last night violence was even more aggressive than previous nights as rioters once again tried to set fire to the federal courthouse and actively tried to breach the entrance of the courthouse. Rioters are also employing tactics that force federal officers to leave the Hatfield Federal Courthouse, setting them up to be attacked with lasers and projectiles.&quot;[2]<p>Perhaps these do not meet your narrow definition, yet violent attacks on our other branches of federal government seem fairly analogous if not of the same magnitude as Wednesday&#x27;s assault. Are you suggesting Apple would&#x2F;should allow apps where users organized violent assaults such as these on the executive and judiciary - just not against the Capitol building as Congress is in session?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;live-news&#x2F;george-floyd-protests-05-31-20&#x2F;h_cb459ab077b164295d8d61d80987e3fb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;live-news&#x2F;george-floyd-protests-05-31...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhs.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;portland-riots-read-out-july-22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhs.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;22&#x2F;portland-riots-read-out-...</a>')
