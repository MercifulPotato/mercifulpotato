So I started doing digital only purchases onto a 256 GB microSD card, and it’s so much better (IMO). I haven’t noticed a difference in load time either.<p>It doesn’t help that game updates go onto the SD card, not the cartridge. So updates to the whole game basically make your cartridge a DRM dongle.')
