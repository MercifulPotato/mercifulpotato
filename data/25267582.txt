I&#x27;ve been maintaining python+ncurses tool for configuring system: network, ntp, etc. If you don&#x27;t have dhcp server running on your network, then ifup will block until it resolves address (ui freeze). If not, then you have to kill it and also dhcp reolver. After switching to systemd-networkd it just works in background.<p>All configuration is done with .ini style files so that no need to use special parser for &#x2F;etc&#x2F;network&#x2F;interfaces.<p>Disclaimer: I jumped on linux few years ago when systemd already had some momentum, so that I wasn&#x27;t used to either init or systemd. I found the later easier to pick up.')
