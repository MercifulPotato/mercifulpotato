There are lots of things I buy that are like that. You don&#x27;t always need something physical and lasting to show for a purchase. I understand the Oculus business model and went in understanding it. I&#x27;m putting in an up-front cost and then future payments for content and I don&#x27;t own the headset or the content in any kind of traditional sense. The closest analogue in this case is a digital vacation. I will have experiences and memories to show for it and a souvenir once the headset no longer has any functional value.<p>I am totally ok with it being regulated what could be called ownership. I think the crappiest thing about FB is that a whole lot of early adopters thought they were becoming owners and only later realized that they were renters. Legal action seems possible over this. I went in with clear expectations so I do not have the same complaint. I also recognize this is still an early product category and that I take certain consumer risks to experience the future today.')
