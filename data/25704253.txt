I have yet to see factories growing out of the ground in Ohio after Trumps promises.<p>I’m unaligned politically, only voted for Obama in ‘08 for the racial symbolism (representation matters).<p>They show up in Portland, uninvited, pointing guns. They showed up in Kenosha uninvited shooting people.<p>Why not align with the side that otherwise has largely spray painted buildings and marched for representation?<p>Human biology will react in kind; refuse to compromise, put boots on necks figuratively speaking, do not be surprised and angry when that’s how you are treated in return.<p>There’s a parallel here to the story recently about securities fraud. Investors suing a company means the company burns cash that undermines investors.<p>Politicians undermining and not compromising with the other side is undermining the whole of their own country.')
