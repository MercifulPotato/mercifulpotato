Item(by='JPKab', descendants=None, kids=[25378296, 25379752], score=None, time=1607632404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376702, text='I&#x27;m not arguing with this view, but I want to emphasize, that as someone who once worked in the Federal sector in numerous different agencies, that they waste tremendous amounts of money on things that have nothing to do with their core mission.  The Pentagon is obviously horrendous, but other agencies that I expected to be better stewards of their dollars (EPA, DoE, IRS, and yes, NOAA) were horrifically wasteful, on dozens of fronts.<p>The hiring is always a problem, even when there isn&#x27;t a hiring freeze, but they don&#x27;t fire enough lazy people, which demotivates hard workers who end up bailing for the private sector.<p>As taxpayers, we should be furious at the GOP for the Accuweather bullshit, but we also need to be furious at any government agency which tolerates the level of fraud, waste, and abuse that most of these agencies perpertrate.<p>As a person who happens to want universal healthcare like the NHS in Britain, it&#x27;s infuriating to me that these agencies tolerate such constant mediocrity in their ranks (mixed in with the talented of course!!!) and are so bad with their spending efficiency.<p>Bezos had something to say about the Seattle city government last year:<p>&quot;They don&#x27;t have a revenue problem, they have a spending efficiency problem.&quot;<p>It seems like we always get political about this, with one side wanting to &quot;starve the beast&quot; (as if government is this evil beast), and the other side just always letting them get away with the excuse that they need more revenue.<p>Where are the people who BELIEVE in government that will demand that it be efficient?<p>Edit:<p>I love how people think that because corporations are inefficient, they assume that all organizations are equally ad inefficient as the US Federal Govt.  The rate at which people are involuntarily terminated in the Fed Gov is far, far too low, because incompetence is routinely tolerated where it wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be anywhere else.  Why?  Not because a person&#x27;s supervisor in the Fed doesn&#x27;t recognize the incompetence, but because the firing process is so difficult that they don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t expend the energy to do so.  If you want government to have a bigger role in people&#x27;s lives, but are so delusional as to not recognize how bad it is, then you aren&#x27;t furthering your cause.<p>The FDA still hasn&#x27;t approved the Pfizer vaccine, while the NHS already did.  Pfizer is an American company.  That&#x27;s a national embarrassment.')
