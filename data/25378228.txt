Item(by='JPKab', descendants=None, kids=[25378296], score=None, time=1607632404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376702, text='I&#x27;m not arguing with this view, but I want to emphasize, that as someone who once worked in the Federal sector in numerous different agencies, that they waste tremendous amounts of money on things that have nothing to do with their core mission.  The Pentagon is obviously horrendous, but other agencies that I expected to be better stewards of their dollars (EPA, DoE, IRS, and yes, NOAA) were horrifically wasteful, on dozens of fronts.<p>The hiring is always a problem, even when there isn&#x27;t a hiring freeze, but they don&#x27;t fire enough lazy people, which demotivates hard workers who end up bailing for the private sector.<p>As taxpayers, we should be furious at the GOP for the Accuweather bullshit, but we also need to be furious at any government agency which tolerates the level of fraud, waste, and abuse that most of these agencies perpertrate.<p>As a person who happens to want universal healthcare like the NHS in Britain, it&#x27;s infuriating to me that these agencies tolerate such constant mediocrity in their ranks (mixed in with the talented of course!!!) and are so bad with their spending efficiency.<p>Bezos had something to say about the Seattle city government last year:<p>&quot;They don&#x27;t have a revenue problem, they have a spending efficiency problem.&quot;<p>It seems like we always get political about this, with one side wanting to &quot;starve the beast&quot; (as if government is this evil beast), and the other side just always letting them get away with the excuse that they need more revenue.<p>Where are the people who BELIEVE in government that will demand that it be efficient?')
