Unless you are going for higher degrees, the specialization isn’t of prime importance. i.e. what one engineer&#x2F;scientist&#x2F;scholar learns within their field in undergrad compared to another is really not so important for their ability to do things related to that degree.  You don’t need to be exclusively prepared for your exact job.<p>We have accreditation boards to determine what is required for a common base.')
