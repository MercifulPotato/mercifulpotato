It targets a minor improvement in a small part of the overall budget. Most of the time and money of construction in America is tied up in land prices, permitting, and regulation. Prefab solves zero of these issues.<p>There is a building going up in Oakland right now where Factory_OS put out a press release that they had built it in ten days. But they spent 7 years getting approvals, 18 months in site prep, and they&#x27;ve been detailing and finishing the building for more than a year since the press release, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like the method of construction was a very important factor.')
