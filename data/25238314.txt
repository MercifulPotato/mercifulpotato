Item(by='PaulHoule', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606579277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238053, text='I picked up a new 3DS last year and I am delighted with it.<p>The 3DS is a premium gaming experience despite low specs in many areas (pixel count) because the art is built from the ground up knowing how the display is calibrated so every pixel counts whether it is in 3D mode or not.<p>Fan art of games often surpass the original (Touhou, Neptunia) but Fire Emblem Fates does not lose to it because it delivers a unique experience that is hard to capture on other screens.  I wish they&#x27;d enabled 3D for &quot;Pok√®mon Sun and Moon&quot; but then they would have had to make up their mind if Lusamine&#x27;s hair was flat or conical...')
