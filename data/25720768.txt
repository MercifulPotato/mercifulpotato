It would all be self−validating. You couldn&#x27;t draw a breath\nwithout knowing it was part of the plot.&quot;\n&quot;So you think you know where madness lies?&quot;\nMy answer was a convinced and heartfelt, &quot;Yes.&quot;\n&quot;And you couldn&#x27;t control it?&quot;\n&quot;No I couldn&#x27;t control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on the\nconclusion.&quot;\n&quot;Would you be able,&quot; my wife asked, &quot; to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of the Dead calls the\nClear Light?&quot;\nI was doubtful.\n&quot;Would it keep the evil away, if you could hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?&quot;\nI considered the question for some time. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I answered at last, &quot;perhaps I could − but only if there were\nsomebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn&#x27;t do it by oneself. That&#x27;s the point, I suppose, of the Tibetan ritual − somebody sitting there all the time and telling you what&#x27;s what.&quot;\n[Doors of Perception, 57−58]')
