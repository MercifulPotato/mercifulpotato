Here’s Biden right after the ban:<p>&gt; We need to lead the way with science -- not Donald Trump&#x27;s record of hysteria, xenophobia and fear-mongering.<p>And before you reply saying he didn’t mean directly at the ban, I don’t buy it. It was sent directly after the announcement specifically saying “xenophobic” and suggesting the alternative was “science”. That isn’t someone who is signaling they support it.')
