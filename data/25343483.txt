Diode implements a relay incentive in proportion to the traffic handled (which is somewhat predicated on the QoS the relay is able to provide)\n3) Syncthing is a closed system (an impact of #1), so it can&#x27;t do things like link sharing, web viewers, etc...  whereas Diode is able to provide all those things fully decentralized<p>There are certainly also specific UX&#x2F;functionality differences on how the apps are implemented, but those are probably the macro considerations.')
