Item(by='VRay', descendants=None, kids=[25606913], score=None, time=1609530340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605830, text='I haven&#x27;t seen this sort of outright abuse, but I&#x27;ve definitely experienced firsthand at multiple companies a situation where a newcomer needs a ton of tribal knowledge in order to do their job, but the newcomer&#x27;s team members get miffed every time they&#x27;re asked a question.  So then the newcomer ends up having to do way too much work on his&#x2F;her own the hard way, it makes everything way harder and less effective, and before too long they&#x27;re branded a &quot;low performer&quot; and it all goes downhill from there.<p>It happened to me at Microsoft, and later it ALMOST happened to me at Apple.  Fortunately, at Apple I knew what was going on that time and I just badgered my irate teammate and bullied him into giving me all the info I needed.  (Or went around him when I could, since I was lucky that the rest of the team was a lot easier to work with in that respect)  He was a nice guy, but he&#x27;d get visibly annoyed every time I asked him a question.  Either the answer was patently obvious, or the question was unanswerably difficult..  Later on, that teammate left and a new one came onboard with a ludicrous number of really dumb questions, but I just swallowed my bad attitude and did my best to patiently and nicely answer them.. and sure enough, after a couple of months he was fully up to speed.<p>Also, even more fortunately, when things were going badly at Microsoft I had a decent savings account built up and a lot of self confidence&#x2F;stubbornness, enough to say from a place of complete conviction &quot;I&#x27;M not the problem; this whole org is a steaming pile of shit!&quot; no matter who told me otherwise.  I feel really bad for the author of TFA, because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect people to have the type of screwed-up, mercenary attitude it would take to get through his experiences unscathed.')
