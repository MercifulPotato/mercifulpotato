I particularly enjoyed a programming competition that involved a real time tank battle, like &quot;combat&quot; on the atari.<p>Any game that&#x27;s grid based with a fixed number of states works well, either turn-based or real time.<p>You can do a double elimination bracket like a sports tournament, and can be done on a spreadsheet or whiteboard.<p>For more than two players at once, you could try snake, hearts, or poker.')
