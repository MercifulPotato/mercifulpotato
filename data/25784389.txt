They cannot seek the protections of being &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; of any sort, common carrier, public forum, etc. and then, at the same time, disable user accounts for any reason just like any other private website.<p>It&#x27;s never been proposed that platforms like Twitter become common carriers. That designation was intended for the layer beneath them, ISPs.<p>I agree that allowing that layer, ISPs, to effectively monopolize content via regional monopolies and ever-growing media conglomerates is problematic. Now they&#x27;re implementing zero rating in broadband and that means there&#x27;s a high bar for starting the next Netflix, Twitter etc. If you&#x27;re not already part of that club you&#x27;ll have to be super wealthy or take on huge debt from existing tech&#x2F;wealth dominance just to get your foot in the door.<p>We really need to encourage competition at the ISP level in order to allow for competition among services like Twitter.')
