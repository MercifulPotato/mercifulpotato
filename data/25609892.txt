But it isn&#x27;t cost effective.<p>Still consider this.  Things decompose only slowly in a landfill.  But when they do, they decomposed into methane because it is a low oxygen environment.  And methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 is.<p>Therefore &quot;they&#x27;ll break down in the landfill&quot; is not as fine as you think it is.  The fact that styrofoam will NOT breakdown in a landfill makes it ACTUALLY better as a form of carbon capture.  (Although the carbon being captured is actually from fossil fuels, so at best it can be net neutral.)')
