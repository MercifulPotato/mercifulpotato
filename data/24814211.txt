Item(by='monoideism', descendants=None, kids=[24814783], score=None, time=1602976752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24814054, text='&gt; Universal Basic Income people (that used to be called the &quot;dole&quot; in the UK)<p>I&#x27;m much more ambivalent than I used to be about UBI, after seeing what large groups of sequestered, out-of-work, bored, and angry people are capable of doing, but just to clarify, UBI is not the same as the dole. The dole is only given to people who are unemployed, whereas UBI is given to everyone.')
