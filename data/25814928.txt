It&#x27;s ephemeral, mostly garbage. Yeah it&#x27;s kinda cool to see old items from hundred of years ago, but we will leave plenty of stuff either way. But forgetting is part of moving forward. The next generations will have enough to deal with regarding their times than to dive into minute details of the past.<p>Same about worrying about personal photos. I don&#x27;t have many photos about the youth of my grandparents. And none about my great grandparents. But that&#x27;s okay. I don&#x27;t want to be defined by them, and I don&#x27;t want my great grandkids to know tiny details of my life. Legends and stories are just the right amount to know. It&#x27;s a feature that the past decays not a bug.')
