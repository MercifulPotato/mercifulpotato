Probably the best way to go about this is to use some container technology through a semi-managed service or a fully managed service.<p>I would start with something like DigitalOcean. The managed database it&#x27;s a nice thing but hat&#x27;s really not necessary starting. You could start with a database in the same container and then migrate to a managed database when needed. That&#x27;s literally the easiest swap in a tech stack as long as you&#x27;re migrating the same database engine (e.g: MySQL).<p>For a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline probably GitLab is the best choice out there and in my opinion is really easy to learn and comes with a free version with free runner minutes.')
