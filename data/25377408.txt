A tool like Microsoft Teams solves this by creating a matrix type of collaboration tool; however, the result, though helps tremendously for large teams, is also lacking for small teams. Microsoft Teams, in its own way, creates a simple tool to use, however, their &quot;simplistic design,&quot; is not actually simplistic. And what&#x27;s more is that, because the collaboration tool has a lot of hidden features, most teams are not experiencing the full collaboration aspect.<p>Essentially the problem that needs to be addressed is how do you create a simplistic matrix type of collaboration tool that allows all users to fully use a product without any apparent confusion.')
