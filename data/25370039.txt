Even the TS team says the build system is not the core of their work, they just have one for convenience but encourage the community to compete and complement. Integrating build systems is good for beginners who struggle with them but for the rest? IDK.<p>Or in other words, Deno wants to be more than just an opinionated node-Typescript-distribution nobody cares about but then they need to create this ecosystem and focus on the core (what&#x27;s their core and value add other than repackaging node and TS would be the next discussion).<p>With integrating the build step they do the exact opposite, they shut-down an ecosystem before it can even start. There&#x27;s a night and day difference between good and bad build systems and only competition and a rich ecosystem can bring up the best solutions.<p>FWIW, there&#x27;re tons of ways to compile TS, every with different trade-offs and it&#x27;s good that we have these options.')
