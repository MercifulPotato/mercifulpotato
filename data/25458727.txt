I have a roomba and I personally clean the floors quite often manually. In my parents house which had wall to wall carpet, they would vacuum relatively infrequently but the same amount of dirt was likely being tracked in and around. Their house was more dusty than mine seems to be because of the fact that carpet tends to hide how &quot;dirty&quot; it is.')
