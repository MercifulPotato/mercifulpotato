Or conversely  liberals are more confident to voice their opinion because they know they&#x27;re in the majority opinion group and doing so isn&#x27;t likely to stymie their career or cause stressful backlash.<p>Paul Graham tweeted out some survey evidence yesterday that supports the idea that conservatives are simply more afraid to speak their mind in these companies.')
