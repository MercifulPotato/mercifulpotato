However, I had to reinstall WhatsApp because all of my kid&#x27;s sports activities and school updates are organised through WhatsApp groups and it is impossible to participate without WhatsApp. Much as I believe in the cause, I&#x27;m not going to go preach it to the volunteers who coach my kids&#x27; rugby team. The scary thing here is that the actual real-life &quot;social network&quot; has been privatised and monopolised, and now we can&#x27;t participate in society in very important ways without going through Facebook.')
