There is an installation page and a tutorial on the Reason website. The installation in itself is one npm command.<p>&gt; For another example, you altogether dodged the issues associated with multiple &quot;standard&quot; libraries.<p>There is only one standard library. It&#x27;s the one shipped with the compiler. It is also significantly more battery included now than it used to be.<p>&gt; It would be great if the OCaml community were as committed to making their language useful for production applications as they were on convincing everyone else that it already was.<p>The OCaml community as a whole is one of the least vocal on the internet. It does very little outreach. I never see any of the people I consider relevant to the community on HN for example.<p>No one cares about convincing you that OCaml is ready for production use. It doesn&#x27;t need to be argued, it can just be shown. OCaml is not an up and coming language, it&#x27;s a 25 years old one. It powers a lot of Jane Street infrastructure. It is used to develop Coq and Frama-C. It is transpiled to javascript at Facebook and Bloomberg. Heck, Rust which you apparently hold dear was originally written in it.')
