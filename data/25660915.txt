They&#x27;re solving the problem of how to effectively cash out credit cards. Selling items in someone else&#x27;s platform has multiple upsides:<p>1. it&#x27;s a large trusted platform, so the victim&#x27;s bank is less likely to freeze the transactions<p>2. multiple items with arbitrary pricing means maxing out each card is simpler<p>3. the platform will likely have to eat the charge-backs, so where ever the seller receives money from Amazon is relatively safe for a while to further convert into crypto or whatever<p>4. because of the size of the platform you can keep creating new accounts indefinitely - they cannot possibly vet all new sellers - this is probably where the stolen identities for authors come in. Amazon must be doing some basic sanity checks &#x2F; credit score lookups or something similar - hence they need real peoples names &#x2F; SSNs.<p>I&#x27;ve seen similar things on app stores &#x2F; freelancer sites etc. Yes, the accounts get flagged after a while, but there&#x27;s usually enough time to cash out and creating a new one isn&#x27;t that hard.')
