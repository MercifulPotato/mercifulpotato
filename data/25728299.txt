Templates do, but templates bring in their own problems, in addition to not being expressive in the right ways: I can have an array of T, but I can&#x27;t specify that T is Numeric?<p>The fact C++ doesn&#x27;t have Numeric but instead has int and long and unsigned and long long and float and double all off on their own is another problem: The compiler knows enough about them to have complex promotion rules but doesn&#x27;t know enough to allow me to refer to all of them under one name in my code.')
