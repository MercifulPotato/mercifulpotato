Lol, no.<p>Well, let&#x27;s think about it for a second before completely dismissing it. Are there any circumstances where masks could do more harm than good? Well I don&#x27;t know for sure, but off the top of my head: sharing masks and not washing your masks regularly seem like they could be vectors for infection. Also masks might give you a false sense of security and cause you social distance less frequently than you ought to (for example).')
