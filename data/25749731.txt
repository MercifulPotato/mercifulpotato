If you annotate a function for multi-versioning the compiler will build several optimized versions of it, including a generic version, running the most optimal one for the host CPU based on a CPUID check.<p>Intel purposefully misidentifies AMD chips with the CPUID check so always runs the generic version of a function on AMD. It does this even if the host AMD chip supports 100% of the features as some Intel CPU that runs the optimized version.<p>So for any benchmark compiled with ICC any results for AMD chips are meaningless. You can only compare Intel to Intel or AMD to AMD. Compiling that same code without FMV so each CPU runs the exact same instructions will see the difference between them narrow or reverse.<p>Intel is free to optimize the shit out of their compiler but it&#x27;s bullshit that they also actively sabotage AMD chips at the same time. It&#x27;s very much a vendor lock-in tactic.')
