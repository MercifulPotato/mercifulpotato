Item(by='mancerayder', descendants=None, kids=[25556095, 25555947], score=None, time=1609119372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25555295, text='No one ever answers a question like that to a satisfying degree.<p>I made a bunch of money speculating on the swings of stocks.  Not with options, just patience, and it enabled me to make wild returns.  For example, I bought and sold Virgin Galactic 3 times over the past 13 or 14 months, which tripled my initial capital.  I did similar but with a risky few pharma stocks.  PLTR tripled since IPO  (and unlike AirBNB it wasn&#x27;t rigged to benefit banks-and-friends) so that&#x27;s another 200% return.  While many people dump their capital into index funds, I keep most of my money in cash and speculate wildly with a fraction of it, and my returns over the past 5 years exceed what many large funds do.   I also learn about industries and follow news that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise. Stock market index funds terrify me because I want to use the cash in the coming years for property.<p>I don&#x27;t know, but none of this seems healthy and normal.  I&#x27;ve been following the financial press for a long time almost daily, and I&#x27;m pretty confident no one&#x27;s proclamations of the bottom or top can be trusted in advance.  We&#x27;ll know in months or years whether we&#x27;re in a top.')
