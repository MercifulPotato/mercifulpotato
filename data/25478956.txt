The USA was a country that declared independence and fought a war over taxation. The colonies as a whole were a magnet for opportunistic pioneers -- in fact, for much of history, &quot;opportunistic pioneer&quot; (for better or worse) was and is what people think of when they think of American.<p>So while you&#x27;re correct that it is a certain kind of greed and self-interest, where I can&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re trying to say is &quot;how far X has gone.&quot; What does how far mean? The greed has been at this level since nation&#x27;s conception. And ostensibly, it was the whole &#x2F;point&#x2F; of the nation.')
