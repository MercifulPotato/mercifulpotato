He claimed in 2016 that he lost the popular vote due to voter fraud. And again in 2020 he’s claiming that he lost due to voter fraud. In 2012 and 2016 there was never any evidence of massive voter fraud found, Trump even appointed a committee to investigate 2016 and found nothing.<p>Now for the past two weeks, lawsuits have been getting thrown out and nothing substantial has been found. But Trump somehow knew there was voter fraud one day after the election?<p>Trump must prove there’s voter fraud and given his history, there’s no reason to think he will. Every Secretary of State and even the director of cyber security has said there was no massive voter fraud, Trump fired the director for saying that.<p>Taking all of these facts together and saying that we have no faith in Trumps claims, somehow this makes us the biased ones?')
