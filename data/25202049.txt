You mention day-traders, but what about tiny screens sliding out from behind larger screens swiveling out from behind yet larger screens is helpful? Why is this better than one, much larger screen (i.e. a laptop with a 24&quot; monitor or larger)? Why is there a screen embedded next to the keyboard? Was it just another place to squeeze a screen in, or is there an actual use-case for that? And is that a tiny little screen in the upper left portion of the bezel around what I would normally call the &quot;main&quot; screen? What&#x27;s that for?<p>Are there digital nomad day-traders who are even interested in using a laptop in the first place? Where are they that they don&#x27;t mind carrying this very heavy device around, where they have access to a power outlet to use it<i>?<p></i> What is the purpose of the battery, actually? It doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s meant for practical use, since it seems it would last for less than an hour in ideal circumstances. Is it sort of a mobile UPS?')
