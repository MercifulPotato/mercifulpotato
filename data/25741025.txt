I&#x27;d like to think I and my many fellow pacifists can do something about our behavior. I have zero effect on China, and most of their more recent supposed misdeeds are straight-up propaganda bullshit anyway. Compare their methods in Africa with ours. We send in AFRICOM, flood the zone with weapons and ammunition, undermine and eventually murder any democratically-elected leader who supports socialism on the level of e.g. Germany, etc. The Chinese hire locals to build factories and then they hire and train more locals to work in those factories.<p>Any time I hear the word &quot;abhorrent&quot; I think of all the Native Americans, enslaved Africans, Filipinos, Guatemalans, Colombians, Indonesians, Vietnamese, Afghans, etc. whose lives were ground up in the gristmill of USA capitalism.')
