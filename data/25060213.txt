If you read on Ableton website:<p>&gt; Live uses one thread to process a signal path. A signal path is a single chain of audio flow. In tracks where instrument or effect racks are used, with multiple chains in parallel, Live may use one thread per chain depending on how CPU-intensive each chain may be. If two tracks are &quot;chained&quot; by routings, for instance by a side-chain routing, a track being fed to a return track or any tracks being fed into each-other, they are considered dependent tracks and count as one signal path. Any dependant set of tracks will use one thread each.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.ableton.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;209067649-Multi-core-CPU-handling-FAQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.ableton.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;209067649-Multi-c...</a><p>The way they allocate plugins to threads is very inefficient and wrapping each plugin in a separate process sidesteps it as the OS takes over the allocation to different cores.')
