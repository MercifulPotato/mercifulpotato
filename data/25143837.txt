Within that there are very nuanced conversations to be had about when the threshold for force or fraud has been reached.<p>Enforcement of contracts is essential to a healthy society, but is it good to enforce a contract where one party either lied or coerced the other to sign? No, or at least not necessarily.<p>The nature of the contract between social media platforms and their users (both explicit and implicit) has changed dramatically since the days that Twitter was &quot;the free speech wing of the free speech party&quot;. Users have sacrificed a increasing amount of privacy for less and less obvious benefit.  In the meantime, many people have come to depend upon these services for connecting with others, for their livelihoods, and for news independent of corporate media.<p>Have the social media companies deceived their users? Or have they forced unconscionable terms upon their users?  Have they violated consumer protection laws?<p>I am not a lawyer. I don&#x27;t know the answers to those questions.  But I do know that there are some lawyers and judges who <i>do</i> think that some of these social media companies have overstepped.  We don&#x27;t necessarily need a civil rights case, or a constitutional amendment, or even to repeal Section 230.  All I think is necessary is for existing contract and consumer protection laws be litigated and enforced.<p>This kind of action would benefit both left and right, and I think is more constructive than opportunistically deciding that &quot;businesses can do whatever they want&quot; when you think it only hurts people on the right.')
