I wonder what happens to metals mixed in the oil, do mushroom suck those in as well or somehow filter them and leave in the ground?<p>Old oil well and refinery sites in the developing world are full of ponds with a mix of water and oil&#x2F;oil products that often come as a result of cleaning processes. Over time, due to evaporation and dust, these turn into asphalt like hard substances. Mushrooms could be a low cost solution to removing those over time, the slow speed of growth won&#x27;t that much of issue as with fresh oil spills.')
