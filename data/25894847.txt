An accidental diversion of the colorado river creates the largest lake in California (I think) and a community springs up around it. You have jet skiing, sun bathing, and other activities that local californians can partake in.<p>Agricultural runoff and a lack of an outlet slowly kills the artifical lake until its completely poisoned and millions of fish die and wash up on the shores spelling doom for the new community.<p>I&#x27;ve camped there several times and I recommend anyone near Socal to go check it out. It gives off very dystopian vibes but you can&#x27;t help but awe and gawk while watching the locals like you&#x27;re watching the last of humans in planet of the apes. It&#x27;s wild.<p>I can&#x27;t find the pic of missing kissing a fish bone but here a few pics I could scrounge up.<p>The jesus loves you mountain is outside the salton sea but I find it amazing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;39lJ047" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;39lJ047</a>')
