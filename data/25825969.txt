In C, however, if the integers are not unsigned, the add&#x2F;sub version exhibits UB on overflow, because C unnecessarily ties signed&#x2F;unsignedness with overflow behavior (UB, two&#x27;s complement, etc.).<p>Not that this is important, but could hint why this trick is more often shown with XOR than with add&#x2F;sub.')
