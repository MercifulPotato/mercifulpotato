The new Surface Pro X at least has an EFI and the drivers are somewhat there instead of not at all. It would be an order or magnitude less work to get that running Linux properly instead of the M1.<p>My opinion: I&#x27;m not expecting to see usable Linux on M1 devices any time soon. Apple are nicer about this than they are usually however - they want to prove that their new platform can be taken seriously and do general purpose computing - it looks like they lightly hinted at cooperating with Microsoft about Windows on ARM (though it may just be deflection).<p>They are pretty certainly not going to develop any drivers for anyone else, but I think there&#x27;s a (low) chance we&#x27;ll see documentation that will allow others to do so.')
