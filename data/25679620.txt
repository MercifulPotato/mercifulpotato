Retraining pilots and qualifying them would have meant new operational costs for airlines operating the 737 Max negating the benefit of the more efficient bigger engines.  That pushed Boeing to try to make the Max series fly &quot;like&quot; a regular 737.  Problem is that they couldn&#x27;t hide the fact that crappy software written by $7&#x2F;hour coders is a poor substitute for an airframe scaled up to match the bigger engine size.  Deaths were inevitable when they decided to lie to the pilots about what was actually going on.  Done correctly, the software fix could have been workable, but the design of MCAS was piss poor.')
