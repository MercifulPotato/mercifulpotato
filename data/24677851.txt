The biggest ones are asset protection and incontestable estate succession.<p>IMHO, if your net worth is over about 250k (or lower if you have a high risk profile) your assets should probably be held in an offshore LLC, trust, or foundation. This makes them effectively untouchable by lawsuit, divorce proceedings, seizure, etc.<p>If you are concerned that your will provisions will be contested or that a lawsuit between siblings is likely when you die, offshore estate management also makes those things impossible.<p>Since in only costs 1-3 thousand US to set up effective offshore asset management, and maintaining it is 200-1200 a year, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for peace of mind.')
