Now let me tell you Why Rust is miles ahead than Swift.<p>1. Swift abstract away lot of memory management by defaulting to thread safe reference counting. In Rust you are free to use stack, heap and wide range of other option. Rust has a freedom here. ARC is basically a garbage collection whatever apple say.<p>2. Rust pattern matching is novel. You can see match on csharp, php because its so good.<p>3. Rust is far better in concurrency world.<p>4. Cross Platform support is Meh in Swift. Its starting but its too far. \nIf you are writing ios app or anything for mac yes swift is ahead.<p>But in other field Rust is far ahead. See the link for fair comparison.  I have used various PL in my life time from c, c++ , java, swift , rust etc. And I am not biased towards rust. But simply saying swift is miles ahead is totally unfair to me.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;v4.chriskrycho.com&#x2F;rust-and-swift.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;v4.chriskrycho.com&#x2F;rust-and-swift.html</a>')
