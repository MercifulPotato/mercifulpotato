Item(by='zamalek', descendants=None, kids=[25709190], score=None, time=1610246705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25706987, text='&gt; Genius Bar nearby where it’s not unusual to get free out of warranty repairs for things that aren’t your fault.<p>Is this sarcasm? You can pick basically any video on Rossman&#x27;s channel and come across a case where Genius Bar either refused to repair a known device defect (without charging the customer for a logic board replacement), or botched a repair. Genius Bar is the <i>last</i> place you should take your Apple device for repairs.<p>Apple customer support&#x27;s only advantage is that it actually exists.')
