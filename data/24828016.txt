Not as many doors will be open to me.  I tend to think less about what I can <i>do</i> and more about what I will be able to <i>maintain</i> later on as my situation deteriorates.  Just as as most adolescents accept that they won&#x27;t be astronauts or Presidents, I have had to accept that far more mundane things will simply be out of reach.<p>As a life, it is <i>smaller</i> than most, not quite as brightly colored as that of a you who would have been healthy.<p>I try to be prepared to do things when I have that energy available to me, but I make sure that those things are important, because I cannot fritter away the few times I am capable.<p>You also have to develop some patience: patience with explaining things to strangers who may or may not be well-meaning with their questions, patience with friends who do not &quot;get&quot; that you won&#x27;t be able to make it that night, and finally patience with yourself for not meeting your own expectations.<p>This all sounds very Zen when I put it that way but I am keeping much of the sadness and bitterness out of my description.')
