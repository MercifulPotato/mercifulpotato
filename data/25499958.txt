This doesn&#x27;t vary with sincerity, but rather with substantiveness and flammability. Those are the variables you need to modulate.<p>We have to moderate effects (or likely effects), not intent. Effects are observable while intent often isn&#x27;t, and of course it&#x27;s effects which actually make a difference on the site, whether intended or not.<p>Intent doesn&#x27;t communicate itself, especially on flammable topics, so the burden is on the commenter to disambiguate it. One way to do this is to write thoughtfully and add information. Your reply here is already much better than your GP comment. This often happens in response to moderationâ€”people respond by explaining some of the background that was in their mind but which they didn&#x27;t say earlier. The thing to do is to include more of that in the first place, and then it will be clear that your intent is substantive discussion rather than provocation.<p>Here are some previous explanations in case they&#x27;re helpful:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=disambiguate%20burden%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=disambiguate%20burden%20by:dan...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=troll%20effects%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=troll%20effects%20by:dang&amp;date...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22expected%20value%22%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22expected%20value%22%20by:da...</a>')
