Item(by='slykar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610698258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763828, text='&gt; turn to the person next to you and whisper a question or look at their notes?<p>Person next to you has the same low quality notes you do. In my group we designated a single person to take notes and after the class you just snapped a photo, since no other materials were provided. Other people were listening and trying to understand the subject. Taking notes is distracting you from learning.<p>Making friends in a class of 100-200 people is hard. My friend went to a Berlin university. You are just a number there. I find it much easier to engage in a discussion using a forum.<p>&gt; Meet older students<p>How do you approach them? You have no idea who they are. You are never in class with them. University is basically the same model as high school here. You are not picking subjects or classes, you have to follow a script. You only meet students of your year.<p>There are some sorts of after hours interest circles, but they start after your 6 hours of learning.<p>Peer learning can also be done online or after an online course.<p>The good parts of university are the ones that can be done outside of it, hence there&#x27;s no need to visit the building at all.')
