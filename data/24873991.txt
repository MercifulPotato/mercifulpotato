Japan&#x27;s bailout of its corporate sector was contingent on its corporate sector removing their supply chains from China.<p>A lot of natural incentives, globally, are not going China&#x27;s way right now. A lot of corporations are going to repatriate or localize their supply chains, because, at long last, supply chains, and not labour, are the cost-center of most corporations. Over the next decade we&#x27;re actually going to become a less globalized world from a manufacturing perspective.<p>Finally, while the manufacturing sector has always had more friendly relationships with China, the technology sector (particularly software) has a much more ambivalent relationship with China; and now tech makes up a huge percentage of corporate power. Given that Western domestic politics is becoming more economically nationalist and that the corporate sector of most Western countries is gaining less benefit from the labour arbitrage that China offers them, I think we&#x27;ll see a significant draw down in economic power from China over the next 10-30 years. There will be sectors that stay in China, like high-tech hardware, but even they will become more regionalized as well. You&#x27;ll start to see <i>some</i> iPhones (or whatever) get made in Western countries as hedges against the need to rapidly draw down manufacturing in China.<p>The Washington Consensus in the 90s thought that normalizing trade relations with China would turn them into a Democracy. No one who is serious thinks that any more, and given China&#x27;s current bad bout with human rights violations there is a convenient cover for the West to take.<p>My two cents.')
