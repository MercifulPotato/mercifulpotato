We found that this process was always the same.<p>1) Collect data from users and create a place to store it in (database, filesystem, etc)\n2) Organize the data we&#x27;ve collected, so you can find it later\n3) Process the data we&#x27;ve collected. Processing could include transforming the data, performing an action or sending the data to another system<p>This led us to create FormKiQ.<p>FormKiQ is a platform application that gives developers 100% control of their data, letting them automatically perform actions on the data through an event messaging architecture.<p>We’ve built FormKiQ with AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The reason for this is that we wanted a system that didn’t require any configuring and managing of servers, and we also wanted a system we could both scale automatically in periods of high usage and cost next to nothing when barely being used.<p>We have found a lot of use cases for FormKiQ so far, and we wanted to share it with the HN community for ideas and to maybe even find a few people willing to try it out for their specific needs. We are still early in our development and looking for any kind of feedback!<p>Please visit:<p>Website: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.formkiq.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.formkiq.com&#x2F;</a> \nGitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;formkiq&#x2F;formkiq-core" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;formkiq&#x2F;formkiq-core</a>')
