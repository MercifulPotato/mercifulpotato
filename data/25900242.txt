If you scale that up to the 75KW+ batteries being put into EVs today buying an inverter could be a good investment if you live in an area with frequent power outages (or a cabin or whatnot).<p>There was also some talk about Teslas being able to send power back to the house with the new HPWC - not sure if that ever happened.')
