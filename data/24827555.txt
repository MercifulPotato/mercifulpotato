It&#x27;s different for every DM but on the site overall it&#x27;s pretty high. I think part of it is due to how much people really do want to play, and that they have paid for the session. I really do like the incentives idea though. That is something I want to explore more of now. Like a loyalty program for playing in a campaign.')
