Both times I was at a stop sign. The second time the guy just said &quot;oh sorry, the sun was in my eyes.&quot; Meanwhile I thought I was going to be pushed into moving traffic and die by someone who in no way could have avoided me. Took me a full minute to catch my breath and gain enough composure to lay into the guy who hit me. He never got out of his car, never said sorry (real sorry), nothing. I&#x27;ve had cars chase me because they don&#x27;t think I should be riding in the right most lane (no bike lane or construction).<p>One time a Pizza Hut driver almost killed me. I called his boss, they didn&#x27;t care.<p>One time an <i></i><i>UBER DRIVER</i><i></i> almost hit me and then proceeded to chase me because I yelled and flipped him off. I sent a photo of the license place to Uber and the local PD, nothing. Not even an acknowledgement.<p>The fact is that people don&#x27;t care. You go on HN or Reddit and people will complain and actively encourage hitting riders. It is always the rider&#x27;s fault, even if the driver broke the law. And I&#x27;m tired of it. I don&#x27;t care if the rider was in the wrong, you&#x27;re a lot more squishy on a bike than in a plastic housing with a motor. There&#x27;s this weird dichotomy of not caring about the life or safety of someone.')
