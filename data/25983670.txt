If someone said &quot;You believe murder is wrong, I don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t try to force your morality on me&quot; to justify murder, most people wouldn&#x27;t buy into that logic. Obviously not all cases are as clear-cut as that, but when it comes to ethical concerns, the attitude of &quot;you do your thing, I&#x27;ll do mine&quot; doesn&#x27;t really apply.')
