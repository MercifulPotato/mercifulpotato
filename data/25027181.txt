They could claim that being able to recommend food based on your past searches is part of their core functionality, and that requires saving searches in cookies, or saving them on the server side with a fingerprint on your side.<p>You could argue that Yelp is only a yellow pages of restaurants and therefore no cookies are essential. Someone else could argue that they are much more than a yellow pages, that if they were only a yellow pages they would not be profitable and cease to exist, and that their core reason of existence is their recommendation engine. To that person, essential functionality would require more things to be stored.<p>Then there is a regulatory aspect. Some governments may require their companies to install trackers of sorts. Some governments just don&#x27;t give a damn and let their companies do as they please. GDPR is not a universal law. It&#x27;s an EU law. Nobody else has to follow it, and there is no way you&#x27;ll convince every country in especially Asia, Africa, and South America to follow GDPR.
