Item(by='fundamental', descendants=None, kids=[24818873], score=None, time=1603035652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24817447, text='Congrats on getting your project to the MVP stage. Right now the landing page seems to do a reasonable job (IMO) at pitching the &#x27;WHY&#x27; as you&#x27;ve laid out in your comment here, but as it stands it doesn&#x27;t showcase the how&#x2F;what.<p>Per q1, Meetings at my organization currently tend to be pretty freeform, so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s a problem that really needs solving, though I&#x27;d personally appreciate if things had somewhat more structure as described by your MVP.<p>Per q2&#x2F;4, without signing up, it&#x27;s not entirely clear. I&#x27;d recommend the getting started page either having more detail or having a learn more page which shows the workflow your application provides with basic screenshots prior to requiring a sign up. As per the application itself, the way you describe the &#x27;WHAT&#x27; here seems like you may need to be cautious about the scope of the application. Typically organizations will have existing tooling for meetings to occur in (just a normal conference room reservation, slack, teams, gotomeeting, etc, etc, etc). The pitch of the idea seems to have your project being an organizational tool on the side, so creating meetings&#x2F;inviting individuals is likely being done elsewhere and the tooling you provide would fall into managing the flow of the meeting.<p>Per q3, given that meetings are not currently managed in this style my current org would likely not use such a tool even at no cost.')
