That&#x27;s the actual value of the stock right now.<p>If the stock climbs too much, and the short sellers default, the stock is worthless.<p>TBH, this is the short sellers own fault. They made the assumption that the market was &quot;fair&quot;, and that they were going to buy back the shares for cheap when they needed them as a consequence.<p>That assumption was wrong.')
