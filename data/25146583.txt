I went in there with an open mind, thinking maybe I was wrong about the imaginary property thing. I came out of there more certain that imaginary property laws are bad, however I also came away greatly impressed by all the people there (many who worked there way there from some of the most destitute places on earth, so who am I to say they shouldn’t buy that Tesla because it’s money from imaginary property laws?). I have been secretly confused about Microsoft’s strategy the past 6 or 7 years under Satya. The embrace of Linux, open source, GitHub, vscode; it seems Microsoft is sprinting away from depending on Imaginary Property laws, but that was traditionally the source of their enormous profits in the 90’s. I don’t claim to understand what’s going on at the c-level (those folks are way smarter than me), but it does seem like there is a new game plan. My first week in 2014 people were laughing at me for getting Ubuntu on my machine, and pitching GitHub over SOurceDepot; how things have changed.<p>But yeah, I felt guilty when I crashed my bike on the way to work; walked over to the on site hospital and got X-rays and a sling without a copay ; got paid $50 while I was there to get a flu shot; grabbed a latte on my way back to the desk; committed a few línea; then clocked out early to head to the pool. Knowing that it’s most likely imaginary property laws paying for the utopia in Redmond. I really hope more people can work at places like that, and I do hope that places like that are still possible without an unnatural imaginary property system.')
