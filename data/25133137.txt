Local setup for a static site repo is trivial if you use an existing repo as a starting point.<p>Most static site gen templates include RSS feeds (removing the need for the &quot;built-in newsletter&quot;) and are light enough to run circles around AMP pages. Given the easy setup, all that&#x27;s left is deployment: a problem with a million simple solutions.<p>I notice this is targeted at developers. What does this offer for a developer capable of posting to HN, Reddit, the Fediverse, etc.; running `make` to generate their blog; and combining `git push` with their preferred deployment solution (rsync in CI&#x2F;CD, Netlify, GitHub Pages)?<p>We already have the ability to blog in markdown on our own domain, with a copy of the content in a git repo. Am I missing anything?')
