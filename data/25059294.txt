It&#x27;s &quot;externally callable,&quot; that is, it can see transitively if something is just locally public or not.<p>You also can&#x27;t dynamically generate functions at runtime, or do things like method_missing, so this ends up being much more complete than a similar analysis in a language with those sorts of features.')
