They won&#x27;t transfer you. They won&#x27;t share their number. What they&#x27;ll do is send the police.<p>I can safely say, in retrospect, that although I survived it, it took nearly a decade to fully heal from that event. But in the mean time, I also learned (thanks to posts like these) about the Samaritans and later in the UK, they helped me get through the tougher moments of this process.<p>I don&#x27;t know how significant the effect is, but it&#x27;s non-zero. :)')
