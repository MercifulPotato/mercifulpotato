Given the duration of a citizenship, it doesn&#x27;t sound a bad requirement.<p>Some countries, though, require you to have only one citizenship, which implies you will have to get rid of whatever citizenship you have. But that was not the point of your incorrect statement.<p>Once thing that is common in Europe is citizenship by family, and I am not aware of a country (in Europe) that allows citizenship by being born in that place. In fact, I am just aware of United States and Brazil with the latter rule, but I never investigated it further.')
