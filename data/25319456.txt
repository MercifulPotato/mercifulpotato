Anyone tells you to start from the Greeks they are snobs. Showing off and&#x2F;or having a laugh at your expense. \n2) Think about _your_ own &quot;bigger life questions&quot;, what are they, what interests you. Give it time. Read something like Russell&#x27;s History of western philosophy or list through a Philosophical dictionary. See who feels closer, more relevant to _you_. Maybe try this thing <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.denizcemonduygu.com&#x2F;philo&#x2F;browse&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.denizcemonduygu.com&#x2F;philo&#x2F;browse&#x2F;</a>\n3) Don&#x27;t concentrate too much on the names. Same authors have books or parts on different subjects. Some of them will be to your liking some not.\n4) Don&#x27;t get into large complex works right away. For example Locke&#x27;s essays on human understanding or Kant&#x27;s Critique of Pure Reason would be a major pain in the butt to read as first philosophy book and you&#x27;d have to reread them later not to mention that you&#x27;ll have to reread them anyway and not just once... Treatises on Government and&#x2F;or Kant&#x27;s Pragmatic Anthropology would give better chances to get hooked on. So you don&#x27;t just autopilot read through the big ones without properly understanding a thing.<p>edit: 5) Then the Greeks ;)')
