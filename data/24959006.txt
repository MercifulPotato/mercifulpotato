Here is a young untouchable girl&#x27;s article in 1855 that sheds a light on the brutal oppression and subjugation that was already deeply ingrained in Indian society, and how the British introduced some balance.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forwardpress.in&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;165-years-ago-first-female-dalit-writer-wrote-about-the-grief-of-the-mangs-and-the-mahars&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forwardpress.in&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;165-years-ago-first-fema...</a><p>From the article:<p>The Mang and Mahar children never dare lodge a complaint even if the Brahman children throw stones at them and injure them seriously. They suffer silently because they know they have to go to the Brahmans’ houses to beg for the leftover food. Alas! O God! What agony this! I will burst into tears if I write more about this injustice. Because of such oppression, the merciful God has bestowed on us, this benevolent British government. Let us see how our pain has been mitigated under this government.<p>Earlier, Gokhale, Apate, Trimkaji, Andhala, Pansara, Kale, Behre, etc [all Brahman surnames], who showed their bravery by killing rats in their homes, persecuted us, not sparing even pregnant women, without any rhyme or reason. This has stopped now. Harassment and torture of Mahars and Mangs, common during the rule of Peshwas in Pune, have stopped. Now, human sacrifice for the foundation of forts and mansions has stopped – now, nobody buries us alive. Now, our population is growing in numbers. Earlier, if any Mahar or Mang wore fine clothes, they would say that only Brahmans should wear such clothes. Seen in fine clothes, we were earlier accused of stealing such clothes. Their religion was in danger of being polluted when Untouchables put clothes around their bodies; they would tie them to a tree and punish them. But, under British rule, anybody with money can buy and wear clothes. Earlier, punishment for any wrongdoing against the upper castes was to behead the guilty Untouchable— now, it has stopped. Excessive and exploitative tax has stopped. The practice of untouchability has stopped in some places. Killing has stopped on the playground. Now, we can even visit the marketplace.')
