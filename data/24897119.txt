It&#x27;s not site&#x27;s assets being protected here.<p>We are protecting users from sites coordinating their actions via the presence of resources. If I visit store.example they might cache a &#x2F;big-spender resource. Then if I visit other.example, they can check to see if I have &#x2F;big-spender cached.<p>As a user, I ought to be protected against coordinated tracking mechanisms like this. Content Security Policy might be able to let store.example protect it&#x27;s asset, but in this case, the problem is that store.example might be deliberately exposing the cached&#x2F;not-cached state of that resource to others; it is the user, not the site&#x27;s content, that needs to be secured.<p>Thusfar the only safe we&#x27;ve found to do it is to have every site have it&#x27;s own naive, isolated, alone view of the world. This is, alas, in my perspective, extremely unfortunate. I picture the spider web of information being cut into pieces, broken apart. But I also recognize the necessity of this. I can&#x27;t stand it, but I see no alternatives. And makes me so sad that we will never ever see modules work on the web. That ~2011 was the last &amp; will forever be the last good year for CDNs, before CommonJS &amp; bundling took over, before we made CDNs no longer places of sharing.')
