You could specify how much money you make and get automatic feedback based on whether you are giving too little or too much for your use of those resources. I&#x27;ve seen multiple companies that have tried to do this &quot;fairness&quot; thing... but the most popular one is still patreon and that&#x27;s too much manual work. There are many hard problems with this proposal, mostly how do you do the communication&#x2F;monitoring of the elements you want to donate for and this system, and how you determine if what software developers &#x2F; artists &#x2F; whatever are asking for is fair or not (this is the really big one), but it doesn&#x27;t seem so far fetched. What we all really want is a fair distribution of the rewards for our efforts. We have to solve this at some point, and the obstacles are friction, the previously mentioned determination of &quot;reasonable compensation&quot;, and consensus on <i>the</i> tool to solve these two (which should be funded through itself).')
