The strength difference between the average man and average woman is the difference between the average NFL linebacker and the average man. Do you think it right that the average woman&#x27;s ability to obtain justice is dependent on whether some man stands up for her? And yet that is how things tend to work out in an honor culture.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of guns described as &#x27;the great equalizer&#x27;.  An NFL linebacker, average man, and an average woman would each have an approximately equal ability to obtain &#x27;justice&#x27;.<p>&gt; I want to live in a law and order society. A place where potential rapists are deciding whether to worry about the police, and not whether to worry about me.<p>As someone else pointed out, the prison term for rape is about 10 years. So in your society, potential rapists worry about facing 10 years in prison, and in the other, an extrajudicial death penalty.  Seems to me the latter might be a better deterrent.')
