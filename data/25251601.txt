The whole carb has a much lower glycemic index thanks to fiber whereas the processed carb has a glycemic index closer to table sugar. Foods with a very high glycemic index cause glycation, which is when there is too much sugar in the blood and it starts crumpling proteins and causing other bad health effects. Whole carbs are fine for this reason because they tend to be very bulky and filling, so your stomach will usually be full before you can eat enough to cause bodily harm.')
