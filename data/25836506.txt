Item(by='aaomidi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611079531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25836349, text='&gt; where bad ideas die and good ideas spread.<p>Why do we assume this is true? Billions of people get scammed in the world yearly. Yes. Billions.<p>Mass hysteria[1] is a thing, and sure in the long term an idea __may__ die out (again, there&#x27;s no real evidence of this). The damage done until it does die out can lead to a rise in cult of personality like how Hitler came into power and became so popular in Germany.<p>There isn&#x27;t some natural filter of hate and __bad__ ideas in humans. People are sheep and will put their weight behind anyone who resonates with them. Not necessarily &quot;good&quot; ideas.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_mass_hysteria_cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_mass_hysteria_cases</a>')
