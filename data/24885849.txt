Stability was better, drivers more performant, and I don&#x27;t remember daily fighting with memory leaks.<p>And X.Org&#x27;s driver architecture could be replaced completely (in fact, it could be made to run on the same stack as Wayland) - it wouldn&#x27;t be the first compositing Xserver around, and could use methods that would deal with noticeable to many lag involved in compositor-based UI.')
