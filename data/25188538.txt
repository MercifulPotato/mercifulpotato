And you got me thinking about just <i>why</i> MJF might not have just straight up admitted to cocaine or amphetamine use during those times (especially now as he presents a more tempered tone as he faces his own mortality). Back to the Future was his first movie and he has said that the grueling process was &quot;worth it&quot;(it basically launched the career that he moved to hollywood seeking). If he ever publicly stated that drugs helped him succeed, it would come off as an endorsement. This was the first article where I&#x27;ve seen him say he &quot;smoked a lot of pot&quot; and had a drinking problem and it may just be that those admissions are more generally accepted now (and without the same &#x27;drugs are bad&#x27; stigma.)')
