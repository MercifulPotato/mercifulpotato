Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25790894], score=None, time=1610718160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25790310, text='&gt; as opposed to Hotwire which either does full page dumb replacement or asks you to define which sections to replace<p>It&#x27;s not that dumb in practice because for a lot of things Hotwire uses HTTP instead of WebSockets which means you can take advantage of what HTTP has to offer such as caching.<p>That means if you decide to dynamically load a menu&#x27;s contents with a Hotwire Turbo Frame then it&#x27;s only sent over the wire once and assuming its content doesn&#x27;t change, it&#x27;ll serve a 304 content not modified for future requests.<p>For pushing updates with Turbo Stream which is done over WebSockets, I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll push that snippet of HTML (let&#x27;s say a user&#x27;s comment) over WebSockets and then either append or prepend it to the DOM based on however you configured it to be inserted. And if you edited that comment later on, it will replace that snippet of HTML that was previously sent (since it&#x27;s the same ERB template). It won&#x27;t re-render the full page.')
