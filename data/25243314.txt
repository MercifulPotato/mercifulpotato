I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s as good as other apps. I mean, if you&#x27;re keeping a to-do list, better to do that in Apple Reminders -- especially now that they&#x27;ve added that new shared list feature and assigning todos. But if you have to put up with Jira, then yes, I personally find the Jira app to be faster than the website. It reminds me why I like apps as much (or more) than websites.<p>I&#x27;ve also run Jira on a server before, and if you optimize the Java runtime&#x27;s settings and over-provision, you can get a pretty fast Jira instance going. It&#x27;s just most folks rarely touch the default configurations, which are terrible, or don&#x27;t shell out for SSDs when running it. And the cloud version ... well, it seems a bit under-provisioned if you ask me. Jira doesn&#x27;t appear to be written well enough to take full advantage of the cloud, yet.')
