There can be some imperfections (e.g. &quot;barrel distortions&quot;), but these are pretty small. Compared to a single lens, a fancy telephoto lens captures more light (producing a brighter image), it may blur the out-of-focus part of the picture more, and it has less chromatic aberration, but the perspective projection is the same.<p>The perspective distortion comes for landscape photos are due to the field of view. So the absolute distance between lens and sensor doesn&#x27;t matter, what matters is the ratio between that distance and the width of the sensor. As long as that ratio is the same as the ratio of the eye-to-picture distance and width of the picture, the perspectives will match.<p>The problem is that if you are looking at a landscape with your bare eyes, you will look at a quite large field of view. To reproduce that field of view when looking at the picture, you probably need to print it several meters wide, and look at it from a meter away or so. If you take a photo with the same field of view but print it at a handheld size, it will look &quot;too small&quot; and the perspective will seem exaggerated.')
