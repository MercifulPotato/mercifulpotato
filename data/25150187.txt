This removes one of the major <i>obvious</i> benefits in that analysis (AMP pages may still benefit but it&#x27;s harder to qualify), so there may be a stronger technical argument within companies to drop support.<p>&gt; <i>It will continue to rank by &quot;page experience signals&quot;, and presumably AMP pages will continue to be the standard to beat.</i><p>This is a tricky prospect. A concrete &quot;we will treat your AMP page preferentially&quot; is a lot easier for tech managers to grok than &quot;AMP stands a good chance of scoring well on metrics we prioritise, so may be preferred, if you believe you can&#x27;t achieve these metrics without AMP&quot;.<p>On the flip side, it&#x27;s completely conceivable that Google could continue to treat AMP pages preferentially while claiming it&#x27;s due to proxy metrics, since their algorithms are not public.')
