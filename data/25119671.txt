Your team may not, your direct reports won&#x27;t and your management hierarchy may not, however, your business will. If you have certain principles such as support for LBGTQ+, anti-military contracts, or a conservative in tech for example, and your company signs a contract to work with another organization that doesn&#x27;t care about the cause or are completely against it, what happens? I know CEO&#x27;s who can&#x27;t fire bad clients because they don&#x27;t own their own company.<p>&gt;Walking away from his business means the collapse of his reputation, failing his employees, and failing his family.<p>Walking away from bad business can make you so much money it&#x27;s hard to imagine. I&#x27;ve had conversations about doing business with shady people, which resulted in me making a deal with the person who had the same experience with the other individual.<p>&gt;On the other hand, a weak business and&#x2F;or business owner will be very vulnerable to principle-based compromise.<p>Growing pains, but an employee who is competent or incompetent will face the same dilemma because of what I suggested earlier.<p>I call it being a slave earlier, to intentionally raise alarm. I don&#x27;t know of a way to define it but you don&#x27;t have to go to sleep at night thinking, well, I didn&#x27;t like that decision and now I need to change my entire life or deal with it. I.e. find a new job, change my commute, change my schedule, acquaint yourself with a new environment, meet new people and so on. An owner, is doing this on a daily basis already.')
