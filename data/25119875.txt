Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605582402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117596, text='When I travel as a business user, I don&#x27;t check any of the hotels apart from the top most brands. Sometimes, even if there is a 5 star hotel from a brand I don&#x27;t know of, I wouldn&#x27;t choose it over a 4 star hotel of a brand I do know of. The vast majority of business travelers behave (or book via their companies) the same way more or less.<p>When I&#x27;m choosing a place for a vacation, again, I&#x27;m looking at the top brands I know of, including AirBnB. Since the major hotels all resemble my business hotels, I&#x27;m more or less stuck looking at AirBnB rentals, simply because it&#x27;s a more casual brand that I know of. I assume the vast majority of casual travelers are just like me.<p>I&#x27;ve had very good experiences using AirBnB in smaller towns, even in otherwise poorer places in Asia and Europe. On the contrary, I&#x27;ve had shitty AirBnB experiences, mostly in large cities in developed markets.')
