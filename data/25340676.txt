What if it&#x27;s &quot;Both&quot;?<p>About 20 years ago I got escalated to high-tier Comcast support for an issue that turned out to be a little of A, a little of B: Comcast (Might have been @Home, based on the timing) required that your MAC address be whitelisted as part of their onboarding process. Early home routers had a &quot;MAC Address Clone&quot; feature for precisely this reason. At some point, the leased network card got returned to Comcast. Our router continued to work just fine... until about a year later, when the local office put that network card into some other customer&#x27;s home. We started getting random disconnects in the middle of the day, and it took forever to diagnose, as the other customer was not particularly active with their internet use. Whose fault was it? Ours, for ARP Spoofing? Theirs, for requiring the spoofing?')
