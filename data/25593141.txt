They&#x27;ve put themselves on the path where they can&#x27;t abide by the GPL.  GPL3 says you must preserve the right to <i>run</i> the software and apple takes that away from their customers then sells it back.<p>So apple nopes out of it.  They rely on the initial boost they got from GPL software.  They do some MIT&#x2F;BSD licensed stuff (and publish some of it but not everything). Every year less and less happens, unless it&#x27;s their own language&#x2F;etc.<p>They do have nice gradients and round corners though. :)')
