A mortgage comes with down payment and a house for collateral.  You can end up underwater on an interest free home mortgage just as easy as one with a positive mortgage. The only difference is your monthly payment is lower without mortgage interest.<p>Also, if you default on the mortgage, you are also out your 20% down payment.<p>The part I find interesting about the current situation is that stocks are sky high going higher, but loan interest is low. This indicates to me that banks and institutions are desperate to park money anywhere but the stock market <i>despite</i> the incredible market performance.')
