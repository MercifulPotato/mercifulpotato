For purposes of this discussion, the point was that the video got rejected based on Climate Feedback.  And it got rejected by them on the basis of &quot;reports&quot; from two people, neither of whom had actually seen the video, and neither of whom thought it was problematic once they did see it.<p>So either Climate Feedback rejected it on their own, but lied about why (or had a bureaucratic error), or two reviewers told them it was problematic and then lied about doing so (or both forgot that they had done so).<p>Outsourcing checking for disinformation to people who lie and&#x2F;or have bureaucratic errors is going to have issues, even if those people are omniscient as to the facts of the subject matter... but nobody actually is that, either.')
