The trick with TDD though is that it&#x27;s simple to learn, but hard to master.<p>Another good practice is to reduce the &quot;blast radius&quot; of changes so that you&#x27;re dealing with one thing at a time. For example, don&#x27;t introduce a new type (class, interface) as a method parameter while implementing the new type while writing tests for it while changing all of the callers of the method to use the new type. One (small) thing at a time, and prefer to keep everything compiling and working except for that one thing you&#x27;re working on.<p>As for cooking etc., I differentiate between &quot;tidy&quot; and &quot;clean&quot;. Mid-process dirty is common, but I strongly prefer to keep my working area relatively tidy throughout.')
