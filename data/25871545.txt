Incase it helps, we’ve been running our own WebRTC infrastructure (TURN servers only at the moment) for the last 5 years. It’s globally distributed, fault tolerant and allows us to mitigate the high costs. We’re doing 10s of TB of traffic at a fraction of the cost. Would be happy to discuss our infra incase it helps.')
