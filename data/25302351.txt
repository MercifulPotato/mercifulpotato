I have a reasonable choice about whether to meet someone in person, but not whether to use electricity. And while both may be harmful, only one of them can be the <i>proximate</i> cause of the continued spread of disease and even death.<p>The strawman you&#x27;re building is that we put health &quot;before anything else&quot;. Being absolutist and making any one thing a priority to an extreme degree can of course be problematic. But asking people to properly wear masks in public, closing spaces where people do convene and not wear masks, and expecting people to relate to others virtually or from a distance are not &quot;putting health before anything else&quot; - they&#x27;re making health <i>one</i> priority. You&#x27;re making up the idea that it&#x27;s exclusive of everything else.')
