Without optimizations, it’s relatively easy to get the general gist of the code back, but once -O3 is added, the code doesn’t decompile easily.<p>If a line of assembly is:<p><pre><code>    mov eax, ebx\n</code></pre>\n...that doesn’t tell you anything about what eax and ebx refer to. They’re just x86 registers with no clear relationship back to the variables.<p>If Apple was demanding the debugging symbol database, that’d be something else. But they aren’t.')
