I can&#x27;t see it well because it&#x27;s tiny, and because the &quot;designers&quot; usually chose colors that are tough to distinguish, and sometimes very difficult to see at all.<p>For instance, the default console colors in Ubuntu are TERRIBLE (maybe for everyone). The output of &#x27;ls&#x27; uses blue letters on a black background for some type of file, and I literally cannot see those. Ditto for some errors in Emacs (e.g., trying to exit w&#x2F;o saving a file). That output is invisible.<p>If you are an engineer and decide to do something with color in your UI, please get some designer help and listen.')
