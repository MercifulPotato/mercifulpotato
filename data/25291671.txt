If that was the case I would be far less skeptical, but, aside form a few enthusiasts that make crypto transactions to make a point that &quot;people use these&quot; I don&#x27;t know of anyone that uses crypto for practical, everyday financial transactions.<p>Can you provide me some evidence that people are <i>using</i> crypto at a large scale, and that that scales in increasing in a way that it is anywhere near competing with banking services?
