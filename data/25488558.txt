It is not the Apple of the automotive world.<p>Quarterly profits for the most recent quarter (Q3 for most companies, Q2 for Honda): Toyota: $4.6 billion. Honda: $4 billion. GM: $4 billion.  VW: $3.8 billion. Ford: $2.4 billion.  Fiat: $1.4 million (not a typo, that is an m there.). In all cases, these profits were below their 2019 quarterly profits for the same quarter. Total of approximately 18.8 billion.<p>Tesla: $331 million, or approximately 1.5% of the Q3 profit share.<p>(Note that Hyundai had a loss and so is excluded from the profit share calculation. In all cases, these are <i>global</i> numbers. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caranddriver.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;a34602700&#x2F;auto-sales-profits-third-quarter-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caranddriver.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;a34602700&#x2F;auto-sales-profi...</a>. For all automakers except Tesla and Fiat, profits are related to the sale of automobiles. Fiat&#x27;s profit is related to a special one-time accounting event, and Tesla&#x27;s profit, as with all of its previous quarterly profits, relates to the sale of credits to other automakers; Tesla has yet to have a profitable quarter based on the sale of vehicles.)')
