Zip ties are bad, but they&#x27;re not in the same universe as IEDs. If they had IEDs I&#x27;d be <i>way</i> more open to the idea of characterizing this as terrorism, and all that comes with it.<p>Edit: It sounds like the cops say they found IEDs. I&#x27;ll be following that closely to update my view on the proper response to this.<p>Edit2: Actually the report is that the IEDs were not found at the Capitol or as part of that but near the RNC and DNC offices elsewhere, and a pipe bomb was found in a car. So there is no evidence that the people who entered the capitol were carrying bombs. The specifics in this case matter.')
