The interesting thing I gained from your statements is, it would appear that both parties are moving towards fascism or &quot;corporatism&quot; as Mussolini liked to put it, with all the military-industrial complex that comes with it. It is clear to most people how corporatism could be applied to the Republican party, but socialism is also a &quot;partnership&quot; between government and corporations where government regulations and incentives to the market bend it to the governments will (and both the Right &amp; Left have consistently increase the military-industrial complex). We may feel that climate intervention and laws implementing that needs to happen, but it is quite clearly a corporatism partnership with the government where companies are given marching orders with legal regulation, then given incentives to change their behaviour. Oddly enough, I think America is moving towards fascism, but the &quot;anti-fascists&quot; are just as guilty as the war hawks on Wall Street. There are very few people advocating truly a truly free society or scaling back the massive military-industrial complex and surveillance state.')
