In the past it used to have RIM, Nortel, Bell North and Corel. Today the largest Canadian tech company is &quot;Constellation Software&quot;.<p>And the reason for the decline is simple. Canada&#x27;s best and brightest don&#x27;t go into tech. They go into real estate and property development to extract value out of the insanely overheated housing market.<p>And ironically this ties back to the immigration discussion. One of the major contributing factors to the housing shortage is because of Canada&#x27;s aggressive pursuit of wealthy emigres. The housing market in places like Vancouver has turned into a slush fund to launder the money of CCP party members and other third world kleptocrats.')
