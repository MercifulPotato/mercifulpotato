I agree, that final scene in An American in Paris is just mindblowing (for the lack of a better word). I&#x27;ve seen it at least 20 times and it still amazes me. Vincente Minnelli was a one of a kind genius. Another highlight for me was Astair&#x27;s Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz from Blue Skies. And as for Gershwin - I myself prefer his Piano concerto.<p>2. As far as I know, musicals were the most popular genre in 1930s-40s and a lot of talent was put in their creation (and it shows). That said, I just don&#x27;t like the genre for two reasons:<p>- Astair&#x2F;Rogers-style, where actors suddenly transition from dialog to dancing, just seem too weird and far fetched to me;<p>- Busby Berkeley-style extravaganzas are, indeed, better and, as a rule, visually stunning. But for me they fail as films simply because there is usually not enough plot&#x2F;dialogues (that is, the whole plot is just a vehicle to show dancing sequences). These type of films are better enjoyed as short clips on youtube :-) Uncharacteristically, I&#x27;ve enjoyed much later Saturday Night Fever and Dirty Dancing, both made in this style. Although I think these two films could have been even better if their creators were more ambitious. There were a lot of unused potential in them.<p>3. I have no objections to the westerns as a genre. I&#x27;ve included both Destry Rides Again and Stagecoach. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve seen ~10 westerns from 50s and 60s, didn&#x27;t like any of them and decided to skip the genre altogether. I might return to them some time in the future.')
