Back in the old days, you paid for an advertisement in the newspaper. Your right to post that ad was completely controlled by that paper. If you posted an ad with inflammatory or blatantly false information, the newspaper would refuse to run your ad.\nImagine if I was Nixon running against JFK, and I attempted to buy an ad in the Times on the second page, immediately after the election, indicating that the election was fraudulent, and that I had actually won.  Would anybody have run that ad? Absolutely not. What&#x27;s incredible is that Twitter does actually allow these tweets but simply indicates the facts may not be accurate.')
