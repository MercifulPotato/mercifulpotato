Kids at home including a 2yo who needed regular attention.<p>2. Working late nights to get un-disrupted time for work (see 1).<p>3. Fear of getting a bad performance review (it ended up being not so great anyways).<p>4. Lack of interactions with co-worker and working odd hours led me to waste quite a bit of time on re-inventing the wheel at work.<p>5. Seattle freeze&#x2F;weather didn&#x27;t help either and a big stretch without vacation.<p>I took a 2 week break at end of December which coincided with end of our perf review period. Though I didn&#x27;t get the (perf) rewards I wanted, having it be over gave me a lot of clarity.<p>I felt we were lucky with flexible and stable jobs and good friends close-by. However, I always had a feeling&#x2F;pressure that I should be able to do it all (exercise&#x2F;work&#x2F;manage kids), and it was hard to balance all the expectations I had of myself leading to stress and an eventual burn-out.')
