But that doesn&#x27;t keep me from recognizing the ethical issues with killing and controlling other beings to survive. I really appreciate people pushing the envelope on this. If I could eat basically the same diet but have it all be from a replicator, I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat.  So keep pushing, vegans!')
