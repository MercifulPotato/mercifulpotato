Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=[24931061], score=None, time=1603982527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24930612, text='It does.<p>According to Wikipedia, <i>No true Scotsman, or appeal to purity, is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample.[1][2] Rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any new specific objective rule or criterion: &quot;no true Scotsman would do such a thing&quot;; i.e., those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group.</i><p>Now, with this definition in mind, let&#x27;s review the context of this discussion:<p>&gt; Using CoC&#x27;s to backstab people is not going to end well.<p>&gt; But that&#x27;s their only usecase, isn&#x27;t it?<p>&gt; No, CoCs are meant to clearly state that bigotry is unacceptable.<p>&gt; Oh really? This discussion is about someone that was persecuted and punished for violating a CoC. Do you see any bigotry involved in this story?<p>&gt; This discussion is about someone being punished by a committee for something that <i>wasnâ€™t</i> in the CoC, as you can read in the article.<p>So there was a debate about whether CoCs can be used as a weapon. gwbas1c rejected the idea that CoCs could be used as a weapon. barumi referenced OP article as a counter-example, to demonstrate an instance where a CoC was used as a weapon. pindab0ter then resorted to a &quot;no true scotsman&quot; fallacy to reject this counter-example. According to pindab0ter, this was not a &quot;true&quot; example of someone utilizing a CoC for attacking people, because the victim feels like they did not violate the CoC to an extent where such an attack was justified. This line of reasoning can be used to exclude all examples of people using a CoC as a weapon. After all, if someone feels like they violated a CoC and deserved their punishment, then they wouldn&#x27;t characterize the situation as an &quot;attack&quot; in the first place.')
