Isn&#x27;t that ironic? Central banks are begging for money making industries. There is this money making industry that they could have spent the printed money on instead of letting it lie in some bank account and push up the value of every stock and cryptocurrency. It&#x27;s money that could have employed low skilled workers in a fresh and growing industry and also save the planet. It&#x27;s never going to happen. People are so against the idea of technological progress the only way it&#x27;s going to happen is when it&#x27;s forced down their throat.')
