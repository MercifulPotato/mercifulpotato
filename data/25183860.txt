HCQ is available by at least 8 different manufacturers in America.<p>As a drug wholesaler, this drug increased from ~20$ for a 100ct bottle to ~$100 for a 100ct bottle. At its height of popularity in late April, all supply chain went to McKesson&#x2F;Cardinal&#x2F;Amerisource with daily allocations to smaller independent&#x2F;regional wholesalers. State boards of Pharmacy specifically changed law to make sure this drug was given to those that actually needed it for RA.<p>The author does make great points on big pharma and absurdity of patents&#x2F;costs, but HCQ is not a great way to illustrate that point.<p>Lastly, HCQ was so overproduced that by the end of July 100ct bottles were selling to smaller regional wholesalers off contract at $3-5 per 100 ct bottle. Patients can probably buy this cash pay from an independent pharmacy  for $10 now.')
