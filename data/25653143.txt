Even better - convert any “how to” guide into a personal checklist that you can use to track your progress.<p>I like to think of “how to” guides like recipes for how to do something specific to your team. This site helps you create and organize them.<p>Background: I’m a software engineer, and more recently a software engineering manager at one of the FAANG companies (I’m not mentioning which one just to retain a tiny bit of anonymity). My point, though, is that even at huge established companies, having one place to share your team’s “how to” guides isn’t easy. My company has a huge internal wiki. It’s awful. Search sucks, and it’s like the Wild Wild West — no structure at all.<p>Some teams&#x2F;companies try to solve this with “Knowledge Base” software, but I think what we need is a little simpler. Knowledge Bases are great for things like general information, strategy docs, and collaborative efforts… but not so much for straight-forward how-to guides (AKA SOPs or checklists).<p>At my current and all of my previous companies, we’ve always struggled with how and where to document our how-to guides&#x2F;SOPs&#x2F;checklists or whatever you want to call them. This grew out of my own need and I’m hoping to make something of it if other people find it useful too.<p>What I’d love feedback on:<p>1. Does the idea resonate? Does it apply to you and your team?<p>2. Does the messaging on the site make that clear?<p>3. I know it’s still pretty basic,  but does it provide enough value right now to be considered an MVP that people might pay for?<p>4. What did you like?<p>5. What’s missing?')
