I never found it all that much of a pleasure to use, but for people who were good at animation, it was a fairly powerful tool.  (I did Flash for a few years and spent most of my time writing ActionScript 3 in FDT, which was built on top of Eclipse; I left the animation stuff to people more capable in that department!)')
