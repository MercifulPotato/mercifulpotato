Item(by='unemphysbro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609902803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650224, text='My brother is 11 and he&#x27;s more of a hands-on type of person (he&#x27;s built some furniture, wooden stencils and  functional crossbow; terrifying for our parents) and doesn&#x27;t like to sit in-front of a computer for more time then school necessitates.<p>Because of this I figured I wouldn&#x27;t force him to learn programming, rather nudge him towards it. I bought him a Tynker membership and he seems to enjoy that. It seems like a fun, gentle introduction into programming.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tynker.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tynker.com&#x2F;</a>')
