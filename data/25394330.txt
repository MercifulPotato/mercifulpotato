There really is a physical object corresponding to the pipe, and the &quot;|&quot; refers directly if tersely to that object.<p>A filesystem is fundamentally a way toorganize blocks of data on a storage medium. It consists of an actual physical medium with various attributes, which is used by a rule-driven system (&quot;the filesystem&quot;) to decide where to put data (and conversely where to find it). It doesn&#x27;t actually work in the same way as a paper filing cabinet, but in most operational senses, the two things are far closer together than they are different.<p>The CLI is not a metaphor - it&#x27;s an abstraction. It removes details that you don&#x27;t need to know about (mostly), but provides you with a way to operate directly upon the objects (concepts) known to the operating system that you are interacting with.<p>The classic Mac desktop described in TFA does consist of a lot of metaphors. Technically one can see this clearly in the way that the kernel of macOS isn&#x27;t responsible for most of the way that desktop functions today: this is left to user-space services that create higher level objects for the user to interact with, leaving the kernel to deal with the same sorts of objects you&#x27;d describe with the CLI.<p>Or something like that.')
