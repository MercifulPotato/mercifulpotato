For python small projects it is pretty sweet.  You type some commands and you are up and running.  With c&#x2F;c++ it seems there is always this &#x27;big&#x27; first time step for setup.  Yet long term that seems to flip around like you have seen.  Where that first time setup works pretty good for a long time.  Whereas in python the org of the program becomes this dead weight you are kind of fighting.  It is not awful but just kind of there.   Now that is just my exp I am sure others had the opposite.  But it is nice to see someone else out there thinking like I do about this.  python for nice small contained things.  other languages for longer term bigger projects.  But it is same problem most of the time you have in many orgs.  The prototype becomes the production thing :(<p>People always ask me &#x27;how do I become a programmer&#x27; the first thing I always tell them is &#x27;you need to learn python it is fairly easy to pick up and learn&#x27; I aim them at the python org website and their excellent tutorials.  Funny enough it weeds out the people who do not really want to be a programmer but thought it sounded cool, as they have to stop and learn something.')
