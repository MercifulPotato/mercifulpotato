It sounds pretty straightforward mechanically. A short means I borrow a share from you and sell it to someone else today, buy it back some time later and give it back to you. That someone else has a bona fide stock, which they can lend to another shorter.<p>If you mean why the metric of &quot;how many [shorts to] edges are active&quot; is being tracked? I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the best proxy for how confident market is the stock is about to tank. Also, shorting as an abstraction is its own thing, so counting how many shorts there are is as useful as counting any other distinct market activity.')
