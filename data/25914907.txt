They still have a quite generous rewards program (not as generous as the US, but not bad) and I thought they always charged high tx fees (which is also why not all merchants chose to accept it). But the argument being that they also have the high earners = high spenders in their network, and merchants can attract more of those customers by accepting Amex. If the cap was at 0.3%, how can they be any different than MasterCard&#x2F;Visa cards, which usually don&#x27;t have reward programs here?')
