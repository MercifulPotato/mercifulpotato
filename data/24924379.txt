I absolutely fail to understand how a data science heavy language in 2020 can have such convoluted parallel processing. Dask, numba, joblib all are unfinished projects and absolutely not headache-free. CuPy works great, but it is not multi-GPU capable as of today.<p>And anytime you point this out, people will trot out a toy problem in Cython and try to prove you wrong, which has zero relevance to real world issues. Hell, Cython cannot even compile something as basic as Numpy FFTs, something that is absolutely critical in signal processing.')
