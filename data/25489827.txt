Item(by='Terretta', descendants=None, kids=[25491805], score=None, time=1608500757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487556, text='As many here did back then, loved Lode Runner.<p>So much so that the first 6502 arcade game I wrote was a Lode Runner derivative called “The Heist”.<p>Levels consisted of floors and stair steps, and there were different types of art on the walls you could steal, including an easy one and a hard one (based on the location puzzle) of low and high value.<p>You could cut through floors and use ropes to rappel up or down.  Some walkways were blocked by storage boxes you could push, including push into a hole in the floor which jammed and filled the hole.<p>Guards patrolled on beats.  If close enough to you, they could shoot you.  You could pick up a bucket of water from janitors, and slosh it on the floor to make the guard slide one way or another, or fall into a hole you’d cut.<p>You could “turn out the lights” at a light switch.  The effect would be you could only see within a certain radius.  Gaurds couldn’t see you any more, but also, you couldn’t see them unless close enough.<p>Most logic was AppleSoft Basic, while the drawing routines were 6502 so falling and sliding and throwing the water would be smooth.<p>Lode Runner got me into coaxing machines to do what I imagined, instead of just using what others did.')
