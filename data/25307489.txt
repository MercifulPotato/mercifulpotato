I&#x27;m pretty sure if this was true, everyone would be using it for database work now, except no one does. So these claims are baseless.<p>&gt; Bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain will disrupt (evolve) something. The leading use case is a store of value. If that is to be adopted then bitcoin&#x27;s value will be in the trillions.<p>Evolve what? You don&#x27;t even seem to be sure and are just guessing that it&#x27;s novel and surely has some value, but you don&#x27;t know why. Trillions? Where do you get this number from? Do you somehow take the size of an existing market and assign a value per consumer? Where is the rigor behind your claims?')
