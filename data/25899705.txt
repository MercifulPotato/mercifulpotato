However, I am not in denial that what he did was wrong. I always knew he had done the wrong thing, and he always took complete responsibility for what he did. He pled guilty and never tried to shift blame to anyone but himself. Like I said, it was out of character for him and something he did during a time of intense difficulty for our family.')
