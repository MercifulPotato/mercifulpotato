You end up with exploding hover boards, electrical fires caused by bad chargers, tainted or counterfit makeup etc...  The appeal of Target or Walmart is that they have a duty to their customer to not sell them dangerous products and they have clout to get cheap prices.  10,000 eCommerce shops selling private label chargers exacerbates this problem.   I can trace the product to a factory in China sure, but that doesn&#x27;t solve my lawsuit problem.  Do I sue shopify in this case?')
