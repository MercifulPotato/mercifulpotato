I was talking about the fact that I had experiences building cross-compiler, that could come in handy with embedded development.<p>The guy stopped me right there and said, basically: &quot;Just no. Let&#x27;s just not. We&#x27;re not doing that here and have no intention of starting doing that&quot;.<p>He went on to explain about it and basically it boils down to the fact while technically possible, anything outside the bsp (board support package, that is IDE + compiler&#x2F;linker&#x2F;debugger&#x2F;programmer) is unsupported. The vendors just won&#x27;t support anything that&#x27;s not built with their tools (in retrospect, that&#x27;s very reasonable).<p>So the practical reason is support.')
