(root node)<p>Now thinking in terms of first principle and contemplating situations I hardly ever get angry or sad (lately) because I&#x27;m mutating from my natural instinct of reaction (where the unconscious mind kicks in) to a more robust framework of response (why? -&gt; okay -&gt; work on it). (work in progress)\nIf I know that something is not under my control, I&#x27;d probably not waste any energy on it unless it conflicts with my root node if it does then I&#x27;d switch to the problem-solving mode.<p>Most of my actions are just functions aim towards maximizing the root node, and the above framework kinda makes it efficient.<p>In my POV, if I can pattern match the cue for anger using the above framework with enough iteration I don&#x27;t really think that it&#x27;s unrealistic to control anger or any emotion.')
