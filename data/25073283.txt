Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605206892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071352, text='Good stuff, lots to think about.<p>If I&#x27;m permitted a bikeshedding moment though, I&#x27;m not sure that &#x27;meta-rationality&#x27; is the right term (though it is <i>far</i> better than &#x27;post-rationality&#x27;). The type of thinking that is discussed isn&#x27;t exactly ratiocinating (or reasoning) about rationality (the reasoning <i>of</i> the article might be described that way, but not it&#x27;s subject per-se). Perhaps trans-rationality works better?<p>Also, it seems that the specific type of thinking demonstrated (especially to solve the puzzles) is — or at least bears a close relationship to — abductive reasoning, which isn&#x27;t mentioned.<p>Also, the solution in footnote #20 isn&#x27;t correct, the black shapes not only separate the groups of white shapes when joined, <i>they MAY terminate them as well</i> (or they may terminate a sequence of groups of white shapes. Since terminating black shapes are optional, we don&#x27;t know for sure whether a singleton can be terminated this way.)')
