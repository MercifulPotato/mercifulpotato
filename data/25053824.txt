Which is bigger I don&#x27;t know but the ones going are the hard worked blogs (without readers thanks to google) and the ones coming are commercial spa type of crap.<p>From experience, at some point many went from say 10-20 spam for every 1 comment with every 10th comment really being worth something to something like 200 spam for 1 comment and nothing really worth reading. Writing good comments use to be a viable method to advertise your own website. The link sat under your username and the content you commented on was related to your own site. If the comment was good enough people would naturally look for more of your writings.<p>Then came the &quot;comments are spam&quot; paradigm and it all went down hill from there.<p>But on the up side, the fast rate of change does mean it can be something entirely different tomorrow. All it takes is one or more good ideas.<p>(I just had one: turn downloaded yt videos into torrents and use the yt url to find the magnet. Independent users can download build and revive the same torrents)')
