Add a section in the description of the MR describing how the changes were tested.  If this is detailed enough and covers all the edge cases I worry about, sometimes I don&#x27;t even need to look at the code to be comfortable with approving the change.  Conversely, it&#x27;s frustrating when I get a MR with a blank or generic description without any notes on purpose, approach, how it was tested, etc.')
