Item(by='XCSme', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602584464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24762668, text='userTrack does not have any bot-detection system yet. Many bots are filtered automatically as the tracking is done in JavaScript, so HTML-only crawlers do not show up in the dashboard. Bots that run JavaScript might appear in the total stats and the visitors list, but usually in the list you can visually see if the user was a bot (usually has a low screen resolution and a session length of 0).<p>I do plan to add better bot-detection, but currently I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable problem with it nor any existing customer reported this problem. I think one reason why bot percentage overall is lower than in Google Analytics is because GA is a very popular and old platform and there are many spam bots created specificially for it whereas userTrack is still new and has a lower market-share, so it is not even blocked in any way by ad-blockers yet. I have focused more on the features&#x2F;issues reported by existing clients than the bot-detection, but I did add it to the roadmap and plan to work on it soon.')
