Just yesterday Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s 2016 deposition was unsealed, and it mentions Clinton and Prince Andrew, among others[1].<p>The conspiracy burned for 2 years, and when more information is unsealed it only confirms things people believe. Anyone watching knew something was up with Epstein, his sweet-heart deal for sex crimes against children, and that island, and his untimely death. Until everything is unsealed and in the light, things are only going to get more intense.<p>Furthermore, there seems to be a lot of bipartisan appetite for truth in regards to Epstein, partly because many believe it also implicates Trump. How powerful is something that unites Qanon and Trump&#x27;s critics under the same flag?<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;free.law&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;gov.uscourts.nysd.447706.1137.2_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;free.law&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;gov.uscourts.nysd.447706.1137.2_2.pdf</a>')
