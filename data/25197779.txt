The full-color daily strips and recolored Sunday strips are copyrighted to Paws as they are considered a different product.</i><p>So maybe it&#x27;s down to copyright law that the strips have differing colors (and that the coloring is chosen to be completely over the top to ensure it can be claimed to be different enough from the other versions owned by other companies?)')
