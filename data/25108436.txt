WP straight-up describes the service as hosting in the letter cutting them off.<p>But what <i>does</i> get problematic is when your service is an auth provider for numerous others, and a major communication hub in itself, and it becomes possible for you to just suddenly get locked out half your life all in one fell swoop.<p>WP mostly sidesteps this issue, being an open source project that you&#x27;re free to just host an instance of yourself. But consider Facebook, with a chat service that&#x27;s more than a decade old and that covers a quarter of the planet -- and the reaction you would have if an equivalent platform were to lock you out of emails spanning that kind of time frame. Particularly given that it&#x27;s a closed protocol, and as such any ability you do have to export that data is really only useful for archiving.')
