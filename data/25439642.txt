I was a bit of a snob for a day or so, &amp; didn&#x27;t really know or trust the controlling entity, but I decided to try it. It was really fun! Easy to use.<p>I think Bump happened a year or two latter, which was also fun. But it felt far more intermediated, like it was pulling down much more data. Looking at who in the area also bumped at just that instant to triangulate who to put in contact with each other.<p>I remember back in the 90&#x27;s wear(able)-comp(uting) world, PANs were going to be a thing. Personal Area Networks. Your skin itself would be a low-baud rate modem, so you could shake hands &amp; transmit your contact information. Definitely pre-covid. ;)<p>I really think Project Eddystone has many of the answers for how we ought to make ourselves visible to the world. It was mainly focused on commercialized entities, and people are scared of the internet, but I think there&#x27;s still great potential. Alternatively, it seems weird that NFC, which is much more tightly coupled, 1:1, &quot;safe&quot;, is so under-utilized. I&#x27;m not sure if there are good open standards for data-exchange over it. Meanwhile proprietary AirDrop and FastShare&#x2F;Nearby Sharing are some of the few, tightly controlled offerings for offering files. All these manners of tech needs some champions to drive good protocols, enable more interesting futures. Sorry, I think I&#x27;m repeating myself again. Thanks for the fun comments dcsan.')
