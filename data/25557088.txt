The computer is in itself a simulator of a simple game involving formal rules with assembly language terms as the axioms.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat poetic, beautiful and accidentally funny that your argument frays at the same blind spots that your tone does, which is at the gap between theoretical and on-the-ground meaning. It is true in a theoretical sense that you could describe a computer as a simulator which can be modeled with formal rules. But it tells me nothing about why the computer as a mass-market electronic device which runs mass-market software occupies the societal role it does, nor where it will go, nor why it was an innovation which transformationally altered society in the same way as the flame, the wheel, the chariot, the bow, the written word, the loom, the printing press.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re not going to try and engage with any of that because &quot;It probably can be done, I just can&#x27;t spare the effort&quot; what do you think is more likely:<p>1) your complaint most loudly voices new and fresh insight to the industry which it had previously missed<p>2) your complaint most loudly voices your own gaps in curiosity and understanding<p>If it&#x27;s 2, then I just think that&#x27;s sad. I see a lot of engineers (frequently early-stage in their careers and suffering from a bit of imposter syndrome) get stuck in a rut where they dogmatically devour formalism as a vehicle to elevate the level and quality of their engineering to the level of rigor seen in the sciences. But the appropriation of surface level aesthetics masks a methodological inability to do the dirty work to get the actual job done via &quot;less sexy&quot; paths (as reality often requires), to differentiate and harden critical sections when necessary. It&#x27;s sad because it generally only speaks to their own lack of exposure with just how power and impact software can be built to have, and it takes the momentary weakness of inexperience and calcifies it into eternal inexperience and terminal juniority owing to an unrealistic, radioactive hubris far out of proportion with actual capability.<p>That could be you. It doesn&#x27;t have to be.')
