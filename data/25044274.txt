I found my sons did better socially when not having to deal all day with an actively hostile environment. They had more friends, were more able to connect to people in a positive fashion, etc.<p>Homeschooling doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive. You can go to the library and check out materials for free, shop second-hand book stores and buy materials from the bargain bin. I got a lot of math books for as little as a dollar because most people don&#x27;t read math books for fun, so they often ended up in the bargain bin at regular bookstores.<p>You can join email lists and the like to help you figure everything out.<p>For my family, homeschooling was all upside. I had more time as a homeschooling parent to do other things than I did as a public school parent.<p>As a public school parent, I had to take my kids to school and pick them up. I had to pack a lunch every day. I had to attend parent-teacher meetings. I had to help them with their homework and it was an uphill battle worse than when I was choosing curriculum that was a good fit for their needs.<p>I have two twice exceptional sons (gifted and learning-disabled). One of our biggest challenges was keeping them in curriculum because if it was a good fit, they ran through it quickly and if it was a bad fit, I needed to ditch it and find another answer in short order. They didn&#x27;t want to do it. It was bombing.<p>Homeschooling is easier if you have a child with health issues and special dietary needs. We liked to attend museums and other activities of that sort and stuff like that is educational. That&#x27;s often a special field trip in public school. You can do more things like that as a homeschooler.<p>The biggest hassle of homeschooling is not teaching the kids. It&#x27;s complying with state laws. Joining an email list to help you figure out how to track their progress so you aren&#x27;t so stressed about that detail is very helpful. You can also join things like (iirc) the Homeschool Legal Defense Fund to get a newsletter and legal protection in case the state does get on your case about something.<p>You will want to look up the laws in your state. Some states are very lenient and others aren&#x27;t. If you can comfortably comply with state law, then homeschooling can be a very happy experience for the entire family.<p>You will need to set boundaries to prevent &quot;parent burnout&quot; cited in the article. When my sons were in public school, they imposed on my time when they were home. If they were home, they felt entitled to make demands of my time and attention. With homeschooling, I had to establish boundaries and say &quot;No, you can&#x27;t do that to me 24&#x2F;7. If my bedroom door is shut, knock. Don&#x27;t burst in. If you want to talk to me, ask to arrange an appointment. Don&#x27;t expect me to drop everything all the time.&quot;<p>In the long run, it was good for how we interacted. But it was kind of a hidden problem that wasn&#x27;t obvious ahead of time would need to be addressed.')
