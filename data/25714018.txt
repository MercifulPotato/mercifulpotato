It’s only an indirect indicator of things that matter (strength, endurance), and even those are only indicators what really matters: health.<p>And yes, I think that applies to anorexics, too, although there, of course, the only way to gain strength or endurance and thus get healthier is to eat more and gain weight.<p>I also am aware that some people train in order to <i>look</i> strong rather than <i>be</i> strong, but I think that should be discouraged. I don’t know you, but given what you say about your brother, it probably is genetics, so accept you won’t ever look as strong as some others.<p>Certainly, if you’re as strong as somebody who weighs more, you’ll likely beat them in exercises where you need to move your body (swimming, running, cycling, mountain climbing, cross country skiing, rowing, etc)')
