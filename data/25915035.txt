It’s not maintainable, it’s not readable, there’s no way to collaborate with other developers on it. There’s no way to create abstractions, so you must keep all the details in mind at all times. You can’t put those details into a box and forget about them. It is Cthulu–esqe. It would be a chapter of The Book. Practicing M4, or any language in this family, has a permanent SAN cost. Just learning the language probably doesn’t have much cost, but even small sacrifices should not be made lightly.')
