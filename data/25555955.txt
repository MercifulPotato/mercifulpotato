Item(by='thr0w__4w4y', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609119885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25538612, text='Interviewing someone like yourself isn&#x27;t hard at all... I&#x27;ve interviewed hundreds of people (which isn&#x27;t thin air here on HN) and I&#x27;ve pretty much seen it all.<p>Generally speaking, in an interview, I&#x27;m trying to assess &#x2F;what you can do&#x2F;.  Which is not &quot;what you have done&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve interviewed at least 2 people, who were hired against my recommendation, in different companies, that clearly fleeced everyone else.   In both cases, the candidate walked the walk &amp; talked the talk, but something seemed off.  &quot;Sociopath&quot; is a term that is thrown around loosely but I think it applies to both candidates (one man, one woman).  In both cases, they&#x27;d convinced most of the interviewers they were very strong in areas they&#x27;d never professionally tackled before.<p>I&#x27;m less interested in what the candidate claims to have done; that could be reality, or a well-rehearsed and &quot;lived&quot; fantasy.  But by talking about hard engineering problems in real-time, with &quot;curve balls&quot;,  I can usually tell if the candidate has &quot;the right stuff&quot; or not.  Even if it&#x27;s just aptitude.  I can train smart people who handle themselves well.  But if the candidate can&#x27;t field tough questions and unexpected (off-script) questions, that&#x27;s enough for me to pass on the candidate at the level I&#x27;m hiring.')
