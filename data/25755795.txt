Say a rogue user uploads an illegal image to your site, you&#x27;ve now hosted this illegal image which is a felony. Even if you delete it quickly, you&#x27;ve already committed the crime by hosting it in the first place. It&#x27;s completely impractical to run any internet service without this protection.')
