E.g., for client-rendered apps, or apps that pull their data from XHR. Since jsdom implements the script element, and the XHR API, and a bunch of other APIs that pages might use, it can get a lot further in the page lifecycle than just &quot;parse the bytes from the server into an initial DOM tree&quot;.<p>(I&#x27;m a maintainer of jsdom.)')
