Mandatory secureboot that couldn&#x27;t be disabled.  A Windows system that&#x27;s not as open to modification as the x64 version.<p>They did their level best to get maximum control and this was and is a huge turn off.  If they made it as open as x86&#x2F;x64, and pulled out all the stops to get software support equivalent to x86 like Apple have done with their system, then it would be a compelling proposition.  As it is, it has woeful software support, and Microsoft did very little to address this.')
