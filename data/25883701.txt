The Democrats would be marched en masse to the gallows and revealed to the world to be the satanic blood drinking pedophiles the faithful always knew they were. The world would see the insurrectionists as patriots and heroes for stopping the CCP in league with the Democratic Party from stealing the election and denying Donald Trump his rightful second term .<p>Many of these people literally believe they&#x27;re involved in a holy war and that Trump was sent by God, so for them, victory was a metaphysical certainty.
