If other stakeholders such as customers, employees, investors, and so on are able to make money off of it, that&#x27;s a plus. But we shouldn&#x27;t expect founders to do anything other than act in a manner facilitating the generation of wealth for themselves.<p>RH is no different than any other startup in this regard. They aren&#x27;t going to open themselves up to the risk of not following a margin agreement in the name of &quot;the revolution!&quot; They are in the business of making money, even if that means users lose their shirts.<p>And if people have been trading GME, AMC, et al on margin? (I mean, unless the government steps in or something?) I&#x27;m afraid a lot of them are going to be losing their shirts in the coming weeks.')
