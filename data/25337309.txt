I think something like 6 separate breakers.<p>Our stove is on a 40 amp circuit. From my reading, 50 amp is pretty common.<p>On top of that there is a dedicated 20 amp circuit for our microwave (which broke a few years back and we never replaced)<p>Plus a dedicated circuit for the garbage disposal &#x2F; dish washer.<p>Plus one for the fridge<p>Plus one or two more for countertop appliances.<p>It&#x27;s kind of crazy to think about.')
