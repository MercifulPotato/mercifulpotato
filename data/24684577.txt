Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=[24685152], score=None, time=1601872321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24684042, text='<i>&gt; Thanks. I mean the laws and precedent that made it clear my non compete is unenforceable based on the idea that I have a right to... work.</i><p><i>&gt; Oh hey and thereâ€™s the name right there!</i><p>I wish non-competes being unenforceable had a pithy associated phrase, but it doesn&#x27;t.<p>There are nuances to non-competes that sometimes get glossed over, such as non-solicitation of customers and co-workers. I believe those types of clauses <i>are</i> enforceable in CA.<p>Oddly enough, the union neutering that is encoded as &quot;right to work&quot; is usually cited as a factor that makes a state more &quot;business friendly&quot;, and so are enforceable non-competes.')
