When zoomed out dealerships would be clustered together using a modified k-means clustering. I had to do a lot of non-trivial coding to handle the variance in how latitude is distorted in Alaska vs the continental US. To this day, that was the algorithmically most interesting coding that I&#x27;ve done.')
