Copyright is not &quot;opt-out&quot; process; the RIAA doesn&#x27;t publish a robots.txt with their content and if they forget you have a free pass for copying some song for yourself. Copying every single word on a webpage to make money is not so clearly &quot;fair use&quot;.<p>I think it worked out OK, but Google totally thought a lot about this problem early on and they and other search engines tried hard to make everyone really comfortable with their approach.')
