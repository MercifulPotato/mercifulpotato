A union would have definitely helped and these voters chose to vote for the party that decimated unions. Are we supposed to pay attention to a group that refuses to look at facts and often votes driven by baser needs than what is good for them. I say we just need to build a collation that makes this group of voters irrelevant. If the last 4 years haven&#x27;t made them not support Trump then I do not see the point of trying to bring them into the fold.')
