Understanding, of course, that not all pain is &#x27;the same&#x27;.  My level of tolerance is likely because I understand the &#x2F;significant&#x2F; risks of addiction.  I&#x27;d rather not be in pain, obviously, but not at the risk of being a junkie.<p>I definitely get the impression that a lot of people  sucked into pain med addiction are not the sort that have had a lot of previous experience with pain.  Making it doubly irresponsible to prescribe such highly addictive medications for them.')
