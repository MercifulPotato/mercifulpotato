Not after the union is formed and established - I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lot of straight talk between UAW and GM nowadays - but if someone like Musk is afraid the gigafactory workers are banding together, he might be forced to talk to them directly. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this &quot;real talk&quot; is ever recorded or broadcast.<p>The most stark example I can think of is when Emperor Hirohito informed the Japanese citizens of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki[1], but funny enough that is mostly known for how confusing it was for the average Japanses citizen to understand what was going on.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jewel_Voice_Broadcast" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jewel_Voice_Broadcast</a>')
