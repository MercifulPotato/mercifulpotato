(Fair use exemptions specifically apply to copyrighted things.) Interoperability is fair use. And things like something being non-commercial, such as a lot of open source software, is a major factor in determining whether or not usage is fair. Things like WINE or NES emulators or the like would fall very comfortably into fair use.<p>It&#x27;s nowhere near as world-ending as Google&#x27;s public policy team would like you to believe. But given that Android is <i>not</i> fair use (it&#x27;s not interoperable, they just wanted to glom on the popularity of the platform), it sucks for Google.')
