In Scheme, you would have to GENSYM every variable in addition to every function you call within a macro. Whereas in Common Lisp you just need to GENSYM the variables. That&#x27;s the real reason Scheme doesn&#x27;t use DEFMACRO.<p>I&#x27;m not personally a fan of any hygienic macro system because learning a new language defeats the purpose and elegance of Lisp macros in the first place. But then again, outside of personal projects and academic exercises, no one should be using macros. Messing with fundamental semantics of a language while other developers are working on the same project will certainly make you a ton more enemies than friends.  I still have a grudge against the guy that used Ruby&#x27;s method_missing and I spent an entire day hunting down a method that didn&#x27;t exist. When I figured it out, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been so pissed at someone before.')
