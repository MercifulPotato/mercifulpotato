I think we should never be frightened of hacked cars, we should definitely be hacking our cars (and trucks, forklifts, lawnmowers, combines, papershredders, robots).<p>Just wanted to add many comments on Can and obdII:<p>In the United States the obdII port is required beginning in model year 1996.\nThe obdII port and the CAN is analogous to rj45 and cat5, 5e, 6, etc.<p>Should note, the can bus is anything but bog standard.<p>However, in 2008 the United States required that all vehicles provide an iso15765 interface as the basis of the on board diagnostics. Iirc, 15765 is a subset of Can that&#x27;s for cars and not forklifts. Can is controller area network.<p>There are a large variety of protocols talked across Can, far too many to list as you have noted. There are schemes which are serial, parralel addressed and not, and even analog signaling cohabitating this generic breakout port.<p>Where it differs between cars is the capabilities of the DLC, if the vehicles isn&#x27;t equipped with a sensor suite, there will be no correspondent ecu subsystem to query, but for the most part you can send control messages to anything you want on a DoT approved vehicle, unless it is locked away behind a specific gateway and the car manufacturer is still hiding the method to control access to the device.<p>None of this applies to infotainment devices or comfort features.<p>Consumers should rue the day we return to the age of mystery subsystems requiring special protocols.<p>The reason I say this (and I suspect but, can&#x27;t remember the 2008 iso 15765 mandate rationale) is that you probably want your mechanic to be able to fix your car, right?<p>Anybody who might be interested in the wild and fun world of automotive Com protocols such as this I can recommend to you this good and recent resource from 2020: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csselectronics.com&#x2F;screen&#x2F;page&#x2F;simple-intro-to-can-bus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csselectronics.com&#x2F;screen&#x2F;page&#x2F;simple-intro-to-c...</a>')
