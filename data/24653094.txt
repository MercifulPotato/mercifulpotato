Side projects have been my passion because I love product, the ideas, the journey and the dream. As a developer, I feel constrained to the code and less involved in the product as a whole. I have too many ideas and not enough time in the day. I know native mobile like the back of my hand and can definitely bridge the technical gap working with engineers and biz dev. I’m just looking for a shot, I know with my tech background and communication skills I can lead in a team environment and bring great things to a product.')
