But those issues aren&#x27;t censored - they are mainstream non-partisan talking points.  That&#x27;s all I heard about for the past 6 years, from both parties.  It&#x27;s not exactly taboo to talk about trade.<p>But if a party dilutes their message by embracing conspiracy theories, outlandish lies, bigotry, and authoritarian rhetoric, then what the hell?  How is political discussion supposed to be in good faith anymore?  If people want to talk to me about trade, they can talk to me about trade on whatever platform they want.  I listen to them all the time.  If they want to talk to me about how voting machines are rigged by Hugo Chavez, then they&#x27;re probably not going to say, &quot;oh, your right&quot; when I show them facts that say otherwise.')
