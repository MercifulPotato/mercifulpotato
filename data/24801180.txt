Some time last year a friend recommended me to check out Melodics. It has 3 instruments: keys, pads (finger drumming), drums. I&#x27;ve played pads for few mont;hs, that was good, I&#x27;ve felt it improved my timing and rhythm skills quite a bit. Then I switched to keys. I didn&#x27;t really like that; it felt like I&#x27;m mindlessly repeating whatever is on the screen instead of internalising music. OTOH, when playing pads it felt that something stays in my head after playing. So I guess this may be useful to some people.<p>For me it&#x27;d be more interesting to have some sort of memory trainer - I play something on screen few times, then I replay from memory and app shows me a diff maybe? Or when I&#x27;m learning a piece, it would give me a challenge &quot;play bars 21-25 both hands&quot; or &quot;play bars 19-23 left hand only&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;melodics.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;melodics.com&#x2F;</a>, I&#x27;m not affiliated in any way')
