I have been dying for a good Pokemon game since I was a kid. The GBC games were addictive, but I wanted something that would feel more interactive and require realtime battle skills. The RPG-style battle mechanics got really old. Pokemon Snap was and still is magical, but the user was stuck on rails. Pokemon Stadium was at least 3-d, but the battle mechanics were the same. I fantasized about having an open world with the battle mechanics of Super Smash Bros. A BOTW-style Pokemon game would be just incredible!')
