You probably need a combination of credit cards, Paypal and possible several others depending on your niche &#x2F; platform (e.g. Apple Pay or Amazon Pay).<p>B2B? I&#x27;d go with Stripe for credit cards and SEPA debit but also offer bank transfer for larger tickets &#x2F; customers. For our services we offer the latter for all yearly plans as some companies don&#x27;t want to pay by credit card and prefer getting an invoice that their accounting department can handle. Depending on your location there are various services that can provide you an API for your bank account balance and transfers, you can then match them against the invoices mostly automatically.<p>There are higher-level services like Chargebee that offer multiple payment gateways and do some of the legwork for you, personally I find Stripe + some homebrew code for invoice generation and bank transfer handling easier, plus it amounts to less personal &#x2F; sensitive data of your clients being stored on third-party services (if you value that kind of thing).')
