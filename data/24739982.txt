How do you have a dialog with someone, even someone arguing in good faith, when the dialog is about whether you have the right to be who you say you are?  I could have dialogs all day about external principles, but internal ones, it’s a lot harder to talk about with someone who disagrees.  It’s all well and good to decry cancel culture, but these are people who have had to fight tooth and nail to even get a seat at the conversation table in the first place.')
