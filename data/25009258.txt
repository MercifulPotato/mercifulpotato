It has kitchen staff who become more alarmed over time at the state of the kitchen they&#x27;re working in every day, and if nothing is done about it, there will come a point where the kitchen starts failing to produce edible meals.<p>Generally, you can either convince decision makers that cleaning the kitchen is more profitable in the long run or you can dust off your resume and get out before it burns down.')
