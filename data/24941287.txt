I now feel quite frustrated having to work in other languages where I&#x27;m missing the tight REPL integration.<p>It&#x27;s ideal for getting into &quot;flow&quot;, iterating on ideas, there&#x27;s no waiting or downtime that you can get in other languages.<p>I don&#x27;t know why REPL driven development and Clojure type REPL integration isn&#x27;t how we all want to do development (assuming as you say it&#x27;s not embedded or some other niche area).
