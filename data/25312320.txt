Ideally, your employer or client will respect you as a human being who has something valuable to bring to the table.<p>Even better if they actually know you!<p>&gt; If you ever have a chance to talk candidly with an executive or entrepreneur about a subject that you are passionate about...well, at least take the meeting. Those sorts of discussions aren&#x27;t interviews per se, but sometimes your vision will click with someone else&#x27;s, and that&#x27;s where the magic happens.<p>This is great advice. Talking to business folks when you aren&#x27;t working for them is a great way to practice this skill and you never know what you might end up running into. Another good thing to do is to try to connect two people who might benefit from the connection (discussing a technology, an opportunity, etc). Sometimes something will happen, sometimes not, but the goodwill will be remembered.<p>A few years ago I joked about never wanting to submit a resume again. If you spend time on your network (all the time, not just when you need a job) and do good work, hopefully you&#x27;ll get to a point where you can contact people you know who are looking for help.<p>Sure you&#x27;ll still need to &quot;interview&quot; but the stakes are lower: they know you and you know them.')
