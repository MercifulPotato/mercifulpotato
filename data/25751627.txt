Open discussion failed.  Many conservatives distanced themselves from the truth.  That inherently leaves any truth seeking institution with a progressive bias because reality has a progressive bias.  I agree that can turn into a feedback loop like you suggest, but what is the way out of that for these institutions?  Is the National Weather Service supposed to distance itself from reality and introduce conservative bias into its coverage in order for conservatives to trust it more?<p>I&#x27;m also not sure what specifically you are referring to with the &quot;objectivity props up the status quo&quot; line.  Do you have examples of institutions using that as an example to lie?  Do you have an example of when an organization was able to &quot;demonstrate good faith and a commitment to the truth wherever it leads&quot; that was truly about to change falsely held beliefs of people on the right?')
