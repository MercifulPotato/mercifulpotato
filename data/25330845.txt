I can understand a child feeling that way about the company behind their favourite products, but it seems unbecoming in adults. The best example might be Apple &#x27;fanboys&#x27;. (I don&#x27;t know of a gender-neutral term here. <i>Fanboy</i> implies an excess of appreciation, but <i>fan</i> means something weaker.)<p>I don&#x27;t see that it has much to do with religion though. It&#x27;s only silly because of the specifics of what a corporation <i>is</i> - a somewhat amoral body of capital, very roughly speaking - but it&#x27;s not always silly to be attached to an institution. There&#x27;s nothing religious about supporting the Against Malaria Foundation, or the EFF, or (here in the UK) the National Health Service.')
