That&#x27;s mostly due to unsold capacity and poor bin packing on many levels (user has an oversized kube cluster, the cloud provider has spare machines, etc.).  Many cloud machines just sit idle for years on end because someone has forgotten about them.    In many cases, those idle resources are not used for lower priority jobs either, since they are being paid for by a customer.')
