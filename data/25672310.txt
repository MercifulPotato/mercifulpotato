You not only have to maintain the tool itself, but also the build stacks associated with them and it becomes the task of the user to make sure they are running the most recent version. This leads to more complex support situations.<p>Basically, you need a deployment methodology that allows for:\n* Ease of use by &quot;novice&quot; developers\n* Only introduces minimal overhead for those developers\n* Makes it easy to upgrade or remove a tool you installed 6 months ago\n* Doesn&#x27;t require a tool development team to come up with their own solution<p>This is a surprisingly tricky to do on a diverse environment with 1000+ internal users.')
