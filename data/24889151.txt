Item(by='acgkmopvvgvmgv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603654110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24888123, text='&gt;Why do people do this? What can be done to stop it? Obviously nothing I&#x27;ve done so far has been working. This feels like talking to conservatives about climate change.<p>People can just continue to work and make FLOSS better like they always have and ignore the peanut gallery. It must be soul crushing to see so much FUD about your work.<p>FLOSS has many flaws nobody is saying it&#x27;s perfect but it&#x27;s like you have to be perfect or you&#x27;re useless. And most projects are starving for manpower, Wayland could have been ready 5 years ago if 0.1% of the companies benefiting from FLOSS had helped or at least not act maliciously like a certain GPU vendor.<p>Gaming also brings the worst types of communities and Linux has been booming there lately.<p>Another possibility is that the so called Organic Marketing that certain companies are investing so much these days are used to demoralize and steer public opinion about FLOSS. I once made a comment on reddit that went to almost -200 in a matter of minutes. That doesn&#x27;t happen even in political or religion posts, it&#x27;s manipulation clear as day.<p>I stopped programming because of a chronic condition or I would help Wayland if I could. I&#x27;m glad people like you keep the ball rolling. You might want to think about your mental health because the tone of the posts here have been going downhill and you become used to it.')
