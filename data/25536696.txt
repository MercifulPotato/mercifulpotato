India has huge inequality and the upper classes (especially the liberal upper class) are so hated and reviled by the common people and so out of touch that their many many attempts to handle sensitive topics like sexual assault, Dowry, casteism, etc. end up rubbing their intended audience the wrong way and getting them to tune out the message for good.<p>You see a really similar thing in the US with Trumpism and the contempt working class people have for the social mores of the liberal upper class.')
