These are however separate components - homed and systemd-nspawn respectively. It is not all rolled into a single &#x27;systemd&#x27;, this is a misrepresentation.<p>systemd is very modular. People like to paint it as a monolith because it lives in a monorepo for the most part, but it is not actually built as one and individual components can be disabled or swapped out.')
