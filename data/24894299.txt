I&#x27;m pretty happy with my home office [1].<p>&gt; 1. I like big, big monitors.<p>I&#x27;ve realized that I find it uncomfortable to use more than one screen, so I just use one 27â€³ 4K screen. But occasionally I open my laptop and put it on a stand to show some extra windows.<p>&gt; 2. I prefer a full size keyboard.<p>My favorite keyboard is the older version of the Apple Wireless Keyboard powered by AA batteries. It feels really nice to type on it (maybe because I&#x27;m used to it.) I recently bought a brand new Apple keyboard because I thought it would be better (and I could recharge it over USB), but it&#x27;s much worse.<p>&gt; 3. I prefer a separate mouse.<p>I use an Apple trackpad, and I love it. I only go back to a mouse if I&#x27;m playing a game.<p>&gt; 4. I prefer big freaking disk drives installed.<p>I have a 2 TB SSD, which is more than enough for me.<p>&gt; 5. I put the desktop under my desk, and with a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, there is much less of a snarl on my desk.<p>I like to put my laptop on the desk, and I only plug in a single Thunderbolt 3 cable for charging, gigabit ethernet, and my monitor. I really love my CalDigit TS3 Plus dock [2].<p>It&#x27;s really nice that I can unplug a single cable and take my laptop to any cafe or co-working space. (Before&#x2F;after the pandemic.)<p>&gt; 6. The desktop has an optical drive I still use.<p>I haven&#x27;t used an optical drive for about 5 years, and I don&#x27;t own any optical disks.<p>&gt; 7. The desktop has lots of USB ports and they&#x27;re all in use.<p>My dock has a lot of USB-A and USB-C ports, and it&#x27;s in a very convenient location.<p>&gt; 8. I can replace&#x2F;alter parts of the machine without buying a new one.<p>That&#x27;s a great point, and it&#x27;s one of the major downsides of using an Apple laptop. I do have AppleCare, and Apple&#x27;s support is really amazing.<p>&gt; 9. Desktops are cheap.<p>That&#x27;s very true! But I was using a 2012 MacBook for 8 years before I upgraded it, and I think I&#x27;ll probably continue using my current laptop for another 8-10 years. It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s a very high quality machine and I think it will last for a very long time.<p>&gt; 10. I can build what I want with parts from newegg. Premade powerful computers are always &quot;gaming machines&quot; and I don&#x27;t want a gaming machine that comes with a graphics adapter that sounds like a 747 taking off.<p>I certainly can&#x27;t do that for any kind of laptop (either Apple or other brands.)<p>&gt; 11. I want an all-metal case because a machine caught fire once.<p>Nothing to worry about there<p>&gt; Edit: 12. My desktop doesn&#x27;t have a microphone or camera, so they cannot be surreptitiously turned on remotely.<p>MacBooks have a hardware light that turns on when the camera is active, and I haven&#x27;t heard any reports about hackers being able to disable it. Although one disadvantage with the newest MacBook is that you can&#x27;t attach a sliding camera cover anymore, because it will crack the screen when you close it.<p>The microphone can be surreptitiously turned on, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m too worried about.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;soE6TMJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;soE6TMJ</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caldigit.com&#x2F;ts3-plus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caldigit.com&#x2F;ts3-plus&#x2F;</a>')
