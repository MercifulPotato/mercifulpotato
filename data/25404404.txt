Here, you need to say &quot;we&#x27;re transforming patient outcomes and helping people achieve their best health.&quot; It&#x27;s just not a requirement anywhere else I&#x27;ve worked. There are more billionaires outside of Silicon Valley than inside it, and very few of them have had to put up such pretense. They just say &quot;we&#x27;re starting a health insurance company to outcompete incumbents through better operational efficiency, delivering best-in-industry margins and double digit revenue growth.&quot;')
