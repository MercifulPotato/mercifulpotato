Item(by='JeremyNT', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611771292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928636, text='&gt; If that&#x27;s so, doesn&#x27;t the defection to an opposing camp make his message even here more credible?<p>All you really need to judge a Tom Friedman article is the &quot;Opinion columnist&quot; badge by his name.<p>What does he produce? He produces opinion. By what metric are his opinion pieces judged? Engagement.<p>Tom Friedman - and for that matter, most other opinion columnists (excepting those who are practicing domain experts who occasionally write about those specific subjects) - isn&#x27;t paid to be right. He can be wrong over, and over, and over again. If the orthodoxy of the group who employs him changes (hey, look who&#x27;s buying NYT subscriptions these days...) he can be wrong in novel ways. He doesn&#x27;t have to &quot;show his work.&quot; He never suffers any consequences.<p>He might have re-evaluated things! He might even be right - because hey, a stopped clock is right twice a day! But knowing what his job is and how he&#x27;s performed in the past, it should be apparent that there&#x27;s no particular reason one should believe him over, say, a random commenter on HackerNews such as myself. He has no incentive, credentials, or history that suggest a reader could usefully appeal to his authority.')
