It could all probably be handled by just one instance but that is sort of the standard setup we have for things.<p>matomo is very comparable to google analytics in terms of reports. matomo has some things that seem a little easier to get to; like visitor flows.<p>However, matomo seems to just give up on big data, complex reports. Similar reports in google analytics take a long time to complete, 10 to 40 seconds, but they at least complete; eventually.')
