I have built a Max&#x2F;MSP external enabling one to script and live code Max&#x2F;MSP (a computer music platform) in Scheme. I love it, I checked out many options  before settling on S7 and have been super happy with the choice (guile, gambit, chez, chicken, chibi, racket, ecl). It&#x27;s in many ways similar to Janet and Clojure: a single-namespace lisp 1 but with keywords, CL style macros with gensym, and environments. It is also close to Guile, but is liberally licensed.<p>The best part of S7 in my opinion is how easy to embed and extend it is. The C FFI is really easy to use, and all of S7 fits s7.c and s7.h, making building very easy. You can see some S7 in action in Max&#x2F;MSP here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ErirIFCTdjg&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=MusicwithLisp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ErirIFCTdjg&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=...</a>')
