It used to be that botnet operators DDOS for hire or install Dutch spyware toolbars, now with headless browsers and fingerprinting evasion it has become impossible to distinguish real ad impressions from fake ones.<p>Your only tool to fight these fraudsters are statistics but over the past 10 years the &quot;bad guys&quot; (I don&#x27;t know who is more evil, the people defrauding businesses legally or illegally) finally figured it out. They know if they are too greedy they will be caught so they now play the long milk game.<p>It is incredibly lucrative. A single botnet victim can yield upwards of $2~4 in ad revenues from a variety of ad networks.<p><i>It is IMPOSSIBLE to distinguish real from fraud ad clicks&#x2F;impressions since the introduction of headless browsers and fingerprint evasion</i><p>Somehow web scrapers&#x2F;botnet operators have found the sweet spot. This is just like how the American Cosa Nostra working with Russian criminal groups were able to siphon off crude oil from the USGOV in the 80s.<p>I miss the 90s when everything was more simpler and secure as a result.
