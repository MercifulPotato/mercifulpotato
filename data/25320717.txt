I don&#x27;t see how that erodes the fundamental right to private ownership. You can certainly find land with very low or no property or land taxes on it. You won&#x27;t be anywhere near infrastructure, culture, food, or higher education, but your taxes will be very, very low. You are paying to participate in all the value-adding parts of society. It would only follow that improvements to the public common increases the value of your privately owned asset, and you should continue to pay your share of the upkeep based on the productive value of the land.')
