Thanks for that.  My remark still holds, the real insight is that sweet drinks are no good for health, and hfcs even more so than succrose sweetened drinks.  So no matter if apple.juice is similar in contents and effect as a coke, both should be a rare treat, and water and unsweetened tea and fresh apples are really a Good Thing (tm).')
