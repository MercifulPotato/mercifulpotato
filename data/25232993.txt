Item(by='MaxBarraclough', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606514907, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25225426, text='&gt; Both of these can be found in normal first aid kits<p>Neither are found in a normal first aid kit.<p>&gt; I would bet that you can legally use it at home<p>No, suturing is a surgical procedure.<p>&gt; this work was probably done by a nurse with a 2 year degree<p>I&#x27;m not a medic, but from what I can gather online, suturing is considered an advanced specialised skill for nurses.<p>&gt; If the kid were at summer camp, they would have probably had the staff nurse do it.<p>I doubt it, even with a qualified nurse on site. No summer camp wants a reputation for being reluctant to take injured children to the emergency room, neither do they want liability.<p>&gt; Emergency rooms are both overkill for this<p>Does any first-world country agree with you on this? As far as I&#x27;m aware suturing is always treated this way, it&#x27;s not just for-profit medicine and artificial gatekeeping.<p>&gt; We are all talking as if the hospitals performed a dangerous complex procedure and saved the kids life<p>It&#x27;s routine emergency medicine. Nothing more, nothing less.<p>&gt; If so, then isn’t 19,000 a small price to pay?<p>No, it&#x27;s absurdly inflated.<p>&gt; If not (and it’s a simple task as I believe) then why did they charge so much?<p>Because they could. There&#x27;s a deep power imbalance at play. You can&#x27;t go price-shopping when your child needs emergency treatment. You might know going in that medical expenses are the top cause of personal bankruptcies in the USA, but you can&#x27;t haggle. You won&#x27;t even know what you owe until after the fact.<p>Brits like myself are generally horrified at the way American medicine is run. This kind of thing simply doesn&#x27;t happen in the UK. (That&#x27;s not to say our healthcare system is perfect, of course.)')
