Get powerful. There is a threshold effect. \nUnless you have a non-normative path to power (organized crime or powerful family or lots of money already), don&#x27;t do it.<p>What you&#x27;re doing is the equivalent of trying to get strong by pulling a 500 lb barbell every day without moving it. It is not effective. Go somewhere where you pull the 100 lbs first and get it off the ground. Then move up. One day you will be able to pull the 500 lbs. Then you can go back and move it.<p>In the most dangerous places, all the barbells are 500 lbs. You will not get strong. The barbell will not move. The barbell will never move.')
