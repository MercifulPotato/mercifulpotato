Under New Labour it was still broadly speaking pro-government (generally, it&#x27;s never totally uncritical, just tending towards friendliness relative to the opposition of the day), it was just a different government with different values.<p>But people don&#x27;t notice when something stops being biased against them if they&#x27;ve already stopped paying attention to it because they were previously put off by their perception of its bias, so many of these older perceptions of its bias still exist. This creates the illusion that there&#x27;s bias both ways, based on people&#x27;s claims, and that it therefore must be &#x27;balanced&#x27;.')
