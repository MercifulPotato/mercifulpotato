Processing capabilities, and development tools were vastly different.<p>There was just so much stuff that you had to manually build you don&#x27;t have to now.  (There are other complexities that we get to worry about now.)  One thing I noticed back then is that putting stuff in the database just made things easier.  In some instances, it really did act as like an amplifier for getting work done.  Need to sort data? The database has things in place to do that and really efficiently too.  I remember working with people, and if they had to make things like a linked list or a binary tree, they were lost (Yes, these were CS people too.  We can argue about their education, but yes, they did graduate with a CS degree).  There was nothing really like Stack Overflow to ask for help.  You were really on your own for a large portion of it.  Database code really took care of a lot of that for you.  (Truthfully, the companies I worked for used MSSQL Server back then, so your results might have been different.)')
