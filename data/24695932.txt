Item(by='cyphar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601975267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695657, text='CC0 is much more thorough than the Unlicense, was written by actual lawyers, and has a fallback to a maximally-permissive license in jurisdictions where willing relinquishment of copyrights into the public domain doesn&#x27;t exist. Unlicense doesn&#x27;t have any of these properties so it really should be strongly avoided when choosing a license for a project -- there&#x27;s no benefit to using it over CC0 and several potential (though admittedly theoretical) downsides.<p>The Unlicense website also incorrectly states that &quot;CC0 is not intended for software&quot; -- while the other CC licensed aren&#x27;t good choices for software, CC0 most definitely is intended to be used for software as much as any other copyrightable work.')
