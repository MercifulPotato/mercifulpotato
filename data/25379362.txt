Basically any non-new grad developer in a high cost of living area earns more than that, regardless of the language. I&#x27;m also suspicious that only 1.4% of survey respondents use Clojure, which may show a bit of a base rate fallacy here.<p>What would be the explanatory thesis for Clojure programmers being the most highly paid? None of the most highly paid roles I&#x27;m personally familiar with in big tech or finance use Clojure, and people who work in those roles earn well into the six (and sometimes seven) figures.')
