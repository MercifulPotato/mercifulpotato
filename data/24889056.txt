I eventually had to blow away all its gconf to recover it.<p>It turned out that at some point someone decided that 300% and 400% scaling had no purpose and caused issues because in some cases they messed up UI layout.  They removed them and the removal was just shipped along with security &amp; bugfix updates in fedora.  The way it was removed caused instant crashing for people that previously had them enabled!<p>I&#x27;m fixed now, though with the display at 200% I have difficulty reading it (It&#x27;s a 4k TV that I need to read from a long distance away) ... but since I can&#x27;t use gtk interface stuff on it at all now I guess I won&#x27;t be opening any bugs on minor layout issues that might be caused by increased scaling.
