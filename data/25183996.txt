I want to try an experiment with a new way to send messages to single person or a group. @mentions are part of our social habits now, so thought of a way to use @mentioning to direct message a person or group.<p>How? You @mention recipients in the message itself. In other words, any message will be sent to all the @mentioned users. Does anyone want to participate in this experiment? If so drop in your details here in this form.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;Ccr77ZNG1ZQ6nRxq6')
