It is making part time door dash delivery drivers and Uber drivers out of college educated people. It’s making Classics majors into web developers via bootcamps, it’s hiring out in India, and it’s making the tech you know today sound literally stupid on your resume within 3 years. You’re also in a ageist industry, so there’s time working against you too.<p>What you or I <i>want</i> is no longer a question afforded to us sadly.')
