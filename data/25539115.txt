Can improving the former make progress toward the latter?  I&#x27;m inclined to agree with Jordan that we shouldn&#x27;t expect the two to enhance the other much less commingle.  Just as advancement of one classical algorithm rarely enhances another, I think it&#x27;s unlikely the next generation of object recognition is going to advance speech recognition or reading comprehension.<p>Probably more essentially, until AI escapes its current dependency on pattern matching driven solely by accumulation of probabilistic events, I see little chance that human-level general-purpose cognition will arise from our current bases for AI, namely observing innumerable games of chess or watching millions of cars wander city streets.')
