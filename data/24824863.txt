Item(by='bryanrasmussen', descendants=3, kids=[24824953, 24825078], score=1, time=1603102105, title='Ask HN: Should autistic children be schooled around other autistic children', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Reason for my question, it is a pretty good chance my son has autism. I think stage 1, seems no problem with intelligence to me as he is nearly 3 and seems to have the right vocabulary size and reasonable motor skills, but he does have some symptoms regarding stage 2 (putting things in order, stressed out if order gets messed with), definitely not stage 3 at current time. The kindergarten seems to think he is totally late stage 2 or stage 3, which seems weird to me, maybe he acts worse among them.<p>It is being suggested that he should go to a kindergarten that has special resources for autism. One of my worries is that among other autistic children he might behave worse in that less chance of learning to socialize, picking up bad habits regarding speech and acting out.<p>Hoping someone has some familiarity with issues and can point out to good data on what benefits there are to having him in a kindergarden with other autistic children and if there are any problems associated with it.')
