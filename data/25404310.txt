Item(by='jcrawfordor', descendants=None, kids=[25406352], score=None, time=1607833656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403414, text='A large portion of SDRs have no FCC equipment authorization at all, and so don&#x27;t necessarily comply with regulations---including the lack of an AMPS lockout. This makes them a little bit iffy for sale in the US, but there is generally a rule that allows &quot;test equipment&quot; to be sold without equipment authorization under certain conditions on its use. I (not being an expert on this, I am not a lawyer, etc) would describe most hobby SDR use as being a gray area, but one that is probably not of too great concern since most hobby SDRs on the market are receive-only and obviously these weird part 15 rules about scanning receivers don&#x27;t really matter in the modern age.<p>SDR transceivers like the HackRF are probably still not being purchased by people who will cause any trouble, but I do worry a little bit more about unintentional disruption of important radio applications like aviation navaids or whatever. If I were to take a policy angle here, I think it might be a good idea to restrict such devices to people with amateur radio licenses since they are not especially hard to obtain (DE AE5JL). I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a thousand people here who would vehemently disagree with me on that though.')
