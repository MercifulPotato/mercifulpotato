AOT low profile? yeah sure it invalidates the whole language features<p>Dotnet AOT? i don&#x27;t call experiments, products, and they have the same limitations as Excelsior AOT, they produce insanly large executables, or if you want to target something like GO, you need to give up on the language features, i don&#x27;t call this a good experience<p>Il2CPP, it&#x27;s a transpiler; and same story as Excelsior AOT, it produces insanly large executable, the GC, and the code produced is very poor quality due to the nature of the language (lot manipulations at runtime, including reflection)<p>Go success story is that it now go beyong docker and k8s, people write cli tools in GO (github cli one good example), they write all their servers in GO (Riot for example), and some start to do gamedev with GO (ebiten)<p>Google is still using GO, it&#x27;s not a system language it has a GC<p>And since the Rust guy left, their rust effort vanished, at least publicly <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google</a><p>oh and BTW, we&#x27;ll see wich one get flagged, the one who call someone a TROLL because he give valid arguments, or someone who call someone a delusionist')
