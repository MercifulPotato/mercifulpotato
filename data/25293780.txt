If that&#x27;s what you want to argue, fine, but it&#x27;s not relevant to antitrust action discussed here.<p>There is plenty of choice, many of which I&#x27;m happy with and many of which I&#x27;m not. I think it&#x27;s farcical to say that there is no choice, millions of consumers have chosen freely without coercion from many options. The choices we have today are options that consumers have chosen willingly and repeatedly over other options that no longer exist.')
