To be honest: it primarily goes through the same general steps as most of our boards - ALC Operations Team designs it; PCBs are ordered; once PCBs are received, it goes through the pick &amp; place, reflow, inspection, and packaging; finally, the boards are sent using our standard fulfillment&#x2F;shipping. Does that help?')
