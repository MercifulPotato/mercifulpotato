Are all (where all is not 100% but around me pretty close to that) parents going to suffer from Alzheimer.<p>I am saying this because with few notable exceptions (like N=2) all my friends, including myself and my wife, slept poorly at least during the first year of their child and sometimes up until second year. I think this counts as sustained poor sleep.<p>So either I am living in a bubble and I should add this to the list of stressful things I feel (I read) I am not doing right as a parent, or nature decided at one point to select children of parents predisposed to alzheimer.')
