Buying from a scalper is strictly riskier than buying from a retailer (might not be able to return faulty equipment, etc). There might be exceptions for rare &#x2F; limited edition items because then scalpers can potentially control the whole market and extract monopolistic profits (assuming the demand curve allows it).<p>Scalpers only exist when the true market price of something doesn&#x27;t match the list price (Demand &gt;&gt; Supply). Graphics cards worldwide, microphones, at-home lifting equipment, USD in Venezuela... it&#x27;s basically Uber&#x27;s surge pricing but for products :)')
