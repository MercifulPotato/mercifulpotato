Item(by='leptons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603952886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916234, text='No, the goal is to swap them out during the day.<p>When I&#x27;m <i>seriously</i> on-the-move, and the phone is critical to the mission, and I&#x27;m not able to be attached to a cord or carry a bulky external battery bank - a few thin, flat lithium batteries are an ideal solution. I&#x27;m talking about situations where high availability is key. Sometimes I bring 2 or 3 backup phones just in case, all the same model, and they all take the same batteries. It wasn&#x27;t uncommon for me to have about 8 spare batteries on some trips. Half the batteries were always charging at a base station, and I would swap those out in a few seconds and get back out where I needed to be. Yeah it&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s situation, but now I just need to have 4 or 5 devices instead, and have to use a stupid external charger which never does what I need it to. Operationally it&#x27;s made me suffer having to use modern devices without removable batteries.<p>Charging from an external battery bank is just not ideal, it&#x27;s inefficient, and bulky, and increases the heat of the device while charging which can actually be a problem in some situations.<p>Changing batteries takes less than a minute, creates no additional heat, and restores the device to 100% instantly.<p>I did this with every phone I had before they took the option away from flagship phones.')
