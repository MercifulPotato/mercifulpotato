The problems are:<p>- Binary format is big endian. All modern processors use little endian.<p>- The time format doesn&#x27;t have a time zone.<p>- The binary time format is in UTC, while the text format is in local time, and you have to convert (WTF!)<p>- The binary time format is HUGE.<p>- Typed nulls seems a little excessive for very little gain.<p>- No efficient small integer encoding.<p>- Containers in the binary format are prepended by the element count, which makes progressive container filling impossible.<p>- No custom types (except maybe s-exps, which are overkill)<p>- No metadata<p>- No URI, UUID types<p>- no markup container<p>- no references')
