Item(by='dexterlemmer', descendants=None, kids=[25440745], score=None, time=1608061009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25417891, text='&gt; &quot;Would you give me your home address and keys so I can drop off a newspaper on your coffee table each morning?&quot;<p>... Oh. And BTW. I&#x27;ll be making some copies of your keys to give to a bunch of others interested in placing adds on your coffee table (or so they claim). I&#x27;ll also go through all your drawers to see if I can&#x27;t find any other keys&#x2F;access cards&#x2F;... to gain access to your office or your colleages&#x27; offices, friends&#x27; or family&#x27;s homes, etc. just so I can provide them with the same adds &quot;service&quot; as I intend to provide you. Of course I don&#x27;t remind you of any of this. Nor do I tell your colleagues, friends, family, etc. After all. What you don&#x27;t know will aid me and what they don&#x27;t know will aid me. ;-)')
