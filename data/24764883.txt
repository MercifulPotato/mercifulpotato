That said, there really isn&#x27;t precedent that nails down what network interactions constitute distribution. The biggest practical effect is that a lot of companies (both software vendors and end users) simply don&#x27;t allow the use of AGPL code.<p>So (not legal advice) your issue isn&#x27;t so much that a service provider will make a user-facing service out of your code. But that many won&#x27;t touch it at all because of the AGPL license.<p>Also note though that someone <i>can</i> offer a user facing service using AGPL code, they just have to distribute any other code that is part of the overall work. (Which is what a couple of the new usage-restricting non-open source licenses seek to prevent.)')
