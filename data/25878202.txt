Modules take years to design, build, and test.<p>That&#x27;s why the current trend moves towards ever smaller and thus cheaper satellites and big launchers like Delta IV Heavy, Ariane 5, and Falcon Heavy barely see any action at all.<p>Starship would enable single-launch space stations, yes. But there are no single-launch space station designs yet and building one will either take time (ISS&#x2F;MIR) or end up being much more expensive per person day due to weak design (e.g. Skylab).')
