Added the Tamahide restaurant to visit sometime, thanks!<p>The biggest thing I&#x27;ve felt since moving here: whether or not you can speak and interact in Japanese makes a world of difference. Seriously. I have interacted with expats who have not studied any inkling of Japanese, nor have tried any kind of interactions apart from other expats, and it felt their life was so bland. For example, they&#x27;d struggle to order anything except at big chain restaurants that have English menus, so that small alleyway restaurant that serves super nice ramen? Or that washoku (Japanese food) restaurant that&#x27;s famous for its signature dish in Japanese? Very hard.<p>And that&#x27;s without all the intricacies of interacting with Japanese people (beyond asking for directions where people are very helpful). Boy, that&#x27;s a rollercoaster ride. Sometimes you strike up conversations with people so easily because you can speak the language. Sometimes you get hurt because of differences in ways of thinking. Sometimes you try to put yourself in a Japanese person&#x27;s shoes and try to understand what they&#x27;re thinking. To me, it&#x27;s been one of the most fun parts so far.<p>And I feel much more welcome. For example, the bento (packed lunch) shop run by a family where I buy a takeout from once a week? They know my name and can tell my voice when I call to order a bento. I ask them how&#x27;s life and they do as well as we chitchat while visiting their shop. I leave the shop with both of us saying &quot;Thanks as always!&quot;. These small things do make a difference  when you&#x27;re living thousands of miles away from your home country.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining that there should be more English stuff in general; I feel people are trying to improve the situation. Nor that I&#x27;m saying not knowing Japanese will make your life hell; it won&#x27;t. But, it will be bland. Especially if you happen to end up at a local town in rural Japan. That has its own charm points but you&#x27;d miss out most of them.<p>TLDR: Speaking from experience, if you ever plan to stay long-term in Japan, learn Japanese. I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret it.<p>(Sorry for the long rant.)')
