Last time I checked, BLM app ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;black-lives-matter&#x2F;id955318790" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;black-lives-matter&#x2F;id955318790</a> ) is on Apple store and the group has, among other notable events, burning Kenosha done on their bucket list.
