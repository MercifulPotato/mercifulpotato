Item(by='Out_of_Characte', descendants=None, kids=[24992917], score=None, time=1604504032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24987058, text='&gt;Devices are eventually going to segregate themselves onto their own networks: 2.4 GHz for legacy &#x2F; low-cost &#x2F; IOT, 5 GHz for data rate, wigig&#x2F;wifi 6&#x2F;etc for extreme data rate.<p>That would be rather annoying. Wifi is so usefull because you can connect everything to the same network. Especially when most consumers are oblivious to any computer architecture design decisions. And can you really expect someone living in a tiny apartment to purchase three network types? (2.4; 5ghz; wifi6) or one expensive device with all three technologies? Communicating data rates and transmission power will be the way to go I believe.<p>If I can hook up a printer to a network switch then that&#x27;s what I usually go for. And pray that the printer actually works.')
