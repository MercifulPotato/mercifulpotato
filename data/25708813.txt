There&#x27;s a left wing inside the Democratic party, but the Democratic party is not left wing.<p>George Soros is not &quot;left wing&quot;\nBill Clinton was not &quot;left&quot;, and Hilary wasn&#x27;t either.<p>It&#x27;s not even a question of what&#x27;s relative. They don&#x27;t even call themselves &quot;left.&quot;<p>I spent much of my 20s and 30s in the organized and unorganized left, as an activist. Back then (90s, mostly), globalization was the enemy, not the goal. We were tear gassed at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City protesting the negotiation of trade agreements. It&#x27;s a strange world to see now people lump BLM and Bernie Sanders and your local Trotskyite sect in the same camp as Biden, and &quot;globalists&quot; and &quot;George Soros.&quot;<p>As in 1930s Germany, the far right has adopted certain clasically left positions on certain issues in order to mobilize the working class, but for opposite goals. Many of the slogans chanted in the Capitol building the other day (&quot;whose house? our house?&quot;) are directly lifted from left wing activists.<p>Nothing speaks to the disintegration and loss of the actual socialist left in North America more than the fact people can&#x27;t identify them anymore from the background neoliberalism of the American political mainstream.')
