It&#x27;s exhausting when they don&#x27;t listen (&quot;right, right, you&#x27;ve read something on the internet, yes, yes... why don&#x27;t you let me take a look at it first&quot;) or they only try their common approaches that have failed before and if you don&#x27;t fit that mold, well, too bad.<p>I hope you find a way to manage (or better yet, get rid of) your pain. It&#x27;s such a waste that, unless you&#x27;re famous, rich or a rare, scientifically interesting case, the point of &quot;sorry, there&#x27;s nothing else I&#x27;m willing to do for you&quot; comes rather quickly. It seems with most chronic problems, you need to become an expert and then find and convince somebody who is certified and can write a prescription.')
