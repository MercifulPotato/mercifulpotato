Because of that I circled back with the folks who rejected her, and in chatting with them, discovered they felt she wasn&#x27;t a good fit for the team, but would be able to do the work.  I spoke to my HR folks, and my own manager, and we agreed to overrule the team and hire her.<p>Straight up, best decision on hiring I have ever made.')
