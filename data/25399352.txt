When you revisit this piece of code later, or another person finds it, your first experience with the debugger is not remembered, thus lost.  This is what I meant.  On the contrary, if you clarify the code and make it easier to instrumentate (by adding assertions, tests, comments, logging, etc.), it helps you right now, you in the future, and everybody else at any time.  Furthermore, as a result of these efforts you will create a code that is clearer and nobody will ever need to debug to understand what it does.<p>The only case where debugging makes sense to me is for cases that are difficult to add instrumentation to, like assembly programming, where it will be somewhat inevitable that you need to step through the instructions to see what&#x27;s going on.')
