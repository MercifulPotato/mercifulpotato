Protobufs seems like an odd take but I&#x27;m looking forward to their subsequent articles<p>The best in class right now is Open API 3, which offers a way to describe endpoints, verbs and expected responses with a JSON  schema. And even so, working with it feels primitive compared to, for instance, front end focused tools with bundling, type checking, package management and so forth.<p>With Open API 3 &#x2F; Swagger, you hand write a YAML or JSON file or fill out a form and have it done for you, but there is no code completion nevermind AST analysis. And now you have a schema, but there is no automatic link between that schema and the backend code, nor error typing, nor validation. The code generation options that are available are clunky and not customizable. If you change the code, you just have to go over the schema by hand again and make adjustments. Unit tests help of course, but you build it yourself<p>As for server responses, there aren&#x27;t really coalescing best practices. There are many possibilities for incoming and outgoing headers, but no language or library to ensure getting them right, the way that TypeScript works for instance<p>I really feel like this is greenfield territory, but that&#x27;s strange, since it&#x27;s pretty critical')
