OCSP requests only include the certificate&#x27;s serial number, however, and (AFAIK) Apple does not publish a directory of all issued certificates.<p>WRT the web PKI, though, yes, the serial number can be looked up in CT logs. Although that same &quot;basic packet capture&quot; will give you the hostname of the server -- at least until encrypted SNI is used everywhere.<p>(As for why OCSP is <i>unencrypted</i>, chicken and egg... rsponses <i>are</i> signed, however.)')
