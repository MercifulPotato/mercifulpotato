Item(by='vram22', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604349311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24964463, text='&gt; Bengali is very much a descendent of Sanskrit<p>Yes, that is nearly same as what I said above, except I said &quot;likely&quot;, because I was not sure, not being a language expert. And that &quot;likely&quot; applied to the other languages I mentioned too, in that sentence.<p>Edit: Actually, I am (still anecdotally) pretty sure of it for at least Hindi and Marathi, because both of them have too many words which are the same as, or derived from Sanskrit, for it to be a mistake.')
