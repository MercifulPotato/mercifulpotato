Do you see how it handles known content types from a new website that you haven&#x27;t previously visited seamlessly without you reading docs and telling it what to do with it?<p>I want to get my job done with an API, not browse it. I spend most of my time figuring out what order endpoints need to be called in and what data they need to be passed, not what the endpoints are.<p>The shittiest HTTP APIs I&#x27;ve used had full lists of endpoints but nonexistent documentation of arguments. If HATEOAS solves that I can get behind it, but I don&#x27;t think it does.')
