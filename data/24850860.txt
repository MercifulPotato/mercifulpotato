Item(by='temp667', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603306438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850659, text='Absolutely - I auto deny reflexively, and probably miss out on notifcations I want.<p>It&#x27;s weird - cookie popups (I can browse incognito or clear cookies or use an extension to control my own cookies) and the notification popup I found similarly annoying.<p>Just let me browse and control my browsing on my own terms. In the website text it can ask that I go into a notifications whitelist panel and add a url that can send notifications, or click on an element that triggers the pop-up etc.<p>Similarly, we keep on hearing these headlines about someone not having the right cookie popups or enough of them etc. I wish those would go away as well. The place to control cookies is with the user. I&#x27;m not sure disabling cookies even hides my activities from a site (obviously it doesn&#x27;t).')
