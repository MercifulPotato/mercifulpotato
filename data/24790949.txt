But for Terraform, you still need to know the underlying provider; to use Terraform in AWS I have to know what AWS resources I&#x27;m looking for, Azure resources in Azure, and so on. But Terraform adds value through abstraction. I don&#x27;t need to learn the specific AWS&#x2F;Azure calls; Terraform does it for me. Terraform provides a sane, consistent syntax. And it encourages a declarative workflow that the cloud providers themselves don&#x27;t do very well&#x2F;at all.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily see Waypoint providing that same value. You need to know the underlying provider to know what you want to do with it, but the abstraction seems to make it more difficult to use that provider, not easier. But I am a devops professional, not an application developer, so I might just be the wrong market for it.<p>Either way, congratulations on the release, and I&#x27;m excited to see where Waypoint goes from here.')
