The most important thing to me (and I suspect many other people in favor of decentralization&#x2F;federation) is the ability to host my own service. I couldn&#x27;t care less if 90% of email users are on gmail as long as I can run own email server or pay someone else to run one for me while still communicating with everyone.<p>I&#x27;m sure some people would disagree with my priorities above but for my experience as a user, that is what makes the most difference to me - not being boxed into what someone else thinks my client should look&#x2F;act like or being locked into their server. Naturally I think more decentralization is better, but that&#x27;s more a philosophical preference whereas wanting to run my own server or pick my own client is more about usability and control.')
