Item(by='aw1621107', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611680151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913775, text='&gt; In such a case it is incorrect to say that the evidence was found to be lacking because the evidence was never considered.<p>I feel like now the disputable phrase is &quot;considering the evidence&quot;. Is the judge not considering the evidence when deciding that the presented facts&#x2F;evidence are insufficient to support the complaint, even when assumed to be true? How would such a ruling differ from a hypothetical one where the case goes to trial and the defense does literally nothing? Is the evidence considered in the latter case but not the former?')
