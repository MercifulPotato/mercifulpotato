I&#x27;m certainly interested in understanding your perspective.<p>I hope I&#x27;m not misinterpreting your statements, but it appears you agree that information is rooted in trust. In fact, you say it&#x27;s philosophically so, while I make a weaker claim about practicality.<p>A paradox would arise if I were to say &quot;information is based in trust, trust no one&quot;. But I would instead say &quot;information is based in trust, empirically evaluate your basis for trust&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I recognize what&#x27;s dangerous about the claim, or what your proposed alternative is.')
