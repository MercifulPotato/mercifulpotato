Each “wallet” contains one vote, and voters create a transaction that sends their vote to the “wallet” for the candidate they are voting for.<p>The private keys would be randomly generated and not recorded by anyone, so anonymity would be preserved.  Normal blockchain double-spend protections would prevent double voting.<p>Am I missing anything?')
