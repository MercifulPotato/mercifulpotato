If you stole, say, the Swedish crown jewels ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.se&#x2F;20190211&#x2F;police-confirm-swedens-stolen-crown-jewels-found-strangnas-royal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelocal.se&#x2F;20190211&#x2F;police-confirm-swedens-stol...</a> ), you could pop off all the jewels and melt down the gold for its weight value, but that would be losing almost 100% of the value.<p>The thieves can&#x27;t auction off their books by listing them at Christie&#x27;s. But that&#x27;s not the same claim as &quot;the thieves can&#x27;t auction off their books&quot;.')
