Somebody doing X and a culture where many people turn a blind eye to and enable X aren&#x27;t the same thing.<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes a huge difference tbh.<p>&gt; We&#x27;re talking about forums on the internet. Are you an I &quot;aligned&quot; because we had this discussion here?<p>No. But this is a forum that generally frowns on and downvotes conspiracy theories. If you go to a forum that&#x27;s primary function is discussing them, then I would say yes.<p>&gt; Also, please do respond to my edit. I&#x27;m still pretty clueless as to the better way to work the problem of powerful people turning a blind eye to and enabling lawbreaking by other powerful people other than just talking about it.<p>&gt;What is the right way to address e.g. the widespread availability of illegal prostitution in hotels owned by American companies in foreign countries? I saw a few news articles in the press exploring the phenomenon a few years back, but nothing changed. Am I supposed to found a non-profit? A newspaper? Do the investigation myself and publish it to LiveLeak? Write a letter to my congresswoman? I&#x27;m honestly not sure how to work that problem, other than just talking to other people about it.<p>Well given that your theory could be wrong, yeah, you should probably either do the investigation yourself, fund someone else to do the investigation, or find a different problem to solve that is within your power to affect. Raising awareness of something in the form of a conspiracy theory delegitamizes it.<p>For example, how legitamite anti human trafficking non-profits have had a harder time doing productive things due to conspiracy theory influence: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;qanons-obsession-with-savethechildren-is-making-it-harder-to-save-kids-from-traffickers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;qanons-obsession-with-s...</a>')
