Immunity to those is hypothesized to be a 1 year time frame. Covid19 is probably going to be similar. The game changer is the vaccine which may cause a more durable and longer term immune response.<p>Mechanistically reinfection is possible even with a vaccine but you may be asymptomatic or the disease course may be innocuous and the infectious period reduced.  This is what reduces the Ro value below 1.')
