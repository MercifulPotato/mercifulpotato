Publishers sell prestigue and attention, and this can&#x27;t easily be replicated, nor is it unnecessary.\nThe increase in research papers makes them even more valueable in my eyes.<p>This is despite me wanting to see many changes to publishing and science distribution.<p>edit: removed part that I deemed unecessarily hostile.')
