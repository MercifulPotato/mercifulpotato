It’s also a serious underestimate—10k is more typical for the initial filing.<p>That&#x27;s not right. That&#x27;s $6,000 all in. Maybe software patents are more expensive.<p>&gt;Almost every single provisional application I’ve seen filed without a lawyer’s input has been close to worthless. This is a false economy.<p>That&#x27;s a bad sample then. A lay person can definitely file a good provisional patent application. They just need to describe the invention inside and out.')
