Then came <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitignore.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitignore.io</a> and made my life a lot easier. Sadly, not too long ago, Toptal decided to rebrand the site a bit (not too much, but we developers are purists). So, the next time I spun up a new repository, I started procrastinating. I no longer wanted to have to leave the terminal to setup a .gitignore file. And thus git-ignore was born. You can now utilize battle-tested ignore templates right from your terminal.')
