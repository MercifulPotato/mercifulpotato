I guess all the cars will need to be charged during the night, in parallel.<p>Parking garages could add charging stations for all their customers and get paid for that.<p>Parking places on the streets could be equipped with charging stations, one per place. It&#x27;s going to be more complicated than laying fiber optics but doable. It&#x27;s a new grid as big as the current one and for higher wattage.<p>Finally, if you have to park where there are no charging stations, oops.<p>Gas stations that can refill N cars per hour will be able to recharge a fraction of them, bad news for those businesses.<p>Of course this is true only if we&#x27;ll have to charge. If battery swap becomes common then the problem will be solved. Yet, the volume and the weight of a battery is still greater than the volume and weight of the gasoline storing the equivalent energy. The logistics will be more complicated. I expect to see power plants dedicated to charging:  charge batteries -&gt; load them on a truck -&gt; deliver to &quot;EV stations&quot; -&gt; bring back the exhausted batteries -&gt; check if they&#x27;re still OK -&gt; loop again.')
