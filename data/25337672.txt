Item(by='Stephen304', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607375877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25336494, text='&gt; In US English you might say &quot;gotten Gitter&quot;, i guess.<p>I assumed &quot;got&quot; was extraneous due to editing, removing it sounds a lot better to my ear: &quot;An alternative architecture would be to have Gitter directly federating with Matrix by...&quot;<p>I assumed it was a mistake due to editing, since I would use &quot;got&quot; primarily in this way: &quot;An alternative architecture would be if we got Gitter directly federating with Matrix by...&quot;, to my ear &quot;got&quot; normally follows a noun, but I think the alliteration makes it sound extra awkward.<p>At any rate, I&#x27;m no english major so it&#x27;s not a big deal.<p>&gt; You can already create non-repo rooms in Gitter<p>My question is less about non-repo rooms and more about rooms that look like repo-rooms. Is there any protection against a malicious user setting up &quot;#google_chromium:gitter.im&quot; and distributing malicious binaries?<p>Edit: Maybe I&#x27;m not really asking a clear question - overall I&#x27;m wondering what the long term plan is for the gitter room addresses, where you can be sure that matrix-org&#x2F;matthew-test belongs to matrix-org. It seems to me that if the gitter room addresses are planned to be removed in the long term, the security implications of the room address will change, so I was looking for some mention of that in the post. Not that it&#x27;s a huge deal if communicated properly, people would just have to be sure they found the room from an official repo and keep in mind that the restriction of creating rooms under the org is no longer present.')
