Item(by='Daniel_sk', descendants=None, kids=[25223298, 25223061], score=None, time=1606419659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25222834, text='The engine decouples and either shuts down completely (if you don&#x27;t have Start-Stop switched off) or it just idles on low RPM. Before the Audi I had a BMW that wasn&#x27;t classified as MHEV and it still would decouple the engine during coasting (in Eco mode), but it would not turn it off because this would add a delay of 1-2 seconds until the engine is ready again (and it didn&#x27;t have the additional battery + electric motor to start it in these conditions). The small electric motor helps to quickly start the motor in this decoupled mode (which again is not something that only hybrids have) and so it can be turned off for up to 40 seconds of coasting. All of this can be disabled in the Settings menu and the engine will never go into &quot;coasting&quot; mode and this coasting mode will almost never be triggered in the city anyway (you can see that it will shift from a specific gear like 6 to just &quot;D&quot; - and then you know that the engine is decoupled).\nAnyway, I and many others (most?) turn off the start-stop right when you start the vehicle. I just don&#x27;t like that the engine turns off on every intersection and then you have a second of delay and slow response + more wear on engine for so many starts and stops. In this case it will still coast with the decoupled - but idling - engine.<p>Also by coasting I mean condition where the car has enough momentum and either goes downhill or there is a slower speed limit ahead (this is detected automatically from map data) and the car knows that it can just decouple the engine. This is evaluated by the car based on some conditions, it&#x27;s not controlled by the driver.')
