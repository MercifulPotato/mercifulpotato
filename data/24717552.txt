It also is still mired in an ancient architecture based on technical decisions made 25 years ago that just don&#x27;t apply now, doesn&#x27;t take advantage of modern GPU pipeline improvements and has issues with poor multithreading and asynchronous processing. This is why Metal managed to get 10x rendering performance.<p>The other aspect is that openGL has nothing to offer when it comes to accelerated compute services to compete with CUDA. Apple needed a single solution across desktop and mobile, that could also provide a compelling alternative to CUDA and that didn&#x27;t leave them dependent on anyone else.')
