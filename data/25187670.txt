Item(by='ntsplnkv2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606145160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187199, text='&gt; also I think people had fewer emails known in their address books than they generally have friends on social media though I don&#x27;t have any numbers to back up that gut feeling.<p>This is the bottom line.<p>Back in the day you&#x27;d join a forum over a particular topic or hobby. Everyone had screen names. Moderation was tight, if there was politics it was confined to a single area that was easily avoided. You only saw &quot;links&quot; to &quot;topics&quot; that included images, not images.<p>Now with social media, people share images, memes, quotes, posts, etc. But while before that could be confined to one particular area and wasn&#x27;t visible with fully anonymous screen names, now you see a real person that you know saying it, in your feed. It makes it feel more real. And get this - 50 people liked it and shared it themselves.<p>Where Facebook&#x27;s brilliance comes in - is that it gamed the process of popularity. Most want to have as many &quot;friends&quot; as possible at first, they see old people they knew and want to see what they&#x27;re up to, want to be popular, etc. But they don&#x27;t realize that they really just don&#x27;t want to get to know that many people that well. Some people are insane, some are borderline white supremacists, some are borderline anarchists. Before you never saw that side of people often. Now it&#x27;s right in your face.<p>My advice? use social media for what it was originally designed for - staying in touch with friends you actually care about. Not politics. And mute&#x2F;remove any friend who cares more about their agenda than seeing a good friend&#x27;s cool vacation or neat artwork or cute newborn.')
