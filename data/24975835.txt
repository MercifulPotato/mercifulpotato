I work for SpaceX, and I&#x27;m the hiring manager for the &#x27;Senior Full Stack Software Engineer (Application Software): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;1f5a69532us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;1f5a69532us</a>&#x27; position. I&#x27;ve been here for 4.5 years and I think what we do is neat.<p>This is an exciting time to be working in this organization. We just launched Starlink Beta; we have engineers writing software to help produce Starlinks (the dish), control our network, and manage customer accounts. At the same time, we have engineers writing software to help produce Starships, Dragon capsules, and refurbished Falcon 9 first stages. The projects we take on to aid these programs are challenging and rewarding.<p>If you have any questions about the role, our organization, or working at SpaceX, ask away. I&#x27;ll do my best to respond promptly.<p>Best,\nSteve')
