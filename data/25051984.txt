I could easily see it already being 50%+. Even a layman would know to be suspicious of &quot;12% Biden, 11% Trump, 77% No Response&quot;.<p>I can&#x27;t even tell you if a pollster called me... I&#x27;m getting about half-a-dozen calls a day from rando numbers that want to refinance my nonexistent student loans or talk to me about my home&#x27;s nonexistent warrantee. I went to permanent do-not-disturb months before the election was even in the news. If you don&#x27;t leave me a voice message I don&#x27;t even know you exist; if you do leave me a voice message you&#x27;ve got about 3 seconds to convince me you&#x27;re not a spammer before it&#x27;s trashed.')
