That&#x27;s not plausible at least where I live, since (a) this would be massively abused to drain people&#x27;s banking accounts and (b) the bank would be fully on the hook for compensating these losses (above an initial 50 eur risk IIRC), so none of the banks would even consider permitting a risk like that, since that would cost them so much money.<p>If you need to reset your bank credentials (not solely a password - some form of second factor is universally required), it can&#x27;t happen electronically without involving the real world; either you come to a branch with proper ID or you get mailed them to your registered physical address.')
