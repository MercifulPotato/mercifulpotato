Both because of the copy&#x2F;paste stuff you mentioned but also just validating syntax can be time consuming.<p>There is an offline workflow tester I&#x27;ve tried but it is not close enough to the real thing to add that much value.<p>I&#x27;ve also struggled at times with how data moves around. There are docs and even example actions, but the overall state of education on doing cool stuff with GA is pretty weak.<p>I&#x27;ve also struggled with some of packages, and services--although some of the pain I&#x27;ve experienced is just software and service dependency management in general and that&#x27;s a big challenge unrelated to GA.<p>Speed is a real consideration, though self-hosted runners can potentially solve that problem for you.<p>Rather than a get what you pay for take, I feel more like it is still early for the product. The visibility is high because it is Github, but it is still getting a lot of things worked out.<p>For me, GA is too conveniently integrated to Github to ignore.')
