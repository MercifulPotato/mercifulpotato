Amazon has put time and energy into work making the service but little (AFAICT) into the Elasticsearch product itself.<p>In my opinion this is a short-sighted way for Amazon to do business. If Elastic makes every new feature unusable by Amazon, do to licensing restrictions, Amazon&#x27;s product will fall behind.')
