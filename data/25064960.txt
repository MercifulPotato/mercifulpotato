They&#x27;re always reaching so far to implement grand features that the core functionality was constantly buggy. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve improved since I last used it years ago, but I gave up before they could stabilize it.<p>Dropbox is another example of a tool that started out nearly perfect in its simplicity and laser-like focus on doing a few things well, but continues to get worse and worse with each additional layer of features. I was so much happier with Dropbox when it integrated transparently into my filesystem instead of trying to force their UI into everything. Now, even clicking the button to open the Dropbox folder launches a customized Dropbox file browser UI instead of just taking me to my Dropbox folder.')
