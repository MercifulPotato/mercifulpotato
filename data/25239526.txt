I&#x27;d also be ok with something like a web browser, but just Forth scripts being shared like you said. As long as I have text and images and a way to view them, I don&#x27;t think anything else matters.<p>It sounds like y&#x27;all are trying to build the original internet OS (iOS, but years before Apple took the term) that Carl Sassenrath of Amiga and Rebol fame was trying to build. Rebol is a lot like both lisp and forth, and is very powerful. Carl thought users would just share Rebol scripts over the network. To give some context, a fully graphical tetris is like 3&#x2F;4 a page of Rebol code. If only he had open sourced it sooner.')
