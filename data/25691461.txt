I don&#x27;t have any empirical data to back that up, so it&#x27;s just a general assessment from watching the industry.  In my mind, Facebook pioneered a lot of the bad practices and has been the leader in unethical practices.<p>For me, that makes Facebook worse than the others because increasing profits by being unethical is easy and as soon as one company in an industry starts doing it, others are left in an impossible situation.  Either they become unethical to compete or they get outcompeted and fail.<p>Facebook has also demonstrated they&#x27;re not going to change until someone forces them.  Even with all the pushback in the last couple years, they&#x27;re still pulling anti-consumer stunts like the forced account tying &#x2F; data collection with Oculus and Instagram.  I tend to judge companies by their actions rather than their words and Facebook hasn&#x27;t ever done anything to make me think they care even the tiniest little bit about the public good.')
