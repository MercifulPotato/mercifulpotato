The scientific community is responsible for peer reviews and journals can operate however they’d like. Google is responsible for google and can submit&#x2F;censor&#x2F;only pay for research that they want to pay for. Good luck finding any academic that is not beholden to their source of funding.<p>Academia is not the “uncompromised land of science” that it may seem to be. What google is doing is par for the course. I have about 50 other complaints about academia before I get to my complaints about private companies censoring research (which I believe is a very harsh take on the situation at hand.)')
