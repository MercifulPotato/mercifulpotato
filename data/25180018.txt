They’re the ones who bought houses in all the gentrifying neighborhoods, they’re the ones with two or more kids, and they bought index funds with all that money, so the effects of going to a top tier university massively compounded.<p>Some people have already pointed out that top tier universities have been discounted for the last decade. But even in 2000, Harvard college cost less than half of what it does now. Taking out loans to pay for Havard in 2000 would be the best investment you could ever make in your life, <i>just</i> considering that same inflation that partly raised Harvard’s tuition price also reduced the real cost of your debt.<p>I believe the underlying problem is not financial literacy though.')
