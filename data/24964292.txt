What matters is being placed in the right context—without that, newtypes are just a labeling scheme, a way of giving something a name.<p>What&#x27;s a better alternative though?<p>I like this approach for tagging e.g. user input that has been checked to be free of HTML&#x2F;JS injection hacks to stop you from outputting user input that hasn&#x27;t been checked first (Angular does something like this with TypeScript I think). Obviously you could tag something as safe that isn&#x27;t by mistake but at least the places in your code this decision is made is explicit and you can&#x27;t forget to do it.<p>I&#x27;m not seeing a practical alternative that would be significantly better. If you want to be able to capture any property you can think of in the type system (like bounded integers or bounded lists), you&#x27;re inevitably  going to need dependent types and they&#x27;re about as far from practical as you can get (where either you or the computer will then have to write difficult maths proofs before you know your code is correct).')
