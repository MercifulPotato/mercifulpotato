Due to how the system is set up at the governmental level, whenever any participant in the trial experiences adverse reactions, the trial is halted, until an explanation can be given. It&#x27;s a serious concern that can and does lead to products not being approved by the FDA. Not being approved = loss of tens or sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars. People take this stuff very very very seriously :)')
