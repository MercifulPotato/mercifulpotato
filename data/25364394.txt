I highly recommend watching the documentary The Plot Against the President[1] on Amazon Prime. It does a very good job showing how the media does not report the facts anymore. I bet most people don&#x27;t even know that the entire Trump and Russia ties &#x2F; collusion were fabricated and proved patently false. The media decided to ignore reporting that, leading most people to think Trump has ties with Russia. It&#x27;s dishonest and disingenuous and manipulating people to think a certain way and believe things that are not true.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Plot-Against-President-Devin-Nunes&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B08LMJ93LL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Plot-Against-President-Devin-Nunes&#x2F;dp...</a>')
