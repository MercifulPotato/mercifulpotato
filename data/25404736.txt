I feel like what it boils down to is that there are a decent amount of people that prefer life under an authoritarian regime (whether governmental or corporate). A regime where someone they trust decides for them how they should enjoy their life and protects them from bad choices. Merely allowing a different party from offering a competing choice would undermine the whole premise.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the cruise ship industry where you forgo choice (compared to traveling outside of a tour) but gain safety and the benefit of not having to research or make decisions. If anyone could open up a restaurant or organise an outing on a cruise ship, then that perceived safety disappears and the need to make conscious decisions arises.<p>As this seems to be a reasonably common theme in these posts I wonder if there&#x27;s a market for more products that follow a similar purchase incentive, like a fridge that only allows you to insert groceries you&#x27;ve bought from the trusted supermarket.')
