Which rarely has a cache hit already by now (see many other posts on this site).<p>&gt; &quot;rely on a large service to actual host your content for you&quot;<p>This is the case anyway even with cross domain caching as the source you cache still needs to have the <i></i>exact<i></i> same URL including domain. The cross domain only refers to the site loading the resource.<p>So e.g. `foo.example&#x2F;jquery-3.2.1` and `bar.example&#x2F;jquery-3.2.1` where never treated as the same at any point in time. The only think changed is that if `foo.example` and `bar.example` both depended on `cdn.example&#x2F;jquery-3.2.1` and you visited `foo.example` before `bar.example` it might already have been cached when you visit `bar.example`. Through most times it wasn&#x27;t as e.g. `bar` used a different CDN a different URL to the same resource or a different version.<p>So this change doesn&#x27;t really affect small sites more then any other side. And the effect is generally negligible.')
