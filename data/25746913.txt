None of those people, regardless of what they&#x27;re fighting for (in particular if they&#x27;re doing it in good faith) are using the right tactics to achieve their goals. BLM chanting &quot;defund the police&quot; while rioting and requiring more police? Right-wingers want their politics &amp; cclaims of election fraud taken seriously while staging a faux-coup in clown custumes? What did they expect, the public opinion <i>not</i> to turn against them? These tactics are so ridiculous that I find it really hard to believe they were sincere in their intentions.<p>Same here for Big Tech. If they wanted to prevent &quot;inciting violence&quot; they&#x27;d censor specific tweets, not ban Trump and Paul Ryan. But, mostly, I think the best move against further violence was increased government action, both in case of BLM (e.g. destroying CHAZ in Portland) and in case of Capitol attack (increased military presence in DC).<p>I think (and hope) that FB&amp;co are digging their own grave. They probably calmed Democrats for now, but they&#x27;re a single scandal away from being dismanteled.')
