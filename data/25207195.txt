Our arguments are orthogonal to the point.  I&#x27;m simply saying the ideal number of wolves is almost certainly more than zero.  You seem to be arguing that there&#x27;s no ideal number of wolves, which is reasonable.  The ideal number could easily change over time as well.  Before the industrial revolution wolves posed a larger threat than they do today, for example.<p>To further internalize your point, rather than talking about &quot;ideal&quot; wolves, which as you established is not a thing, I will think of it as the ideal change in wolves.  That number could be positive or negative as a function of time and location.')
