Item(by='octoberfranklin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607769174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397098, text='&gt; why the total RDOF grant closed at only $9 billion instead of the anticipated $16 billion<p>It closed low because SpaceX placed a bid in a ton of territorries that were expected to be monopoly single-bid areas.  In the ones SpaceX didn&#x27;t win, the winning bid was nonetheless forced lower by their competitive bid.  The ILECs are furious.  No pity, they can eat a bag.<p>Over the course of the next year the winners need to submit detailed plans for their networks to the FCC, including (for the first time ever) the &quot;oversell&quot; ratio (i.e. how many customers with &quot;1gbit service&quot; are sharing a 10gbit backhaul).  So it could be up to a year before we find out exactly what sort of service each ISP is claiming fits into the performance+latency tiers they bid for.<p>The FCC did lay down some hard rules though: (1) no DSL technologies allowed in the &quot;gigabit&quot; tier and (2) no geosynchronous or medium-earth-orbit satellites in the &quot;low latency&quot; tier.  SpaceX is classified as low-earth-orbit.')
