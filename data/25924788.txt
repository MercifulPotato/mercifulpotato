You might as well point out the problems of C++03. Streams, lambdas, method references, records, and local variable inference make it pretty fluent to write and at the very least it has a sane standard library (I can&#x27;t say as much for Scala).<p>Also as for their intro problem what type of Java programmer worth their salt can&#x27;t do:<p><pre><code>    while (true)\n        System.out.print(System.in.read());</code></pre>')
