The construction of highways through poor (read: minority) urban areas, causing mass respiratory disease and premature deaths[1].<p>Isn&#x27;t this kind of leap?  I&#x27;ve lived plenty of expensive places (e.g. downtown San Diego, Boston, Los Angeles) that had free&#x2F;highways close to expensive property.
