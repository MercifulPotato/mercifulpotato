How can stuff like this be happening in 2020?<p>I&#x27;m surprised at your surprise.<p>Aren&#x27;t there stories about improper arrest and torture quite often?<p>Heck, a friend of mine was improperly arrested recently (the cops lied about what he was doing) and I actually met a guy who had been tortured (soon before I met him) by a state secret police.<p>I also knew a Holocaust survivor.
