Some people are so used to not having a debugger that they don’t know what they’re missing. Debuggers work well for what, windows and websites? I guess Java too? Lots of people end up debugging with prints and that just isn’t so effective. I think I’ve barely used a debugger for more than trivial websites in the last 10 years.<p>They&#x27;re extremely useful for dynamic languages (Python, Ruby, etc) since you can step through call chains and see the full objects being passed around. Wonderful way to learn a new codebase where you have a bunch of functions passing stuff around with no type information in the code.<p>The debugger is the main reason you&#x27;re not gonna pull me away from IntelliJ for JVM or dynamic language stuff... it could be even better - like how CLion is discussed - but I&#x27;m not seeing a better debugger-less alternative.<p>Hooking into async callback stuff and losing useful stacktraces isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not like print statements are gonna do any better there either...')
