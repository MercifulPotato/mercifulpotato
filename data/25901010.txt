Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people&#x27;s privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.\n&gt;&gt;')
