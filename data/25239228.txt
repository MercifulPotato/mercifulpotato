I&#x27;m typically handed a set of Adobe Illustrator files and it&#x27;s my job to use those to build working websites&#x2F;apps.<p>My first project was for $800 in early 2013. The last three years have brought in an average of ~$55K per year. I have several subcontractors who can help out when the workload gets too much, but 80%+ of the work is done by one person (me).<p>A few years back I started offering &quot;maintenance plans&quot; on the websites (which basically entails updating the WordPress core&#x2F;plugins and giving them a few hours per month for enhancement requests). These are remarkably &quot;sticky&quot; and most clients have continued maintenance for 3+ years.<p>The self-employment taxes are brutal, but it&#x27;s still worth it.')
