Switched to v4.0 and everything works. Still it&#x27;s open source and the dev&#x27;s will respond to GitHub issues.<p>Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not too bad, or not so much worse than other chips. It seems <i>every</i> piece of embedded hardware will have quirks and the SDK&#x27;s will have pain points. From what I gather and my limited experience, it&#x27;s more a matter of how many and how severe. I prefer at least an open source SDK where it&#x27;s possible to share patches with the broader community. From what I gather here and elsewhere the only other open source SDK&#x27;s are for the Nordic chips.<p>P.S. the esp32&#x27;s ADC supposedly has terrible calibration issues.')
