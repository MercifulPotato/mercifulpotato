I&#x27;ve optimized it a fair bit, but there&#x27;s probably some tricks I still need to learn. It turns out that mobile processors don&#x27;t like heat very much, and blow out their cache much quicker than you&#x27;d hope. :)<p>In the long run, I think your intuition is correct. The hard physics of the camera constraints (exposure time, etc) will put a hard upper bound on FPS+fidelity, and thus bandwidth.')
