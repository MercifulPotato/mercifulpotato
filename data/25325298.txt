They could just expand that into a fully featured digital wallet to compete with WeChat, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Cash App, PayPal, etc. It&#x27;s actually astonishing they didn&#x27;t do this a decade ago.<p>I get the VC appeal of blockchain, but Facebook already has the money to fund it. Outside tech circles I don&#x27;t think slapping a blockchain label on a product will make it more appealing.')
