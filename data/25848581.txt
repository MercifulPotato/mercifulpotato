Where I type no additional characters to start a paragraph in markdown, I&#x27;ll need to type 9 characters with dumb down? Same goes for titles, subtitles, etc.? While I appreciate people trying to fix problems, I don&#x27;t find the core symbols required for markdown <i>that</i> esoteric and for anything else I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll have as much difficulty remembering the correct dumbdown as I would remembering the equivalent markdown.')
