I think WhatsApp&#x27;s <i>Live Location</i> definitely satisfies many use cases. The biggest distinction I see between it and Zood Location is that Zood shares your location continuously, which is useful for families. The sharer doesn&#x27;t have to re-enable the share every 8 hours. Zood also has an expiring share feature called <i>Timed Sharing</i> [1]. Zood will generate a link you can send to anybody (no Zood required) and the recipient(s) can view your real time location via any web browser, all end-to-end encrypted.<p>&gt; <i>There might be better vistas in B2B.</i><p>That may indeed be the case. It&#x27;s something I need to investigate further.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ara.sh&#x2F;private&#x2F;hn-zood-timed-share.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ara.sh&#x2F;private&#x2F;hn-zood-timed-share.png</a>')
