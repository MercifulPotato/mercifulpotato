If I have a program that calculates projected weight loss and it&#x27;s only used by me on my computer, crashing or displaying obviously incorrect values from accepting negative values for weight or body fat percentage only impacts me so it&#x27;s mostly a user friendliness issue. If I&#x27;m entering my billable time into my employers time tracking system, anything that could corrupt data impacts more than just me. While I could intentionally lie about my billable hours without detection, I shouldn&#x27;t be able to accidentally or intentionally enter that I worked -5 hours or 5000 hours on a particular day. Accepting either is undesirable and impacts others.<p>I&#x27;m confused why the parent comment is being downvoted. It&#x27;s a valid question. It might sound na√Øve to some but it&#x27;s still worth discussing.')
