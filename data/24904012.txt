Is there an alternative model they could have used? Are there companies using such alternative models?<p><i>It&#x27;s hardly persecution to insist that American businesses stop doing gross harm to the American people.</i><p>Agreed, but it&#x27;s very much not clear what the harm is. To say that it&#x27;s algorithm-based advertising is not at all convincing to me, but maybe there&#x27;s a good argument for that being the case that I haven&#x27;t seen? What convinced you?<p><i>lots of people still use these platforms and they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future</i><p>Yes, but I think you underestimate end users. The shift away from supernormal stimuli of all kinds will be slow and arduous, but for whatever reason I have faith that we will do it. We&#x27;re successfully doing it with smoking, and making good progress on the sugar + sedentary lifestyle front as well with all sorts of niche diets and fitness regimines popping up.<p>Although it&#x27;s still super early, I see the beginnings of a move away from this particular brand of virality based social media as well. Examples would be: the popularity of long form lecture series on youtube + online classes (masterclass is fluffy, but also points in this direction), the evolution of shared blocklists on twitter and other similar methods of &quot;bubbling&quot; (including the rise and rise of reddit, as well as discord), the trend of non-toxic, long-lived anonymous accounts on twitter, etc. etc.<p>Also, and maybe I&#x27;m just being unimaginative, but what kinds of market rules would make sense here?')
