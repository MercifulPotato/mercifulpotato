High rents due to the fact that you&#x27;re not allowed to build new housing, high property taxes paid by new residents, while old residents pay nothing, high income and sales taxes to paper over the gap in the budget left by the lack of property tax paid by longtime residents.<p>The whole system has been optimized to milk as much money as possible from newcomers.
