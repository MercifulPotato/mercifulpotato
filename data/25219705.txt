The user has either failed to complete setting things up, or forgot to change the name servers to something else after removing it. It&#x27;s a configuration issue created by the user.<p>Some TLDs check for this, they won&#x27;t transfer a domain to new name servers unless they already respond as authoritative name servers for that domain.<p>The argument is that someone else could set up a zone before you. But there can&#x27;t be duplicate zones, and the user should create this zone before changing the name servers. There are mitigation strategies that have already been discussed, but other than being a Nice Thing (tm) and likely lowering the volume of support tickets I don&#x27;t see how this is the providers fault. You set the name servers before checking that you had control over said name servers, or forgot to change them when moving away.')
