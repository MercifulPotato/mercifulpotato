I interviewed at a few places in March for senior roles and there wasn&#x27;t any algo gotchas. Some coding, I think mostly to make sure I could code. But a lot more emphasis on architecture and team skills.<p>So maybe there&#x27;s the gap between senior roles and mid&#x2F;jr&#x2F;new.<p>But my question then is, how are senior folks training&#x2F;picking folks to replace them?
