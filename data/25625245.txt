Item(by='lcall', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609708026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620859, text='I like this idea of reaching the stars as a higher goal, partly because it (to me at least) clearly implies that we must treat each other non-destructively.  Learning to improve oneself, and service to others in their growth and goals, bring real joy.  I guess maybe it comes with the expansion of self and others in that way.  Selfishness tears it down, like the story of the crabs in the heated water (or something like that), who prevent each other from exiting up &amp; out.<p>And maybe those higher aims can serve as one&#x27;s higher aspirations or guiding purpose, even in the absence of religious beliefs that one sees as actually true, and which lead one to be kind &amp; honest, and to strive for competence in service to family and humanity.  I suggested so in my own writings (at my site), but perhaps less eloquently than the parent comment.<p>My beliefs agree that the earth has a purpose, and also is a creation worth of our respectful stewardship, for high purposes.  And that we can be OK and don&#x27;t have to depopulate -- that there is enough, and to spare, to fulfill the higher purposes, which is comforting to know.')
