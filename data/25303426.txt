Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607096279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302893, text='If the city charged you based on the value of the land you use, you&#x27;d go bankrupt after a picnic in the park. Cities offer plenty of things &quot;for free&quot; (payed by taxes and other sources of income) and you benefit from a lot of those also as pedestrian or cyclist. Drawing the line at drivers seems a bit self centered. I have the feeling you consider most of what you do to be worthy of gratuity. Bycicle lanes and parking still cost to build and maintain but you get them for no additional explicit cost. Ironically (car) road tax pays for some of that.')
