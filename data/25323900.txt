Why did you just say that philosophy can help us address a long list of questions if you&#x27;re willing to concede that maybe philosophy isn&#x27;t for answering questions at all.&quot;</i><p>Because I was answering people who insisted that philosophy was has to be useful.  I&#x27;m not moving the goal posts so much as questioning their assumption that philosophy must have a use to be of value.<p><i>&quot;OP wants answers&quot;</i><p>But this sub-thread is not about the OP&#x27;s wants.  It&#x27;s a reply to people challenging the value of philosophy.<p><i>&quot;Then it&#x27;s not going to be very useful to OP, is it?&quot;</i><p>Again, you&#x27;re assuming that philosophy has to be useful to be of value.  And, again, it <i>can</i> be, for the reasons I stated before, but it can still be valuable even if it isn&#x27;t.')
