They&#x27;re just not public.<p>For the most part, there wasn&#x27;t anything the user did; just Google algorithm bugs. In one case, a startup lost all of its data because one Google system expected another Google system to implement a fraud detection measure, and the other Google system didn&#x27;t. Completely internal to Google, but poof, all of a sudden, account gone, all data gone, and no way to fix it.<p>In another case, GCE lost a contract worth millions of dollars to AWS because Youtube had algorithm bugs. Poof. Youtube system broke. This was early GCE days, and they were looking for successes, and we were sufficiently high-profile that we had a dedicated engineering team. They pushed on Youtube. Youtube said we weren&#x27;t important enough to help.<p>Most of this stuff is either under NDA, or otherwise just private, but it is why my current employer, as a policy, doesn&#x27;t do business with Google. That&#x27;s a big contract too; I&#x27;m not at a startup right now, but at a big company.<p>&gt; And name me one other company that provides unlimited free storage<p>I think you&#x27;re unintentionally arguing I shouldn&#x27;t rely on Google-unique features, since I might lose them. I already knew that. I&#x27;ve learned that lesson painfully over, and over, and over, and over, and over.<p>That hurts Google in B2B. If all customers take that philosophy, Google fundamentally can&#x27;t have unique, differentiating advantages beyond price. It doesn&#x27;t matter what unique AI algorithm Googlers come up with for the Google Cloud. I won&#x27;t use it if I can&#x27;t count on it still being around when I ship my product. And I can&#x27;t. The only time I will use Google is if it provides unique customer access (e.g. Android apps or Youtube eyeballs), which hopefully the antitrust thing will help with.')
