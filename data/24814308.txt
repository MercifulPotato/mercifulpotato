Let me quote myself from my original answer:<p>--- start quote ---<p>&quot;Standardising a language&quot; never works. Prescriptivism rarely does because languages are living things and evolve no matter how many rules you throw at them.<p>--- end quote ---<p>So, Britain has standardised English. Did it work? Well, not really, almost everyone keeps speaking in their own way. As for government speeches... Here&#x27;s SNP&#x27;s Ian Blackford in the House of Commons (not government, but still, a high-ranking politician) [1]. And I believe Americans, Australians and New Zealanders have no problem understanding their politicians despite English not being standardised.<p>As for TV. Have you ever watched British TV outside BBC News programs (which traditionally, but not necessarily use a &quot;BBC accent&quot; which also changes with time)? Just a few samples: Big Narstie Show [2], Eastenders [3], and, yes, BBC News (around 10:02 mark, 16:30) [4] Or even something like this [5], but this is an extreme example.<p>All that despite English having been standardised for more than a century.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hiE9f8jM4SE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hiE9f8jM4SE</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uDmGAlRMIS0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uDmGAlRMIS0</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YR2BEQKMyJ4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YR2BEQKMyJ4</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qcBt_klPbAw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qcBt_klPbAw</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=le_uNGdpa4c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=le_uNGdpa4c</a>')
