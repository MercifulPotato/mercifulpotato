Waiting 2&#x2F;4&#x2F;6&#x2F;8 years to resolve a deadlock isn&#x27;t a great idea. The checks and balances in the Senate were ignored by Mitch to get things done, rather than compromise.<p>Since Congress makes its own rules, and 51&#x2F;49 is enough to change a rule (&#x27;the nuclear option&#x27;), supermajority would have to be a constitutional amendment... And then 45% would be enough to halt government. I guarantee you this would then happen regularly.<p>Other systems have mechanisms to force elections if deadlocks are persistent. Of course, you also need mandatory voting, PTO for voting, full franchise, etc and that isn&#x27;t going to happen in America while this Supreme Court lasts.')
