Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=[25989289], score=None, time=1612185706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988022, text='By &quot;niche&quot; here, we mean affecting very few people, I think?<p>Then &quot;accessiblity&quot; in general is not niche, it effects everyone or almost everyone.<p>But &quot;accessibilty&quot; is a broad concept, applying to all sorts of different unrelated needs. Vision impairment, cognitive differences, mobility needs, etc.<p>Some of them effect more people than others. Some of them will be &quot;niche&quot;, effecting few people.  it is just a fact, right? It is faulty logic to say that because &quot;accessibility&quot; effects everyone, every single accessibility accomodation is also therefore of use to everyone. It&#x27;s not so.<p>How much need is there for multi-lingual screen-reading? I have no idea. It&#x27;s obviously not universal -- I don&#x27;t need it for instance, although I may need other kinds of accessibility attention -- but there may be lots of need for it! But we can&#x27;t prove it one way or another just from language games around the general concept of &quot;accessiblity&quot;.<p>Whether developers ought to accomodate even niche accessibility needs is a separate ethical or practical argument.')
