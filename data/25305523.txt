Another engineer eventually took it over and implemented the same UI thing from scratch, in about 50 lines of CSS and JS, in about 30 minutes. There were clearly two different approaches to the problem there!<p>What I see from many people (especially coming out of bootcamps) is that they learn one tool. They make one or two apps with it, the apps work fine, and so they believe they can do anything. That works great until they come up against something they haven&#x27;t seen before. Once they do, they have no framework in their mind as to how they can move forward in solving the problem. All they know are those one or two tools. So if they can&#x27;t find a plugin or something to copy&#x2F;paste into those tools, they become lost.<p>HTDP is genius because it shows you how simple the fundamental process really is. They literally call it a &quot;design recipe&quot;. It&#x27;s basically understanding the shape of your data, defining inputs and outputs, and writing tests. With those ideas and some practice with that methodology, you can handle any situation that comes your way, forever.<p>It&#x27;s not the junior engineers&#x27; fault, though. A lot of people in the industry speak in terms of tools. &quot;We&#x27;re looking for React people&quot;, etc. The idea that your skills are defined solely by the tools you know is widely accepted in startup circles. It&#x27;s no wonder that bootcamps operate the way they do.<p>From what I have seen, the mythical &quot;10x&quot; programmers really do exist, and they&#x27;re the ones who are really great at keeping it simple. They&#x27;re not necessarily FP-oriented, just focused on writing simple code to accomplish a goal (and very good at it). HTDP is a great way to start down that path.')
