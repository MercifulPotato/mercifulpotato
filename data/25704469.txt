Off-topic discussion does not fall outside of the 1st Amendment, and a restriction of the 1st Amendment to try and classify that as somehow less deserving of protection -- that would be a much greater curtailment of 1st Amendment rights than anything Facebook has done.<p>Bluntly, &quot;would need to be litigated to find out&quot; isn&#x27;t an acceptable answer given that the people giving this answer are the same people proposing the legislation.<p>Courts don&#x27;t decide what the law is, they interpret it. You have to have an idea of what you want the law to be, you can&#x27;t kick that off to the courts. They&#x27;re trying to interpret your intention and the letter of the law you propose, not the other way around.')
