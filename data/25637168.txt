This was an employee owned company, but my understanding is that salaries are fairly similar at other defense contractors. Interestingly, it got to the point where the government employees we worked next to made more than us. Usually the deal is they get great benefits, but lower pay. However, pay seemed to be pretty stagnant at my contractor (nice folks though).<p>Taking the same salary to live near Seattle (Everett, I suppose, but the point stands) is a substantial pay cut.<p>I now work at a different defense contractor, across the street from said Boeing plant and came in with ~3y experience for ~$110k. Certainly much lower than a true &quot;tech company&quot;, but it was tens of thousands of dollars higher than where I&#x27;d fall on the Boeing pay scales.')
