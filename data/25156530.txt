The horror!&quot; gives you the right impression.<p>For small datasets and short training times it isn&#x27;t so bad, a deterministic training script on git and a dataset with gitlfs. So can easily reproduce the model when needed. \nHaving to do this on very large datasets (that are possibly expensive to keep a copy of for just experiments and not prod) or really slow training times is basically disgusting. I&#x27;ll be interested to see what you have done.')
