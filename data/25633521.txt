The first story is about office chairs, the second is about celebrity engagements. Sure, it&#x27;s clickbait, but we&#x27;re talking about facebook - not nature magazine.<p>Maybe facebook changed their ad policies to prohibit this kind of content. That&#x27;s within their right but they owe an explanation to their advertisers and perhaps some wind-down time.<p>This sort of arbitrary ban-by-T&amp;C, with no judicial oversight, is further evidence that Facebook, and likely all large tech companies, are abusing their monopoly power and need significantly more regulation.')
