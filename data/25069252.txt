These are our observations as well. Based on metrics we collect (opt in telemetry, website traffic, language service downloads, etc), there are over 1.7m developers using Angular.<p>I&#x27;d say that many of them are in the enterprise, but there are also a lot of startups that bet on Angular. This is mostly due to the integrated stack where folks need to make fewer decisions and get smooth updates across versions.<p>Stability is another factor. We validate every commit pushed to the Angular repo with 2600+ projects inside of Google. If any of their tests break we rollout automated migrations or rethink the implementation.')
