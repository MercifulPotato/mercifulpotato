This phenomenon is definitely more widespread that people in this thread seem to realise, afaics because many are power users used to power interfaces. Power interfaces are generally not enormously useful for the majority of users (preemptive &#x2F;s: yes, please tell me anecdotes about how pet power interface is superior).<p>Yes, there is flawed design: that covers most design, in the same way there is flawed programming, which covers most programming, and flawed approaches to business which covers most business, and so on.<p>[edit] the feeling I get from the threads here is that many commenters don&#x27;t get that most design involves huge tradeoffs, same as programming. Design training is not &quot;make a pretty thing&quot; (which is what many commenters seem to be dismissively suggesting, which is actively offensive), Dribbble is <i>really</i> not reflective of actual design, and much of what you see is surface driven by designers having to find tradeoffs to deal with management edicts&#x2F;commercial goals&#x2F;technical limitations that may conflict with otherwise good design')
