Kids learn stuff that&#x27;s &quot;fun&quot; and read books that are &quot;fun&quot;, that&#x27;s about it - except maybe a couple of semi-serious classes in the later grades. Even if they did teach finance, due to young age it probably wouldn&#x27;t even register.<p>High school seems to be a mad dash for college-like credits and classes. If it doesn&#x27;t serve either (1) student&#x27;s interests (e.g. sports), or (2) college requirements - core subjects or easy A&#x27;s, or (3) the current district agenda (scrambling for test averages, or common core, or SAT or lack thereof, or whatever the hype of the year), it will get little attention. Finance doesn&#x27;t really seem to fall into any of the above.')
