As much as crypto gets a bad rap here I think itâ€™d be better if authority over TLDs was decentralized such that anyone could own one. Handshake.org is one project trying to do this and interestingly there are additional benefits to decentralizing the root DNS such as getting rid of CAs as the root of trust for security.')
