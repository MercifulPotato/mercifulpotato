But first, a disclaimer: The site is run by a dear friend and I have done a lot of behind the scenes work on the site content.<p>So why poke around the site? The site&#x27;s mission is clear: &quot;A living archive of the best print journalism.&quot; What the site operator does is, essentially, rescue good journalism that would otherwise be lost to microfilm. Nearly all (if not all) the content pre-dates the internet, and these pieces become virtually unavailable without efforts like this. Everything is done with permission from the rights holders and this effort allows anyone to experience journalism across a range of subjects and styles that at one point captured some of a cultural zeitgeist.')
