E.g. we have to accept the fact that woman is much more likely to take maternety leave, and essentially an AI is okay to be aware of that, too. It even has to, else it finds another commom factor (eg womans chess club) - but it should be able to wilfully ignore this finding because using it against an applicant is immoral.')
