Assuming exponential distribution, this is most likely to only last further as long as it has already. And with us as the only example, it would most likely be the same for others. So 50 years out of 5 billion on the planet and 3 billion since life began. Are there 100M stars within radio range? Do we even have time to point antennas at each one long enough to get a signal? That’s about 15 seconds each. How many bands do we need to scan in that time?<p>Any hope of contact or expansion requires an extremely long period of sustainable existence in a state of constant technological development. Most of modern humanism is antithetical to this. The entire world today seems focused on expanding consumption. This is especially true of both colonialism and immigration. Economist today judge an economy by its internal consumption rather than older notions like export productivity. Seems like we’re going to have to reconsider policies and priorities if we want to make it out of here.')
