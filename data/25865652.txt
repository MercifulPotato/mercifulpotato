I think Bezos feels the same about <i>literally everything.</i> AFAIK Azure&#x2F;Google have actual partnerships with the Elastic stack, partnerships that assumedly benefit both sides and have staying power.<p>Part of me wonders if AWS always had planned to do this, and they were just waiting until it made business sense to fork (ie they had features and a new direction in mind but neglected to implement them because Elasticsearch was good enough as is). The alternative part is just 2 big corporations not finding a way to get along. Which means without clear direction and careful stewardship I&#x27;d expect the forks to just be cleanroom reimplementations or something like that.')
