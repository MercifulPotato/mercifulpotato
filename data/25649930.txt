Item(by='tynpeddler', descendants=None, kids=[25652843, 25650226, 25650121, 25654418], score=None, time=1609875395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649357, text='A securities fraud lawsuit against a company because the work environment is toxic reminds me of the movie Unforgiven.  For those unaware, the movie starts with a cowboy disfiguring a prostitute with a knife because she laughed at him.  After the incident, the guy who manages the brothel is financially compensated since he had invested money in bringing the prostitute to his place of business, money which he will presumably be unable to recover now that the woman has been disfigured.  No compensation is ordered for the disfigured woman (another cowboy does try to compensate her out of guilt), instead, the perpetrator is flogged, and that&#x27;s supposed to be enough for the woman.<p>There&#x27;s a real gap in our understanding of capitalism and crime if it&#x27;s easier to compensate shareholders of a toxic company than it is to compensate the direct victims of that toxic behavior. If a toxic culture would suppress stock prices, it seems that the same culture would suppress career advancement, physical health and general mental well being.  The problem seems to be that an employee must not only prove criminality but also particularized harm, whereas the standard for a successful securities fraud lawsuit seems to be lower.')
