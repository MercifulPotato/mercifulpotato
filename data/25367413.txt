Remember Farmville? And also many bands ended up putting their merch and tour dates up on FB because it was just so easy.<p>Then recently it grew a marketplace to take on craigslist and ebay, and added videos (making it a mini youtube or tiktok).<p>And let&#x27;s not forget that FB groups are the go-to place for many hobbies. Into old cars? Or old sewing machines? You won&#x27;t find an active forum for those things, or if you do, they&#x27;re 1000x more hostile and trollish than FB&#x27;s groups.<p>So my question is, where do you draw the line? Was FB marketplace anticompetitive because it pushed out craigslist?<p>I guess this whole thing is a fishing expedition to see if the justice department can find a smoking gun email where someone says, like, &quot;Let&#x27;s be anticompetitive with snapchat&quot; or something...')
