They don&#x27;t reduce streaming costs, they just push them onto unsuspecting users. I&#x27;ll be billed for the additional upload by my ISP if I open their video on my phone. Plus the idea isn&#x27;t even new. There have been streaming video BitTorrent clients implemented in Javascript for some years already.<p>As an admin, if anyone in my wifi opens a page using this technology, their increased upload traffic will slow down or potentially even block more important things like off-site backups.<p>That&#x27;s why companies and universities tend to block p2p &quot;CDN&quot;s. Or at the very least, they heavily throttle it, which means your watching experience suffers.')
