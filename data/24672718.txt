Item(by='mettamage', descendants=None, kids=[24674833, 24673400], score=None, time=1601739516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671289, text='&gt; Why?<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t post reviews all around where you live, then.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t mind, as I know letters without tone of voice are tough to interpret (and you don&#x27;t seem to be downvoted anymore). But because you&#x27;re using the imperative (I hope I use that word right), it can come across accusatory. It&#x27;s possible that some people then imagine a bit of a negative tone of voice in such a statement. I know I do, and then I remind myself that I&#x27;m reading letters and that the imagined tone of voice (and whatever it might imply) is purely made up by myself. But some people may not do that.<p>&gt; It just seemed a bit obvious to me. If I post a review, with my account, I have been there, right? And if I post a lot of reviews month after month in a certain place<p>It is obvious. Except for people that it isn&#x27;t obvious too. I have a lot of family members who wouldn&#x27;t think about this. They have a hard time using WhatsApp (barely able) or filling out tax forms. I don&#x27;t see them immediately realizing that filling out Google reviews would leave them exposed in such a way.')
