If &#x2F;r&#x2F;Conservative is representative of the average right wing user, yeah, it&#x27;s normal they&#x27;re getting banned, as they are absolutely incapable of reasonable discourse.<p>You also conveniently forget the local subreddits absolutely overrun by the far right. &#x2F;r&#x2F;canada was so bad that &#x2F;r&#x2F;onguardforthee had to be created. &#x2F;r&#x2F;metacanada regularly calls for eugenism. &#x2F;r&#x2F;france has the far right coming out of the woods every day.')
