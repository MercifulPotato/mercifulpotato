I just put in the right details, download it, and send it in.<p>To keep track of projects, I use Trello: I&#x27;ve got a bunch of columns that I have for &quot;Approved&quot; &quot;In Progress&quot; &quot;Completed&quot; &quot;Invoiced&quot; &quot;Paid&quot;, which helps me remember where, what, when, and how much I need to send in. It&#x27;s a little clunky, but I&#x27;ve got a good workflow with it.')
