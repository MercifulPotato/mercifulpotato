In the 90s, the technologies that made the internet boom were things like Linux, Mysql, php, which were created in europe (with great US contributions). . Google wouldn&#x27;t be able to commoditize its search so easily otherwise. US companies were (and are) great at consumer-facing tec. It&#x27;s in the past decade+ that the US has become dominant in just about everything tech (largely because of the cloud and mobile). It has also become excessively dominant in the media (outside china), so dominant and centralized  that american outrages end up becoming global outrages. When was the last time we saw twitter trends coming from outside the US? There is a war going in on armenia, yet overshadowed by a US debate (before potus got covid, which overshadows tonight&#x27;s alien invasion). All operating systems that have substantial user base are now made in US.<p>Even the TikTok case is telling. Many european countries do not wish to have bad relations with china, or don&#x27;t see them as a threat, yet they &#x27;ll follow suit in banning it.<p>I think it&#x27;s the other way around. There is too much americano-centrism in the internet now, and that s a problem because it&#x27;s being filled with increasingly more numerous and more rigid american rules (gone is piracy, subscriptions for everything, app stores, gatekeepers everywhere). This is a culture that is not fun, and consumers will take note. TikTok is probably just the beginning of people searching for new toys outside america&#x27;s walled garden.')
