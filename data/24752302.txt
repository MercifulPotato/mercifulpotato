If you suddenly want to jump in and start enforcing rules, which I think probably should happen, you need to be very careful that you don&#x27;t wind up making things worse by legitimizing the abuses of only one horse. If you can&#x27;t do that then you&#x27;re better off just letting them fight it out.')
