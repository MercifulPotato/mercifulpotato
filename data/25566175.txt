People don&#x27;t like that, so I&#x27;ve learned to fake emotions, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I actually feel them.<p>For example I never bother actually cultivating real anger. But sometimes anger is useful so I&#x27;ll act like I&#x27;m angry. But it&#x27;s just an act, there is no actual anger there.<p>When I actually (and rarely) get an actual emotion I&#x27;ll examine it like it&#x27;s a stranger &quot;wow that&#x27;s so cool how it&#x27;s making me feel, that&#x27;s such a strange thing to experience&quot;.<p>If it helps: My &quot;I&quot;, and my &quot;mind&quot; are two different things. And sometimes my &quot;I&quot; watches my &quot;mind&quot; and wonders &quot;why did it do that?&quot;.')
