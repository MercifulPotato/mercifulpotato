Item(by='bhaak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604623728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003059, text='&gt; The developer of Calibre considers epubcheck broken, which it is, and wrong about the ePub specification, which it is.<p>Citation needed? epubcheck has existed for more than a decade and is in somewhat in active development. This would be somewhat surprising for a tool that is widely used in the industry.<p>Looking at the examples in the article doesn&#x27;t help.<p>&gt; Calibre adds an &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt; to every heading and subheading.<p>That&#x27;s just invalid XHTML by Calibre. How&#x27;s that epubcheck&#x27;s fault?<p>&gt; If you wrote the book in a particular font, the index generated from a DOCX may be in whatever Calibre thinks is a good default font â€” and this default font may show up elsewhere.<p>Again, how is that epubcheck&#x27;s fault?<p>&gt; Calibre is also the most common ePub generator. Its format converters are robust and battle-hardened.<p>Usually I see pandoc being talked about epub generation. I didn&#x27;t even know Calibre had epub output.<p>I only see problems in the article created by the Calibre converter and I have serious doubts about calling a XHTML generator &quot;robust and battle-hardened&quot; that can&#x27;t even produce valid XHTML.')
