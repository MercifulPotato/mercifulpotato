It&#x27;s in his interest (both in the sense of a personal interest and in the sense of consistent with his neoconservative &#x2F; hawkish beliefs, which are much stronger than Trump&#x27;s) to sour the relationship with Iran and also to prepare the American people for the idea that we should be going to war with them.')
