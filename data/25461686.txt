A certain character may disrupt the mechanics of the game that are the most fun to a subgroup of players. To take it to an extreme, let&#x27;s say a character is introduced to a fighting game and this character will win as soon as the &quot;A&quot; button is pressed. Now whatever fun people were doing to win in the game before is gone. In order to win, you just have to pick this super-character and hit the A button. Doesn&#x27;t sound very fun to me.<p>At a deeper level, that people won&#x27;t &quot;exploit the brokenness for their own gain&quot; is key to a functioning society. Just as the promise of laying out rules in detail (expert systems) failed to capture the complexity required to get high-functioning AI, societies can not function by formal rules (laws and regulations) alone. There are sorts of complexities about norms, mores, and moral codes that are important to keep societies and organizations running. What is expected behavior when everyone is queued up to buy tickets at an event, but there is no formal sign saying &quot;please queue here&quot;? I mean you could audiciously walk up, stand next to the person in front of the line, and then walk up to the windows when they say &quot;next please&quot; and not be breaking any written rule, but everyone sure would be angry, and if everyone did it you&#x27;d have near total anarachy where the pushiest or strongest always got to the front of the line first.<p>One of the biggest problems with internet scale is that its pretty easy to start running into individuals who ARE ok with exploiting the rules, or just ignoring them. This can be because they are from societies with different norms than the one they are encountering online, or just because they are in the small minority of people who just don&#x27;t care. This effect is aided and abetted by the relative anonymity online. If you cut in line, people who you can see and here are going to yell at you right now. Break the social norm (or actual policy) of not paying for reviews and you&#x27;ll most likely just get a strongly worded letter and possible ban on selling (which is easy enough to get around).<p>In short though, not exploiting a broken rule or system just because its broken isn&#x27;t silly. Its the a huge part of having a functioning society.')
