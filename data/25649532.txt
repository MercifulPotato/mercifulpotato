I think you will agree though, that the outcome you describe isn&#x27;t inevitable or most-likely.<p>Over time you will likely figure out a good life-work-philanthropy balance. Much of the conversation within EA is about self-care and long-term planning. If giving 70% of your income to charity works for you, that&#x27;s magnificent. But if you realize you need to give less and take more care of yourself so you don&#x27;t burn out, that&#x27;s the appropriate decision.<p>I gave 50% one year but it didn&#x27;t work out long term. I&#x27;ve been giving 10% for almost a decade and intend to ramp up to 20% in the future. My wife does 10% too - it works out well for us.')
