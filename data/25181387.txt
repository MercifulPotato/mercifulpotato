I the last five years I have worked between two cities in my country, one where the federal government is the major employer, one the financial center. Getting off the train downtown in the financial core, I see engaged, enthusiastic, and hungry people heading to work to make something of themselves. They bound up the escalator because they have energy and drive and want to improve theirs and their family&#x27;s lives.<p>In the government town, I see lots of people with unfulfilling, boring, and secure jobs, and the whole vibe of the town is defeat.<p>For many people, competition and pressure are essential to enjoying life, and we want to optimize what we do to support that. Without the pressure we atrophy. There are lots of places (like a lot of government work) where you dont have to work hard and can enjoy other parts of life. But what I&#x27;ve seen is that usually it doesnt work that way.')
