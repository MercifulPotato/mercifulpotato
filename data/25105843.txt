Either way, the economy of china is structurally quite different from the US or EU.  The role of public (and some &quot;private&quot;) debt there is different.  Which is not to say that they don&#x27;t have problems -- they have lots of problems.  But saying &quot;the Chinese economy is effectively a huge bubble fed by monetary stimulus&quot; is just wrong.<p>As for &quot;increasingly becoming aware of the corruption in its government&quot;... that&#x27;s not really true simply because everyone has been aware of it for literally a thousand years.   The corruption is sort of background noise there, it is essentially expected.  The question most people ask is instead more like, &quot;is there more or less corruption now?&quot;  &quot;is the corruption more or less harmful?&quot;<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re getting the idea that the &quot;the number of conflicts between the population and the PCC has progressively been escalating&quot;.  If anything, the gov of china is more respected inside China now than ever before.  I suspect it&#x27;s mostly because of their aggressive response to covid.  Which they never tire of letting everyone in China know about.  Short term, at least, the CCP&#x27;s power inside China is quite secure.  Long term, who knows.')
