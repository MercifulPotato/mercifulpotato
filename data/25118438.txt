The last google DKIM bug I&#x27;m aware of was in 2012, so I can&#x27;t counter the specific claim about DKIM with evidence, but the assertion that &quot;the only way to spoof x is to hack and get the private key&quot; is not any absolute truth.<p>(P.S: I have seen no denial nor confirmation about the authenticity of the Hunter Biden data - only claims of Russian involvement. Make of that what you will. The DKIM is circumstantial data until there is confirmation or denial - especially, as you say, it&#x27;s not all released).')
