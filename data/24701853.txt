The fact that OP links an archive of interview questions is indicative of the underlying problem.<p>Giving a candidate a problem they haven&#x27;t seen before and observing their problem solving skills and mentality doesn&#x27;t sound so bad on paper. However the process has been gamified and as a result the expectations for what a candidate should know and accomplish have increased. This ends up favoring younger candidates and&#x2F;or fresh grads, since on average they can expend greater time and energy into studying for these types of interviews and their algorithms &amp; data structure courses are still fresh in their minds. A more senior candidate or a person with more responsibilities outside of work (taking care of children, parents, etc) won&#x27;t be able to invest as much time into studying these types of problems. The original purpose of the interview is also obfuscated - did the candidate genuinely show good problem solving skills or did they see the question before and merely memorized the solution? As a hiring manager I&#x27;ve seen multiple instances of the latter.<p>I think the utility of spending time on these problems varies from person to person. I personally find it more useful to delve into distributed systems, cryptopgraphy, networking, or operating systems. These topics have made me a much better engineer and improved my problem solving skills, more so than programming riddles which gave me diminishing returns over time.')
