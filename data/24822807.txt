Esp when you retire and have lower income you still have to pay $1-2k every month in taxes which is nearly as much as SS pays.<p>Marginal is well over 50% in NYC, CA. eg top bracket marginal is 37% federal + 12.3% CA state + 1.45% Medicare is over 50% before property taxes. 40% total tax is very easy to hit.<p>Like I said before if you&#x27;re on Social Security or unemployed its really tough, I know someone who&#x27;s out of work and paying $2.5K a month in property taxes, it eats up your savings super fast.')
