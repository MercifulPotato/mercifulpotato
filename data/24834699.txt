But then we realized people abuse the service (it&#x27;s a B2C SAAS that&#x27;s free for the C side) and we need a way to ban the abusers from using the platform.<p>Going for auth impacts everyone because you have to provide (and verify) your info to us, and this translates to 99% of the users being impacted by the other 1% who will not play by the rules. Sure, you can blame companies for not coming up with smarter options for eliminating the abusers that hurt everyone else, but when we&#x27;re offering a free service without asking for anything back from your side I find it hard to justify investing months of development into this. And this is why you create an account with your email or phone number, and if you make the life hard for everyone else you go out of the platform and let everyone else enjoy it peacefully.')
