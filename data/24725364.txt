I have a rather intimate&#x2F;inside perspective on Serbia and its dealings .. and yes, I can confirm that all of the things you mentioned are indeed true. Plus a whole lot more, which I rather not get into. Long story short: it is indeed complicated. Even to the point where the focus on very legitimate concerns themselves, can also be used for a political (foreign) agenda that might not care much about those concerns themselves (only about how people respond to them). I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the case here (I honestly don&#x27;t know), but it happens regularly that legitimate criticism is hijacked for another (political) purpose.<p>Sadly Serbia is (or has become) a perfect target&#x2F;partner for many foreign investments&#x2F;endeavors that can&#x27;t quite stand the light of day, with many eager local accomplices who gladly keep what they know to themselves in exchange for outside guarantees of compensation&#x2F;support&#x2F;protection&#x2F;safety.<p>It pains me, because the country is dear to my heart. We will see if this current &quot;equilibrium&quot; (of sorts) will eventually tear itself violently apart, or if there&#x27;s a chance to peacefully transition to a better situation. As it is now, I highly doubt it can remain sustainable for long. There&#x27;s just too many skeletons in the closet. At some point the (intentional&#x2F;instigated) squeeze of a single person could trigger a chain reaction that not even the most draconian containment measures could control, let alone stop. The country will be in ruins by then though (if it isn&#x27;t already).')
