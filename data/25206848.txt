Paying $1500 for a new computer every 5 years or so is good.  Paying $1500 for a computer every 16 months, not so much.<p>The monitor on my MacBook Pro just died, and I bought it July of last year.  The repair was is $850.  Luckily my credit card covered the hardware warranty, but I&#x27;m kind of wishing I&#x27;d bought AppleCare.')
