I was under the impression that an 8087 would have been equally happy to respond to NaN by quiet propagation, setting a global sticky flag or crashing your program, and it&#x27;s modern hardware, with multiple heavily pipelined vector units running in parallel, that prefers to quietly propagate. Am I missing something?')
