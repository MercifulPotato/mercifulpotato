Item(by='MrRadar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608850950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25532292, text='&gt; Question for the Americans - is Mavis Beacon a reasonable name for someone to be called where you come from?<p>I would say so. Mavis is a bit old fashioned, but it was a very common name at one time[1]. Beacon is not a common last name, but IMDB does list a few people with that as their last name[2] (and a lot more with &quot;Deacon&quot; as their last name; I could totally buy the B and D getting switched out at some point in the family&#x27;s history, especially if they immigrated in the 19th century when record-keeping was much less stringent).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mavis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mavis</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;find?q=beacon&amp;s=nm&amp;ref_=fn_al_nm_mr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;find?q=beacon&amp;s=nm&amp;ref_=fn_al_nm_mr</a>')
