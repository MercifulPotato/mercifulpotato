Everyone lies from time to time, or bends the truth to make themselves look better. Frequency and magnitude are the important factors.<p>Also, Joe could have had dinner with this guy and still never talked with his son deeply about work. Joe having eaten with this dude would call into question his claim, but it wouldn&#x27;t be proof he was telling a falsehood.<p>However, it sure does look a little questionable.')
