You&#x27;ll get the cheapest option available, filled with all the corporate crap you don&#x27;t want, and locked down to oblivion.<p>Macs have a minimum quality bar, and don&#x27;t tend to get hamstrung quite as easily by company policy. It&#x27;s just not worth it unless you know for a fact you&#x27;ll get to choose the machine and software yourself.<p>As for at home, I&#x27;m flexible, but I wouldn&#x27;t go for Mac if I wanted to game, and now in 2020, I wouldn&#x27;t go x86 if I needed battery life.')
