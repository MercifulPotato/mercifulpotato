It&#x27;s great to have a free and open-source programming language focused on scientific computing.<p>What I dislike from the Julia community is the unhealthy fixation they have with Python   and R. Virtually, no comment or blog-post is written without mentioning how slow, inefficient, inappropriate, inelegant is Python or R. Somehow, the Julia community convinced itself that best way to attract more users is to constantly put down Python and R. A sad state of affairs definetely.')
