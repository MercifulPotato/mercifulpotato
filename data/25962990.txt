It is being produced at cost by AstraZeneca. The UK acted quickly, realising that each week of lockdown costs a similar amount to their entire vaccine expenditure. They got scientific advice and backed a range of different technologies.<p>Meanwhile the EU acted bureaucratically and treated this like a procurement exercise, squabbling about spending and placing orders in December. It is now scapegoating andsuing a company that is producing the vaccine at cost.<p>GSK has every inventive to scale up capacity and produce as many doses as possible, and has no profit motive to divert doses.
