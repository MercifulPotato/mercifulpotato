Writes can be lost if the primary dies and a secondary is promoted before data from primary has been replicated to it.<p>&gt; Is this any different than how things work in eg Postgres?<p>1. The comment of mine you are replying to applies to any DB that uses Eventual Consistency, as can be seen above it.<p>2. Yes, this is different in PG simply because PG doesn&#x27;t do Eventual Consistency by default.<p>&gt;&gt; 2. The whole point of adding secondaries — again, the &quot;webscale!&quot; argument — is to scale read capacities<p>&gt; The main driver behind secondaries is redundancy&#x2F;durability.<p>In general, maybe — or even maybe in your specific use-cases. But Mongo&#x27;s prescribed use-cases — the ones they marketed, heavily, even going so far as to make up terms like &quot;webscale&quot; — are about &#x27;performance&#x27; and &#x27;scale&#x27;.
