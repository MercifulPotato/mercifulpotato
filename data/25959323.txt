Most recently transforming large (1-50 GB) CSV files in to a format that can be digested by a proprietary bulk DB loader.<p>Because our problem was just about reformatting we ended up reading the CSVs in binary mode and using struct to extract the relevant values from the date time fields. But if we needed to do actual date logic something like this would perhaps be useful (but there other fast date time libraries out there, I&#x27;ve been a fan of pendulum for some tasks).')
