Displacement is not a problem if you build the newcomers enough housing. They are willing to pay for expensive high rises and live there. Be happy that they don&#x27;t actually want your house. But for the NIMBY that&#x27;s the worst outcome. He doesn&#x27;t want his neighbor to sell the plot because he wants to sell his own plot for profit. The lack of housing eventually results in displacement.<p>The opposite of gentrification is far worse. Stagnating communities feel the same effect. The local economy is transforming. Local culture is getting lost. Except all of it happens for no one&#x27;s benefit.<p>People get the wrong impression and start &quot;fighting&quot; gentrification and then introduce real problems through misguided policy.')
