I just placed an order for an eFatbike last week.  I&#x27;ve spent the last 9 months hiking every possible hiking trail within an hour or so of me.  Now it&#x27;s time to explore all the MTB trails and fire roads.  Getting outside on weekends is the only thing that has kept me sane since the pandemic started.  I haven&#x27;t been to my company office, client sites, gym, restaurant, etc. since mid March.  Other than to go grocery shopping every other week and hiking on weekends, I rarely leave the house at all.')
