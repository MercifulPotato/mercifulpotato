Their skill is judged by what they&#x27;ve produced that&#x27;s directly relevant to the evaluation process. Comparing programmers to such a diverse array of disciplines requires a more detailed analysis.<p>A percentage of the software industry has a bias against programmers who don&#x27;t code in their spare time because it&#x27;s extremely difficult to evaluate technical talent. We lean on quality filters like number of hours spent on side projects that have sparse evidence to support their efficacy. While I&#x27;m skeptical that a general set of metrics exist we can use to perfectly evaluate technical skill across the industry, we can certainly do better.')
