Google has really done us all a favor by being actually more authentic: they&#x27;re saying &quot;We&#x27;re an Advertising company .&quot;  (the period is said out loud).   They are a tech company insofar as it serves their ad business.  They&#x27;re not a general tech company, and they have no interests or pursuits in anything else unless it is to develop new lines of ad revenue.<p>I&#x27;ve stopped using Chrome, use gmail only for dealing with companies (their spam), rarely watch YouTube anymore, and use DDG for search.  It&#x27;s _very_ noticeable how little targeted advertising I receive anymore.  I have developed a whole new appreciation for my DVD and BluRay collection, and now feel compelled to buy up whatever is available while they last.  Physical, own-able media is becoming frighteningly scarce.<p>I think the Google situation is a deliberate result of restructuring under Alphabet, and in terms of business it&#x27;s wise.  Google is about ads.  Other companies of theirs will be about other things.')
