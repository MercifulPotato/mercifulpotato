What&#x27;s more interesting -- amputees and disabled folks go BERSERK when they get treatment, or what if we escaped the bounds of the human form. Why does this game have such an extremely boring view of what humanity could be if you had access to mods. Gender, race, body type, even the configuration of limbs and the like seem like they should be things of the past in 2077. Instead we have a tired Japanese stereotype, a Haitian gang, and some pretty boring ideas about the human condition.<p>Gibson himself offered the critique that the game looked like GTA papered over with 80s retrofuturism.<p>I think it&#x27;s totally reasonable to critique the game as not really doing anything interesting in the genre or even doing anything more than appropriating genre tropes.')
