It is also open source so anyone is free to make their own fork of Dendron.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m all in on Dendron and this is my full time gig. I want to make sure that developing Dendron remains sustainable. To that end, I plan on introducing value add server side functionality that folks may pay for.&quot;<p>PS: Why not switch to Emacs? It will only take a measly year to get comfortable! :)')
