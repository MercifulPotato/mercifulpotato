Hence the price pop on day one.  To think about it more in depth - assume I enter a bid of 100 shares at $100. If the market clearing price is $50, I’ll be awarded 100 shares at $50. However, I was willing to buy far more than that at a higher price, so I’d go buy more shares on the open market, driving the price up.')
