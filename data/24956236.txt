The most popular BSD-based kernel is Apple&#x27;s, which isn&#x27;t distributed under the BSD license. The most popular GPL kernel is Linux, which still is.<p>So with the BSD license somebody can take your work, improve it, distribute it under a proprietary license and supplant you in the market. Compare macOS or iOS installed base to FreeBSD.<p>But then the codebase is henceforth tied to that company. If Apple is dead in twenty years then probably nobody is still using the iOS kernel (and <i>not</i> because they switched back to FreeBSD), but if Google is dead in twenty years most likely Linux is still popular all over.')
