It&#x27;s a move to get out ahead of it.<p>From the DOJ&#x27;s proposed 230 legislation[0]:<p>&gt;&gt;The second category of amendments is aimed at incentivizing platforms to address the growing amount of illicit content online, while preserving the core of Section 230’s immunity for defamation claims.<p>&gt;&gt;Section 230 immunity is meant to incentivize and protect online Good Samaritans.  Platforms that purposely solicit and facilitate harmful criminal activity — in effect, online Bad Samaritans — should not receive the benefit of this immunity.  Nor should a platform receive blanket immunity for continuing to host known criminal content on its services, despite repeated pleas from victims to take action.<p>Enforcing a hacked materials policy is fully consistent with the DOJ&#x27;s proposed change.
