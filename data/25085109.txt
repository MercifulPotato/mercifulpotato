Uber drivers cannot decide what to charge, Uber does. How much an Uber driver makes is entirely up to Uber, and Uber is losing money on every ride so in the long run they have to either increase the price or pay the driver less. My (large) employer pays for my health insurance in the US which has to be added to what we charge. Uber has to pay nothing for any benefits and can cut the wages to just barely enough to not die. From an economic standpoint Uber should go out of business but it does not since it is getting almost free labor and just raises money to make a profit. I see no way this is a market that makes any sense.')
