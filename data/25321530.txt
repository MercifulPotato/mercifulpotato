Here&#x27;s what splits the difference: science can&#x27;t help us answer your list of genuinely crucial and relevant questions... but neither, really, can philosophy.<p>GP is fundamentally right that those questions have proven intractable to philosophy. Philosophy is a standing list of all the theses put forward as solutions to those questions. But even people who are fully engaged with, have a stake in and spend their whole lives wrestling with such questions can come to diametrically or orthogonally opposed answers.<p>Shrug?<p>Philosophy offers lots of frameworks, tools, prior art, etc. to tackle such questions with. But it can offer you no sure answers and no means of mediating between potential answers.<p>Science, while it has huge blindspots and terminal unanswered questions, can goddamn perform in the areas that are well-trodden.')
