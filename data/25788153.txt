Remember when there was a push-back from models being too thin?  Everyone agreed that it was bad to show ultra-thin models because it was unhealthy and generally unobtainable.  The same should be for overweight people, except now we have the concept of body-shaming (which didn&#x27;t apply to ultra-thin models??).  There needs to be more of a focus on self resposibility along with a push-back against the bad practices of the food industry.')
