Much like YouTube, sites like Pornhub have the excuse that they ostensibly exist to let people upload their own, often amateur, content - and there was a lot of really good amateur content on there. Which, naturally, the commercial porn industry wanted to eradicate just as much as the pirated stuff because it was their direct competition. Part of the problem was that there&#x27;s an inherent assymetry to this - it only takes a few really keen exhibitionists wanting to show off to entertain a much larger group of fans across the globe. Another part is that there&#x27;s all kinds of niche content that, despite being both consensual and legal, isn&#x27;t well served by mainstream porn (and in some cases can&#x27;t be due to Masterard and Visa).')
