Otherwise they just run back to the usual <i>free</i> surveilanceware.<p>I&#x27;ve tried and failed to convince some young, highly educated zoomer friends with good incomes to move away from WhatsApp and Facebook and even when I told them &quot;Look, they&#x27;re basically spying on you&quot; they just brush it off and say &quot;I don&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s fun, easy to use and all my friends are already there&quot;.<p>Ironically, it was easier to convince my boomer parents to move to Signal and they also understand and agree with the tradeoffs and extra friction for the sake of free privacy but younger people just want to be where their friends are and not feel left out (remember the blue vs green bubble stigma on iMessage).')
