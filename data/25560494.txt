For instance, an older worker is a good deal more likely to be hired if s&#x2F;he is able to write the firmware for ray tracing video card hardware than s&#x2F;he is to be hired for knowing how to write web apps in &quot;cool language of the week&quot;. In fact, I&#x27;d argue that most of the older tech workers in the situation of being discriminated against, <i>are</i> the workers who spent their careers learning &quot;cool language of the week&quot;. A few of them may get lucky and get a job doing something that a 22 year old new college grad can do, but what&#x27;s the likelihood? Should you bet your family&#x27;s future on those odds? Even if you get the job, what&#x27;s the pay likely to be like?<p>I feel like a lot of tech workers never ask themselves these questions. It&#x27;s never too early to ask them either, in fact you should ask them early in your career. Getting too comfortable doing things everyone knows how to do will make you decidedly uncomfortable once you hit 35 or 40.')
