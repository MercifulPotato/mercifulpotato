Let&#x27;s break it down point by point:<p>* Inherited fortune - Questionable.  All I was able to find on his family was that they were Holocaust survivors.  Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ll give you that one provisionally, but I&#x27;d like to see actual evidence, if you have any.<p>* Bowdoin - Correct.<p>* Is elected official - Obviously.<p>* Blocks housing - Does this sound like &quot;blocking housing&quot; to you:<p>&gt; Preston also introduced two ballot initiatives approved by voters in the election. Proposition I raised the transfer tax rate for property sales valued over $10 million, intended to fund affordable housing. Proposition K authorizes the city of San Francisco to build or acquire up to 10,000 units of affordable housing.[21]&quot; [0]<p>Sorry, does not pass the smell test.<p>Moreover, &quot;acting against&quot; something is not even close to &quot;blocking&quot; that thing.  You&#x27;re redefining terms to fit your preconceived narrative.  It&#x27;s almost as if you have a personal reason to hate him. [1]<p>* Gentrifier - Again, no, you do not get to redefine the term &quot;gentrifier.&quot;  If you think that&#x27;s acceptable, then I can just redefine the issue out of existence, too.  Sorry.<p>* Never had a job: Incorrect per his LinkedIn profile. [2]  As well, &quot;Preston worked for a nonprofit called the Tenderloin Housing Clinic, where he fought evictions and did advocacy for tenant rights.&quot; [1]<p>* Is obscenely rich by socialist standards: So, wait, now we&#x27;re redefining &quot;rich&quot; in terms of &quot;socialist standards?&quot;  No.  Sure, he has a home in Alamo Square, which has a median home value of over $1M, and, if we accept without any actual evidence that he owns those other two properties you say he does, that puts the value of his assets at least at around $3M.  But, we have no idea how much debt he has, so, his net worth could be rather pedestrian given he&#x27;s an attorney in San Francisco.<p>Sorry, not buying it.<p>So, 4 out of your 7 bullet points are either factually incorrect, misleading, or completely unproven, and you expect me to believe you?  Methinks thou dost protest too much.  This just sounds like you have some personal axe to grind, which is completely irrelevant to whatever semblance of an argument you&#x27;re trying to make.  Did someone call you a gentrifier in the past, or something?<p>If you could bring something that vaguely resembles a coherent set of facts, then I&#x27;ll believe you.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dean_Preston#Political_career" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dean_Preston#Political_career</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;48hills.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-sleaze-reaches-high-tide-in-d5&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;48hills.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-sleaze-reaches-high-tide-in-...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;dean-preston-6454137&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;dean-preston-6454137&#x2F;</a>')
