Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608573082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496522, text='&gt;How much risk is the average employee taking on, compared with the investors who are supplying capital so the business can operate and scale?<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a pretty big risk to become unemployed, especially where the welfare system can be unstable, and you have dependents to support. The investor, at worst, will have to take a &quot;labour&quot; job. The worker, at worst, will be food and shelter insecure.<p>&gt;By all means go and start your own company if you think labor is the only part of the equation<p>That&#x27;s not really a valid response to a criticism of the system which necessarily operates with the division of capital and labour. Obviously you need money; that&#x27;s not what is in dispute here.<p>Capital and labour are integral parts of the equation, but the social function of an owner of capital who commands an army of labourers and sells the goods for profit is arguably not. Production can happen (and has happened) outside that social relationship.')
