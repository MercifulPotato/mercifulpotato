I can prove that this is real<p>There&#x27;s also at least two alternative explanations.<p>I also get a lot of emails to an account I own from someone who keeps using my email instead of theirs. You&#x27;d think they would have noticed they aren&#x27;t receiving them by now, but apparently not. Are you also totally sure that it&#x27;s not just someone else entering an email address they don&#x27;t own for work and party invites?<p>And for a second explanation, are you sure it wasn&#x27;t hacked&#x2F;stolen?<p>There&#x27;s groups of people out there that bruteforce and then sell OG accounts, such as short twitter handles and common firstname.lastname email accounts.<p>The fact that the forwarding rules are still setup and working actually leads me to think it&#x27;s more likely someone else stole the account rather than that it was deleted and recreated, assuming someone else really has access to it.<p>There&#x27;s other possible ways your account could have been compromised too, like having a backup email address for it on some other email provider or domain that did go under or get compromised, but a weak password or a re-used password from a leak seem most likely for the compromise route.<p>Do you have evidence somehow that the account wasn&#x27;t stole in that way?')
