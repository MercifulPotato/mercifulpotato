Item(by='throwaway2245', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608302114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25466236, text='&gt; Can anyone elaborate on what Carmack is suggesting here? To specialise in some tool early in your career? Or something else?<p>I think he is overall suggesting that you should find your business value - your value as an employee to the business you work for. He seems to be specifically talking about &quot;career advice&quot;, as advice for employment, so slightly outside of his own experience.<p>He is suggesting a shortcut to this business value is to know one tool deeply enough that you become the go-to person for that tool in your company (whether or not that is in your job description).')
