Like militaries. Hierarchic and authority driven. In something as casual, permissive, and political as a democratic republic, even with laws, it corrupts itself. Those with power decide what is meritorious, and inevitably lower ladders for their family and friends.<p>Minorities have never been on a level playing field, so I&#x27;d argue it never was nor could have been a meritocracy anyway. It was always corrupt from its founding. That would seem to be a necessary first step.')
