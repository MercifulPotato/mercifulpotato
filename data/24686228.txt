More times than I can count I’ve seen business requirements change to require those “unrepresentable” states, and since you’ve now designed you whole data model around it you need to add awful hacks to make it work.<p>The timeline example is actually very telling. A lot of times you’d actually want to encode overlapping time periods at the edges.<p>You’d be laughed out off a meeting where a business asks about this and you smugly explain how it is unrepresentable.<p>I guess what I’m saying is that it might be worth over designing your system a bit to leave you some wiggle room, unless you have hard guarantees that something should be “impossible”')
