Item(by='p3ndrag0n', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605115561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25059497, text='&gt; Regardless of whether it&#x27;s an intentional trick or an oversight, I don&#x27;t think that the benchmark showing the mobile chip is better than a desktop chip in RAW PERFORMANCE is true. And that means that a lot of the conclusions that they draw from the benchmark aren&#x27;t true. There is no way that the A14 (nor the M1) is going to be faster in any raw performance category than a latest generation and top-spec desktop system.<p>The benchmark is true but misleading. It compares &#x27;Intel vs Apple <i>Top Performance</i>&#x27; meaning essentially the speed it could go at max. It is <i>not</i> a real world number or result and exists purely in a vacuum. If your phone ran at that speed for an extended period of time I guarantee it would melt. I think the only conclusion to be drawn is that Apple&#x27;s mobile CPU&#x27;s are very capable and well designed, and  ARM has a lot of untapped potential.')
