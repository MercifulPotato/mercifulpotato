I had access in 3 clicks on Roku in the Amazon prime channel.  I can cancel at anytime.<p>My wife wanted to watch the Borne Identity and my um friend had figure out why Radarr blacklisted a bunch of releases then wait for it to download and un-par (which took 5x longer than the download). I came back into the living room 15 minutes later and found my wife just watching it with commercials on Peacock.<p>During a break I convinced her to switch to plex since it didn&#x27;t have commercials.  But then we had to pause the movie and fumble with subtitles for the scenes in the swiss bank. First downloaded set didn&#x27;t match the timestamps. Second did, but it was like 5 minutes. &quot;Why couldn&#x27;t you just let me watch in on NBC HONEY?&quot;')
