Keeping them in sync hasn&#x27;t been that hard. After each update I run both versions on the same input file (resulting in my blog <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plurrrr.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plurrrr.com&#x2F;</a>) and check with meld if there are any differences. This works very well. I am only a little worried that the Python code might contain some Perl-isms.')
