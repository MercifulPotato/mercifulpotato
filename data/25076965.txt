But this reaffirms the observed trend of Apple becoming more of an owner of the machine that supposedly I own.<p>I&#x27;ll attempt to shut it down (at least now, it still observes &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts) - but when I can no longer do that, I&#x27;ll leave Apple forever, hopefully by then other hardware manufacturers have caught up in UX.')
