But space is pretty empty. The regular air on Earth contains ~10^19 particles per cm³, and it can take several km of air to start seriously interfering with light. A dense portion of space contains something like 10^4 particles per cm³, and a less dense region maybe 10^-4 particles per cm³. So, once you leave the atmosphere, the noise that&#x27;s destroying the signal is simply far, far, far weaker than the signal.<p>Now for your first question. As I mentioned in my first comment, the spectral lines arise from different orbitals. What this means is that there isn&#x27;t a single line associated with a molecule, but actually several lines. So if you think you see a line from one molecule, you should be able to find the other associated lines, and the more of the lines you can find, the stronger the evidence.<p>As a couple of people have noted, this isn&#x27;t a perfect process, so you can get into arguments if your identification is actually correct or not.')
