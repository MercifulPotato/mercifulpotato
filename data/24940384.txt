I am long time Apple user, and can remember a time, when this company checked all my professional boxes. Clean industrial design, user friendly interface, high quality pro software (Final Cut Studio, Soundtrack Pro, Motion, Shake, etc), UNIX based, perfect ergonomic features and port connectivity. Long hardware life (I use in my home music studio Apple Cinema 30&quot; and it still is working perfectly) may be best industrial design for display ever. So, did I find resemblance in Apple of today?\nNo. Today Apple is money printing machine with ultra polished marketing promotion and clever cost cutting strategy in manufacturing processes. Today Apple is focused on keeping the profit top spot. Yes I still use Mac OS, but more and more lean towards Linux based desktop. I see a future for creative people away from dichotomy of Mac&#x2F;Windows boxes. There are enough new software (DaVinci Resolve, Blender) what is missing is someone like Affinity to port their apps to Linux and we will have a good start. \nMay be if we buy Linux phones as early adopters, things will change somewhat, I don&#x27;t know. What I know is that we as professionals must take action and stop closing our eyes, I personally share with everybody my point of view. We are good at influencing our clients, friends. In the old Apple era, I have turned a lot of people from Windows to Mac.')
