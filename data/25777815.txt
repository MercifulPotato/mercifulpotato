I see plenty of really distasteful, vile comments show up on Twitter.  And AFAIK inciting violence is illegal.  So the area between those seems to me like it would be pretty narrow.<p>My impression of Parler is more that they only deleted illegal speech of a particularly egregious nature, e.g. child porn.')
