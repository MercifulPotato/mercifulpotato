Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=[25499545], score=None, time=1608584275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499311, text='Thank you, this is a great explanation (and I skimmed some of the RFC on my phone so probably missed some of that). The approach certainly makes sense.<p>It’s also an interesting approach compared to some of the partial hydration approaches I’ve seen. They all seem to use either wrapper divs&#x2F;spans (bad for all kinds of reasons) or adjacent script “markers” containing initial hydration data, which seems similar to the slots approach but doesn’t necessarily enable streaming&#x2F;prioritizing certain content for first render.<p>Since you’re here, I know the RFC discusses compile time static analysis to identify content which could be server-&#x2F;static-only, but is there any consideration for supporting that where better static analysis is available (e.g. TypeScript&#x2F;Flow)? I don’t mind manually marking components static or dynamic if it means a better UX, but doing it automatically in the compiler&#x2F;bundler could be great for DX, as well as for preventing mistakes.')
