I don’t know from the article if any of this has actually unveiled anything - sounds like the goal of the work, which is progressing Ok.<p>EDIT: Link to the paper. Yours for $30. Ugh. Why is this costing something when I already paid for the research? \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vtol.org&#x2F;store&#x2F;product&#x2F;computation-and-extraction-of-boundary-layer-parameters-from-numerical-simulations-for-use-in-rotor-acoustics-models-16494.cfm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vtol.org&#x2F;store&#x2F;product&#x2F;computation-and-extraction-of...</a>')
