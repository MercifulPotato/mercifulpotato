As a result, you&#x27;d seemingly need an authoritarian government to force these types of changes, which has the potential to cause greater harm than the problem it&#x27;s fixing.<p>Incentives - While such a system seems better for workers, it doesn&#x27;t show any benefit for entrepreneurs or investors. Why would anyone start such a business if they lose control almost immediately? What is the incentive for investment if it doesn&#x27;t come with the potential for a return?<p>Competitive Advantage - The reason you&#x27;d need an authoritarian government is because anyone using a traditional ownership model would have an advantage against these types of companies. As we&#x27;ve seen in cooperatives, one-person-one-vote creates freerider and horizon problems, and the pressure to form smaller firms would eliminate the economies of scale that many firms today enjoy.<p>This feels more like a political solution, and seems liable to succumb to predictable economic behaviors.')
