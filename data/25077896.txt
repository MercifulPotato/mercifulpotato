Raft’s (and Redpanda’s) performance is proportional to the best of the majority of nodes, while sync replication (Kafka) works only as well as its worst-performing node.<p>AFAIK we can push the limits of hardware on throughput.<p>The gist is that I&#x27;d need more details exactly on what you mean raft is slow.<p>We support the same level of acks as kafka except acks=-1 is much stronger gurantees due to the log completeness guarantee of raft.<p>for 0 and 1 we short circuit the raft acknowledgement and return to the client to match the exepectations of acknowledgements come to be known by users.<p>There should be no perf penalty vis-a-vis kafka in any setting I can think of. If it is, is probably a bug on our side.')
