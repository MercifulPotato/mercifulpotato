What&#x27;s more, your earlier quibble about anonymizing the data doesn&#x27;t even negate the statements I have made. Apple always sends your location to Apple, while Google and Amazon do not if you don&#x27;t want them to.<p>Just as you did then, you continue to ignore the even more egregious practice of not only tracking everything you install but tying it to your identity.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24585353" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24585353</a><p>Due to people downvoting my comments to the point that I cannot reply, I will explain why askafriend is wrong right here (though I already explained why they are wrong in my GP post, which they also ignored in their response to that post). Disabling Apple Maps from getting your location does not stop Apple from getting your location. When <i>any</i> app gets your location on iOS, Apple also gets your location. This is explained clearly in the link contained in this comment, which askafriend ignored. Both Amazon and Google allow you to get your location without telling anybody.')
