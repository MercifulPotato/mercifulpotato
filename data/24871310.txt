Otherwise you are driving on your own dime<p>&gt;Why should I get the same wage as a sub par driver\nBecause that&#x27;s not how the world works. It isn&#x27;t some meritocratic paradise that fairly pays people for their work. \nBesides, nothing says uber can&#x27;t pay you more for being a better fully employed driver. If you truly are a better driver, surely you could get a raise right?')
