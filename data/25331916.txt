It covers many advanced topics from perception, filtering, and localization, to planning and vehicle locomotion - thousands of hours went into the technical content, and the platform has some great documentation, infrastructure and tools. The best part is the hands-on approach, participants contribute to the Duckietown platform and compete in a semi-annual miniature DARPA-style challenge. If youâ€™re looking for a practical introduction to self-driving, there really is none better IMHO.')
