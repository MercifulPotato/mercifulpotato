It&#x27;s on the C++ side and does &quot;some funky things&quot; in the way of SIMD to eke out more performance.<p>I wonder how much of that codebase is shared between Windows and macOS though. It&#x27;s quite possible that Microsoft could take advantage of a lot of porting work that has already been done for Apple&#x27;s M processors. If you support Windows&#x2F;x86 and macOS&#x2F;arm then it&#x27;s probably not much more work to create a Windows&#x2F;arm port. Unless there are compatibility issues with the Win32 APIs themselves?')
