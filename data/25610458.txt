This appears to be a terminology mismatch between audio people and electrical engineers, if the rest of this thread is any guide.<p>Here is my view of things: along the time axis, signals can be either continuous-time or discretized&#x2F;discrete-time. Along the intensity axis, for example voltage, signals can be either continuously-variable or discretized&#x2F;discrete-valued.<p>I consider an &quot;analog signal&quot; to be one that&#x27;s continuous in time and in value. I consider a &quot;digital signal&quot; to be one that&#x27;s continuous in time but discrete in value; for instance, the output of a (asynchronous) logic gate.<p>Your definition of &quot;digital domain&quot; seems to be discrete-time, discrete-valued signals; for example, the readings out of an ADC or commands into a DAC.<p>The difference between the two would nicely explain a lot of the confusion here.')
