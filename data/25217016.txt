Additionally the Python API is only semi stable between releases.<p>If you want to add performent extensions to Blender, it requires maintaining an entire fork of the app.<p>Contrast this to other DCCs, where they almost all provide compiled plugin support (usually C++) and API stability is largely guaranteed between releases.<p>This makes Blender very unfriendly for production pipelines.<p>Add to that, Blenders Python extensions don&#x27;t have a very friendly UI story via ghost, whereas other DCCs largely provide a Qt + PySide2 backing.<p>Fwiw I&#x27;m very much pro blender, having rolled it out to artists in production settings, but I am far from recommending it in any core production pipelines unless the studios are willing to maintain an entire fork of the app.')
