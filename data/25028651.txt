I am part of another Internet community where &quot;apolitical&quot; means &quot;is not ringing round door to door trying to persuade people to vote in a certain way&quot;, and of course I have a strong aversion to politics in that sense. Aside from anything else, it seems highly arrogant to expect that I am somehow so much more right than the other half of the population, in the field of politics which I have no special understanding of at all. I&#x27;m not <i>promoting</i> apathy; I am recognising that I have no reason to believe I&#x27;m more right than everyone else here, so I will contribute my vote and I will try to understand things, but I won&#x27;t try and persuade others. On the other hand, I will try and persuade others in areas where I <i>do</i> feel that I have unusually good knowledge.<p>I really am highly uncertain about what people generally expect these days from words like &quot;apolitical&quot;, especially because I perceive this as being one of the areas where there is very strong social pressure to Not Seem Like An Arsehole and so there is no clarification in the downward direction. I think the meaning of these words has been changing quite rapidly, even over the last five years or so.')
