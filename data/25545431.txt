The closest we get is this:<p>&gt; But the auditors were adamant. They did not care that the approved algorithms were weaker. Nothing would change their decision.<p>That&#x27;s the 100% the author&#x27;s perspective. It&#x27;s quite possible those auditors were aware of the existence of bcrypt and what it does.<p>Even so, their personal opinions simply didn&#x27;t matter. And they, quite likely, tried to point this out to the author. Yes, a stronger algorithm - bcrypt - existed, but as long as it wasn&#x27;t a formally vetted FIPS approved algorithm, it simply wasn&#x27;t an option for operational use.<p>Compliance isn&#x27;t bad in itself. It&#x27;s a tool. Compliance is implemented to ensure that large and complex organizations can continue to function as a structured system. It helps ensure accountability, audit-ability, integrity, reliability, sustainability and other &quot;abilities&quot;.<p>There is a trade-off, though, when it comes to day-to-day operations. You simply can&#x27;t improvise. In a large organisations, that&#x27;s a good thing, which the author clearly hasn&#x27;t understood.<p>While the direct result is that their systems security is now weaker, that same compliance also shields them from any legal repercussions. If those systems get compromised, they can always point to the list of sanctioned algorithms and the oversight. That&#x27;s how  accountability works.<p>You&#x27;ll find the freedom and the flexibility to implement your own solutions in smaller organizations. However, that comes at a price: The buck stops at your desk. When something breaks, all eyes will turn to you in order to fix it. And there will be little to hide from.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m well aware that there&#x27;s more nuance to it. There are plenty of stories on both sides of the aisle were the lack of or very existence of formalisms either saved the day or directly lead to catastrophe. That doesn&#x27;t imply that one is always better then the other.')
