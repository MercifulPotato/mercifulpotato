This is one of the OLD reference papers: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2016&#x2F;257.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprint.iacr.org&#x2F;2016&#x2F;257.pdf</a><p>I guess once I figure out what bootstrapping IO for C means, maybe I&#x27;ll have a chance of understanding the paper. But I don&#x27;t even know what bootstrapping means in this context.<p>I have no idea what:<p>&quot;Indistinguishability obfuscation&quot; is (it seems like some kind of mathematical inverse to Monty Hall but I doubt that&#x27;s a clean take)<p>&quot;polynomial size circuits&quot; are (are they just talking about the number of variables in an equation? What does &quot;size&quot; and &quot;circuits&quot; mean here?)<p>&quot;constant-degree graded encoding schemes&quot; are (blu... bluh... uh...)<p>or what any of the above mean &quot;in the plain model&quot; (or what even is a &quot;plain model&quot;).<p>That&#x27;s the first 1&#x2F;3rd of the first sentence of the abstract.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with that, clearly it&#x27;s an extremely specialised field so I don&#x27;t mind being ignorant here, but the OP article doesn&#x27;t really seem to help at all with the understanding.<p>The OP article has a nice picture with hidden lock boxes further down the page but this just feels like the whole quantum entanglement mystery all over again, where the analogy is more confusing than the observed phenomena.<p>I&#x27;m looking at a bunch of replies here like &quot;isn&#x27;t this just simply [x] with [slight y difference]&quot; and making huge calls on the impact to society and I&#x27;m here wondering if I&#x27;m the only dumb person who doesn&#x27;t get it.<p>I&#x27;ll just add this is extremely interesting but it feels like this is going to take a few years for me to absorb what it means, unless I focus all my energy on it, which I&#x27;m not convinced I should just yet.')
