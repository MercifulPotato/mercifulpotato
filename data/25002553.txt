It&#x27;s a shame really, everyone&#x27;s benchmarking the GPUs and nobody&#x27;s looking at the impact of the CPU as far as I could tell. But now that we have an AMD core that&#x27;s 20% faster than the previous one, the tables might&#x27;ve turned.<p>Best of luck developing X-Plane, I wish I could help you guys justify the Linux support, but unfortunately I&#x27;ve not got the enthusiasm or free time to commit to a flight sim just now.')
