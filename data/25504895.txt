People who repeat what you just wrote usually seem to ignore it: If every arena where people <i>actually meet</i> is privately owned, and all of these places agree on what ideas are valid topics of discussion, the effect on society will largely be the same as if a state actor suppressed free speech.<p>We&#x27;re not quite there as a society, but we are moving in that direction. Some of the biggest public arenas are close enough that it is a problem. As a current example, consider if Facebook, Twitter and reddit all agree that any discussion asking critial questions regarding transgender issues are grounds for expulsion. If this happens, there <i>will</i> be valuable discussions that don&#x27;t happen, and society will be worse off for it. There will be people who make life-changing mistakes because they didn&#x27;t have access to a viewpoint that catalyzed an insight that was important for them.<p>We&#x27;re not <i>quite</i> there yet. But there are numerous incidents that make me worried that this trend will leave us with a society that&#x27;s net worse off. Or moves towards violent conflict as the suppressing the free exchange of ideas has <i>economic</i> consequences where those with social access to free speech arenas get better opportunities, leaving the rest without even the <i>possibility</i> of engaging.<p>You see the latter being alluded to when investors on Twitter or elsewhere state that there are many factually true insights about startups that they would never state outside of a close circle of acquaintances, out of a legitimate worry that it would incite a Twitter mob and cause serious personal consequences. Everyone outside of their own sphere of influence are worse off for not being able to share the knowledge. Yet another wedge increasing the wealth disparity, and more fuel for the anger that comes along with it.')
