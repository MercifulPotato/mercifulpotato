They&#x27;re doing amazing work. I tried to build a very simple autonomous drone in my last semester of school using a DJI Mavic Pro. Was pretty difficult, though that probably had something to do with the DJI SDK not really being setup to do what we wanted. Still, really makes me appreciate the quality of work that Skydio is doing.')
