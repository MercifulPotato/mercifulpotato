To reach the lofty heights of Bill Gates et al. one must amass ~ 1 million times more wealth than the median US household.<p>The reason why some believe that to be a billionaire is exploitative is that they believe this 4-6 order of magnitude disparity in wealth is <i>inherently</i> exploitative. You could always imagine a society where the warehouse workers were paid double ( or even quadruple ) for the effort they perform and a 100 billionaire would simply be a 100 millionaire.<p>Regardless of where you draw the line for the discrepancy to be considered exploitative. The line exists somewhere for <i>everyone</i>. Tsar Nicholas had the equivalent of ~1.3 trillion in today&#x27;s dollars in wealth prior to the revolution, and I can&#x27;t imagine the US supporting anyone with amassing more than 10-20 trillion dollars in wealth.<p>Carnegie et. al. each managed to earn up to ~300 billion in today&#x27;s dollars prior to the anti-trust act.')
