Could it be the case that it has rare harms that take months or years to manifest? I am really curious, because from where I stand, the majority of people are rushing to get the vaccine and so forth without even questioning the safety of it, but I am skeptical (perhaps due to my ignorance). I would personally rather wait years with it before I feel comfortable getting it. As far as catching COVID-19 goes: I am pretty sure I had it, as someone I live with was tested positive. We were asymptomatic.')
