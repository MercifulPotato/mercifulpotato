Item(by='lucideer', descendants=None, kids=[25045814, 25045208], score=None, time=1605006268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044546, text='The manpage says it &quot;PRINTS the pathname of the WORKING (current) DIRECTORY&quot;; I don&#x27;t see any implication that either the word &quot;print&quot; or &quot;pathname&quot; make up any specific part of the acronym.<p>Really the manpage doesn&#x27;t specify either way. If I were to force any meaning from the manpage, I would tend to go with the 1st word in the sentence starting the acronym, but it&#x27;s not so much ambiguous as it is just simply not saying anything at all.<p>The original manpage doesn&#x27;t give an etymology, so should be discarded as a source.')
