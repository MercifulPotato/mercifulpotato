Are you going to maintain X.Org? Who is going to maintain it? Maybe you are going to hire developers to preserve purity?<p>&gt; instead of working piecemeal<p>That&#x27;s exactly what happened. Do you remember fonts without anti-aliasing? Run xfontsel, that&#x27;s X11 fonts rendering. Freetype, Fontconfig, Cairo, Pango, HarfBuzz work on client side and push pixels to X Server. Entire rendering model changed, X.Org become compositor. They&#x27;ve faced limits, they&#x27;ve implemented DRI, DRI2 [1].<p>Now developers decided to make good compositor. And they&#x27;ve done it without disturbing X11 ecosystem, with clean way to port toolkits. Window Managers can&#x27;t be ported but they can be reimplemented, just look how many compositors people built [2]. It is a miracle.<p>Linux future is bright. Video drivers moved from X Server to kernel, display configuration parts replaced by KMS, we&#x27;ve got modern font rendering, text shaping, we&#x27;ve got open source AMD GPU driver!<p>I still use Intel GPU, X.Org and xmonad, but the times they are a changing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_Rendering_Infrastructure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_Rendering_Infrastructur...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;wayland" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;wayland</a>')
