Linux will end up splitting the requests down to typically 128kB blocks, but they&#x27;re submitted to the SSD as a batch rather than one at a time, so there&#x27;s sufficient work to keep the drive properly busy. But only do this if you actually need all 100MB. If you&#x27;re randomly accessing only bits and pieces of the file, it&#x27;s usually better to stick with 4kB requests (or larger if your file format and access patterns make that appropriate).')
