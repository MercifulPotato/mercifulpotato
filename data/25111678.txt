Neat but no real gain over JPEG in quality on photos so nonone really used it for anythign but animations, but everyone were already used to GIF in their workflow so.. meh...<p>- JPEG2000 1997-2000 embroiled in patent nonsense so noone really uses it in the wild.<p>- WebP: used by google to look cool but since most people used a webbrowser that does not support it at launch servers were forced to have JPEG&#x27;s as fallback. Great savings much wow.<p>- HEIF: Absolute cluster fudge of variations then Apple did a big Dick move and said &quot;Orchard says HEIC, or Bust!&quot; without actually telling anyone and broke several people&#x27;s workflows that depended on JPEGS form iPhones, especially since FCPX did not support HEIC on launch and it took another 6 months for that update to come. Yay.<p>- WebP2; Google want to swing big dick dev powers to gain a marginal possible performance savings on their servers and say&#x27;s &quot;WebP? That is sooo 2015! you gotta be on WebP2 to hang with us&quot;<p>Is it really that surprising that most people who depend on workflows to actually work to make their money are still using JPEG, GIF and TIFF files?')
