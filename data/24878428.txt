But then again many open-source projects already do this. I&#x27;d rather have control over my repositories than host them on someone else&#x27;s server which is why I&#x27;d go for self-hosted Gitlab or Gitea.<p>This has been my point which I have made for self-hosting over the last few months since GitHub was down on a regular basis, and going against locking in their ecosystem, which is another risk. GitLab cloud is no different. [0]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23915707" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23915707</a>')
