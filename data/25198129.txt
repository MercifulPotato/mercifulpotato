Item(by='teekert', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1606223686, title='Ask HN: Why is the Windows taskbar autohide setting so badly implemented?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I have always set &quot;Automatically hide the taskbar&quot; in Windows, for as long a I can remember. I just like it if the UI gets out of my way and only pops up when summoned (in Windows&#x27; case by hitting the Win&#x2F;Super key).<p>But also for as long a I can remember I have played the game of &quot;what app is forcing my taskbar up&quot;... Usually while I&#x27;m trying to hit something that the taskbar is now obscuring (like Firefox&#x27;s search box, or half of a Teams notification. It is absolutely maddening because I have to click every open app to see if it has anything to report before the taskbar goes down again. And it seems to be getting worse lately I have the feeling.<p>So I want to ask you HNers., how do you treat the Windows taskbar? Am I missing something? Why is the responsible app never flashing? Why can&#x27;t it flash just the upper pixel line so I know something is up but it doesn&#x27;t obscure anything. I have the feeling I am a very small minority of taskbar hiders and nobody really cares about this setting.<p>In comparison, I never have this issue in Ubuntu, the taskbar is there when I hit the Win&#x2F;Super key and not there when I leave it alone. How hard can it be?')
