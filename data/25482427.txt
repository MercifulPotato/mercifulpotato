The latter was a life changing, eye opening journey into the heart of America. Being a &quot;coastal elite&quot;, I gained a level of empathy and cultural understanding for &quot;middle America&quot; at 13mph and in crashing with strangers via WarmShowers.org I can&#x27;t imagine any other 67 day trip could provide.<p>I recommend this experience to anyone who will listen, though it&#x27;s not for the feint of heart...pretty dangerous riding alongside traffic (i.e. insta-death is a swerve away) for starters.<p>If we can lower the bar to this kind of socially transcendent experience -- starting by making it safer sans cars&#x2F;trucks -- I firmly believe this has the power to connect America in ways she needs so badly these days.')
