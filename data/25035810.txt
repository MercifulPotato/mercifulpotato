The question wasn&#x27;t about public utility, it was &quot;Should the City of Chicago act to ensure that all the City&#x27;s community areas have access to broadband Internet?&quot; which can imply a number of contradictory policies, from Chicago setting up municipal broadband to Chicago giving tax incentives to the existing national broadband providers.<p>Illinois limits ballots to three referendum questions, and questions chosen by higher-up political entities have precedence over smaller, more local ones. The three questions on the ballot for Chicago are chosen by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. (For these purposes, Cook County is equivalent to the city of Chicago plus a couple neighboring suburbs.)<p>Background established and into personal opinion: The question is in fact deliberately vague. The Board&#x27;s goal is not to ask three divisive questions getting at the heart of urgent political matters. It is to fill the ballot with three questions to preclude local, less connected authorities from putting inconvenient, compelling questions on the ballot. Here&#x27;s a 2018 court case reaffirming that (Calumet City is in Cook County): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagotribune.com&#x2F;suburbs&#x2F;daily-southtown&#x2F;opini" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagotribune.com&#x2F;suburbs&#x2F;daily-southtown&#x2F;opini</a>...<p>These questions are deliberately worthless and it&#x27;s a waste of time to analyze them for policy guidance.<p>If you&#x27;re curious, the other two questions this cycle were: * In creating its City-wide plan for continued growth and sustainability, should the City of Chicago place equal focus on the goals of resiliency, equity, and diversity? * Should the State of Illinois restrict the sale or possession of firearms that have been defined as assault weapons or of magazines that can hold more than a certain number of rounds of ammunition?')
