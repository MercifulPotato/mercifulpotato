My wife and I got married in our mid 30s.  If you&#x27;re a strait guy with a good career, keeping yourself fit, reasonably good looking, no kids, and without religious&#x2F;cultural reasons to get married, the main advantage of marriage is to reduce relationship anxiety in your partner.  A lot of single guys in my position in their mid-late 30s, some of them friends of mine, tend to date women in their mid 20s.  Women in their mid 30s know there&#x27;s a big risk of losing reasonably successful and fit partners to younger women, and their anxiety puts strain on the relationship.  Entering into a bond of mutually assured financial and social destruction with my partner made her feel much more secure and thereby greatly reduces stress in the relationship.<p>When I was in my late 20s, I also had good chemistry with a female friend who was 32 or 33.  She hinted pretty strongly on several occasions that she thought we&#x27;d make a good couple.  Unfortunately, she had a poor relationship with her father which is a no-go for me due to past bad experiences.  I remember she confided in me that she felt like she needed to start looking to date guys in their late 40s&#x2F;early 50s.  She was good looking and a graduate student at Columbia University at the time.  A lot of women in their mid 30s who should have very good dating prospects have a lot of stress about being passed over for younger women, and unfortunately they&#x27;re often not wrong to worry.<p>If you can&#x27;t imagine leaving your partner for someone else, and they&#x27;re worried about being left because they&#x27;re seeing their friends getting left, words are cheap and your partner will know it.  If you can&#x27;t imagine leaving your partner, then there aren&#x27;t many downsides to getting married, and your partner will also know this.<p>Of course, there are others in different situations, but that&#x27;s the experience of me, my wife, some of my wife&#x27;s single female friends, and some of my single female friends in their mid-30s.  Several of them very pleasant good looking women with graduate degrees from Ivy League schools and good careers.<p>So, for me, I had gotten a bit tired of the dating scene, really liked my partner, couldn&#x27;t imagine breaking up, and knew my parter was getting anxious.  For us, it was a good move, and has made our relationship much stronger.')
