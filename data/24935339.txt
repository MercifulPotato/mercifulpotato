The whole point of &quot;Commenting&quot; platforms is conversation. The fact that these conversations are archived is coincidental. When I post on HN or Reddit, I don&#x27;t care if the conversation lasts a week, let alone a year or more.<p>Perhaps all passing conversation is &quot;Irrelevant&quot; in the author&#x27;s perspective? I don&#x27;t know, but honestly... if this were deleted after 3 days, I wouldn&#x27;t care.')
