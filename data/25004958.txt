Learn how it works from first principles, and the magic will disappear -- errors can still be daunting, but if you follow the concepts something normally jumps out at you. More than anything what gets people is the hypetrain and quickly moving libraries that just don&#x27;t follow the &quot;don&#x27;t break user space&quot; mantra these days.<p>k8s is complex, but the complexity is for the most part essential. Just about every kubernetes concept maps to a thing <i>you&#x27;d have to handle yourself</i> if you ran one or more robust personal servers. It is a simple control loop, that you can run on only one machine -- one bit to check what should be running (etcd + apiserver), one bit to run the things (kubelet), and some bits to make sure they stay running (controller-manager and the other controllers).<p>It is certainly more complex than Dokku[0] or Caprover[1] but that&#x27;s because those are very focused on running applications -- Kubernetes aims to run more things, and for more use cases, but you don&#x27;t have to <i>know</i> about all the use cases, just the ones that matter to you.<p>All that said, I&#x27;ve been working on an orchestrator that simpler to operate than kubernetes, because I think kubernetes stumbled upon it&#x27;s most powerful feature (operators) too late, and the answer to simplicity might actually be breaking kubernetes apart <i>even more</i>.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dokku&#x2F;dokku" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dokku&#x2F;dokku</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CapRover&#x2F;CapRover" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CapRover&#x2F;CapRover</a>')
