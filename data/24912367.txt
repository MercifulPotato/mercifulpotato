Item(by='tluyben2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603835514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24912185, text='&gt; - What does FOSS look like with no-code - do we need some serious FOSS tools in this space?<p>FOSS traditionally has little interest in this because FOSS volunteers like to write code and, like HN, do not believe (to which I agree) that it is more efficient&#x2F;flexible than writing code.<p>These tools have their purposes, but they are not new by any means and this &#x27;generation is not coming&#x27;, it was there since the 70s. Here is a package from the early 80s [0] which is still supported because people still use it; I for one know a large steel processing plant that runs on it since the beginning of the 80s until now; the guy who wrote the bespoke ERP system cannot actually code well; he stinks (he knows it; I knew him well when I still lived close to him), but it worked well for them with this &#x27;low-code tool&#x27; for all these decades.<p>As I said somewhere; the problem is that FOSS is not interested and that the commercial tools belong either to tiny companies who can be wiped out tomorrow (by &#x27;something&#x27;) and huge companies who can cancel the product or only have cloud versions so you are locked-in completely. And a lot of people find that scary while almost all textual programming languages and frameworks are open source and free as in speech and beer.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DataEase" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DataEase</a>')
