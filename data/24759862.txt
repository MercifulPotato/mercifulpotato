Item(by='danans', descendants=None, kids=[24761312, 24760447], score=None, time=1602539537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756863, text='I can&#x27;t tell if the author sees it as a feature rather than a bug, but this basically describes the feudal system of land use, wherein the best areas are exclusively occupied by the priesthood, aristocracy, and their retainers, while the peasantry toils under their control outside the fortified walls.<p>That shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise because the text in question was written nearly 2,000 years ago.<p>It&#x27;s recommendations hold few lessons for the modern era except as a reminder of the inhumanity of the feudal system.   Bear in mind that we only disposed of feudalism (though not completely) in the last few centuries.')
