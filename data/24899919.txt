By the time I saw the fully unedited raw videos of the guy and the kid, I&#x27;d already seen dozens of memes and many official news articles&#x2F;videos comparing the &quot;Covington Kid&quot; to anti-protestors during the Civil Rights movement. The full, unedited videos show the truth; it was a complete non-event. Totally changed my perspective on the kid and the protestor; they went from symbols of a struggle for rights to two people who happened to run into each other in Washington, D.C.')
