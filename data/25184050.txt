Suppose that, due to some underhanded dealings of the Electoral College (and&#x2F;or SCOTUS), the current President were to be granted a second term.  Further suppose that 70% of the country saw this process as illegitimate, but wanted to avoid any direct violent conflict.<p>My question is:  Would big tech companies (or key employees within them) work together to implement a digital General Strike across the country?<p>This would be an extreme and probably criminal form of civil disobedience, although I imagine the perpetrators could be motivated by an expectation of receiving a presidential pardon if they were successful.<p>I&#x27;m sure that someone in the contingency planning departments of these big companies someone has gamed out what would happen if Apple and Google and Microsoft all pushed software updates to devices and online services which blocked certain activities (e.g. use by fossil fuel companies?) while controlling the media narrative by promoting messages from their side.')
