I think an interesting thing about physics education is that it teaches resourcefulness and opportunism. Physics &quot;owns&quot; relatively few techniques and technologies. It borrows from others, and combines things.<p>One of the reasons physicists like programming so much, is that it&#x27;s the modern duct tape for putting disparate things together, and there&#x27;s so much stuff out there to use.<p>Physicists are always among the earliest users of technologies -- vacuum tubes, transistors, and successive generations of computers. At my college, the earliest adopters of personal computers were all physics professors. The one exception was a humanities prof whose kid happened to be a physics major.')
