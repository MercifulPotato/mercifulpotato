(To be fair, every e-commerce giant has a mediocre UI.) I see them casually mentioned in lists of &quot;Amazon alternatives&quot;, but I&#x27;ve never once had someone recommend Overstock for a specific purchase. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even talked to anyone who actually buys there.<p>Are they growing gangbusters in some niche I&#x27;m not aware of?')
