I have seen folk end up with 1000+ tests, of which most are useless because the mocks make far too many assumptions, but are necessary because of the layer coupling.<p>This was mostly in Node though, where mocking the request&#x2F;response gets done inconsistently, per framework. Go might have better tooling in that regard, and maybe that sways the equation a bit. IMO there&#x27;s still merit to decoupling if there&#x27;s any feasibility of e.g. migrating to GraphQL or another protocol without having to undergo an entire re-write.')
