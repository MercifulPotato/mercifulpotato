How is the joke on the American if the guy pretending to be Khazak is acting dumb? I&#x27;ve not seen Americans being rude or mean or judgmental to the Boat character until he is rude first, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s highlighting some immoral or prejudiced behavior.<p>Borat skits seem to be him pretending to be a foreigner and being dumb and obnoxious while his subject looks increasingly uncomfortable.
