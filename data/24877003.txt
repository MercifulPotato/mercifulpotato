This has been happening safely for decades, under constant monitoring for impact on fish and other ocean life. The whole recent &quot;Fukushima tritium release&quot; news cycle is entirely FUD, and all nuclear safety experts agree that there is basically no risk involved. Please stop propagating the FUD.<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.japantimes.co.jp&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;national&#x2F;social-issues&#x2F;fukushima-radioactive-water-release&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.japantimes.co.jp&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;national&#x2F;social...</a> has some of that information, but you can easily find more refs comparing tritium amounts at Fukushima vs. normal release at facilities like La Hague.)')
