Super useful for field research, but at US$900 per pair, they&#x27;re above the &quot;let&#x27;s see what happens&quot; budget for true experimentation. A $90 pair, on the other hand, even with a slightly lower range, would put them comfortably at about the price of a Raspberry Pi or other SBC, opening up a lot more possibilities.')
