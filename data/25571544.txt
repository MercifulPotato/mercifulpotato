People still pay for the service, but they earn shares for their loyalty to a product and get dividends from those shares.<p>Marriage of socialism and capitalism essentially.

We could do single-payer negotiations with drug companies, etc...<p>If anyone wants to work w&#x2F; me on this... email me: patrickwcurl - gmail Trying to put a team together. Co-op style.')
