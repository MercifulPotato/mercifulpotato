A lot of the ergonomic (split) keyboards still force your hands in awkward positions if you&#x27;re coding because of all the weird parentheses and symbols you don&#x27;t normally use. What I haven&#x27;t tried yet are ortholinear keyboards or tiny keyboards like the Atreus. Judging by the layout I&#x27;m guessing ortholinear keyboards would still force your hands into awkward positions at the (pinky) edges, so avoiding that by using a tiny keyboard might be an option?')
