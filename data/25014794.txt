The clear superiority of the C64 experience in some respects as well as the popularity of Pico-8 (including amongst longtime games industry veterans) both indicate that something is seriously amiss with current computing; it&#x27;s not just nostalgia. Both offer a much greater immediacy and responsiveness that makes them more productive in many settings despite their primitiveness.<p>It&#x27;s not like the C64 or Basic were earth shattering marvels of design either so the fact that the  c64-inspired but ~5 orders of magnitude more powerful raspberry Pi 4 compares very unfavourable in terms of startup time and probably quite a few other latency metrics is pretty depressing.')
