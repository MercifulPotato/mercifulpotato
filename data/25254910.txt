The candidate Covid vaccines have been tested on 30-50k volunteers with 0 or maybe 1 adverse event, so the risk must be well below 1:10000. Given that the risk with Covid is much higher, like 1:100 of death and 1:20 of other nasty long-term effects, and (without vaccines) most people would get it, that seems like a fantastic deal.<p>People in areas with no virus, like New Zealand, could plausibly consider the risk not worth it yet.')
