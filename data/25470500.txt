This means it’ll always lag behind UIKit, AppKit, GTK&#x2F;Qt, and... whatever Windows has these days.<p>The Iced project used as an example has a custom renderer for example... does it support VoiceOver? Does it support every standard Cocoa keyboard shortcut?<p>Rust wrappers for these existing libraries (some exist) that maintain all functionality is what would allow “world-class” apps to be built in pure Rust IMO.')
