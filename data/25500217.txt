Here&#x27;s what I was referring to:<p>&gt; Server Components preserve client state when reloaded. This means that client state, focus, and even ongoing animations arenâ€™t disrupted or reset when a Server Component tree is refetched.<p>As well as the part in the video where non-serializable props are referred to, in the context of implicitly sending data between client and server (these may in fact be two separate topics).<p>But either way, surely the quoted paragraph requires some highly-magical behavior?')
