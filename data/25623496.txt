Item(by='onetom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609696829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604302, text='Java is indeed feels like Assembly, compared to other JVM languages, but in large part because of its typed and object oriented nature. I have a very different experience with the JVM ecosystem when using Clojure.<p>It definitely doesn&#x27;t &quot;require 800 lines to talk to a REST API&quot; if you use this HTTP server&#x2F;client lib, written in pure Clojure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;http-kit.github.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;http-kit.github.io</a><p>I&#x27;m primarily developing Clojure software, using IntelliJ and I mostly use the keyboard for it.<p>Cmd-E for recent file or Tool window (Clojure Deps) switching.\nThis is what I use the most.<p>Cmd-Shift-A for the Action Menu, which I use for Window Split Down&#x2F;Right or Run tests and a couple of REPL commands, like copy the last result to the clipboard or open it in a browser. Opt-Tab to switch between splits. I don&#x27;t switch between tabs, because I limited the max number of tabs to 1.<p>Cmd-, - Preferences<p>Cmd-; - Project structure<p>Cmd-Shift-O - Open files<p>Cmd-Shift-F - Search Files recursively in the whole project<p>Cmd-1 to focus and turn the Project file structure on and off, Cmd-Shift-Left&#x2F;Right to resize it, Shift-Esc to close it (or any other tool window).<p>Cmd-9 for version control. Cmd-Shift-]&#x2F;[ for moving between tabs. Ctrl-V for VCS operations menu, like (1 or just Enter) commit, (7) branch, (8) push.<p>Reassigned F12 to Cmd-2 to focus&#x2F;show&#x2F;hide the Terminal. Esc to switch the focus back to the Editors (which is buggy for years now and registers the Esc key in the terminal, but it&#x27;s just a slight annoyance)<p>Cmd-Opt-R to run Clojure REPLs. Ctrl-Enter to eval top-level form or Ctrl-Shift-Enter to eval sexp before caret in the REPL. Cmd-Shift-J&#x2F;K to barf&#x2F;slurp, Cmd-&#x27; to raise and Cmd-(&#x2F;[&#x2F;{ to wrap sexp. Cmd-Shift-Up&#x2F;Down to move an expression backward&#x2F;forward within its containing expression. Cmd-&#x2F; to comment. Alt-Up&#x2F;Down for Expand&#x2F;Shrink selection by syntactical units. Refactoring with Ctrl-T.<p>Everything else is just opt&#x2F;shift&#x2F;ctrl&#x2F;cmd + cursor keys, space, tab, shift-tab, enter or fuzzy search by simply typing the name of something in a popup list, dialog box or tool window.<p>These shortcuts cover ~80% of my time using IntelliJ, but I use another 10-20 keybindings, like folding an file structure navigation, which cover 95% of the use-cases.<p>It&#x27;s also important to add that my CapsLock acts as both Ctrl and Esc and I&#x27;m using the SpaceFn layout via Karabiner Elements (as implemented by the jeebak complex modification). This makes a tremendous difference in convenience when using anything really from the keyboard primarily.')
