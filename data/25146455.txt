It&#x27;s a pretty easy read and has some fun illustrations by one of the authors. It&#x27;s one of my favorite design books in general since I believe it&#x27;s a pretty important subject which can easily apply to other types of knowledge work.\n[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discussingdesign.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discussingdesign.com&#x2F;</a>')
