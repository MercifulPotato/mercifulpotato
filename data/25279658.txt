All of them are ignorant? Uh huh.<p>&gt; but Scott Adams is no isolated fool, so unfortunately his continued support for Trump is, yes, willfully seditious.<p>Geez Louise.<p>&gt;but when you have someone openly attempting to retroactively cancel an election after he lost,<p>Let me fix that for you to add some context: &quot;but when you have someone OPENLY AND LEGALLY attempting to retroactively cancel an election after he lost&quot;.<p>Trump is going through the court system. He has a right to do that. Do you want to live in a country where candidates are not allowed to challenge election results in court?? Really really? So far outcomes of the lawsuits resulted in some votes that were missed to be counted (like the flash cards in Georgia), some re-counts that resulted in Biden getting a bigger voter-share, and a number of lawsuits being thrown out.
