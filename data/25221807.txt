Expert-level knowledge is just a small piece of the puzzle.<p>In London, I&#x27;ve recently seen senior engineer salaries range from about £60k at the lower end to about £120k at the upper end. Which is such a wide range as to be totally unhelpful. I&#x27;d say it shouldn&#x27;t be <i>hard</i> to find a range of jobs to apply for at around £85k, which seems to be the most common ballpark figure.')
