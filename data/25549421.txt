If you are going to ship software to end users <i>there is almost always a better way to bundle and ship than send someone a Docker container</i>.<p>Docker is not a distribution tool, if you are expecting your end users to install Docker, you&#x27;ve already screwed up.<p>&gt; Downloading a pre-compiled binary is almost like this, except with worse odds. Maybe there’s a build for your architecture. If it was statically linked, you’re golden. Otherwise, use ldd to reverse engineer the fact that you need to install libjpeg.<p>On Mac and Windows this is almost never an issue. Even on Linux, it&#x27;s pretty straight forward to statically link your binary if you aren&#x27;t sure about the environment it&#x27;s going to be run on. Statically linked binaries are a bit bloated... but not as bloated as a damned Docker image which contains entire dependency trees.<p>In no case is &quot;Making it into a Docker Image&quot; a simpler&#x2F; better distribution mechanic.')
