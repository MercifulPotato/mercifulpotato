Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25752366], score=None, time=1610470553, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748230, text='&gt; if a business owner refuses service to people based on political opinions or similar they are in for a world of hurt<p>That surprises me. &quot;Political opinion&quot; is not a protected class [1] in most jurisdictions in the US, and I assume that the same holds for whatever the local equivalent is to protected class. Especially considering that a lot of European countries also have laws that prohibit Holocaust denial--which are unconstitutional in the US per the 1st Amendment.<p>[1] Protected class, in US discrimination law jargon, is an attribute that you cannot legally use to discriminate against. The usual protected classes are sex, race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, and gender identity, although there is some variation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (e.g., military service is protected in my state).')
