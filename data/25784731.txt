Knowing that both platforms have been used by the military in combat situations, and knowing the hunting platforms usually have much more powerful cartridges?<p>This is a question you&#x27;d need to ask to the portuguese authority that manages weapons importation at the customs, which curiously, it&#x27;s a procedure that must be done in the presence of a customs oficial, an expert of the Police (PSP), and the General Management of Weaponry and Defense Equipment (Direcção-Geral de Armamento e Equipamento de Defesa).<p>So I think it&#x27;s their opinion and expertise that dictates such decisions? No idea! But I don&#x27;t see it written anywhere that such specific weapon&#x2F;platform is banned&#x2F;forbidden.<p>Curious fact, just came across this information, apparently not so long ago civilians could buy fully automatic rifles in Portugal \n, you just had to belong to a &quot;club&quot;! It was one of the few countries that allowed that, like Pakistan an Yemen - I had no ideia just found this out. Law changed from pressure of EU and UN.')
