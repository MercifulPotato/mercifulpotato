Virtual hosts are easily supported. You should read up on the K8S documentation because it seems you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the K8S constructs.<p>What you&#x27;re looking for is called an Ingress, which is like a Service that has more advanced routing specifically designed to support multiple hosts and backends from one &quot;ingress&quot; point for the cluster. The Ingress (again a set of routing rules) can be implemented by many different proxies like Nginx, HAProxy, Traefix, Caddy, etc. Or you can use Ambassador like I mentioned which bypasses the K8S Ingress and uses its own streamlined config with better performance, observability and automated HTTPS too.')
