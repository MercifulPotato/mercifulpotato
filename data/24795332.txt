Adult work is completely legal in the US, and pornography is a form of constitutionally protected free speech, yet Parler strictly prohibits it on &quot;Decency&quot; grounds.<p>I see no problem with social netoworks drawing a line in the sand.  The big ones can draw a line at violence, hatred, and fascism.  The little ones can draw the same line and stand shamefully on the other side.<p>And nobody loses their right to speak.')
