Automated testing has been more or less an open area of research for decades. It&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; to see how to trip branches in a case where an int has to be above 20 or whatever, but in reality, when dealing with ad-hoc (&amp; often intractable) memory mappings, fancy pointer arithmetic, or more interesting paradigms (e.g. recursive calls that may break somewhere down the line), this becomes several orders of magnitudes harder to do.')
