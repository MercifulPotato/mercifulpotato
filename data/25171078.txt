It brings up great points. The one thing I don&#x27;t fully agree with is (2) Buy almost always beats build. I think generally it does apply and especially for unrelated, common pieces like feature flags or managed databases.<p>But I think there are plenty of cases when it makes sense to build rather than buy even when tools exist. 1) It helps build a muscle of getting things done. 2) It offers a way to learn new things and to try new things. 3) It gives you understanding and better control over the solution. If the saas goes out of service or out of business it can create stressful times trying to migrate at the last minute.<p>So I would replace &#x27;almost always&#x27; with &#x27;often&#x27;.')
