I agree resource management is the real engineering problem and the graphics code itself is the idealized code that is relatively small in comparison.<p>My conclusion is that resource management across different hardware is a secret sauce that helps individual engines push the limits of the current generation. Listening to interviews with developers, and they rarely talk about a novel lighting formulas. Instead they talk about squeezing in high res textures or more colors. How they managed so many assets or faked a reflection. I imagine the work is incredibly tedious and makes browsers differences look trivial.<p>Differences between hardware is largely how memory can be mapped between CPU, shared, and GPU memory.')
