They are very marketing hype heavy and seem to be designed to give inexperienced people a false sense of expertise. That said, they aren’t a bad introduction if think of as just learning the table of contents and the glossary.<p>I do not consider myself an expert even though I’ve built some pretty large things on AWS. My own path was to build some toy apps, some side projects, and just play in general. Then I took a few certifications (pro and specialty) to help illuminate the gaps in my experience. Then I started building more.<p>Ultimately, the only real way to become an expert is to do stuff. You have to build, solve problems, pivot, do peer reviews, etc.')
