If they added a good build system (heck, just use bazel) and a feature to build code in the cloud, and a web IDE and better code review system (of course, all with open protocols — it’s git after all), we could have a much more standardized open source environment— the overhead to working on a new open source project would be lower since you wouldn’t have to figure out how to build it. It would also make it significantly easier to add dependencies and integrate software together.')
