First of I&#x27;d say that trying to find a 1:1 feature&#x2F;convention parity between the frameworks won&#x27;t work. E.g. in aspnetcore you&#x27;ll add an attribute to model and after generating a new migration the column change will already be in-place. Most of the time it works out-of-the-box, you can always edit the migration if needed<p>What I found lacking (at the time) was specifically a better Webpack integration, similar to rails.\nAlso I got used to having rspec, in net core world you have xUnit which is something like ruby TestUnit.<p>At the start I also found DependencyInjection a bit confusing and also the fact that in Aspnetcore the models&#x2F;entities aren&#x27;t like AR models where you have a bunch of validation&#x2F;instance methods inside it. In .net you try to separate everything in repositories&#x2F;validators&#x2F;viewModels.<p>But yes, unlike Rails, .net won&#x27;t have an opinionated way on how to do things.<p>All-in-all I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the experience. Though I will say that Rails is still a tad more &quot;batteries included&quot; type of thing.')
