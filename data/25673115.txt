For those on prepaid plans, it would also require that you have enough credit on that phone to send SMS. Perhaps the developers felt that there were too many uncertainties to implement this feature; users might have reacted negatively if it didn’t work for them.<p>Plus, Signal plans to eventually allow multiple phones to be connected to one’s account.
