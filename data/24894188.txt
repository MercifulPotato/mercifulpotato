There is no magnetic field nor electric field propagating through spacetime. However there is a continuous gravitational field that can be tapped into. Even our solar system rotates around the milky wave using this gravitational field. It is of interest to pursue the development of &#x27;Field Propulsion&#x27; engine.')
