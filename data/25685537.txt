Good idea?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='hi all!\nI am planning to develop a hacker news like site for cyber security news and for infosec folks to discuss topics. Some of the features I plan to include are:\n* submission of news, comments, upvote etc \n* discounts and bundles for any cybersec study programs, books etc \n* reference documents for things like NIST standard assessments, COBIT audits, GDPR implementation etc<p>I have not decided whether it should work as an aggregator or like HN rely on users to submit news<p>What do you guys think? Would you guys like a site like that?<p>Thanks !')
