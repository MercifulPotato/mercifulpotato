Not many naked imperialists out there anymore, but the arguments are easy enough to make. The US, The USSR... both with some stunning scientific achievements (eg nuclear physics, space travel, physics) achievements during their most imperial, post-war years.  The British. The Dutch.

A lot of Scottish enlightenment may have been catalyzed by the translation of his &quot;Muqdima.&quot;')
