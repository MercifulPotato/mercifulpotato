I had experience with psychedelics, but none with MDMA. All I can say is ymmv. I was underwhelmed by the experience. Later I would go on to do CBT, DBT and Wisemind, and CPT [1] for PTSD and those actually worked really well. I think MDMA combined with those therapies might have been even better. CPT was particularly helpful to confront the abuse I suffered.<p>[1] Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectic Behavioral Therapy &amp; Wisemind, Cognitive Processing Therapy')
