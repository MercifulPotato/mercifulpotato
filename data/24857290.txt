Even if they are not common around us we&#x27;ve had some exposure, from occasional visitors, travels, or media.  When we hear an accent we&#x27;ve really never been exposed to we aren&#x27;t likely to understand it.  A good example is foreign speakers trying to speak our native language... even if they&#x27;ve learned our language in school for years, their even slightly off pronunciation can make it very difficult to understand what they are saying.')
