I&#x27;m going to poke at this a bit, so I want to be clear that I respect you for engaging.<p>&gt; I think the &quot;Great Compromise&quot; helps correct for the fact that people in different locations value different things and have different experiences. People who live in farming communities understand plenty of things that people in cities don&#x27;t and vice-versa.<p>This phrasing feels like a platitude that can justify any distribution of electoral-college power we feel like creating. Can you clarify how it &quot;corrects&quot; for people having different locations&#x2F;values&#x2F;experiences?<p>Maybe it helps to focus on narrower questions like: Do you feel like the current winner-take-all allocation in most states or proportional allocation as used in Nebraska and Maine either uphold or undermine the values you&#x27;re describing here?<p>&gt; ...it&#x27;s an agreement that was reached between states who were giving up their sovereignty to join together. If we discard compromises like that because people who won the popular vote by a tiny margin now think it&#x27;s outdated and that they have some democratic mandate, then collectively society has lost my trust to keep it&#x27;s word on future compromises wherein I&#x27;m asked to forfeit some of my independence and sovereignty.<p>This feels a little unfair...<p>1. States made a compromise of some sovereignty to join, but the compromise was very much about protecting significant parts of that sovereignty. The states, quite pointedly, retain the sovereignty to modify the compromise. If the electoral college is <i>discarded</i>, it will be because states exercised their sovereignty, via this process, to do so.<p>2. Following the above, minus a few stipulations, each state legislature retains broad power regarding how their electors are selected and what they are expected to do. Something like the Fair Vote proposal entails exercising this sovereignty.')
