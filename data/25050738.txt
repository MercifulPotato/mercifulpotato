H&#x2F;W is made by a Chinese company. Project leads are situated all across the world in multiple time zones. Other parts of the software development is spread across Eastern Europe.<p>Anecdote from last job: Building software in a team of thousands spread all around the world across every time zone imaginable needing access to remote systems, physical hardware and thousands of sensors on a floating ship thousands of miles away with a crappy satellite connection.<p>Conclusion: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand how the other half lives, therefore it is impossible.&quot;<p>There are certain subsets of software development that need to be hands on. Many don&#x27;t.<p>And to address the &quot;lack of discipline&quot; in the article: That&#x27;s your problem.<p>To address the hiring of foreign nationals and local labour laws: There are literally companies that exist solely for that purpose. I&#x27;ve used two of those companies in the past for our own teams to hire a foreign national as an employee that works remotely. A cursory web search will throw up dozens of companies that specialize in just that. Those companies have registered offices all across the world. You&#x27;re hired to that company locally and fulfill all local employment laws for only a marginal amount of overhead.<p>Bad article is bad.')
