And that&#x27;s coming from someone who is normally left-leaning, and not a fan of him.  There were definite mistakes at the beginning, and a blase attitude resulted in a bad first wave for the UK.  It&#x27;s still not completely clear why the death rate was so high - may be related to the way the coronavirus ripped through care homes early on, or simply because the UK could have locked down a week or two earlier.  Not to mention the mess up with ventilators and PPE.<p>But since then, the UK has handled the second wave reasonably well.  People aren&#x27;t talking about the crazy high rates in France and Spain which were exceeding the US for much for time, and with a corresponding high death rate too.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with Germany, but their previously pristine record looks like it&#x27;s being shattered at the moment...<p>I think something changed after Boris went to hospital.')
