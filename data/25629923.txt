They are the only parties in a position to implement digital contact tracing natively and they failed us. With great power comes great responsibility. No start-up or government has the ability to implement a low-level cross-platform contact tracing api. As of Today Apple still has not enabled their framework on iOS &lt;= 12 devices even though there are countless people using devices that can not be updated to the current iOS. They have previously provided critical security updates for out-of-support versions of their OS. Why did they not do the same for the contact tracing framework?')
