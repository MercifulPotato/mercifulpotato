Happy to answer any questions about what&#x27;s changed since 2014...<p>Michael Solomon [1] still my agent, and 10x has stood by me throughout my career. While I&#x27;ve stopped doing consulting work for others through 10x, they still support my contracts related to art and speaking arrangements. I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of how much they&#x27;ve done for me.<p>I stopped doing contract work not because of 10x, but simply grew tired of working on, and fixing other people&#x27;s problems. They were completely accepting and supportive of me to head out and build my own company (since 2017). I know their rooster of talent has grown significantly since then, and I would still highly recommend companies use them to get amazing talent onboarded without any hassle.<p>[1] While you&#x27;re looking into 10x, don&#x27;t forget to check out the nonprofit he started <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.musiciansoncall.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.musiciansoncall.org</a> which brings live music into hospitals!')
