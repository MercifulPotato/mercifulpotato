C++ has also been evolving faster than Rust.<p>Right now Rust fills the &quot;C++ with training wheels&quot; niche - when you need a language in this space but don&#x27;t have the energy or time to disentangle the sordid story of all the crufty legacy systems built around C++ after all this time.<p>But in principle if somebody made a well thought-out onboarding story for C++ then there&#x27;s be little point in Rust.<p>P.S. But you say &quot;my borrow checker&quot; - well, sorry to disappoint you, people don&#x27;t really care and actually view it as an impediment in learning Rust, not as a feature. If Rust had no borrow checker it&#x27;d be an even more popular language.')
