It also seems like DNS Over TLS (DoT) isn’t going to get as much traction exactly because it’s easier to block.<p>As other comments have said, (for those who’re able to do it) not configuring any connection for the device sounds like a good start, but even that has caveats about the device connecting to nearby open networks. So the best thing to do instead is to connect it to a network but not allow any communications to the Internet.')
