Instead I have periods where I am super uber productive and days where I feel completely exhausted. I can&#x27;t tell if its a mental thing or rather there&#x27;s actually something physically wrong Lol. My mind tends to be blurry like its rebelling and if I force myself to work hard I start feeling feverish. I have trouble figuring out if I&#x27;m not working hard enough or working too hard.<p>I wonder if its also like that for some of the successful startup founders out there too')
