That conflicts with what I think because I believe that engaging hobbies are that vitality which manifests as “playful” and “fun”.  Are you willing to try something new, and if you do, are you willing to learn to do it well enough to enjoy it.<p>Engaging with a hobby tends to involve making it part of me - the hobbies I haven’t committed to actually liking and just performed have always been the ones that get lost in the shuffle of things.  Even more so, being so committed to a hobby pushes me to do more heavy lifting when it comes to doing it socially.<p>(Edit) After a bit more thought I decided an example would be good:<p>I love Jorge Luis Borges, so when my book club finally decided to read him I took the time to rate many of the stories, trying to collect an essence of his magical, gaucho, and mystical stories to help focus our discussion.  That is what I mean —- to love something so much that effort becomes effortless because you’re bursting at the seems hoping to share.  In this way we didn’t just read “Library of Babel”, but some of the little mysteries that show a different touch of his craft.')
