Dart is garbage-collected; and<p>2. Dart has optional typing, which is to say it supports type hints but is essentially dynamically rather than statically typed.<p>This presentation claims low overhead so I&#x27;m open to be proven wrong here. I wonder how much of that (if true) is Flutter and how much is Wayland (over X). I&#x27;d really like to see some nontrivial apps in this, React Native, Qt, GTK and the like.<p>But GC isn&#x27;t just about overhead (although that is a concern). It&#x27;s about predictability of performance. It&#x27;s about tuning the VM and the characteristics of STW GC pauses (if any).')
