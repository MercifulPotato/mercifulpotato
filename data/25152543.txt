My son wrecked his bike and fell into a creek once and I swear I heard him scream a block away. I ran out to the creek and pulled him out before anyone else in my house even got on scene. There are whole videos of &quot;dad&#x27;s saving kids.&quot; (0)<p>But it&#x27;s not just men. When I was very young, before I could swim, I fell into a pool and my grandmother dove in and saved me. She was like a bolt of lightening. I don&#x27;t have many memories of being young.
