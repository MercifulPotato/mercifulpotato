The two aren&#x27;t comparable. Drinking a lot of alcohol and getting into a car is a choice. The intent doesn&#x27;t even matter in most countries since it&#x27;s a &quot;Strict liability&quot; crime.<p>The government forcing you to take an injection is literally not your choice. Not to mention, we know drunk driving impairs people and increases risk. There are tons of studies that show that (they also show sleep deprivation is worse than alcohol for driving, but that&#x27;s not illegal ... probably because it&#x27;s not measurable, or it&#x27;s hard to gauge intent).<p>This vaccine has been rushed through the process with zero long-term Longitudinal studies. A drug company can yell 95% effective all they want, but the fact is, this is a HUGE unknown. The vast majority of normal scientists in other fields cannot do this research themselves and there aren&#x27;t even any published papers yet we can look at.<p>This is a bad argument. You want some more bad arguments? Look at the Buck SCOTUS decision which lead to forced serialization, or the SCOUTS decision that lead to Japanese internment camps. You know what those two decisions were dependent on? Jacobson. The vaccine case.')
