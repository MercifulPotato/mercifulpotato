I&#x27;ve got a sneaking suspicion that they&#x27;ll brew fewer than 10 pots before failing,  and that even if the hardware is working in six months they&#x27;ll turn the service off.<p>I was thinking of plugging in a cheap drip coffeemaker into a smart plug (somehow I have five of those that aren&#x27;t plugged in) but out-of-the-box every coffeemaker I&#x27;ve seen doesn&#x27;t start when you turn it on but needs a button pressed.  I tried shorting the pins together on the start button and that doesn&#x27;t work,  I think I&#x27;d have to put in a 556 time to delay a moment and then &#x27;push&#x27; the button.<p>Maybe they make coffeemakers that just start instead of pushing a button or setting a silly clock,  but I think it might be against the law because of fire safety or something like that.')
