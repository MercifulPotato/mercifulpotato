Item(by='andrewshadura', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603958993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24926417, text='In Slovakia, we have an addressing system invented in the Maria Theresia times: each building has a separate number, unique within the city or a suburb, in addition to the usual house number. In small villages, especially where streets have no names, these unique numbers are used to identify houses, as no other house numbers exists.<p>These numbers appeared in an attempt to uniquely identify households, mainly for tax and military purposes, hence the name: <i>conscription numbers</i>. In a lot of places, these numbers were literally issued in the order troops marched through the town, usually starting with the church. (More on the topic: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forgottengalicia.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;cache&#x2F;page_enhanced&#x2F;forgottengalicia.com&#x2F;conscription-numbers-vienna&#x2F;_index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forgottengalicia.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;cache&#x2F;page_enhanced&#x2F;...</a>)<p>The fun thing about conscription numbers is that they alone can be used in addresses. For example, Nižná 496 is a valid address (where Nižná is the village name), while Nová Doba 496, Nižná is what many people would use — this village has no street-level house numbers, but streets themselves have names.<p>Similarly, Bratislava I 501 is the same address as Hlavné námestie 1, Bratislava is the same address as Hlavné námestie 501&#x2F;1, Bratislava is the same address as Hlavné námestie 501, Bratislava.<p>Sometimes, houses have street-level numbers, but there’s no street name. For example: &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;4738832411#map=18&#x2F;49.05125&#x2F;19.61773" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;4738832411#map=18&#x2F;49.0512...</a>&gt;. There’s a bunch of houses in this area which have addresses like Trstica 1, Trstica 3, but <i>also</i> have conscription numbers, so technically Iľanovo 122, Liptovský Mikuláš, Trstica 1, Liptovský Mikuláš and Trstica 1, Iľanovo are all probably valid addresses (not verified by any delivery there, though).<p>With postal codes, IIRC all post codes in Slovakia outside of Bratislava start with 0, those in Bratislava start with 8, a remnant from the times when Czechoslovakia had a common postal code system. In Bratislava, the second digit in the postal code is the city district&#x2F;suburb, three more digits define a bigger zone within it, but are largely optional; the third digit of zero means the postal code of a post office serving the area:<p>811 07 is an area in the Blumentál locality, 810 07 is the post office which delivers there, but a post code 810 00 would work just fine.')
