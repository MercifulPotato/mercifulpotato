I think he is the dumbest one too and I think he is personally responsible for a large percentage of avoidable Covid deaths in Brazil. I think he is corrupt too. But I think he is not <i>more</i> corrupt than tons of other politicians in Brazil, and also not more corrupt than several other world leaders.<p>Also, no drug lord considered to an “organized crime” relevance award?<p>This “award” is just a statement about the opinion of those behind it of which places took a turn for the worst this year. It is a political opinion as important &#x2F;unimportant as any opinion article written by any of those supporting organizations. It is not a thought out selection with objective criteria. Just a way to influence society opinion. Which is ok btw, just not something worth taken as definite judgement about who was the more influential person in corruption and organized crime in 2020.')
