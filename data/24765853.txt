There are a lot of people that wax nostalgic about how &quot;it was a better era&quot; but in reality, it was god awful video quality, low effort or simple content, creators that made stuff when they felt like it, and much harder to use youtube as a search engine as opposed to just an entertainment machine.<p>The internet pre-today was just garbage. The issues with being tracked and Facebook...blah blah blah are all minor in comparison to it&#x27;s convenience it&#x27;s brought. Remember when you ACTUALLY had to make a forum post and engage with others online to maybe get the answer you were looking for? What about online shopping? Did you really like relying on some sketchy website that someone whipped up and didn&#x27;t bother to secure your info with they&#x27;re half-baked payment processing page?<p>The thing these people often forget is, that garbage content they think is so great is still there. They just don&#x27;t actively look for it anymore. They just see the top promoted channels and go &quot;oh wheres the good stuff!&quot; but don&#x27;t bother to search for it. They never sort by new I bet on any website.')
