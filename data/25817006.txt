No space reactor will make sense for terrestrial power generation.  The temperatures are different, power density is different, safety cases are different.  A 20kg reactor likely needs highly enriched fuel (space reactors are typically fast reactors too, so we&#x27;re talking about something that&#x27;s almost a bomb there.)<p>An external neutron source does not greatly change the needed enrichment (since any practical subcritical reactor would still need k fairly high, so it is only a bit subcritical.)')
