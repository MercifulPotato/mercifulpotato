Item(by='patrickk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604911881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25032225, text='&gt; Serge quickly discovered, to his surprise, that Goldman had a one-way relationship with open source. They took huge amounts of free software off the Web, but they did not return it after he had modified it, even when his modifications were very slight and of general rather than financial use. “Once I took some open-source components, repackaged them to come up with a component that was not even used at Goldman Sachs,” he says.<p>&gt; Open source was an idea that depended on collaboration and sharing, and Serge had a long history of contributing to it. He didn’t fully understand how Goldman could think it was O.K. to benefit so greatly from the work of others and then behave so selfishly toward them. “You don’t create intellectual property,” he said. “You create a program that does something.” But from then on, on instructions from Schlesinger, he treated everything on Goldman Sachs’s servers, even if it had just been transferred there from open source, as Goldman Sachs’s property. (At Serge’s trial Kevin Marino, his lawyer, flashed two pages of computer code: the original, with its open-source license on top, and a replica, with the open-source license stripped off and replaced by the Goldman Sachs license.)<p>From an excellent article[1] by Michael Lewis, on Goldman Sachs&#x27; attitude towards open source software.<p>EDIT: typo<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;michael-lewis-goldma...</a>')
