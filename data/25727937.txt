Those roads would avoid features that confuse the automation, or have some sort of passive or active assistance installed.<p>&gt; This is the kind of issue which will persist, vehicles which fail to recognize a real world situation shouldnâ€™t get the benefit of changing the world to fit them.<p>There are already places that regularly confuse human drivers, and those do get fixed (though usually only after someone dies). I don&#x27;t see why we couldn&#x27;t do the same for driving robots, especially when they get more common over time.')
