Many Trumpers like her too. I like that she is honest personally. She has both criticized the  antifa&#x2F;blm riots and the riots on the sixth. Brought up concerns of both police brutality (concerns I share, BTW), and election integrity (which I also am concerned with).<p>I actually have supported with many actions of Antifa &#x2F; BLM (probably wouldn&#x27;t guess that from my post history), including the protests at Pelosi&#x27;s and McConnell&#x27;s houses, and the disruption of the globalist meetings you mention. I don&#x27;t agree with them in their destruction of property, especially that of small mom-and-pop businesses, or even big business if it affects small businesses (by raising insurance rates for example). And obviously, I disagree with anything actually threatening lives.')
