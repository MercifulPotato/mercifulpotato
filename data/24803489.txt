Seems very archaic relative to corporate structures. Makes it hard to figure out whoâ€™s calling the shots.<p>When I go to the Canadian E&amp;Y website, it says:<p>&gt; EY refers to the global organization, and may refer to one or more, of the member firms of Ernst &amp; Young Global Limited, each of which is a separate legal entity. Ernst &amp; Young Global Limited, a UK company limited by guarantee, does not provide services to clients.<p>PwC refers me to a separate website for their structure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pwc.com&#x2F;gx&#x2F;en&#x2F;about&#x2F;corporate-governance&#x2F;network-structure.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pwc.com&#x2F;gx&#x2F;en&#x2F;about&#x2F;corporate-governance&#x2F;network...</a><p>KPMG has been mixing it up, per wikipedia:<p>&gt; KPMG International changed its legal structure from a Swiss Verein to a co-operative under Swiss law in 2003[25] and to a limited company in 2020.[4]<p>Are they basically franchises?
