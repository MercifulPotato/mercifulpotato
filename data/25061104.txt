If the mirror components were abundant, some bacteria would have learn to eat it, and we would have a chiral war. (Perhaps this happened, and we won!)<p>For example from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amino_acid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Amino_acid</a><p>&gt; <i>These are all L-stereoisomers (&quot;left-handed&quot; isomers), although a few D-amino acids (&quot;right-handed&quot;) occur in bacterial envelopes, as a neuromodulator (D-serine), and in some antibiotics.</i><p>&gt; <i>Although D-isomers are uncommon in live organisms, gramicidin is a polypeptide made up from mixture of D- and L-amino acids. Other compounds containing D-amino acids are tyrocidine and valinomycin.</i><p>Some bacteria can produce the D- version of the amino acids, and use them in peptides that are natural antibiotics because other bacteria don&#x27;t know how to destroy them. (Anyway, some other bacteria can are resistant, because they developed a way to destroy them.)')
