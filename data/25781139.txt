I can only comment on what I&#x27;ve been seeing through media&#x2F;social media&#x2F;etc.<p>It&#x27;s tough. People are emotional. People are going to make mistakes. Sometimes mistakes are more likely to present themselves when faced with certain situations.<p>Just like people aren&#x27;t perfect, police aren&#x27;t perfect. Whether it&#x27;s truly the belief of hundreds of thousands on the left, or if it&#x27;s just the usual social media amplification of minority opinions - the general rhetoric of the rioters (separate from protestors) is &quot;all cops are bad&quot;, &quot;defund the police&quot;, &quot;cops are pigs&quot;, &quot;kill all cops&quot; etc.<p>When you&#x27;re the very people that are tasked with &quot;maintaining the peace&quot; and there&#x27;s thousands of people rioting (leading to in one case that I know of, the abandonment and eventual burning down of a major precinct), of course there&#x27;s going to be situations where police make mistakes or act with their emotions - especially when their superiors (chiefs, government officials, etc) are condoning and <i>debatably</i> encouraging the protests&#x2F;riots with their statements&#x2F;rhetoric.<p>Likewise with the other side, there are several videos that were circulating online of hundreds&#x2F;thousands of people rioting in city centers and you have the select few &quot;ruining&quot; it by lighting things on fire, throwing improvised bombs&#x2F;fireworks at officers, shooting and killing officers in broad daylight while they&#x27;re sitting in their cars on break.<p>Of course officers tasked with riot control are going to be a bit more heavy-handed in how they react. Likewise - of course rioters are going to &quot;take it to the next level&quot; - it&#x27;s an arms race that nobody can win.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating to go and look at it from both sides and how pig-headed (ha) both of them are. There&#x27;s absolutely ZERO compromise on either side - and I have no concrete idea&#x2F;theory what has happened in modern society to promote this division and one-sidedness.')
