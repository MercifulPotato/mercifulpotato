Economics is largely about an emergent phenomenon, thus falling squarely on the &quot;is&quot; side of things.<p>Emergence is a relatively recent concept in the linguistic timeline. For most of human history, everything seemed to be either of human action and human intention (turning on a light), or neither of human action nor of human intention (the weather). As such, languages did not emerge (ha!) that easily expressed emergent behaviors, things that were of human action but <i>not</i> of human intention (traffic jams).<p>Similarly, one can see this with the subject of biological evolution (another emergent phenomenon). It&#x27;s been nearly two centuries since Darwin got that ball rolling, and still almost any discussion about evolution is rife with inaccurately implied intention.<p>One other consequence of this linguistic difficulty is that it leads people to propose solutions to perceived problems as if they were just about human action&#x2F;human intention...')
