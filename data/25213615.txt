And suddenly, why looms look as complex as they do and are able to weave complex patterns makes sense. Why looms were automated makes sense, and I find myself with a new sense of respect for those who learn and master operation of a manual loom. It&#x27;s not a trivial task.<p>Still haven&#x27;t been able to figure out what a &quot;differential sett&quot; is. Searching with quotes on google finds a bunch of stuff talking about &#x27;&quot;differential sett&quot;lement&#x27;. Best guess is that it has something to do with using a number of threads per inch that is different from what is set on the read, or differs across the length of the warp.')
