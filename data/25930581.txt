We wanted to prove that an idea would or would not work in a small amount of time, which happily overlapped with the fact that the target environment for the device wouldn&#x27;t require long periods of battery life.  I&#x27;m happy to say that the project was a success so who knows, maybe one day we&#x27;ll have someone port it to C and continue from there.<p>Sorry I can&#x27;t be more specific.')
