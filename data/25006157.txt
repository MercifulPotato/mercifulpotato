As an expat in a non-english speaking country myself, I have just one piece of advice: if you are considering moving to a foreign country and you don&#x27;t speak the language, start learning it the moment you have taken the decision to move.<p>Think of it like playing a game: no language = hard mode, no access to hidden quests, always stuck in the low tier. language = medium mode, access to all the maps, NPCs are friendlier.<p>In my experience, based on how hard the language is, you will see great results after investing 500-600 hours into it.')
