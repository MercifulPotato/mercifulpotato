But that chip probably cost more than the entire laptop with an M1 in it.<p>Apple started at the bottom of their lineup. Given the performance of the processor compared not only to the processors that it replaces but to others higher in their lineups, it’s extremely impressive.<p>Is it the absolute number one best in every metric on the planet? No. But you shouldn’t expect that part in a $999 laptop.<p>This was their first try, in the low end.
