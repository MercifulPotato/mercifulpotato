You don&#x27;t need facebook to create an encrypted communications channel. You don&#x27;t need facebook to reach a wide audience either. Honestly, these days it&#x27;s better not to fly under recognizable brand names or logos because your movement can be easily hijacked by anyone downloading those symbols and reproducing them in different contexts.<p>It seems the way moving forward will be &quot;crypto-activism&quot; where key individuals distribute information through end-to-end encrypted messaging channels; when they act in the public eye, it will not be obvious that they are affiliated with an organized group. In this way their actions will appear to represent &quot;the will of the people&quot; rather than the agenda of a  single organization and it will also shield the organization itself from misinformation.<p>Just my two cents based on what I observed this year.')
