I mean we know how everything in chemistry, biology, etc. definitely DOES simply &#x27;emerge&#x27; with no &#x27;programming&#x27;.<p>People just hear &quot;Sim&quot; and hey think of the &quot;Sims&quot; game. It&#x27;s not like that. Our &#x27;creator&#x27; (Sim programmer) likely didn&#x27;t even know what any of the life forms would even look like on any specific habitable planet, nor how many planets would even form, etc. prior to &#x27;running it&#x27;.<p>And it&#x27;s even [dare I say] likely, that if we are in a simulated universe it may be the N-trillionth one, and the programmer just finally stumbled across the correct values for the fundamental Standard Model charges, masses, spins, that can result in a stable universe. We do know it&#x27;s fine tuned, but we don&#x27;t know if the tuning is purely Anthropic Principle or from many iterations.')
