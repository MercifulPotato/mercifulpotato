An universal society means we can all understand and get along with each other.<p>To a large extent, we already enjoy it. I&#x27;m Polish, but I spend most my day (and by now, I spent half my life) dealing with people from all around the world, I consume predominantly American media, waste my time on an American message board, and hell, I know more about US laws and politics than about my own... and the same is true to quite a large chunk of people on the Internet. A subset of these characteristics is true to a good part, perhaps the majority, of the people living in Western countries.<p>We&#x27;re all living and breathing universal culture to a smaller or larger extent. Might as well have our organizational structures catch up with this reality.')
