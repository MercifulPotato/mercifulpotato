There&#x27;s huge uncertainty how large these effects are, but they&#x27;re significant.<p>Water vapor emissions aren&#x27;t cumulative in the same way as CO2.  It would be potentially an impact of what ever level of air travel you have, but it wouldn&#x27;t accumulate over time like carbon emissions, and so could be sustainable if air travel is held at a fixed level.')
