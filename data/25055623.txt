Imagine opening a command prompt, launching vscode from it and doing a yarn&#x2F;npm&#x2F;nuget&#x2F;pip install; this craps thousands of files for various &quot;caches&quot; and unconfigurable &quot;install roots&quot; and so on.\nI think a light-weight Docker for Windows would be great for this actually, but even a simple solution that builds on top of container.dll (or similar technology) to virtualize the file system would be very welcome.')
