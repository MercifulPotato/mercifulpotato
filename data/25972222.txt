UBI is <i>simple</i>. It’s impact is therefore easily measurable.<p>It’s self-regulating if you believe that the taxpayer will be incredibly sensitive to systemic abuse because they know they’re fundamentally paying a fixed amount directly. If abuse were becoming a problem, the public would express their distaste at the polls.<p>It also frees up a lot of people to pursue ideas they might otherwise be prevented from exploring, which could have outsized macroeconomic benefits.')
