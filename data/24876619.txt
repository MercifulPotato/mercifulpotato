Also they stole the name from GE&#x27;s old internal social network.<p>That latter one, at least, was not entirely serious criticism.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that even Colab is an unmitigated win for the company, it does definitely have &quot;that AWS feeling&quot; of an internal tool that was made a product without really retooling it for that purpose thoroughly. This has kind of become the norm in cloud platforms, though.')
