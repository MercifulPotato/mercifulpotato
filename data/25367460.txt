You talk to enough of them, they can’t tell why a stock goes up or down. They point to this double top or flag pattern and say yeah you need to buy now.  They get “tips” from someone at a stock board and buy or sell.  It’s very very close to what the late 99s look like.  Robinhood helped them along for sure but is not all their fault')
