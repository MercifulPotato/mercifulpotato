I’ll either take my bicycle or a motorcycle. (Both of which can be fun - wheelies on either are great!)<p>The in person meetings were more frequent for me because I could just stop by a persons desk to see how they were doing. I can’t do that online and the culture is much more closed down. Forget about going offsite to get lunch and really hear how things are. No weekly basketball games with various people from other departments to see what’s brewing.<p>There are plenty of benefits to the office and I would like them to still exist. And they won’t as soon as you go remote because they rely on everyone being in one area. If you go remote, chances of seeing anyone in person will fall off a cliff compared to office life.<p>I’ve made some of my best friends through work and I plan to continue doing that.')
