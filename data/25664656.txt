If someone dies from flu, it&#x27;s generally not because of lack of available care. When hospital capacity is overwhelmed, people die that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise die. If covid overwhelms hospital capacity, then people will die because of lack of available care. And so therefore, people dying from lack of available care is valued as &quot;worse&quot; than people dying <i>with</i> sufficient medical care.<p>And so if you equate the two, a lot of people think that is crazy.')
