For convenience, we&#x27;ll say that groups of people with those markers are &quot;of European descent&quot;.<p>The extent of the over-representation is so great that edge cases are likely to have no impact in changing the overall bias of the data.<p>As such, conclusions drawn globally should be treated at least with caution - and with suspicion when one of those genetic markers is highly relevant to the conclusion.')
