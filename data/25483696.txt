I don&#x27;t have too many people on it, but I&#x27;ve run my own server for about a year and a half now and I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever. Throw it on a VM if you have one lying around, and if not you can always spin up a new one and use it for any other services you want to host in the future.')
