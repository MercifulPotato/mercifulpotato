It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, &#x27;I AM HODLING.&#x27;[2] It is often backronymed to &#x27;hold on for dear life&#x27;.[3] In 2017, Quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in Bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, &#x27;to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices.&#x27;[4] TheStreet.com referred to it as the &#x27;favorite mantra&#x27; of Bitcoin holders.[5] Bloomberg News referred to it as a &#x27;mantra&#x27; for holders during market routs.[6]&quot;')
