He was also involved in (and wrote the screenplay for) the Johnny Mnemonic movie, which was one of the blandest attempts at mainstreaming cyberpunk ever.<p>The Japanese stereotypes and Haitian gangs are lifted straight off the pages of Neuromancer and Count Zero. I dig the retrofuturist 80s vibe, but then I love retrofuturism in general so that&#x27;s not surprising.<p>In the end, CP2077 is a AAA video game. It has to appeal to the general population, so yeah, it&#x27;s probably not going to be the most experimental take on the genre. As mainstream cyberpunk attempts go, can we at least agree it&#x27;s heads-and-shoulders better than Netflix&#x27;s Altered Carbon? :)')
