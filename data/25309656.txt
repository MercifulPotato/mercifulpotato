Tony was a little to &#x27;anarchistic&#x27; for Forbes. Key phrase:<p>&quot;He experimented with a revolutionary—some would say anarchistic—version of a “holacracy” management philosophy, where no one at Zappos reported to anyone nor carried any titles. (It didn’t work: One out of seven employees took a buyout.)&quot;<p>It didn&#x27;t work? Really? Company was and is doing fine after 17% took advantage of a nice buyout.<p>The bias in the article is obvious - some clips:<p>&quot;while Hsieh remained an extremely rich Peter Pan&quot;, or<p>his &quot;fatal trait&quot; of &quot;not wanting to be alone&quot;<p>Sure, it sounds like Tony was off the rails, and it ended in tragedy. But this hatchet job is not necessary. Just the facts please.')
