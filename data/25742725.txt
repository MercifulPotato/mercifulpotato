With the amount of information available to us nowadays, you should be able to find many interesting objects.<p>The first time I got to try using a telescope (the day a friend bought one), the very first object I saw was Saturn and seeing the rings with my own eyes was a very different experience than knowing they exist or having seen picture of them.')
