I don&#x27;t know much about biology but I do know statistics. And many of their published results smelled of p-hacking[^1] by cherry-picking the best countries and the best (often accidental!) vaccination regime. Well credentialed people don&#x27;t actively criticize it because despite those statistical issues, the vaccine is likely still 60-70% effective which is a big deal. But! If the stats side of the house is a clown show, it hurts my confidence in the entire house, especially when BioNTech and Moderna have been great in this respect.<p>[1]: Perhaps not in the typical sense of &quot;getting a statistically significant result&quot; but in the closely related sense of &quot;getting a larger effect size')
