I&#x27;m one of the Snowdrift.coop cofounders.<p>Finding a sustainable funding model for free&#x2F;libre&#x2F;open (FLO) software is a perennial topic on HN. Snowdrift.coop is one such attempt. We are hopeful that we may succeed where [others] have failed due to our novel mechanism, Crowdmatching. It is described in the post, but in short it&#x27;s a matching pledge that combines the best of Patreon and Kickstarter.<p>One of the larger challenges is communicating the scope of our vision. &quot;Sustainable funding&quot; to us doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;maintaining the status quo, but with less burnout&quot;, it means FLO software [out]competing its proprietary counterparts; longer-term, we plan to support other public goods, not only software.<p>We&#x27;ve been around since 2014 (before Patreon!), slowly working toward launch. It has been a long journey, [in part] because of the ethical standards we&#x27;ve held ourselves to — we also use exclusively FLO tools (with one compromise: using gitlab.com) and operate as a non-profit cooperative (no conflict of interest between VC and the public benefit). But we&#x27;re finally near the home stretch, and expect to launch Soon…<p>The irony isn&#x27;t lost on us, that Snowdrift.coop struggles with the same issues we&#x27;re looking to solve. Without reliable funding, we rely primarily (currently 100%) on volunteers, which means that progress is inconsistent, based on availability. That&#x27;s one of the reasons why we&#x27;re asking to be included on the FSF&#x27;s High Priority Projects list — additional help could make the difference between launching &quot;Soon&quot; in 2 years vs 2 months. It&#x27;s also the reason why Snowdrift.coop ought to be on the list — almost every FLO project struggles with this.<p>Our scope is wide enough that there&#x27;s room for any skill set, but we can particularly use help with frontend development (especialy css), finalizing our organizational&#x2F;legal structure (especially 501(c)(3) issues), and project management &#x2F; organization.<p>I&#x27;ll do my best to answer follow-up questions (while trying to balance time spent on HN vs getting any work done today).<p>[others]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.snowdrift.coop&#x2F;market-research&#x2F;other-crowdfunding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.snowdrift.coop&#x2F;market-research&#x2F;other-crowdfundi...</a><p>[in part]: the other parts are the regular challenges that any organization faces; the Snowdrift.coop team is working on this because we care, not because we have the most experience running a fully remote, global team.')
