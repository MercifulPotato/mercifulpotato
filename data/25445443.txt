That protein is produced by fetuses in the womb but usually shuts off shortly after birth.</i><p><i>The patients then undergo a grueling round of chemotherapy to destroy most of their bone marrow to make room for the gene-edited cells, billions of which are then infused into their bodies.</i><p>This means that it wasn&#x27;t in vivo modification, which would be truly revolutionary for many genetic diseases.<p>Still, it&#x27;s spectacular progress that will help millions eventually.')
