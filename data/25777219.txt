The controllers arent near capable of driving the led count.<p>The promised 25,000 mini LEDs turned out to be less than 1000 zones, and even then the controller was horribly laggy and poorly implemented giving a far worse experience than a properly implemented ~40 zone tv. And it costs more.<p>Micro led would be interesting where every pixel is it&#x27;s own led, without pixel burnin like oleds suffer from, but that seems far off if ever practical.<p>Oled seems like it will remain king for a while.')
