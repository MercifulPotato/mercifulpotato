The towers of theorems must be a graph, right? So shouldn&#x27;t I be able to say &quot;I want to understand Calabiâ€“Yau manifolds&quot; and get a custom-made exercise set all the way down to set theory?<p>Add an invertible &quot;examples&quot; generator so examples can become exercises and keep track of all the exercises you&#x27;ve already done (perhaps with some kind of spaced-repetition system built in) and you can just keep &quot;fleshing out&quot; your own graph of practiced math knowledge starting with wherever you want to look next.')
