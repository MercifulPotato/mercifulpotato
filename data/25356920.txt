It really doesn&#x27;t matter how <i>easy</i> it would be for them to provide it.  They&#x27;re also probably not providing RSS, though you may want them to, and that would be easy too.  Sorry your pet thing is not prioritized.<p>Personally, I think a small amount of client-side scripting can <i>vastly</i> improve a user experience, and way too much client-side scripting can vastly deter from it.  It&#x27;s a balance that each site must strike.  And the effort they must go through to test and support all functionality while also supporting completely disabling javascript is definitely nonzero.  Some sites won&#x27;t find that effort worth it.  That&#x27;s the breaks.  I can tell you that I never, ever intend to put any effort into supporting a no-javascript user experience on anything I build in the future.  I could almost see rendering an alternate page that says &quot;you no-JS kooks aren&#x27;t gonna be happy here&quot; but even that is more effort than I care to expend on a militant userbase that&#x27;s likely to also take exception to some silly shit like my html not being semantic enough.')
