Inspired by Google&#x27;s Critique and launched 6 years ago, it has picked up a dedicated following solely through word of mouth and has made inroads into the enterprise market, particularly in the self-driving car vertical.  While GitHub has started improving PR reviews again, they&#x27;re aiming at an 80% solution leaving a lucrative niche in the other 20% for nimbler, more specialized companies like Reviewable.<p>Me:  I built and have been running Reviewable since inception, mostly solo.  I want to find someone to take over leadership of the company and inject new energy and purpose into it, while I get some headspace for new ventures.  I&#x27;ll remain available and involved but step back from the day-to-day decision-making loop.<p>You:  You&#x27;re passionate about code review and intimately familiar with GitHub. \n You&#x27;re a strong engineer with a solid understanding of JavaScript (Vue 2, CSS, Firebase RTDB, Node), not afraid to take over a somewhat idiosyncratic 65+KLoC codebase, and with excellent written communication skills.  You don&#x27;t need anyone to tell you what to do and how to do it, and you&#x27;re looking to stretch yourself into a leadership position without taking on all the risks of starting something from scratch.<p>If this sounds like it could be a good fit for you please get in touch with piotr@reviewable.io.  Thanks!')
