Apple&#x27;s &quot;universal binary&quot; seems dubious, and I don&#x27;t believe Rosetta 2 is anything more than emulation software which will have performance ramifications.<p>Microsoft has faced this same problem themselves. Releasing the Surface Pro X is a great example of a machine that is limited by software.<p>As others have noted in other threads, Apple&#x27;s ability to run iOS apps natively on the M1 chip seems like a great mechanism to lower the switching costs, though I maintain the chasm left to cross is software.<p>This is all of course, notwithstanding the &quot;locked down OS&quot; concerns from the front page for the past day or so. Does an M1 Macbook Air with BigSur make a competent development machine?')
