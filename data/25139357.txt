Simply remove the network connection.<p>As a kid I had a computer and a few precious programming books. I could program, or... not much really. I guess I could have enjoyed WordPerfect.<p>As a parent now, I really need an answer for the remote education. I&#x27;ve tried keeping screens visible to parents. That really limits the parents, who have other things to deal with. Parental availability causes a massive reduction in time for online classes.<p>For reference in case somebody has ideas of a technical nature, mostly I&#x27;m dealing with Chromebooks going via DD-WRT, and I don&#x27;t know much about either. There&#x27;s also Android and Windows 10 and Ubuntu. Problems are web games, pointless videos, and reddit. Classes are at FLVS, EFSC, Khan Academy, and various textbook publishers like Pearson. Class video appears on all the popular video platforms, not counting the NSFW ones.')
