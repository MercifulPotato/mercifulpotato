I firmly believe that hardly any (large) company will be prepared to significantly improve conditions for employees without external pressure - at the expense of shareholder value.<p>For example, it is perfectly normal for a company like Accenture to pay a 10% higher dividend for the past fiscal year, while dismissing 5% of its employees worldwide. We don&#x27;t even have to dream of wage increases for employees in the 10% range here. And ACN is just one example because I happen to know the numbers right now.<p>What company increases its employees&#x27; wages by the same amount as it increases the dividend for shareholders? I hardly know of any company that does that.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=development+productivity+wages+us&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=development+productivity+wages+us&amp;...</a>')
