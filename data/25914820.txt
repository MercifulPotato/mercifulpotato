The lottery is random and has a negative expected value intrinsic to playing. GameStop had already gone up a lot and was in the news even before it doubled on Monday. Same for Tesla. Both had ample opportunism for people to invest&#x2F;speculate. It is more like, imagine a sequence of lotto tickets being drawn, and you observe that the numbers happen to follow a predictable pattern despite it otherwise assumed to be random. Surely, it would not be unreasonable to assume the pattern would continue, and if did continue, you would probably regret not buying anyway despite otherwise being conditioned to believe that it is random. Do you trust your eyes or your preconceived beliefs? If you see a dollar on the sidewalk (or in the case of GameStop, a Zero Halliburton suitcase full of $100s from call options)  and you tell yourself that this is economically impossible, and as you are pondering this, someone snaps up the dollar, you would probably feel miffed.')
