I think the key point here is this:<p>&gt; &quot;This workflow is consistent across any platform, including Kubernetes, Nomad, EC2, Google Cloud Run, and over a dozen more at launch. Waypoint can be extended with plugins to target any build&#x2F;deploy&#x2F;release logic.&quot;<p>It makes a lot of sense. You provision your infrastructure with Terraform and deploy with Waypoint. This is basically Terraform but for Deployments.<p>I think that&#x27;s pretty cool. I&#x27;m wondering how clever is this though. If I have something running locally a deploy with Waypoint do they figure out all the configuration automatically?<p>One big challenge that I have always had with fresh deployments into new environments it&#x27;s making them work out of the box. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I have deployed something without having to change a configuration or mess with the command line of my host to make it work.')
