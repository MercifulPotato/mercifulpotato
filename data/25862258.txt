Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s housing, dentistry, food stamps, etc.  People were abusing the disability program, so we made a bunch of hurdles to get funding.  Now there&#x27;s companies who train you how to get over those hurdles: what to write on the forms, what to say to your doctor, etc.  And guess what?  The companies that train you what to say to get disability then get to bill the government for this new service they provided you.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s easy to imagine their incentives.')
