Would you like to know how much emissions reduction has come from voluntary impact reduction?  Zero.  Nothing.  The inconsequential fraction of a fraction of people who are willing to significantly inconvenience themselves for others means nothing.  Imposing your will upon everyone else to enforce restrictions may sound appealing, but that is never going to happen.  So now what?<p>The people looking for tech solutions will try to think their way out of the problem.  Need to reduce CO2?  Ok, here is cheap solar and improved battery tech.  Horizontal drilling and fracking to deliver cheap natural gas and drive coal out of the market. Modular nuclear and next gen geothermal. Electric cars and smart metering.  It is interesting to be sitting in Europe where everyone talks about solutions but accomplish nothing, while tech advancements allowed the US to reduce CO2 emissions to levels last seen almost 30 years ago.<p>It seems to me that people looking for tech solutions are the only ones making progress on the problem of climate change, and doing so in a way that means they might be able to create substitutes that allow everyone else to continue in oblivious denial without noticing that their climate impact is reducing.  I think there is a lot to criticize and object to in tech solutions to these problems, but assuming that any other group is actually going to solve the problem seems to deny reality.')
