I&#x27;m totally down with that.<p>What was commenting on here was a wider remark that celebrities should just avoid making political comments in general. &quot;He&#x27;s a football player, he should just play football. Keep politics out of sports.&quot;<p>This is the part I find unfair. If Kanye West has an opinion on global warming, we shouldn&#x27;t reject it by default. If it&#x27;s harmful, we should criticize it proportionaly to the reach of his platform (so... A lot). And if the negative effects get out of hand, we should be educating people on getting their environmental information from reliable sources, not limiting Kanye&#x27;s freedom of speech.')
