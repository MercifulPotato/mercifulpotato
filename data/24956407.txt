A well-insulated vat of salt is cheap, can be made arbitrarily large, and will hold heat over a 24 hour period with reasonable efficiency. So you store the heat during below-average demand and use it to generate extra electricity during above-average demand.<p>But the same solution also makes solar interesting again when it&#x27;s used in combination, because you can store heat from nuclear during the times when solar is generating and then use it during the times when it isn&#x27;t.')
