A lot of the money that comes in is basically automatic, it&#x27;s being produced by ad sells and stuff like that. You&#x27;d need a massive subset of the company&#x27;s staff to go on strike (not just 1200) before that would have any impact on whether the money-making machine continues to function. In a case like this walkouts or strikes by the tech workers have more of a symbolic purpose + impact on <i>future</i> deadlines&#x2F;releases than a direct impact on revenue.<p>Maybe if the entire SRE department went on strike and stopped maintaining the datacenters that would put a dent in the numbers due to degraded service, but something like <i>that</i> would probably just doom the company entirely even if they went back to work after a bit.')
