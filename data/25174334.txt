I haven&#x27;t tried qtwayland and some of the others mentioned and will give them a run out. I didn&#x27;t have any problems on Arch but for some reason Weston wouldn&#x27;t build on GuixSD which I am also exploring.<p>One fun part was having to use the flag --my-next-gpu-will-not-be-nvidia to invoke wayland against Nvidia drivers. It isn&#x27;t supported and promptly crashes anyway. I was glad I had a Radeon gpu also installed, on which I continue a most satisfactory exploration.')
