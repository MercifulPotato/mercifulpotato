They are very similar weight and while the Pocket has a larger footprint, it&#x27;s not a big difference. If you can throw a Win 2 into your bag, chances are a Pocket 2 will fit too and not make the bag feel any heavier.<p>The Win 2 may be <i>slightly</i> more pocketable, but except for short periods I wouldn&#x27;t pocket either of them except in cargo pants or jackets, and in those, either will fit.<p>The real difference between them is whether or not they are made to be used primarily on a tabletop (Pocket) or handheld (Win&#x2F;Pyra), and arguably the Win line is not primarily made for productivity, so the keyboard is quite secondary.<p>Finally, I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the Pyra&#x27;s keyboard since I have never handled one, but I haven&#x27;t had any issue with Win 2&#x27;s considering it&#x27;s use case for me is mostly limited to the kind of things you&#x27;d use a on-screen keyboard for in a gaming console.')
