Outside of very specific drills I picked one weight setting and stuck with it. If I wanted to vary the difficulty I just rowed faster.<p>I don&#x27;t think varying the weight is good for your form and it could be dangerous for your back if your form is bad. After all, you can&#x27;t vary the resistance of water in a real boat (I suppose you could pour gelatin in a lake). Intensity could be varied just by changing the stroke rate.')
