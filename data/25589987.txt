An appreciation for what&#x27;s theoretically possible is always useful, but I will hire, promote, and throw money at people who can deliver a 75% solution to a problem with 90% confidence. I will struggle with people who aim for 100% solutions that never materialise.<p>I don&#x27;t think that I (as a younger programmer or if I&#x27;m honest even quite recently) would want to hear this, from my future self or anyone else, but I would have been happier accepting it early in my career.')
