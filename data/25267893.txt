I know, LightSail is still AWS.  But it&#x27;s not going to automatically increase the bill by 300% because someone accidentally toggled something in AWS&#x27;s byzantine admin console.<p>When (&quot;if&quot; is more often the case) that client starts to see the kinds of traffic that necessitates a full-scale AWS build out then I&#x27;ll advise them of their options.  By that point, they&#x27;re actually generating real revenue and, as importantly, they didn&#x27;t pay me to prematurely optimize a product that wasn&#x27;t yet generating any revenue, which helped them succeed.')
