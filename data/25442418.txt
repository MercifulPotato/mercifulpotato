I know a lot of people doing small businesses that use FB for marketing, yet if you were to ask them how FB works, they wouldn&#x27;t have a clue. They see the interface, not the implementation.<p>Their interests are aligned in one way, both benefit from being able to find customers. But in another way, there&#x27;s a principal-agent problem. FB negotiates with the shops for their cut of the pie, with a fair degree of power. They&#x27;re also one of the few entities large enough to lobby government, which they can do for both or for themselves.')
