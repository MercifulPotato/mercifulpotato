In exact real arithmetic, there cannot exist an algorithm that will find an $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$ even if such an $x$ exists and $f$ is computable. At least not unless you make some further assumptions about $f$ and $x$.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m talking about the worst case. Your example is easier.')
