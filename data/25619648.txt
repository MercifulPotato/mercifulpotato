When you don&#x27;t know a language well enough to write really gross things that work &quot;for now&quot;, you have to think carefully about the simplest possible solution to a problem that you can express clearly in an unfamiliar language.<p>I have the opposite experience, the worst performance bottle necks I have had to trouble shoot are from principal engineers (and tech leads)  that use medium to high level abstractions in a ruby on rails that don&#x27;t actually understand what how many sql commands they are triggering by writing clever one liners that taco my db, from a rails 2.4 method that has a much better rails 5 system they don&#x27;t know about.')
