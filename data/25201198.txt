The really important point here is that it&#x27;s quite possible OP is right and did exactly the right stuff well but didn&#x27;t communicate it well enough to stakeholders.<p>It&#x27;s also <i>possible</i> that OP was not doing what the business needed -- <i>or</i> was not doing what the stakeholders&#x2F;leadership <i>thought</i> the business needed. People can disagree on this, but in the end it&#x27;s leadership&#x27;s opinion that you&#x27;ll get evaluated on. You can try to convince leadership only if you are in dialog with them.<p>So, how would you even tell the difference between whether you were doing what stakeholders prioritized but not communicating your successes well enough, or mistakenly not actually doing what was prioritized by stakeholders&#x2F;leadership?<p>the solution to this is going to be related to the solution to communicating successes effectively.<p>And to be clear, this is actually a hard problem, you are not alone OP, I&#x27;ve been there. In the best case, as an engineer, my manager takes care of this for me, translating business priorities to my work and advertising my successes at implementing those priorities back out. But we seldom get a best-case manager.')
