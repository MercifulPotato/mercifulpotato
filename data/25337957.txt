The system&#x27;s carefully selected constraints give developers just the right guardrails. They make it obvious whether a choice is good or bad by offering only discrete steps.<p>Can anyone comment more on this? As far as I see, there&#x27;s still a big enough range of font sizes, padding&#x2F;margin sizes, colours etc. that you still have to have an eye for design for the result to look pleasing. I&#x27;ve seen multiple landing pages made in Tailwind for example that don&#x27;t look good.<p>Bootstrap in comparison will have a really uniform look if you use the built-in components, but you won&#x27;t be able to build something that looks as good as Tailwind.')
