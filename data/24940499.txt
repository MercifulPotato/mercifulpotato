If you change my mind, I&#x27;ll go try to change other people&#x27;s minds.<p>&quot;The Hunter Biden documents have at least as much verification as those other archives [the Panama Papers, Wikileaks war logs, Podesta &#x2F; DNC emails from 2016] that were widely reported. There are sources in the email chains who have verified that the published emails are accurate. The archive contains private photos and videos of Hunter whose authenticity is not in doubt. A former business partner of Hunter has stated, unequivocally and on the record, that not only are the emails authentic but they describe events accurately, including proposed participation by the former Vice President in at least one deal Hunter and Jim Biden were pursuing in China. And, most importantly of all, neither Hunter Biden nor the Biden campaign has even suggested, let alone claimed, that a single email or text is fake.&quot;<p>Add to that that at least one email has had its DKIM signature verified (see the link above).<p>I hate Trump and think a second term would be an unmitigated disaster for our democracy.  Even if the worst of the allegations or insinuations were true I think Biden would be better for our country than Trump.  If I were an editor of a newspaper, I&#x27;d certainly think twice before publishing something like this, even if I thought they were accurate.<p>But I would never throw shade on a fellow journalist for writing something like this.  And as a voter, if I&#x27;m going to choose the lesser of two evils, I want to know just how evil the lesser one is.')
