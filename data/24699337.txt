I choose to live frugally so I can drop jobs when I find projects that interest me more than whatever I&#x27;m doing at the time.<p>For example I have spent the last week reading a very interesting book on transcendental number theory which is completely pointless for any job but has given me a lot more satisfaction than trying the latest ethnic fusion $500 a plate cuisine my peers seem to go insane over.
