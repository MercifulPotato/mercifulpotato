Starlark doesn&#x27;t (or at least didn&#x27;t originally) support recursion or while loops or a number of other structures. There&#x27;s also a few other differences that make starlark &quot;better&quot; for configs (some immutability is different, there&#x27;s no such thing as a `class`, etc.)<p>I still support loops in a configuration language<p><pre><code>    for x in sequence:\n      generate_complex_thing(x)\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    [generate_complex_thing(x) for x in seq]\n</code></pre>\nare better than a lot of the more declarative approaches (such as the various contextual approaches of a number of alternative langs) which get hard to reason about because they represent implicit global state.')
