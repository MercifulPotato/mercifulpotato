But being honest, Arch upgrades are transparent. For example I never got crashes or similar issues upgrading from Arch OS&#x2F;Kernel dependencies in my daily basis desktop. The issues that I have only faced were with few dependencies coming from the AUR channel that I have installed on demand.\nSo it&#x27;s not a &quot;crazy&quot; idea to consider to give a try ArchLinux for server-side stuff. Not in 2020.<p>&gt; I very much like the process of steadily keeping up to date bit by bit, instead of stagnating on a stable base and doing a big bang update every few years. I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t need to know which version of which release am I going to get, it&#x27;s always the latest one and it&#x27;s the one that upstream released.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s also the motivation of this thread from my side.\nIn fact, moving between majors for example has also &quot;risks&quot; to tackle (E.g CentOS 6 to 7 to 8). You know, things that you need to take time to evaluate and test. But in the other hand, having rolling release upgrades makes that headache disappears.<p>So IMO I believe the Arch <i>rolling release approach</i> will be the next way to upgrade our software on a non-distant future.\nIt&#x27;s time to try out and test ArchLinux on hot places like servers.')
