It smells and looks like halting trading because their owners didn&#x27;t like the result.<p>Maybe the lawsuit will fail, but they will obviously take a giant reputational hit and it is fascinating to me that they chose to do that. What is the upside? The only thing that makes sense to me is that the owners of Robinhood have too much conflict of interest with the hedge funds that were losing money (and so are acting <i>against</i> the best interests of Robinhood itself in favor of their funders).<p>Alternatively, maybe they&#x27;re being honest about it and what&#x27;s going on at this point has nothing to do with hedge funds and everything to do with what appears to be a scheme to pump up the price and the people that are controlling the narrative sell first.<p>It&#x27;s unclear what hedge fund is getting it stuck to them at this point, didn&#x27;t they say they covered their position already?<p>If that is true, then it really does start to look like what started as an interesting way to penalize hedge funds doing this has turned into a bitcoin-style bubble. Which can also be a useful point to make, but a point that is completely disconnected from the desire to screw over hedge funds.')
