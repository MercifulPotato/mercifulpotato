Item(by='clolege', descendants=None, kids=[25360865], score=None, time=1607439634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345408, text='Right - I gifted a pair of MDR7506s to my girlfriend the other day.<p>I love that they include an insert telling you exactly how to take the entire headphone apart - I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve owned a pair like that before.<p>But, I broke out my B&amp;O H6s to do an A&#x2F;B test after giving them to her, and I think it was a mistake? The H6s are of course in the next higher price price bracket, but the 7506s did not compare musically to them at all.<p>As much as I appreciate the repairability of the 7506s, I think would recommend something a bit more musical as a daily driver.')
