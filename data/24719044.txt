But the Unite the Right rally and posters were full of actual Nazi symbols. There were enough Nazi and white power symbols that anyone marching there is either:<p>1. Anti white supremacist and Anti Nazi, but VERY dumb or very unobservant.<p>2. Anti white supremacist and Anti Nazi, but believe that \nsaving a statue is worth marching in a rally on the same side as a large number of self professed Nazis.<p>3. A white supremist and&#x2F;or Nazi.<p>This wasn&#x27;t a case of a few white supremacist sneaking into an otherwise unrelated event. A large percentage of the crowd was chanting overtly racist slogans and flying overtly racist flags (even ignoring the confederate battle flags). No one there was confused about what was happening. None of the people marching on the Unite the Right side were &quot;very fine people.&quot;')
