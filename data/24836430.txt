Item(by='stchacademy', descendants=None, kids=[24836464], score=None, time=1603196324, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836360, text='Well, the main difference is that - although we do use strings (for files, urls, etc) - the appropriate datatypes are constructed implicitly, that is: no need for newFile(&quot;someFile&quot;) or %someFile. &quot;someFile&quot;, if it <i>is</i> a file path, will be automatically handled as such. If it is a url, accordingly.<p>The point is to keep the syntax clean. (Ok, that would be an argument of going all the way, like Tcl, where everything ends up being a string - but let&#x27;s just get the best of every world without overdoing it :) )')
