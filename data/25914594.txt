Why can&#x27;t I just buy something and own it without needing to provide recurring monthly revenue to the company who sold me the thing? Rowing is boring, but I solved that for myself with a pair of headphones and a podcast. I have a hard time imagining rowing based games being as interesting (though I did like the concept of your pros versus Joe&#x27;s).<p>All said, obviously people do pay subscriptions for stuff like this so best of luck to you and congratulations on your success!')
