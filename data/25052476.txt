E.g. they enroll people in mechanical turk. They claim it&#x27;s similar to a Nielsen group but I don&#x27;t buy it. We do truly random surveys delivered in mobile ads. Can&#x27;t ask nearly as many questions but I think it&#x27;s one of the best ways to currently get a large truly representative sample')
