Item(by='masklinn', descendants=None, kids=[25129705], score=None, time=1605645425, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128658, text='&gt; Sounds like they blacklisted things likely to clutter up the comment threads and left things unlikely to be used.<p>That’s not really believable given how arbitrary it is.<p>&gt; Die faces could lead to weird rolling threads or other things.<p>As if tiles or playing cards could not be used that way.<p>&gt; The markup&#x27;s not great, but too much formatting is distracting.<p>The problem is that despite having only two directives half of HN’s markup is actively detrimental: because there is no escaping, no inline literals, and the parsing is sub-par, in my experience the “emphasis” directive causes issues more often than it helps. HN’s markup would be significantly improved by removing it entirely.<p>&gt; I really can&#x27;t stand when people use those for quotes<p>Which would be way less likely if HN actually supported quotes.')
