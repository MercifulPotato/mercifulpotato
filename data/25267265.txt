That would be reminiscent of many past macOS security issues: processes are treated differently based on their code signature and entitlements, and sometimes that has unexpected consequences.<p>But that&#x27;s not the case here.  &#x2F;bin&#x2F;ls has no entitlements.  And if I modify the sample project to just call stat() directly rather than invoking ls, it still works.<p>So it&#x27;s really a kernel issue where for some reason filesystem metadata is not being protected as much as the actual data.')
