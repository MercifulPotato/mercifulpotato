[snip 20th century bad stuff]. Most of that stuff is now under control and probably will be for your kid&#x27;s entire life. There&#x27;s no chance global warming will be anywhere near as bad as many of those things for anyone alive today.*<p>Umm. I&#x27;m pretty sure that drought, mega storms, wildfires, famine, and mass migrations of refugee populations (just to start) will spawn horrors in the 21st century at least as bad.<p>I mean, consider that some of the worst events in the 20th were essentially triggered by the great depression. As a civilization, we&#x27;re going to have to withstand stressors far more severe than that before the 21st century is out.')
