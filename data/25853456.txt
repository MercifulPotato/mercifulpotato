I don&#x27;t see why it should stop because someone else moved in. A neighborhood is not a fixed, static thing. I understand that this is an unusual, uncommon, and perhaps even uniquely privileged perspective.<p>When my neighbors resist change in a way that forces change elsewhere or affects our entire city, those effects are real. These outcomes affect other people&#x27;s real lives in real ways. It&#x27;s very much their skin in the game.<p>Or maybe the people downwind of a coal-burning plant have no skin in the game.')
