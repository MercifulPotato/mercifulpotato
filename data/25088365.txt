Nature has always been dangerous to humans. The Ice Age almost wiped out humanity. And this was before any modern industrial developments or pollution. Plagues have been ravaging humanity for millenia. Mothers and infants died by the millions. Even for other species, most members end their lives either starving to death, or being eaten, many times while they are still alive and sensate.<p>It is humanity learning to control and harness nature that has made us what we are. We learned to get more food that nature would naturally give. We learned to treat diseases. We learned how to control plagues. We learned to control maternal and infant mortality. We learned to fly. We learned to go to space. We learned to tame and control nature for our benefit.<p>For the future, we are going to have to go all in on science and technology. It is our only hope. Harmony with nature is life that is nasty, brutish, and short.')
