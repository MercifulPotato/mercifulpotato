There&#x27;s some tax advantage to keeping them separate.<p>- a checking account for a personal assistant to pay bills from, limited to a few months cash<p>- when living together with separate finances, a household account that you both contribute to with a debit card. Convenient for splitting groceries, home improvement, etc. Otherwise, you have to keep receipts and settle regularly.<p>- if you&#x27;re paying tax to 2 countries with a tax treaty, you may have to prove that you&#x27;ve already been taxed on money you&#x27;re bringing in. It&#x27;s best if you can do that from an account with only a single source of income, or else it gets complicated.')
