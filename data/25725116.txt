Biden under performed in every state except for 5 key swing states and even then it was only a &quot;win&quot; because a never before seen amount of mail in ballots were used. Perhaps they were fake, or perhaps people that would never set foot in a voting place were fine with circling &quot;biden&quot; on a mail in ballot and dropping it back in the mail box. Still against state law either way.<p>Oh and very few ballots were contested due to signature mismatches. Funny because Obama won his senate seat in the 90&#x27;s by having a team canvas all of his competitors primary ballots and had them whittled down until he was the only one running for the office that year.')
