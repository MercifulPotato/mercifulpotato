Seattle today has a mini-version of this FWIW: We have offenders who have 44+ counts of &#x27;minor&#x27; arrests and a felony conviction on the street [1] getting involved in public shootings.<p>Overall I like the part where folks who have paid their dues get their life back through a measured re-introduction back into regular society (from jail). Even over here, we will need oversight from professionals who have insight into both the worlds who can help with the transition. I don&#x27;t think commuting sentences by 90% is the answer.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komonews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;who-are-the-alleged-downtown-seattle-shooters" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;komonews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;who-are-the-alleged-downtown...</a>')
