People who liked&#x2F;supported it said that it was basically a large-scale sit-in like OccupyWallSt which seems to match the photos of it and I think lives firmly on the side of protest. Otherwise more usual protests like street marches, blocking access to government buildings, or occupying streets with cars also become insurrection which doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>Not even trying to play, if the Capitol shit was actually a sit-in a la #OccupyTheCapitol then I would be here defending their right to protest.')
