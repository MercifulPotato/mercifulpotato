That is the situation it would create for small venues like Hacker News-- extreme liability issues and heavy handed moves to mitigate them (if not just a shutdown as would probably be the case for many non-for-profit venues).<p>But Facebook, Google?  These multibillion dollar companies have very little to fear from a lawsuit by the likes of me or you.<p>They could just staff up their legal team and work anyone who sues them into bankruptcy-- they already do.  It isn&#x27;t like litigation against parties for content they post in the US is easy to begin with even when you&#x27;re not going after a 900 lb guerilla.<p>It would be bad news for them but ultimately just a cost of doing business.  It might even ultimately be the best for their businesses as the ability to endure lawsuits would be one hell of a moat.')
