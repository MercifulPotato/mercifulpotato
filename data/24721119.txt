Pipelines solve this with U-shaped segments. Hyperloop can&#x27;t do either, requires something with airtight-enough seals or some expensive materials.<p>At such high speeds as proposed, any sagging is impermissible (again, unlike pipelines). Of course it&#x27;s solved engineering problem but it markedly increases the construction price and complexity.<p>So, no, hyperloop is not really comparable to pipelines.')
