A lot of money! Interest rates in savings accounts and CDs are near-zero, which hurts the poorest most who don’t own inflation-protected assets like houses and equities.<p>One major thing I like about Bitcoin is that anyone can buy small amounts from an app, and even self-custody it themselves. This is similar to gold but much, much easier and because Bitcoin is purely digital you don’t need anything more than an app and an internet connection. Bitcoin is inflation-protection for the global poor, something rich HNers are less likely to appreciate.<p>And I recognize that Bitcoin is extremely volatile, which makes it harder to use as a hedge against inflation. But if you use currency that is guaranteed to lose 30 to 90% of its value per year (Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon) then dollar-cost-averaging into Bitcoin makes way more sense than holding worthless paper.')
