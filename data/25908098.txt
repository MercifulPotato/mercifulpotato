The overall median and mean ages of an EV with their first owner is still way above the decades lasting 3 year ICE mean.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be just an &quot;early adopter effect&quot; as the &quot;neophilia&quot; of &quot;early adopters&quot; you would think would trend the other way to a shorter first owner life.<p>If the increased first owner life of EVs remains as more &quot;normal&quot; people buy in, that implies there may be a major shift in the secondary&#x2F;used markets and that may be fascinating to watch. It might possibly be a hugely surprising (to some) secondary effect of an EV transition. There&#x27;s a lot of jobs in the used market, and such a big shift could disrupt those jobs quite a bit.<p>(I&#x27;ve got a 2012 Chevy Volt myself and don&#x27;t feel a lot of pressure to replace it any time before the 15-year warranty on the drive chain&#x2F;battery. I probably wouldn&#x27;t replace the battery, as the small bit of pressure I do feel is that it is about time to get rid of the compromise of having an ICE generator backup I hardly&#x2F;never use and move to a full proper EV.)')
