You can go try to find another job in the same industry but all the competing companies are going to be looking at doing the same thing because they have to compete on margins and their competition just reduced their labor cost by a factor of 2 to 10.<p>I don&#x27;t know what evidence for this would look like except for all the goods that are manufactured overseas that used to be manufactured domestically. I&#x27;m not making a statistical argument. I&#x27;m making an argument based on life experience and inference. Although life expectancy in the US is declining. Wages are stagnant but that&#x27;s an aggregate over the population. If a 30-year-old worker loses their job and an 18-year-old worker gets hired in a different industry for the same &quot;real wage&quot; then that looks like no change from the perspective of population statistics.')
