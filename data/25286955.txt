Both online and offline.<p>Extremely hard to do intentional humor without hostility, ridicule, some in-group context or plain silliness.<p>Unsolicited humor is also hard to respond to.\nYou can ignore the joke which may be seen as rude.\nYou can go along with it which you may not want to.\nYou can respond in a serious manner which is awkward. Especially awkward when you actually disagree with the point the joke is making.<p>&gt; Sometimes the addition of humor can show just how silly the context is, something that a formal declarative statement cannot.<p>You can reduce something to an absurdity. Which may even make for an amusing statement, but not a humorous one. If the joke is actually making a point there are certainly numerous rhetorical devices to convey it.')
