Can I count the ways?<p>- The Start Menu shows &quot;suggested apps&quot; by default<p>- On first install&#x2F;boot, the Start Menu is preloaded with about 10 sponsored apps, and many of them install automatically even if you don&#x27;t click them.<p>- These sponsored apps have a tendency to reinstall themselves _even after you just uninstalled them_ if you haven&#x27;t rebooted your computer at least once or twice after first boot up.<p>- Microsoft Edge ads appear in the Taskbar at times, Action Center at times, and sometimes when you are changing the default browser to Chrome, and sometimes even after Chrome is default.<p>- Windows Explorer occasionally advertises OneDrive.<p>- Most built-in Windows Apps like Weather, News, and Sports contain lots of built-in ads.<p>- The Mail app comes with an &quot;Upgrade to Office 365&quot; button always visible.<p>- Cortana occasionally pops up by itself to ask if you want to use it. And there are ads in her search results and &quot;suggested apps&quot; from her for you.<p>- The default Lock Screen, &quot;Windows Spotlight,&quot; occasionally advertises games, Microsoft&#x27;s latest political agenda, or Bing when your computer is Locked.<p>- Office 365, on new installs or accounts, has links to _every web app_ on the Start Menu by default.<p>- When adding a user, Microsoft will hide the ability to create a Local account not linked to a Microsoft account under, like, 3 pages of advertising for why Microsoft accounts are awesome.<p>- The new Settings app has a new header that is in A-B testing right now, which (among other things) has a big obvious link _in the Settings app_ to Bing&#x2F;Microsoft Rewards.<p>- Microsoft Edge has, by default, the entirety of MSN as your New Tab page and your Homepage. Plenty of ads on that, and worse, they serve ads from Taboola and Outbrain. Those types of ads with &quot;You won&#x27;t believe what celebrity XYZ...&quot; or &quot;Take this 2 minute quiz to learn...&quot; kind of junk. (In fact, all of the built-in Windows apps seem to serve Taboola&#x2F;Outbrain. You just want to check the Weather!)<p>- If you are not signed into OneDrive, OneDrive will inform you of this fact _every single time_ you log in with a giant error message.<p>- If you are not signed into Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Teams will inform you of this fact _every single time_ you log in with an Office 365 Sign-in dialog. It frequently fights with OneDrive to see who can make you sign in first.<p>- The operating system will sometimes randomly pop up with messages from &quot;Windows Tips.&quot; While (theoretically) making the experience nicer for new users, the actual Tips app is pretty barebones and really motivates people to click a button to &quot;Learn More&quot;... using Bing search.<p>- If you want to use Google as default search engine on Microsoft Edge instead of Bing, that is a.) extremely nested deep in the UI and hard to find, and b.) if you do manage to find it, there&#x27;s a three-section ad explaining the &quot;benefits of Bing.&quot;<p>And there&#x27;s still stuff I&#x27;m forgetting.')
