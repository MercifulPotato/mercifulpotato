It&#x27;s telling that it was the USA after the war that played up Japan&#x27;s aggression in China. Now the invasion was bad, but was it unique in its brutality? The 1850s civil war in China was way worse.<p>Why the lack of focus on Europeans not apologizing for what they did in Asia&#x2F;China?\nWhy the bombardment of films about the evil Japanese invading but not the Europeans?<p>I&#x27;ve seen anti-japanese posters in China never seen anything on Europeans.')
