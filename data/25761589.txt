Though the law does seem to pick a few different age groups for other things based on a seemingly arbitrary standard.  Lower for driving, even though bad driving could kill innocent bystanders.  Higher for smoking, even though smoking only kills yourself.  You can even sign up and join the military a year before you are able to vote for the politicians who control it.')
