I took statins for about two weeks and started getting weird muscle pains and aches which resolved within 2-3 days after ending treatment. I didn&#x27;t even know that muscle pains were a potential side effect until I brought it up with my doctor. I take several drugs, and statins are the only one which have brought on notable physical symptoms; so I find it unlikely that this is &quot;all in my head&quot;, because I&#x27;m not mentally paying attention to what individual drugs are doing to my body. I find this reporting to be so irresponsible that it is borderline unethical in my opinion.')
