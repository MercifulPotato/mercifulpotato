I see it this way - whatever you do at your current job might be very specific to your current tech-stack&#x2F;product&#x2F;problem-domain&#x2F;team&#x2F;company. When you&#x27;re looking for a new job, you can&#x27;t possibly learn the stack or problem domain of each and every company that you will interview with. In that sense it&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re assessed on more general skills like data structures and algorithms. Those few weekends of brushing up on skills you had anyway allow you to apply for a wide range of jobs. You then pick a new job and specialise in it until the next time you need to switch. Sounds healthier than most of the alternatives.')
