It&#x27;s also used in America whenever prosecutors &#x2F; prison operators want to &quot;send a message.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s great value in keeping a population cowed when a small percentage of them can recount the horrors they&#x27;ve suffered for disobedience to authority. Execution is only reserved for actual threats to the regime, and the odd show trial.')
