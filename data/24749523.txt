I&#x27;ve been getting update popups for a while, but previous experiences updating Ubuntu versions has left me with problems and I haven&#x27;t really felt like going through the efforts of a fresh install yet, but i&#x27;ve been noticing it&#x27;s harder and harder to find working packages for updated software or even for me to be able to build the newest versions of some apps due to being stuck on older versions of libraries.<p>The thing is, older software not updated since before 2016 tends to also be problematic due to older versions of libraries being unavailable.<p>It feels like being stuck in a snapshot in time roughly 4 years or so from the release date of my distro.<p>It&#x27;s getting to the point where the hassle of updating is looking to be more appealing than trying to keep dealing with the hassle of library problems with everything I find not made specifically for libraries available from 2016 to nowish.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there&#x27;s plenty of software that does work hassle free, but I find the more time goes on, the harder it is to keep things up to date or get newly released software without problems.')
