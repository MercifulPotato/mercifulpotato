Drove there from SF with Model Y, ended up renting an ICE car to explore the park, especially since we were staying 1.5 hours from the center of the park.<p>I saw several Teslas around the park, and I think it&#x27;s doable if you only want to visit say 1 or 2 locations, but without a Supercharger in the middle of the park, you will be limited and won&#x27;t have the flexibility to see everything.<p>The resort in the middle of the park has 4 J1772 chargers, which would help if you were staying in the park overnight, but we were simply doing day trips.')
