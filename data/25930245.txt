It is simple to kubespray a semi-working cluster on-prem or cloud provider k8s your way along but if you need to actually learn how to deal with multiple ingress controllers, a service mesh, need multiple storage providers, affinity, gpu accelerated apps, secure k8s and the other problems solved in the legacy world (in myriad ways) k8s can be regarded as a disruptive interruption in your ability to operate. All this being said I lead both IOT edge(via k3s) and science (cloud &amp; air gapped &#x27;vanilla&#x27; k8s) platform teams and appreciate the chance to sell k8s and make easy money.')
