The properties primary use is to hold money. It&#x27;s like the jar buried in the backyard full of gold for the Chinese.<p>Renters are not worth the hassle and earning an income renting a property might throw up some flags and other Income Tax headaches. What you get is a lot of properties just sitting empty going up in value because of the lack of inventory screwing potential Canadian buyers or renters. I don&#x27;t know if I remember correctly but I read somewhere that there were Condo buildings in Vancouver that were almost dark at night because so few people actually lived in them. Complete neighborhoods were void of people because of the foreign ownership.<p>This is about parking money in an asset that would be hard for the CCP to get their hands on. If it were in a foreign bank account as currency, the CCP would have easy access to it. The CCP probably doesn&#x27;t even know there are 1oo&#x27;s of billions over the last 2 decades sitting in Canadian housing.')
