I want to quit my current job and work on it full time. My technical&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;code skills are mostly focused on data science&#x2F;analytics and to complete this project I will need to learn a lot about web development and product management. There is a high probability I will fail but I think I am at a good time in my career for that.<p>I have savings that I can survive on for a year. My thinking is after 6-8 months I will have an MVP or at least a prototype. Then I can reassess and if it doesn&#x27;t look like I will be able to create a viable business or raise money to scale I will have to put it on pause and look for a job.<p>A part of me feels that even if I fail, future employers will look at my attempt as experience. At the same time I know not all failures are created equal, it could easily look like a way to dress up unemployment.<p>For those who failed at startups and had to get a job after, What was your experience reentering the job market?<p>Could you find roles you wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise been able to get without the experience you gained going out on your own? I am not keen on going back to data science&#x2F;analytics I hope that I&#x27;ll be able to learn skills for web development and product management along the way.<p>How do you fail and still have something to show for it?<p>Thanks!')
