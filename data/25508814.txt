Which is a nice way to lower operating costs.<p>I can see the benefit of this and the reasoning behind it. Because SPA still need a server (serverless still implies server side coding) as long as you are executing code on the client you need two codebases. One for the client, one server side.<p>With this solution it would seem that it&#x27;s possible to serve a web app with only one codebase, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus. But then performance and costs do preoccupy me a little.<p>Perhaps the ideal scenario for this tech would be for (enterprise) apps to be deployed on proprietary servers, where scale is a minor concern.')
