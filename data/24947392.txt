When I&#x27;m on the receiving end, my gut reaction is almost exactly opposite.<p>Second, their claim is that this is a miscommunication appears to be a CYA lie.  The recipient has shared sufficient details of what actually happened that either he is lying, or they are.  An apology that asks the recipient to swallow a lie is not much of an apology.<p>You think that this is a good apology.  I think that it is a terrible one.  Here is what an apology that I call good would look like:<p><i>We, the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee, issue a public apology to Jeremy Howard for our handling of the JupyterCon 2020 reports.  We did poorly on multiple levels.  Therefore we have requested our board of directors to take over the investigation of those reports, and to separately investigate our mishandling of the situation.</i><p><i>We deeply regret the pain and anguish that we caused, and we are sorry for it.</i><p>Incidentally doing this would have been free to them.  Everyone knows that they screwed up.  At this point the board would be remiss to NOT investigate, so asking the board to do what it has to do anyways costs them nothing.  And they wouldn&#x27;t have said something that sounds like a lie.')
