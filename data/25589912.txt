However I don&#x27;t think mistrust in the MSM is &quot;ideology&quot; associated with one party. Fox News <i>is</i> the MSM for many people and they&#x27;ve given us many reasons to distrust them.<p>Just off the top of my head:<p>* WaPo and NYT lied about WMDs and Iraq.<p>* NYT lied about NSA spying programs in 2005. Snowden explicitly said he gave his leaks to a British organization because US news could not be trusted.<p>* Rolling Stone misrepresented or omitted testimonies in &#x27;A Rape on Campus&#x27;.<p>* CNN said repeatedly that Clinton was polling higher than Trump and there was absolutely no way he was going to win. CNN also blacked out Yang and Sanders coverage and got flak for it. CNN also retracted at least one story on Trump, i cant remember what it was about but probably Russia.<p>* HuffPo has retracted a racist article after it was revealed the author had faked their identity, and editors made no attempt to verify whether or not their credentials were real.<p>* And of course everyone is familiar with the evils of &#x27;new media&#x27; companies like Facebook and YouTube, from spreading harmful content to children, unfairly enforcing policies, spreading misinformation, and harmful ads.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could come up with more. Why should I trust them? What have these organizations done to prove to the public they are changing? Why does distrusting them make me some sort of alt-right crazy? It seems like the media has the burden of proof, not me. From where I stand, the &quot;political ideology&quot; is a reaction to a sleazy, corrupt, and dying media industry.')
