How original and unique.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s weird that you all aren&#x27;t talking to each other and don&#x27;t even realize you&#x27;re both doing the same things to maintain cohesion and temporary power by vilifying everyone that&#x27;s not putting your party on a pedestal, whether they actually are on &quot;the other side&quot; or simply not repeating the stances verbatim.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc</a>')
