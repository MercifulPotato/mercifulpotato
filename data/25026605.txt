Item(by='isabelc', descendants=None, kids=[25026930], score=None, time=1604851481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015967, text='The division will not be fixed until they realize that the division is not ideological.<p>Most of these comments imply that the division is just ideological. I guess everyone here is so financially well off as to never having been too poor to afford health insurance but just above the cut off to get free health insurance. Families with kids and high living costs, and then being forced to pay over $2000 as penalty for not affording healthcare, it broke many spirits.<p>It was the ACA &quot;Individual Responsibility Mandate&quot; and it is the reason why all the hispanics in Florida without health insurance that I know, voted for Trump in 2016--because he said he&#x27;d get rid of that depressing $2000+ fine. Which he finally did.<p>Simple as that, and certainly not as idealistic as these comments imply. Those who don&#x27;t see that did not have to pay that ACA &quot;Individual Responsibility Mandate&quot; while being poor in an expensive city.<p>A &quot;new direction for divided US&quot; would mean that these politicians stop pretending people vote idealistically versus based on finances. Reading these other comments, one would think all the brown Floridians who voted for Trump are white supremacists. I thought Hacker News was above that simplistic rhetoric.')
