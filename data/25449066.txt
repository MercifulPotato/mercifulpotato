Item(by='macksd', descendants=None, kids=[25450398], score=None, time=1608154547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448905, text='&gt;&gt; I would have thought that the GPL ensures that the customer can then freely redistribute them<p>I&#x27;m actually surprised Red Hat has typically shipped SRPMS in bulk to it&#x27;s customers. I think it&#x27;s rare that customers would use them, and the GPL allows Red Hat to be far less accomodating. It allows you to charge for each copy of the source code you convey, it doesn&#x27;t need to be in such a convenient form, it doesn&#x27;t need to be available on-demand, it just needs to be available on-request.<p>Once a customer has it, yes - the GPL allows them to hand it to Rocky Linux and let them run with it. But I think the community has been fortunate so far just to get the distro sources they have in the way they&#x27;ve gotten them.<p>edit: Perhaps &quot;fortunate&quot; isn&#x27;t the right word, since Red Hat benefits from the community and owes the community some reciprocation. I&#x27;m just saying that legally, if Red Hat wanted to be bigger douche bags, the GPL gives them some space to do so. And I&#x27;m glad they haven&#x27;t fully taken advantage of that before.')
