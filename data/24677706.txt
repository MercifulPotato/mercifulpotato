Almost two years ago I tried installing Arch linux on the laptop they provided which was gathering dust, and I was surprised that almost everything worked perfectly out of the box (except for the fingerprint reader).<p>They&#x27;re using Office 365 too, so I tried using it in the browser (Firefox) and I loved it so much that I can&#x27;t use the local outlook client anymore. It just feels sluggish, and I hate that I have to let go of the slider when scrolling to see the message list update. I don&#x27;t think shared mailboxes are handled very well, though.')
