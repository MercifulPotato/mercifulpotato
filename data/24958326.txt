Solving one doesn&#x27;t solve the other.<p>And disenfranchisement is creating problems as shown in the article, while it tries to solve a problem, which is practically non-existent thanks to representative democracy.<p>First off, trying to delineate between who is allowed to vote and who except on most general rules (e.g. citizens over X years) is more likely than not to be used and abused to shape the electorate. The details are well documented, as in the article.<p>On the other hand, what does excluding criminals trying to solve? You don&#x27;t want them to decide what will happen in the country, but that is why there is a representative democracy. They are only allowed to vote for one of their &quot;betters&quot;, which will take the decisions. (The classism was to my knowledge partly intentional in design).\nAnd their numbers are low enough, that they won&#x27;t be able to chose a representation, which overrules the non-incarcerated<p>&gt; Some people should not have a voice in society - like raping murderers.<p>But people running a business making millions addicted to opioids? It is not complicated to condemn criminals, but it is complicated to set up a system, which doesn&#x27;t use that wish for retribution to distort the electorate. And to what end?
