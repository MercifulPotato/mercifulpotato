It seems sort of inefficient we keep reinventing the wheel (Epic and the like, which are crazy expensive, or self hosted solutions, when practitioners should not be spending time maintaining EMRs), when your records should be stored for your benefit by your government over the course of your life. This is where, imho, high calibre engineers provide the most leverage (one way ratchets on public goods at scale).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usds.gov&#x2F;resources&#x2F;USDS-Impact-Report-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usds.gov&#x2F;resources&#x2F;USDS-Impact-Report-2020.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.va.gov&#x2F;health-care&#x2F;get-medical-records&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.va.gov&#x2F;health-care&#x2F;get-medical-records&#x2F;</a>')
