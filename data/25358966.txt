Lithography?<p>For a country as small as the Netherlands, you can wonder if we could afford from a geopolitical point of view to be producing all the world&#x27;s chips (answer: no, it would force other place to invest highly in competition out of strategic interest).<p>Hence the strategy of being long term profitable and to just sell the machines to everyone at the same price.<p>It does make it baffling why Intel is unable to produce 5nn chips with the same ASML machines TSC is using. It must be management failing Boeing style.<p>As for the rest of Europe. Im sure they can politically do this. But where will the money end up?<p>It will end up in the pockets of friends and families of politicians that will be in &quot;the management&quot;.<p>So don&#x27;t expect anything from this. The future most sold chip will still be Apple Silicon or Samsung Exynos in TSC&#x27;s foundry or Samsung foundry on a machine by ASML using IP from ARM and NVidia')
