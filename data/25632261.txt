While the Boer War concentration camps were brutal, they were nothing on par with the Nazis.<p>In fact “concentration camp” is largely a misnomer. The sizable majority of Holocaust victims were killed in extermination camps, like Treblinka. These never even purported to hold any prisoner population, and simply murdered all prisoners immediately upon arrival.<p>The British have no shortage of problems. But nothing in their history is even remotely comparable to Hitler.')
