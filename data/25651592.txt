Standard time makes more sense for the eastern most edges of timezones and Daylight time makes more sense for the western most edges of timezones (and people towards the exact center of timezones distrust both because they both don&#x27;t work correctly to the sun), because timezones are hour-wide. Going back to 15-minute wide timezones would be extraordinarily painful, of course, but as someone in a city that partly defines the western edge of a timezone, I do sometimes wonder what life would have been like when the city had a 45-minute offset from its eastern edge counterparts back before railways standardized on hour-wide timezones.')
