It may actually be the case that Giuliani is just off his rocker. If he himself was sold by the (false) facts he received from others, he is a more difficult defamation target.<p>That part seems bizarre. Surely he ought to still be culpable is he said false things with the intention to damage Dominion, even if he can convince the court that he believed the things he said. Unless, of course, you&#x27;re talking about an insanity defense or a claim of provocation, but those a very different matter, and I highly doubt that&#x27;s a viable route.')
