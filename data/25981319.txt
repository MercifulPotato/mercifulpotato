A vendor provides an opaque system that requires relatively deep knowledge of it to perform integrations etc. A third party would need to dig deep into the system &amp; documentation to work with it.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this with SunGard&#x2F;Ellucian, and also Oracle. They would not make their documentation &amp; technical manuals publicly available. A third party arose offering general maintenance &amp; other services, and used customer&#x27;s documentation copies to do so. SunGard sued them, and the customer [0]. Oracle has done something similar [1].<p>Unfortunately, this is a common practice by providers of large proprietary systems, and whether or not the vendor prevails is almost irrelevant: customers now know that competitive bidding brings a risk of costly litigation.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think suing your customers is a very good business practice for long term customer loyalty. Then again some industries only have the choice of a few vendors, roughly equally litigious, to choose from. The alternative is to create your own custom system, but that&#x27;s an option only available to very large customers.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20150319233444&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.thehigheredcio.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;28&#x2F;sungard-ellucian-still-suing-cajana-and-nscc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20150319233444&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.thehi...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chronicle.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;a-small-company-promising-major-savings-on-vital-software-lures-colleges&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chronicle.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;a-small-company-promising-...</a>')
