Other aspects were not for me (bureaucracy, high maintenance parents, etc).<p>You might find that while those individual subjects interest you equally, careers in those fields might have different parts to them which you are not suited to (public speaking, grant writing, research).<p>All that said, I’m not really sure that I’m good at my current career itself but more that the individual things that make it up suit me better.
