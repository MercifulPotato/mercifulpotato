JavaScript has been optimized to hell, it has a proper JIT compiler, and it&#x27;s extremely fast, about half the speed of C in many cases. Python and Ruby are inexcusably slow in comparison. We have the technology to make them fast, but the language implementations were born in the 1990s, at a time where everybody thought single-core performance would always double every 18 months. It&#x27;s this kind of &quot;performance doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; mentality that lead to poor implementations and a huge waste of CPU cycles. IMO, those languages will inevitably be displaced for performance reasons. It will take time, but it&#x27;s inevitable.')
