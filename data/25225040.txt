If we’re talking about a parser, wouldn’t it need to test all the values? And if your not testing all the values, aside from simple cases, it’s not something that could just be computed (np, halting problem etc)... so wouldn’t the parser still just need to test some preset number of values?<p>I guess maybe we’re talking kind of like a prebaked in set of unit tests for certain circumstances?')
