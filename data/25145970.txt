Item(by='splonk', descendants=None, kids=[25147453, 25156447], score=None, time=1605757227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137235, text='I hope OSM does well, and I&#x27;ve heard that in some areas (Germany?  Various areas in smaller countries that are less well covered?  Bike trails and walking trails?) it&#x27;s notably better than Google Maps.  That said, in my neighborhood of San Francisco (the Mission), its business listings are basically straight garbage, and I&#x27;m reminded of that every time I use any service that&#x27;s based on OSM.<p>Lazy Bear is a two Michelin starred restaurant that&#x27;s been in its current location since 2014.  By any reasonable measure it&#x27;s a significant business in the area.  OSM still thinks it&#x27;s the barbeque place that used to be there.  Within a two block radius I count maybe 5-6 places that OSM promotes to having a label on the map that have been closed for over a year.<p>I used to work on business listings in mapping products so I have some idea of how difficult keeping business listings up to date is, but OSM is so bad that it wrecks my motivation to fix the data because I just can&#x27;t fathom ever using it in my local area.')
