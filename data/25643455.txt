And these small companies experience an outage per quater, then a million businesses suffer every quater.<p>Not all companies are created the same. Microsoft, Google and Facebook have had their outages, but IME much fewer than Slack.<p>If there are a thousand small companies, none of them have a network effect, and those that experience more outages per quarter will lose customers to those that have less outages per quarter.
