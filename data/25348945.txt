I haven’t found any issue using them - IMO the “it isn’t accurate” stuff isn’t very accurate.<p>Also, base pair resolution is bad on Nanopores primarily at homopolyer stretches. Guess what you can’t synthesize in the first place?<p>(Edit: I’ve done Sanger sequencing on about 3,000 plasmids at once before for high throughput cloning, and that SUCKED.)')
