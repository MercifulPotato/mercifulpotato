Before that I&#x27;ve already heard of cases how in tourists towns the local poorer population wasn&#x27;t able to get long term apartments because richer tourists filled them through Airbnb.<p>Airbnb is cancer for the local population in any country that isn&#x27;t very rich because locals &amp; students then have to commute from further distances.<p>So banning Airbnb would be godsend for the local population of many countries, if you want to make money with renting open a hotel.<p>Obviously there is the argument &quot;I own the apartment so I can do whatever I want&quot;. I really have no good counter argument for this as it is true. But all laws are really relative to the culture. This same person could then say &quot;I don&#x27;t owe the country any taxes because _I_ made the money&quot;.<p>So this just goes to show that we &quot;normalize&quot; everything based on laws.<p>For the greater good of the local population in poorer countries Airbnb should be banned.')
