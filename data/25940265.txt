The programming language is just a very small part of the whole picture. Usually you integrate with many 3rd party systems that don&#x27;t always provide all the guarantees they claim (so you get many edge cases) and understanding these things is not trivial. If it was only for understanding the code it would be easy. And actually having worked with both Rust and Ruby, the easiness of binding.pry and debugging is unbeatable. Rust gives you guarantees how the code behave, but when you have input from external sources (user input or external service input), it&#x27;s much easier to understand what&#x27;s happening (=debug) in a dynamic language.')
