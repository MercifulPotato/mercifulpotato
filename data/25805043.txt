Item(by='perl4ever', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610827755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25792605, text='That sounds like the claim is &quot;if the income per capita within your household is &gt; $60K, then your household is in the top 1% of all households in income per capita&quot;.<p>I think the difference between this convoluted statement and normal measures of inequality could be approximately translated to &quot;most people making &gt; $60K have dependents&quot;. It seems like a bad way to talk about inequality, because what goal would it imply to reduce inequality? Prevent people from having dependents, or prevent them from <i>not</i> having dependents?')
