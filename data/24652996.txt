The law protects him from the emotions of the masses. This law does not extend over to your employment at a commercial company.<p>The reason why people lose their jobs for racist tweets is because companies are reacting to the emotional sentiment of the masses and pulling a PR maneuver.<p>In short, for commercial jobs, it doesn&#x27;t matter your crime, or the degree of your crime or whether you committed a crime at all, it&#x27;s about business and a negative public emotional mood against you at this current point in time is usually bad for business (or stock prices).<p>Case in point, Let&#x27;s say hypothetically that the OP could have mentioned that this woman&#x27;s violent crime was repeatedly beating a 8 year old child for no reason and the public&#x27;s emotional reaction would be drastically different. I&#x27;m not sure what her crime really was, but there is definitely a reason why it was omitted: The OP likely made a rational judgement about the crime and is likely very aware that the emotional reaction to the crime by the masses would be drastically different than her own rational judgement... thus from this line of reasoning she has chosen not to mention what the crime was.<p>It&#x27;s a fine line here. I think if I really got to know a person and I can really understand a person, I feel even a child beater or can be redeemed in my eyes but I can see how in the eyes of the public this can never happen. (Also let&#x27;s be clear here, I&#x27;m not saying the womans crime was beating a child, just using that as an example).<p>People are rarely rational and when you measure the reactions of people in response to stimuli in aggregate you will find that the bigger the aggregate the more emotional the reaction is.<p>This is how a criminal who committed a violent crime can get public support for finding a job, and an innocent man who made a mistake and wrote a stupid tweet can lose any prospect at finding a future career.')
