When we go travelling we have a USB charging bar which plugs into mains and provides half a dozen 2.4A USB ports. We don&#x27;t need vendor-provided chargers.<p>I expect a vast majority of the market is in a similar position.<p>The only people who would take the free accessory are those that need one, or have a compulsion to acquire free stuff because it&#x27;s free.')
