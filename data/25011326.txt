It has features still unmatched by modern games. Where else, tell me, you can mutate to have 16 fingers (putting an enchanted ring on EACH!) and 5 eyes, improving perception?!<p>And you could switch bodies with any monster (best of all Draugr, who moved 4 times faster than everyone and had insane health and other stats!).<p>And if you morphed into a giant, while wearing rings, they would cut your fingers off. Isn&#x27;t it nice?<p>But, best of all, you could meet ghosts of your previous lives, sometimes with gear!<p>ADOM is much more polished, of course, but lacks this inspired touch.')
