They are not “normal” they are technically far less literate than the normal man, and they too of course should be able to own and operate a computer.<p><i>GNOME</i> in fact seems to think it&#x27;s own users to be even less savvy than I do, but they continue to deny this.<p>The other problem is that everything that Red Hat has it&#x27;s tendrils in overflows with meaningless marketing language such as that, in general.')
