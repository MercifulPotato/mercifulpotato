What exactly makes you think the college educated are exposed to fewer points of view than those from the &quot;heartland&quot;? Everything I&#x27;ve ever seen points to the opposite being true, where going to an institute of higher learning puts you in touch with a *vast* array of different people, and living in an urban center does the same. Which leads me to my second point:\n\n  2. Why exactly do you think it&#x27;s not important for someone from the &quot;heartland&quot; to exercise empathy or be exposed to other viewpoints? It&#x27;s pretty obvious that a large factor in the problems of today is tribalism and &quot;othering&quot;, which gets pretty quickly destroyed by exposure to those same &quot;others&quot;, something you don&#x27;t often get in the &quot;heartland.&quot;</code></pre>')
