I&#x27;ve even worked for FAANG clients who didn&#x27;t know what they wanted until we tell them. The kind of work I did (I am exiting the consulting world as of this week) was very consumer-facing and creative driven. I can estimate tech work as well as anyone, but there&#x27;s always too many moving parts to a big project to know how everything will fall into place.')
