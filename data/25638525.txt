I&#x27;ve had the most problem with interacting with people using environments that are &quot;helpful&quot; and aren&#x27;t really programming languages, and I usually end up having to offer them a plain array anyhow.<p>This can also be helpful when you&#x27;re outputting, say, a 10MB JSON object, which isn&#x27;t necessarily that large anymore, on a server where you&#x27;d like to not have to allocate 10MB of RAM to it. You can stream out a plain ol&#x27; JSON object without the resource usage.<p>Sadly, it is indeed easier to convince environments to stream JSON out than it is to stream it in.')
