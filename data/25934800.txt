Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=[25937639], score=None, time=1611785630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933595, text='&gt; He didn’t have any answer as to the fate of new bag holders he created with his tweet. That was irresponsible.<p>I have to say up front, I find this kind of attitude incredibly infantilizing and condescending.<p>Exactly how many &quot;bag holders&quot; did Chamath &quot;create&quot;? (Hint: Zero.) Obviously the &quot;bag holders&quot; are assuming the risks themselves, as is (absent any evidence to the contrary) Chamath. They&#x27;re on a forum literally called &quot;Wall Street <i>BETS</i>&quot; (emphasis mine). If a millionaire announces he&#x27;s playing the slots and subsequently wins the jackpot, is he &quot;responsible&quot; for everyone else who subsequently plays slots?<p>(He didn&#x27;t make this argument as well as he could have, but Chamath himself points out that when Goldman or AIG played stupid games, everyone else was conscripted into being the &quot;bag holders.&quot;)<p>Also, exactly how many people are we even saying Chamath <i>influenced</i>? How many people were undecided about making the GME trade and then said, &quot;welp, Chamath is long so YOLOOOOO?&quot; And how many of these people traded irresponsibly (e.g. overleveraged, invested their life savings)? I would bet the number is small, even negligible.<p>&gt; His plan to make hedge funds disclose their positions daily as some kind of a solution to overleverage makes no sense whatsoever.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I don&#x27;t think he ever proposed this as some sort of affirmative plan. What I heard was him pointing out the asymmetry of which entities are required&#x2F;voluntarily publish their positions. If hedge funds had done that, the 136% thing would never have happened for obvious reasons. I interpreted it more as a response to the interviewer&#x27;s pearl clutching about the market having no &quot;integrity&quot; because a stock price deviated from the &quot;fundamentals&quot; for a time under some bizarre circumstances.<p>&gt; And he’s delusional about research skills of WSB posters as compared to Wall Street analysts.<p>If you&#x27;re correct, then you can easily show us your short positions contra WSB research&#x2F;herd mentality&#x2F;irrationality&#x2F;&lt;pejorative&gt; and we can track how well you end up compared to WSB.')
