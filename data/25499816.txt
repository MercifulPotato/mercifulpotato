They could get by with something cheaper no doubt. I don&#x27;t think anyone really cares about clock speed or processor efficiency in a car because you&#x27;re not really doing anything that last decades&#x27; processors couldn&#x27;t handle (especially with less bloated code bases). Maybe face recognition + key fob presence to authenticate and start the car.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Apple&#x27;s quality is going to translate to cars either unless they poach a bunch of people. Safety features will compromise the quality at some point, but maybe they&#x27;re good enough to work around it elegantly.<p>Plus people paid a premium for Apple&#x27;s quality, but are they willing to do so when that premium is multiple thousands of dollars extra for a car? They could afford low&#x2F;zero cost financing if they wanted to.')
