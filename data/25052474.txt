I&#x27;m glad that the new Air still has F-keys with Touch ID; but I&#x27;m flabbergasted that they&#x27;re <i>still</i> not making the Touchbar optional for the Pro series, given how polarizing it&#x27;s been, and the underwhelming adoption of new Touchbar functionality by third-party developers.')
