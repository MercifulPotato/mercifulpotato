They just want you to think everything is &#x27;natural&#x27;, and all these giant farms are being pollinated by wild bees alone. They aren&#x27;t.<p>You point isn&#x27;t wrong, the wild and managed bees are essentially the same. The &#x27;wild&#x27; honey bees are just domesticated ones that escaped, or didn&#x27;t come back to the hive. The problem is commercial farming in America tends to be all &#x27;mono-crop&#x27; and by it&#x27;s nature has destroyed any biodiversity and any chance of wild bees thriving. So they depend on commercial beekeepers to come in and do the dirty work.<p>It goes both ways, it&#x27;s a mutually beneficial arrangement becuase the beekeepers get access to high quality food for their bees, which will then in turn produce more honey. Unless 75% of the hive dies or fails to return, and the colonies collapse. Which is happening all too often now. It&#x27;s a really big problem to be sure.<p>Sounds like you keep bees so you probably are more knowledgeable than me. Sorry, I just get mad because I can think of very few articles I seen on the topic that explain the topic in a reasonable way. It is clear they are trying to push their own agenda.<p>Good information I found on the National Honey Board website:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;honey.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;presskit&#x2F;honey-industry-facts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;honey.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;presskit&#x2F;honey-industry-facts</a>')
