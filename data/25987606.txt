So at best you&#x27;re owed your money back for the &quot;extra&quot; stock you &quot;bought&quot;.<p>If you own 101% you should know you cannot actually transfer or vote that stock extra 1%, it&#x27;s simply not possible. All 101% means is if the stock goes up, you get 101% of the gains.<p>Fyi, times when votes are happening are interesting for shorted stock because a not insignificant percentage of the stock does get recalled so owners can vote it. So short sellers have to reduce their positions and then increase them again. It is one way to try and estimate short-seller impact in the stock...')
