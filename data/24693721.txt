The other discussion in this thread about whether or not its morally OK to drive drowsy does <i>not</i> apply to your situation. Definitely do not drive until you&#x27;ve had a sleep study done and been cleared by a doctor. The usual situation that is being discussed in this thread is where you are already tired and drowsy and decide to drive because you don&#x27;t have a choice. Your situation sounds like a different medical condition of some sort, and (not a lawyer but) the fact that you are aware of this condition might mean you&#x27;d still be guilty of the same crime as someone who decided to drive when drowsy and fell asleep before causing an accident.')
