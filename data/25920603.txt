There&#x27;s nothing particularly global about our electricity supply that requires it to be as dominated by oligopoly the way that Gasoline and Crude Oil could be.<p>I do expect that the future looks a lot more like C-Stores with charging stations than some of the current stations though. A lot of new Tesla installs are going in at gas stations, but they are the newer stations (Sheetz, Wawa, Parkers) rather than stations owned directly by oil companies.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s regressive and inconvenient about a shopping mall. Most have food courts, and tbh, I think the ideal charge stop would be one near a food hall.')
