Item(by='wes-k', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610126707, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686823, text='See plant based milk, mayo, egg, meat, butter, etc. Also no one is ever upset about peanut butter which isn&#x27;t butter!<p>And it depends on your definition. It is cultured like cheese and plays a similar role in cuisine.<p>Also, no plant based product is ever trying to trick or disguise itself. Their entire market is based around people knowing it is plant based. Yeti&#x27;s homepage has in big bold text right at the top &quot;Real cheese, made from plants&quot;... you could argue &quot;real cheese&quot; and &quot;made from plants&quot; is an oxymoron but my point is, no one buying the product is going to be confused.')
