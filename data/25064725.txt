I kept it downloaded on my device, played it whenever I wanted, and it integrated nicely with Google Assistant, as promised. This year, Google decided to migrate all that into YouTube Music. I thought that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem; just a new name and change of UI, surely? Well, YouTube Music is incessant about nagging you to subscribe. Unless you subscribe it doesn&#x27;t work well with assistant and won&#x27;t play without the app open. I only wanted to listen to the music I had already purchased on the same terms on which I had purchased it, though. Luckily, it was just a handful or so of music and they&#x27;ve agreed to refund it. But now I&#x27;m still in the situation where I will be looking for something to replace the gap. This is just one example.<p>At some point, I&#x27;m not going to be bothering with Google products anymore. I already feel a moderate bias against using their stuff. I&#x27;m switching from Google Cloud to Vercel, for example. I just hope Vercel doesn&#x27;t get acquired by Google.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet done anything about Gmail, Drive, or Photos, but I feel a bit insecure about such important stuff currently being in Google&#x27;s hands.')
