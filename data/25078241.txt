Python succeeded because it wasn&#x27;t. A languages type system design mutates slower than the domain specific needs of what is popular. That slowness translates to difficulty in grabbing emerging domains. And the existing users are opposed to untyped structures as hacks causing friction. For example, most deep learning libraries even in typed languages are only semi-typed as matrix sizes aren&#x27;t compared in the type system but in run time.')
