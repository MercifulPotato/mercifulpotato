Item(by='zozbot234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606042930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173408, text='Older versions of Coq used to include an Isar-like feature known as C-zar, or the &quot;Mathematical Proof Language&quot;.  It was quite intuitive to use, perhaps even moreso than Isar.  Unfortunately it was also quite buggy and unmaintained, so it got removed in later releases.  Within current versions of Coq, I think the &quot;structuring&quot; operators in Ssreflect could perhaps be used to replicate that proof format, but some extensions are needed. The basic operation &quot;have ... by ...&quot; is pretty much there, but an Isar-like proof language includes more than that.')
