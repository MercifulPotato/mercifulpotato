Basically anyone can advance in their field by working harder or smarter. How does wealth inequality play into that? I used to do manual labor, then I got an education and much better pay. A venture capitalist made a crap ton of money, then made smart investments, now they make a crap ton + some more.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I know wealth inequality exists and it&#x27;s incredibly unfair, but I don&#x27;t think it makes sense as a counterpoint to what he&#x27;s saying.')
