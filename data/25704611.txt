But it&#x27;s years between me looking at the actual compiled output. I look at assembly output more often, and most people never even do that.<p>What I mean though is that .&#x2F;configure outputs a config.log that says exactly what was done. Exactly what command line was run and exactly what the error was.<p>I guess I&#x27;m confused why you&#x27;re even looking at the compiled scripts. Would you not look at logfiles and stderr output before you start looking at assembly?<p>CMake doesn&#x27;t. The logs are completely useless, even when I get a CMake expert to come and agree, yes that&#x27;s useless.<p>With autotools you can see that it failed to build because it couldn&#x27;t find library foo when building with &quot;gcc blah blah blah&quot;, and you go &quot;well yeah, you need -L&#x2F;opt&#x2F;foo&#x2F;lib&quot;, so you just add that. (or pkg-config equiv).<p>CMake, on the other hand, seems to force you to look at CMake &quot;source code&quot; (CMakeLists.txt), which is a horrible mess. I&#x27;m not saying autotools isn&#x27;t (yay, m4 :-(  ), but the point is you don&#x27;t have to, because it actually logs what it does.<p>So this is one of the many many reasons CMake sucks.')
