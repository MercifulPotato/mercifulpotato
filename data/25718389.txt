For instance in the language in the definitions part about who the customer is, who the business is should be {common:customer-is-you, common:business-is-mybusinessname} or a part that talks about not using other customer&#x27;s login information. Etc. Why should we have to read every single line when it&#x27;s mostly the same? DRY the TOS.')
