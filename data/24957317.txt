They can&#x27;t unilaterally revoke a Developer ID cert, they can only request that Apple revoke it.<p>&gt; Apple did nothing wrong, unless you’re of the opinion that Apple should be auditing other company’s internal policies and controls.<p>This is missing the point of Developer ID. It&#x27;s a program created by Apple and imposed as a requirement on Mac developers. The purpose of the Developer ID cert is to prevent malware. That&#x27;s why it has a remote kill switch, to stop malware from running. The purpose was not to give Mac developers a remote kill switch to use however they please. Why in the world would Apple do that?<p>Developer ID is not an &quot;internal policy&quot; for third party developers. There&#x27;s nothing to audit. Developer ID is Apple&#x27;s program, designed for Apple&#x27;s purposes, and Apple makes the decision whether or not to revoke the certs.<p>Almost all known Developer ID certificate revocations are not the result of the developer&#x27;s own request but rather the result of Apple discovering malware in the wild and revoking the certs of the malware authors.')
