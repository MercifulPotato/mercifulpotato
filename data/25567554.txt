But if someone stepped outside you would now be aware the flight situation has changed and now being within 30m of someone you need to leave the area. I can tell you this, any good lawyer would currently squash a case of a drone in a window without much fight with the current laws but it is obvious with the language of the RCMP and how they are viewing it those days may be limited because they are trying to define new definitions of what breaks ones expectation of privacy. I don&#x27;t have any drones but I honestly don&#x27;t think it would be worth your time flying outside someone&#x27;s window to test this as you are likely to get arrested and even if you beat the charge you would likely spend thousands fighting it.')
