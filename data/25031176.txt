It failed electronically six months later despite spending nearly all its  time in the box...I bought it to use when using an RPi. Unicomp fixed it under warranty but made me pay for shipping it back to them.<p>To me, not covering shipping on warranty is a tell that their quality is low enough that failed keyboards are common. I don’t think I have ever seen a device have an electronically failed USB port...cables sure but this wasn’t.<p>Anyway mine was junk and might still be. I wouldn’t recommend Unicomp anymore.')
