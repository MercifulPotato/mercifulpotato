For the most part, they do not need to worry about the effects of their actions. So for my explanation, I used spoons to convey this point.&quot;<p>Not so sure about this... everyone has limited resources, time and energy being the biggest, finances usually a big one as well. How accutely you are aware of them perhaps depends on both your situation (such as having serious health issues that need attention) and what exactly you are trying to do with them.<p>Not taking your resources for granted is always helpful though. (Although someone else not sharing a resource doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it worth more to me; e.g. I&#x27;m not happier to be able to walk specifically because someone else can&#x27;t.)')
