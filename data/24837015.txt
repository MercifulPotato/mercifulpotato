If you choose to go a certain way, then that means you are accepting the output.  Why should anyone be able to hide behind &quot;it&#x27;s just an algorithm change.&quot;<p>Now I understand that many of these machine learning algorithms lead to unpredictable and unexpected results.  But again, they have found these risks acceptable by continuing to use them anyway.<p>There should never be any hiding behind &quot;its the algorithm, not us.&quot; You are responsible for your algorithms, whether you understand it or not.<p>The thing I don&#x27;t understand is why they continue trying these stupid algorithms.  What value is there in them?  It&#x27;s very rare for me to encounter one of these things and go &quot;yes, this is exactly what I wanted.&quot;  More likely, they get in the way of what I want to do.  Maybe I&#x27;m an outlier, but I really wish as a profession, we&#x27;d be much more frank regarding the actual results of these things.')
