We&#x27;re a relatively small team, where it is paramount that one works well with the rest of the team.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean you got to fit some tight social profile, far from it.<p>But since we&#x27;re a small team each person has a lot of responsibility, and so we need to trust the right decisions are made for the right reasons, that communication won&#x27;t be an issue, that you can handle dealing with customers for projects and troubleshooting etc.<p>We don&#x27;t need the best skilled coders. We need developers who&#x27;re good at finding solutions to our customers problems, within the constraints of us being a small team with limited resources (time most of all). We need someone who&#x27;s capable of learning new technologies as the needs arise, and we need someone who can communicate well within the team and with our customers.<p>When I got hired, my actual coding skill wasn&#x27;t really a topic. I didn&#x27;t get a single programming quiz or similar question. They were far more interested in my background, what sort of projects I had been working on, what motivated me etc.')
