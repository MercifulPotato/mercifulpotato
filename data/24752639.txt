Nothing major, and I&#x27;ve had worse issues with the Nvidia drivers, but they are still something to be aware of.<p>The first was that my distro (KDE Neon based on Ubuntu 18.04) shipped an older version of Mesa at the time, which was too old for the AMDGPU driver, so I had to add a PPA with an updated version. Since Neon updated to a 20.04 base, it works straight from a clean install. It also worked with no issues when I switched to openSUSE Leap 15.2.<p>The second was that DVI output was limited to single-link instead of dual-link. My monitor at the time only supported full 1440p through dual-link DVI or displayport, and the old GPU didn&#x27;t have displayport. Buying a displayport cable was a quick fix, and I believe the DVI issue is fixed in the driver now.<p>Aside from those two minor hurdles, it has been smooth sailing, very good OpenGL performance in the games I play.')
