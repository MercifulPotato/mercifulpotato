The wrong ones, OTOH, would have gone further down the crazy path, inventing an all-new programming language and runtime for the server-distributed code (for &#x27;security&#x27; or &#x27;performance&#x27; or whatever other reason seemed to pass muster).<p>&gt; They have a shop where designs are done in caffeinated weekend pushes without input from other developers.<p>I have a strict rule on my teams: no development outside of work hours (whatever &#x27;work hours&#x27; means for an individual, where there are roughly 8 work hours in a day and five work days in a week).  It is absolutely vital that developers get to recharge their mental batteries, in particular because a symptom of overwork is bad judgment, and a symptom of bad judgment is being less able to judge one&#x27;s own decisions.
