Sure, some people have broken immune systems, and there can be a new and different virus that evolves from the old one but doesn&#x27;t earn a distinct name. That doesn&#x27;t count.<p>He is immune. Similarly, we say that cars can cross the Golden Gate Bridge, despite the fact that the bridge could be destroyed (by bombing for example) or that one could call the NASA crawler-transporter a &quot;car&quot; that is 90 feet wide. Absurd, exotic, and rare possibilities don&#x27;t change the basic truth.<p>Vaccines do work like getting the illness, or less so. The illness is nearly certain to provide long-term immunity, but a vaccine is not quite so likely. Those who can&#x27;t generate immunity will survive the vaccine but not the illness.')
