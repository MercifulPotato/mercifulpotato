I&#x27;m now convinced this is a waste of time and Anki is best used rushing through sessions as fast as possible (maximum 20min a day). This takes care of the small, boring but often essential rote memorization part, allowing you to use as much of your time and intellect for actual practice in the target domains.<p>(This may not apply if the target domain is actually itself rote memorization, e.g. medical exams)')
