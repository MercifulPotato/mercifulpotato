As I understand it, for all of modern medicine&#x27;s many marvels, it can&#x27;t do much about the common cold, or tinnitus. I suppose that&#x27;s analogous to how we have software that can beat any human chess player, but text-to-speech is still a work in progress. Our systems have a harder time moving the pieces than picking world-class chess moves.')
