It needs the &quot;network&quot; aspect of social networking to operate. Consequently, even if you&#x27;re willing to pay $1&#x2F;month if your friends aren&#x27;t to pay then that $1 represents terrible value and you&#x27;ll leave because there&#x27;s no value in paying.<p>This is the inherent problem in charging for any &#x27;network&#x27; product - it has to represent good value for <i>everyone</i> not just a few people.')
