Still, it is remarkable the difference in the Ivy and Public reading lists no? The structure of most societies and power hierarchy I think is still very much in that Hobbesian legacy. As a note, I didn&#x27;t read Imagined Communities, I will have to take a look. We read the classic counterpoint, Rousseau.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean this to sound anti-elitist (after all, I went to those very same institutions and still run in that world), but nonetheless there is a huge disparity in the opportunities available and where students end up coming out of these places. That their reading lists differ so much from the majority of college students is something worth investigating, at the very least to see what can be improved in any educational trajectory.')
