The semantics are not equivalent to rust, but they are similar.<p>Nim stops race conditions by controlling data passage among  threads (disallowing shared data between threads, in general) and always has.<p>I am not familiar enough with Rust to say that everything rust can do and assure is indeed covered in Nim; however, plain Nim without using the escape hatches (which like Rust unsafe code, exist for those times you must use them) is safe.')
