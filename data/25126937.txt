If that happens, your binary search had a bug. So in this case possible bugs are being obscured, rather than surfaced. This is bad.<p>Integer division by 0 defining to 0 is interesting and certainly convenient; arguably you will accidentally end up obscuring bugs, when you didn&#x27;t intend to divide by 0.<p>The broader point I&#x27;m making is it doesn&#x27;t seem great to me to represent what are basically bugs with Maybe.')
