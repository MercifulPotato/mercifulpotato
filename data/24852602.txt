The reason they don’t allow watching on Linux is because some of their content providers insist on a DRM scheme which they can’t guarantee will be secure on Linux. I disagree with this on an ideological point of view, but from a business point of view it makes sense as Linux is a minority in their potential user base.<p>Quibi’s decision really does not make sense. It is reasonably cheap to release a viewer app or website for the mainstream browsers &amp; OSes, and indeed if there is a <i>good</i> Quibi show then offering it on desktops &amp; TVs would significantly improve the viewing experience and bring more people in.')
