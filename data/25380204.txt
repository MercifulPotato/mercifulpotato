Her words, emphasis added, but probably not the exact  words in the email she sent:<p>&gt; I said here are the conditions. If you can meet them great Iâ€™ll take my name off this paper, <i>if not then I can work on a last date.</i> Then she sent an email to my direct reports saying she has accepted my resignation. So that is google for you folks. You saw it happen right here.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timnitgebru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334343577044979712?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timnitgebru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334343577044979712?l...</a>')
