Taxes on the highest earners were much higher than they were today.<p>Tax rates were higher but there were far more deductions. The effective rate was similar to that of today.<p>60-70 years ago a man with an HS diploma could support a family due to massive demand for labor. This was mainly because America was the economic engine that provided for the reconstruction of the world after WW2. Go back another 15 years to pre-WW2 and shit was pretty bleak even with high taxes.<p>&gt; You mention FB. With network effects, it is inevitable that there will be a few large dominate social media companies. If it wasn&#x27;t Zuckerberg it would have been someone else.<p>It was someone else, it was MySpace and Friendster and other trashy shit. Facebook brought a vastly better user experience that seems mundane in retrospect but it won because it was so much better.
