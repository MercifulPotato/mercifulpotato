For something like software engineering, vetting potential volunteers would also be a huge undertaking. Organizations are typically better served by contracting out important projects or having regular staff handle important work that requires brain power. Volunteers are not reliably committed over the long term to the degree employees and contractors are.<p>Maybe start small and volunteer at a local homeless shelter or food bank or hospital doing whatever needs doing irrespective of it being software engineering.')
