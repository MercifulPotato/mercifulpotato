Do parents have the right to marry away their pre-pubescent daughters in our society?<p>In addition, a large portion of sexual abuse is from family, and the parents of child actors don&#x27;t exactly have the best reputation when it comes to not abusing their children, and show business in general doesn&#x27;t have the best track record on this either. Remember Corey Feldman?<p>&gt; You really think the actresses are traumatised after this?<p>Yes.<p>&gt; Why?!?<p>I think children being told to perform sexually explicit dances while in revealing dress for the enjoyment of adults (the nuances of such enjoyment will be lost on the child) will likely have a negative effect on their mental health later in life and yes, is a traumatizing experience, because they are being coerced into performing a sexual act, the likes of which they cannot understand or consent to due to their age. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the coerced sexual act is stated to be in opposition to coerced sexual acts: the child has no choice! I shouldn&#x27;t have to explain this!<p>If Taxi Driver could make a movie about sexual exploitation of young women without forcing Jodie Foster to literally dance in undress I think we can hold other filmmakers to the same standard.')
