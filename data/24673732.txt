For example, there is no logic in the TCP&#x2F;IP stack that implements the TLS side, no logic that knows about what an HTTP header is, no logic that knows how HTTP&#x2F;2 multiplexes requests over TCP connections etc.<p>Sure, the kernel is implementing the TCP&#x2F;IP stack, but once the right socket has been identified based on IP address and TCP port, and once the packet has been re-assembled, all checksums verified, and the ACK sent to the sender, the bytes of the TCP payload are delivered to the user-space read() or equivalent call, and it&#x27;s up to user space code to interpret that as an encrypted HTTP request or response, decide if the entire request has been received etc.<p>This is why OpenSSL or GnuTLS are libraries that you can find on your system. And the actual HTTP implementation is part of Apache or NGINX or other web servers, or by browsers and other clients.')
