And it seems like a disastrous idea to me.<p>And I haven&#x27;t been thinking this for 20 years or something set in my ways, I was previously only vaguely aware of this &quot;controversy&quot;. In fact, while you suggest the unfamiliarity or dislike of Lisp syntax is behind opposition, I think it&#x27;s probably the reverse, most of the people (especially in 2020) pining over DSSSL are specifically those in love with Lisp who were hoping it would make it an again mainstream technology -- I&#x27;m going to reverse it and say your advocacy is less about the idea of using a full programming language for HTML styling and more about just liking Lisp and wanting an application for it.<p>But also, sure, syntax matters for technology accessibility. It is arguably inappropriate to require someone to &quot;learn Lisp&quot; in order to style HTML.<p>(I did learn and <i>enjoy</i> Scheme in undergrad CS curriculum long ago, I admittedly haven&#x27;t used it since).')
