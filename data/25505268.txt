But I&#x27;m putting that in to be generous, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever seen these topics discussed in good faith.<p>Or do your existing opinions mean you view all discussions on this topic as bad-faith, exactly as the parent comment describes?<p>&gt; However, the reason these are such contentious topics is that 99% of the time they are aired it&#x27;s either people using them to complain about SJW culture<p>Is that the cause of the alleged &#x27;bubbelisation&#x27; of social media networks by &quot;censorship&quot;, or is that actually caused by the supposed censorship?<p>PS: Not trying to imply anything, you still make a valid point.')
