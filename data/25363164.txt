(50% * infectiousness of immune person) + (50% * infectiousness of an unprotected person) = a lot of infectiousness&quot;<p>sub out that 50% for 95% (information that has come out more recently than the published date for that article) and the math looks very different.  Still not &quot;CORONA EXTINCT BY APRIL&quot;... but much better than what you&#x27;re implying')
