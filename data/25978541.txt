Probably not much optimization to be done.  I&#x27;ve seen this in other domains too, I have some graphics&#x2F;art code that is very low level C#, and .NET 4.6 to the latest .NET Core, which has <i>huge</i> performance gains in normal enterprise code, does nothing for it. Which makes sense its all carefully thought out loops on arrays, not much to be done.<p>But that does bring up the point, would we be better served by just, writing lower level code when needed and turning off all these optimizations for faster compile times?')
