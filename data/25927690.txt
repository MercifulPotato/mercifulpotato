Item(by='yourapostasy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611752644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926813, text='In broad strokes, Ikea furniture holds up well as long as the humidity and UV is low&#x27;ish. Don&#x27;t leave it out in the open weather, let it get water-laden with humidity, or sit directly exposed to the sun anywhere, and the glues holding it together will generally last their lifecycle (about a decade or two), possibly longer if in an especially well-cared for environment.<p>With some practice, West System epoxy, filler and fiber glass can easily repair chips and chunks. It helps that I&#x27;m not fastidious about aesthetics, so lacking the laminate on top after a repair suits me. The little bits are more challenging to source if Ikea has stopped manufacturing or supplying them. I&#x27;m hoping 3D metrology and printing can help with that, so waste from people tossing out old furniture for want of a small part nearly goes away.<p>YMMV.')
