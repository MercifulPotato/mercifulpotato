If anyone bothered to look through that backlog (not that anyone would or should), they&#x27;d find me responding that way across a pretty full spectrum of positions and views [1], depending on whoever or whatever the commenter breaking the guidelines was going after. I don&#x27;t see why threads about pg essays should be excluded from bog-standard moderation.<p>(It&#x27;s true that I&#x27;ve also been posting some of my personal views in this thread and the last pg essay thread, but those are different from moderation replies. You can tell them apart by whether or not they say &quot;please&quot; and link to the HN guidelines.)<p>Btw also, please don&#x27;t copy&#x2F;paste comments, as you did here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25400058" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25400058</a>. It strictly lowers signal&#x2F;noise ratio.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=regardless%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=regardless%20by:dang&amp;dateRange...</a>')
