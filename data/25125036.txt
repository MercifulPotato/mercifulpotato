I&#x27;ve never been able to make an iPad-based workflow work for me. If nothing else I spend too much time with my laptop on my, well, lap and nothing with a removable keyboard works for me.<p>Based on the data I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;m not sure why they even did a with fan Pro variant. Even if the market for an 11-12&quot; model is smaller I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t do that instead. I was sure that was going to be the reason they didn&#x27;t refresh their 12&quot; Intel system.')
