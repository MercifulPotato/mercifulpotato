How they come across is different than who they are.  Every statement was a &quot;swipe&quot; at their disrespectful and unreasonable arguments, not them as a person.  If I&#x27;m not allowed to defend my ideas and position, respectfully, in the context of discussion, within site guidelines, what&#x27;s the purpose of discussion?
