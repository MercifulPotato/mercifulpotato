Modern Jews and Christians don&#x27;t understand scripture (in whole or in part) to be condoning the practice at all<p>&gt; Give me some scientific evidence instead of appealing to authority and nostalgia.<p>I have appealed to neither authority nor nostalgia, unless you want to call talking about scripture an appeal to authority. The veracity of scripture is a basic assumption in Jewish and Christian belief, and I&#x27;ll leave it at that. This thread isn&#x27;t a good place to debate that topic.')
