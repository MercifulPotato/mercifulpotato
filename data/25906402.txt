Couldn&#x27;t this be a proc macro instead of a generator? You could define a parse tree as an enum. Each field of the parse tree should implement a Parse trait and then the enum can derive its own parse trait.<p>Perhaps the output won&#x27;t be so smart if its only building the parser element by element rather than seeing the full picture. Also grammers like `&quot;(&quot; Term &quot;)&quot;` would probably be implemented as a struct and that&#x27;s a bit less developer friendly to quickly code. (Although it could be  tuple `(LParen, Term, RParen)` which isn&#x27;t too far off)<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll take a deeper look into the code when I have some free time, but I think I would prefer a proc macro based system')
