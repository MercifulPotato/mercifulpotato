The free version is pretty much the worst free video editor on Linux.<p>Both the free and premium versions are heavily crippled with virtually all common encoders and decoders either restricted or totally unavailable.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t even start unless you have an Nvidia card and use closed source proprietary drivers. Despite all the users (paid or unpaid) reporting the issues on Intel and AMD, they just ignore them. And even if they fix those issues, H.264&#x2F;H.265 encoding (premium-only) is only possible with NVENC with no CPU encoding alternative.')
