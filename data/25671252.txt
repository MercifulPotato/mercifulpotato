Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610029049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668236, text='&gt; Actually they are trying (in vain) to avoid disenfranchisement.<p>They broke the law. They committed sedition--I copy-pasted the actual definition of the law. It doesn&#x27;t matter <i>why</i> they were trying to break law, they still violated the law. They ignored all proper legal avenues to take the law into their own lands. You cannot in good faith ever claim to support the rule of law if you support what they did.<p>Let me put it like this: if I were to kill the President, I would be a murderer. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I think he&#x27;s a deranged nutcase whose continued presidency would irrevocably damage the country: I would still be committing first-degree murder, and will still deserve nothing less than to suffer the full consequences of that crime.<p>&gt; Would that apply to conspiracy to violate election law?<p>There are only 51 electoral vote certificates for the 2020 presidential election. There were only ever 51 electoral vote certificates. Some cosplayers did pretend to make electoral vote certificates to compete against, but cosplaying an electoral vote does not meet the legal requirements to create a valid electoral vote certificate. Congress&#x27;s job is to count those electoral vote certificates. 3 USC ยง15 lays out what Congress was supposed to do yesterday. There is nothing that they did that would violate their actions.<p>I&#x27;m not going to respond to all of your points because my blood pressure can&#x27;t take this, but I will close out with this comment: what happened yesterday is the electoral equivalent of <i>lynching</i>. Even if you think it is justified, it is still an extralegal attempt by a mob to execute their will, damning the due process of anyone they come across.')
