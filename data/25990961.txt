You can&#x27;t own nuclear warheads, you can&#x27;t kidnap people, and you can&#x27;t print money. The <i>act</i> of doing those things isn&#x27;t illegal. What makes that act <i>illegal</i> is the context. If those who were delegated that power are doing it, it&#x27;s not crime, it&#x27;s your responsibility. If you decide to build a reactor in your back yard, that&#x27;s crime.<p>Just because someone else can do something you can&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fraud.')
