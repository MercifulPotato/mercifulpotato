This is a combination of legal (threat of wrongful termination lawsuits, COBRA) and cultural (nobody likes to feel like a jerk boss, morale problems among the remaining employees). The rule of thumb among managers is don&#x27;t hire anybody unless you&#x27;re 90% sure they&#x27;ll work out for at least a year.<p>That creates a major roadblock for entry-level employees. No matter how much formal training somebody&#x27;s had, they&#x27;ve still never actually performed the role before. That makes it substantially riskier that they won&#x27;t fit. Even just a couple years of experience is a credible signal that the person has basic competence in the actual job.<p>What we need is another category of transitional employment, with both much lighter regulatory barriers to turnover as well as more relaxed cultural expectations about job security. In the olden days we&#x27;d call this an &quot;apprentice&quot;. Today it might be an &quot;intern&quot;, but the general expectation is that only applies to very young workers- not those reskilling to make a lateral move.')
