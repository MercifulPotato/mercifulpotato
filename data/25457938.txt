So basic non-personalized website usage statistics (analytics) <i>do not need</i> a opt-in only if it&#x27;s tracking people in any way are such opt-ins needed<p>- if you login you are known to have accepted the terms of service and as such after login no opt-in pop-up is needed either<p>- is not limited to cookies btw.<p>All in all this means that for any site not based on ad-revenue they fully can get away without needing any annoying popups, if they don&#x27;t do some sneaky questionable things.<p>Even for ad&#x27;s there are ways to do them without annoying popups, you just need to not track people, tracking the number of times a website was loaded doesn&#x27;t require annoying popups, just tracking <i>who</i> opened it does.<p>Similar if you track people only <i>after</i> they clicked on the ad you don&#x27;t need annoying popups on the site the add is one but only on the site the app navigates to (through only start tracking after opt-in). Which given that many adds try to sell you stuff and buying thinks only requires a account isn&#x27;t that big of a problem as it might seem.<p>In the end you can say the only reason there are so many annoying popups is because most companies have not intention to respect the privacy of their users. Actually if you look into it and realize that many popups are not legally conform or borderline illegal it becomes clear that they do not only not respect the users privacy but the users themself.<p>Through I have to note, that while many (most?) companies can switch to respectable advertisement, some companies can&#x27;t as easily do so.')
