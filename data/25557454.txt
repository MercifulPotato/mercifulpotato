Furthermore, all the science and engineering concepts are sound based on the physics models.<p>One thing people don&#x27;t get is we only need a tiny fraction of net positive output due to the insanely large amount of fuel available to us. 2-3% positive output is all we&#x27;re talking about and it&#x27;ll be able to economically replace most other energy sources (though it will take time to ramp up of course.)<p>Basically it&#x27;s just a matter of time and continued advances in material sciences. Purity of materials and perfection of manufacturing are the primary barriers. Operational consistency a secondary one (and continued improvement in microcontroller tech and data analysis&#x2F;AI&#x2F;etc. will help here.)<p>One example, in focus fusion, the current progress has definitely been incremental but basically every step of the way the progress has been hindered by exactly the same problem: the materials and apparatus have to be nearly perfect to increase plasma duration sufficiently; to avoid contamination of the self-sustaining plasmoid. And indeed, the progress on that end has been continuous. Once it&#x27;s proven it will be a matter of perfecting the manufacturing process and automations&#x2F;etc. to ensure that degree of material quality and device engineering and voila we&#x27;ll have cheap scalable power.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve been watching for the last 15 years, I think within 40 years is quite reasonable. In fact, I think it would not be a surprised to see consistent 0.5% net positive or better in the next 5-10 years, whether it is focus fusion or tokamak or whatever.<p>TL;DR: Fusion is a 100% sound energy generation avenue that is simply waiting for its &quot;welding&quot; moment. By which I refer to the point where gas production became suddenly economically viable due to the invention of welding (which was motivated at least partly by the desire to improve gasoline production.)')
