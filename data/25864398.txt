Hey was... okay, but missing so many features that Gmail had. Most importantly to me was literally any calendar integration, and custom domain support.<p>Instead of going back to Gmail I found Fastmail after doing some research. It&#x27;s just exactly what I want, a fast web based client that has the right features. And nothing else. Bravo to the company that makes it :)!')
