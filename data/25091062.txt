If you did a histogram of your ping for a bit you would see most values sitting near some &quot;floor&quot; of X ms and then a long right-sided tail of values much larger than X ms. It seems to look sorta like a gamma distribution from a quick test of my wi-fi ping. The mean would sit somewhere to the right of the largest mass of ping times. If you wanted to know where most pings were you could look at the median (which will sit right where most pings are). If you were interested in the really large values of X ms then you could compare the mean and median to find out just how much those slow ping responses are dragging your mean away from the median.')
