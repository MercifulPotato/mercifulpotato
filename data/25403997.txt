It&#x27;s just one of my buttons when people cherry pick something bad about Y and try to use that establish that X is therefore somehow equal or not worse. There are some people out there who even like to believe all humans are equal. As if they live in some alternate reality. I&#x27;m not implying anything about you by the way, just venting.<p>Someone else in the comments here had the gall to say there are bad physics papers therefore gender studies is no less legitimate. Which is totally nonsensical as an argument.<p>&gt; they&#x27;re interested in carving at the joints between phenomena that are taken for granted as conjoined<p>On the surface I have no issue with that.
