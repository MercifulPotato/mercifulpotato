The company had code written using Visual Age, and it needed to be ported out of it. Wasn&#x27;t too bad, considering how old it was.<p>Now I look at VS Code (Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t looked at the source code of Electron), and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much innovation visually. Most IDEs seem to follow the layout of websites - a left sidebar, a main section, and an optional right sidebar, with a footer.<p>Note: If someone here builds a different UI for IDEs, I will be an enthusiastic beta tester.<p>Behind the user interfaces, a lot of things have changed for the better. Integration with other tools in the DevOps pipeline, ability to test quickly, autocomplete tools that understand frameworks, technologies and even contexts - all that has happened behind the scenes.')
