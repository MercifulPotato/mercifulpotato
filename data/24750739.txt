And before that, a doctor.<p>And yes he worked all the hours in the day and still does and always has.<p>He has never stopped studying - he has constantly studied his whole school and working life.<p>Being really good at something takes hard work.<p>And also it makes total sense that employers seek out those people for whom it&#x27;s more than just a job - because those people tend to have a higher level of expertise.  You might not like that but the logic is reasonable.')
