So if they find a model, I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s going to be advertising unless it&#x27;s My Pillow guy and gold sellers. That probably isn&#x27;t going to float the development of the platform.<p>I do think there&#x27;s something to be said for censorship (regardless of whether it&#x27;s a private platform) and the control of misinformation as well. My point is that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s sustainable unless they find a subscription model. But given the zeal of the (far) right, it doesn&#x27;t seem outlandish.')
