And still saved the same 100000 lives!<p>That&#x27;s a problem! To any normal person, that&#x27;s a problem.<p>You&#x27;re doing this weird math where actively murdering 5 people but saving 100000 is the same as just saving 99995, but it&#x27;s not when the 5 murders were not a requirement to save 100000.<p>Maybe your confusion is thinking the safety features are the ones doing the killing when they&#x27;re not? It&#x27;s extra trimmings built on top of the safety features that are doing the killing.<p>In other words:<p>&gt; If it&#x27;s still safer than a car without those features even after falling into the trap then my reaction is a big shrug.<p>It&#x27;s not safer! Because that sentence is about the convenience features are not the safety features!<p>LKA, AEB, Crash avoidance, those all operate separately of the convenience features! And it&#x27;s not a guess about how the internals work either, Tesla literally sells things like &quot;Navigate on Autopilot&quot; separately.<p>It&#x27;s really simple logic. The safety features save lives. The convenience features, by definition, cannot save lives that the safety ones didn&#x27;t.<p>When a Tesla avoids hitting a car coming into it&#x27;s path, it&#x27;s not because Navigate with Autopilot was on, it&#x27;s the Active Safety Features function:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;autopilot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;autopilot</a><p>But when a Tesla hits a stopped firetruck after Autopilot lulled the driver into thinking they wouldn&#x27;t have to brake, the active safety features can&#x27;t do anything! Because the convenience features are subject to the same limitations as the active safety features.<p>---<p>That&#x27;s the crux of the issue that you keep missing. No one is saying the active safety features should save more lives, they&#x27;re saying the convenience features need to stop tricking people into driving distracted. Because those people sometimes die in accidents that wouldn&#x27;t have happened if they didn&#x27;t have them.<p>The safety features would still save the same number of people, just no one would die needless deaths in the name of marketing and looking cool.')
