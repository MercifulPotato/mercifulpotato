We often see such things in the form of religion, though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a hard requirement; merely a natural formation that serves as a fertile place for the kind of conversations and decisions and commitments that need to be made for such a thing to happen.<p>The values then have to extend their way out to action; this comes in the form of positive action (pushing the new message in art and media and society, proselytizing and getting converts, debating and contrasting and encouraging dialogue) and negative action (enforcing restrictions, clamping down on things that have been marked as undesirable).<p>Success in this kind of effort is informed by many factors, from the raw aesthetic of the set of values and the artifacts created around it, to the willingness of adherents to sacrifice and prioritize the cause above themselves. We sometimes see this kind of thing in fledgling political movements... and sometimes in cults. Fine line between the two!<p>Imagine such a group got power with their message: they would have competition, and it would take a lot of work. There&#x27;s a choice here: either draconian control over information (and all the negatives that go with it), or consciousness raising in amongst the population. The latter is harder, takes more time, but ultimately is the way to do this kind of thing while preserving freedom: we need to personally, individually reject negative content and work towards self-improvement and improvement in the aggregate.<p>You can imagine that when one side is selling sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll and your side is selling duty and self improvement, you&#x27;re going to have a hard fight. In fact, this is the kind of thing that the Moral Majority and its predecessors thought that they were doing, in decades past; opining for moderate censorship in specific channels (broadcast media) to help create a wholesome environment in the hopes that it would result in mentally healthy, dutiful children.<p>Say what you will about their specific choices, we can agree most of that effort has been abandoned now, because the battle for the mind has been lost; people want their creature comforts, their bread and circuses, and it&#x27;s insanely difficult to deny this when you have nothing that adequately fills the gap.<p>...<p>I think it could happen in a small group of people if they had space to live and grow and separate themselves from the decaying excesses of our culture. Groups like the Amish and Mennonites and some of the newcomer Islamic and Sikh communities demonstrate an ability to perpetuate and propagate their values to their children and others well. We may have lost this as we flushed religion our of our societies; perhaps this means there is a niche to fill to bring some semblance of discipline back without having to continually be at odds with our new scientific lens on reality.')
