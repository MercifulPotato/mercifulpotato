I&#x27;ve taken courses in primitive wilderness survival that emphasized this point pretty strongly.<p>Some types of meditation can help counteract the effects of modern life. Focusing on the present moment with a lot of awareness of your surroundings, for example, can definitely have survival benefits. A great book that delves into the mental aspects of survival situations is <i>Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why.</i><p>(I&#x27;m not claiming this has anything to do with sex scandals, it was just a side note the article mentioned. Also I&#x27;m not claiming that all forms of meditation have survival benefits.)')
