But that’s starting at a 43% price jump from the ultra low end.  However, with current battery prices a 25k EV with decent range is going to need to be cut down with near Mirage levels of options, or be closer to 30k than 25k for Tesla to profitably sell them.<p>Granted, Tesla could put a 150 mile battery in it but that’s also a major compromise.')
