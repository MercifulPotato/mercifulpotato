Check out BlockFi for example.<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t say these are the _main_ reason why Bitcoin is going up. More likely reasons:<p>- Inflation concerns from the massive QE efforts in 2020\n- Equities market are very overvalued right now, people are looking for alternate asset classes and fiat isn&#x27;t a great option (see point #1)\n- Institutional (more risk adverse) names are getting in. Ex: Mass Mutual bought $100M of BTC last week. Because this was for their general account it needed Fed approval, which is a big milestone. \n- The idea of BTC as a true alternate store of value to gold is becoming more widely accepted.<p>Specifically in regard to the point around Bitcoin as an alternative to gold, the market cap of gold is around $9T. If even half of that moves to BTC we&#x27;d hit about $130k&#x2F;BTC.')
