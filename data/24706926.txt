The result would be an enormous searchlight with a very broad beam.<p>I can&#x27;t find any solid information on the quantitative light output of the AN&#x2F;TVS-3, but xenon arc lamps typically produce 30 lumens per watt. Therefore, the 20KW AN&#x2F;TVS-3 should produce around 600,000 lumens.<p>Readily available high-power LEDs are capable of 1700 lumens, so equaling the AN&#x2F;TVS-3 would take--as a very rough ballpark that does not take into account the different light distribution between LEDs and discharge lamps--350 LEDs and optics. The AN&#x2F;TVS-3 uses 30&quot; optics, so those optics would also need to be at least 30&quot; in diameter.<p>350 30&quot; optics is a lot more like a wall of light than a searchlight. Aiming that many separate optics would also be a nightmare.')
