It would make more sense to just raise capital gains taxes and decrease dividends taxes so that there is no longer a heavy skew towards wealth building in the first place.<p>You can still get returns but they have to be paid through a dividend which generally correlates with useful economic activity. You can&#x27;t just flood the market with cheap money and then use the cheap money to pay dividends if you didn&#x27;t earn the income in the first place.<p>Borrowing money doesn&#x27;t increase the value of a company. It is neutral. If the company is spending that borrowed money on dividends then the company is losing value by exactly the amount that is paid out.')
