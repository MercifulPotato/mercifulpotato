It&#x27;s very indirect. We have an email thanking Hunter for a potential meeting. We have no confirmation from Hunter. We have no confirmation the meeting happened. We have no confirmation any quid pro quo was offered. We have no confirmation Hunter said anything to his father.<p>The laptop was supposedly dropped off a few years ago.
