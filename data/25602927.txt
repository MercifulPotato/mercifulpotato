I guess as an example more related to myself... I make mead and I&#x27;m also an amateur mycologist. Meads can be flavored with spices and fruits. I have seen some meads and beers made with mushrooms or mushroom extracts. I&#x27;ve also seen some mushroom recipes that call for yeast. If you were to make a mead infused with shaggy mane mushroom, you would vomit. Shaggy mane mushroom causes vomiting when alcohol is consumed with it.<p>This is sort of a cheat to the question though. The foods do pair well together from a flavor perspective, but there&#x27;s a physiological issue when consumed together.')
