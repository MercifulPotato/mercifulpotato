As part of the tour, we visited the executive area, where they all sat in cubicles&#x2F;rows like anyone else&#x27;s.  They even pointed out Tony&#x27;s desk, though he wasn&#x27;t around at the time.<p>I came away from that tour with two distinct impressions:\n1 - Zappos had an amazing company culture; everyone seemed to get along and really enjoy their work.\n2 - Tony Hsieh had a surprisingly large collection of half-empty liquor bottles at his desk.<p>Tony&#x27;s death is certainly a tragedy for his family and the communities he helped build.  I hope even during this pandemic we can all maintain those key relationships in life that keep us in check.')
