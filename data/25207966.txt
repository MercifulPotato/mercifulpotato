So longer names are routinely used despite apparent impossibility due to multiplication confusion.<p>No, notation is terse for other reasons. Largely driven by the very common practice of writing it by hand. If you give your new object a long name and use that very name as a symbol you&#x27;ll quickly discover that others who are interested will just abbreviate it to a letter to save effort writing it.')
