Item(by='chrisaycock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602961041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24811021, text='I was a varsity fencer, though nowhere near as good as some of the people listed in this article.<p>I have met numerous parents over the years who got their kids into fencing because it would look good for college. There is a stereotype of the SAT prep book next to a fencing bag.<p>Most of these kids quit fencing as soon as they start college. A few stick with the university team, but quit as soon as they graduate. It is rare to find someone who continues fencing at the age of 22 and isn&#x27;t trying to make the Olympic team. (Which is ironic because fencing is an individual sport that can be done the rest of someone&#x27;s life.)<p>Like the article states, there are very few fencing spots available, primarily because there are very few universities that are serious about it. Anytime a parent asks me what the chances are their kid gets a scholarship, I always ask, &quot;What&#x27;s your kid&#x27;s world ranking?&quot; From plenty of first-hand observation: if a kid isn&#x27;t in the top 100 of the world, that kid isn&#x27;t going to be recruited. (A walk-on spot will still be available for people who want to fence, but forget about getting a phone call from a coach.)')
