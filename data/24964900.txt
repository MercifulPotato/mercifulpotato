For example, humans need space to move around.  On Venus, to give people space you need to build more floating city.  On Mars, people can always go outside in their spacesuit and take a walk.<p>How do you overcome things like that on Venus?  I&#x27;m very ignorant on the subject, so any information would be very interesting.')
