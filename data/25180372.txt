But your are right that a characteristic of scientific culture is relative flexibility. What I&#x27;m saying attention to is where that famous ability to reflect and change fails, and nowhere is that more evident than in confronting the evidence that scientific culture behaves a lot more like religious culture than otherwise. And nowhere is that similarity more evident than in the piles of scientfic cultural proponents who attack anyone who dares to point out the commonality.<p>In fact, to me the most radical characteristic of science as a cultural reality (a religion) and the most clear proof of it is science&#x27;s ability to deny that it produces cultural realism. I can sum it up:<p>Science is the god that claims to not exists.<p>So when I say something like &quot;your science produces monsters&quot;, which is a mythological type language, a science proponent will often freak the fuck out and hide behind the fact that science is only a method. Yet science has birthed multiple technologies with the power to obliviate the planet, and mythology predicted it.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is that it&#x27;s time to call science what it is: a god.')
