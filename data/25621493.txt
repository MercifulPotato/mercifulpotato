I&#x27;m happy to pay for less admin and peace of mind, but obviously there&#x27;d be some point where it would be a cheaper to do it yourself.<p>&gt; How do payouts happen with Paddle in your experience? Stripe usually happens in a week for me.<p>Reliably once a month at the start of the month. Never had an issue.')
