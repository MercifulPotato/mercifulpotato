I had 3 surgeries in the US, 2 were so and so, 1 was &quot;botched&quot; in one of the most prestigious hospitals in the US (Stanford). Treated of course like no more than someone whose insurance is paying, not a follow up beyond what is required by law. I would much prefer to have my next (hopefully in a distant future) surgery in my native European country. And at least they tend to see you as a human and not a cash cow.')
