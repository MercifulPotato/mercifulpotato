It is as if, when the time comes my brain is hesitant to put that extra effort and tries to push me to take the easy route.<p>After I have spent the whole time on unproductive things, the next day morning I make up my mind to say - I should not get into this cycle. Then 11am starts and I again go into this.<p>I&#x27;m looking for some tips here on how to make myself do it.. and to understand why one does this.. is it just me or are there more people who face this same issue.')
