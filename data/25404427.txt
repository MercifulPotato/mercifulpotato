The hospital wanted us to use computer vision&#x2F;machine learning to automate their checking process. But when we went on-site, we realised that our camera setup, which provided workers a 360 view of themselves so that they didn&#x27;t need to awkwardly turn to check their behind as they had to do with regular mirrors, was far more valuable than whatever machine learning model we had built. The real problem was actually how could we make it easier for people to wear PPE so that fewer mistakes would be incurred and thus less checking required.<p>I haven&#x27;t managed to read all your posts but this one stands out to me: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20356222" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20356222</a>. The practices you mention are all areas I want to grow in. In that PPE project, as I tried to onboard other developers, things like a lack of documentation and spaghetti non-modular code made it difficult to keep up with the pace of growth we needed. So my hypothesis is that being in an environment (BigCo or other Startup) where practices are being well-used to deliver a product will stretch my capabilities so that I can better execute on my own&#x2F;in my own team.<p>In your list of suggestions, how would you prioritise what practices to learn? Or is it about identifying issues in whatever project I&#x27;m currently in, having the backlog of potential practices in mind, and then figuring out in real-time how to apply those practices to improve your product&#x2F;processes')
