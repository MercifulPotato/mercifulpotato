For example, take qmail: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abuseat.org&#x2F;qmailhelp.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abuseat.org&#x2F;qmailhelp.html</a><p><i>Qmail does late bounces for a very specific reason: since it was architected and implemented long before spam became a serious problem, Daniel J. Bernstein (DJB) implemented Qmail in a highly efficient, but inflexible way. ... Qmail is essentially dead - there is no further development on the project as a whole, users of it are stuck with an old core, and lots of ad-hoc and sometimes conflicting patches. In other words, an obsolete design, and no ongoing coordinated maintenance.</i>')
