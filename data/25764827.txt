It sounds like she was, reading this article.</i><p>Knowing nothing about the internals at Dropbox, it does sound like it (on the surface at least). Having worked at a couple major tech companies now, executives never get fired. They &quot;step down&quot;, or go on sabbatical ... and never come back. The usual hallmark of the action is that the email about it isn&#x27;t sent by the leaving executive themselves, it&#x27;s sent by their boss.<p>Normal employees don&#x27;t tend to have these options, but executives are so high profile that it seems to be an informalized practice for both company and executive to save face. It&#x27;s hard to worry about them too much though because their exit package is likely more than than most of us could make given ten years.')
