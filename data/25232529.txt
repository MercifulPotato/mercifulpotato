As a species, there is a specific number that we tend to break into, that we can conceptualize, and past that it is difficult to wrap our heads around on an instinctual level. We can cognitively grasp a nation of greater than one hundred million, just like we can cognitively grasp an ever expanding universe, but on a visceral level, it doesn&#x27;t exist. So, you&#x27;ll have to tackle breaking down people into units they can comprehend on a visceral level while maintaining a national identity and not creating splinter groups and intergroup competition. No small feat.<p>Second is the actual governance of this 100+ million people. The actual administration and paperwork (well digital and greatly automated, hopefully). But, the communication, repairs, money system, transportation, food network, etc. etc. For a group this size, this is a Herculean task to be orchestrated and to keep out corruption, good luck.... Oh yeah. Crime and military fall into this category, as well.<p>There are others that I can&#x27;t think of off the top of my head, but there are more. The best way (at least to me) is to think of an abstract. The horrible question, &quot;What does a liberal democracy of 100+ million animals of this type require?&quot; Then break down those answers into solutions. Usually those solutions are code functions, but in this case they are practical solutions.')
