It has a Certificate Policy OID inside it, which is 2.23.140.1.2.2 for OV<p>This is set side in section 7.1.6.1 &quot;Reserved Certificate Policy Identifiers&quot; of the Baseline Requirements, although you could just Google it because OIDs are unique.<p>Cloudflare, as issuer, have confirmed that Cloudflare, the certificate subscriber, are really Cloudflare, because they&#x27;re the same entity. That&#x27;s actually an allowed shortcut, and, I&#x27;d argue, one of the most secure possibilities for such validation of business entities.<p>If you were wondering if this is really <i>Visa</i> that doesn&#x27;t help you at all. For that you&#x27;d best rely on the fact that visa.com is the domain you care about and so logically Visa must have authorised Cloudflare to serve this name.<p>The predecessor of this site, back in summer, was not on Cloudflare, that too had an OV certificate, but for &quot;Visa International Service Association&quot; in Foster City. I guess somebody decided that letting Cloudflare handle this was cheaper&#x2F; easier.<p>Edited to add: Predecessor&#x27;s certificate <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crt.sh&#x2F;?id=3134907318" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crt.sh&#x2F;?id=3134907318</a>')
