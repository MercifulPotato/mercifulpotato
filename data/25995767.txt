The card below it, the GTX 780, was $650, which is still more expensive than any current generation consoles. Meanwhile the current top and 2nd tier GeForce cards (3090 and 3080) have MSRPs of $1500 and $700, which are more expensive, but not outrageously so. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to paint a picture of the market from 2008-2017 as affordable in contrast with the current expensive market.')
