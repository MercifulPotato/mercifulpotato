Don&#x27;t know if you were in the music game back then, but they way it played out was:<p>- Logic had the pole position for non-pro-tools music at the time, and sold (IIRC) for about $600<p>- Apple bought Logic and stated publicly &quot;we will not discontinue it on windows&quot;<p>- I think a year later, might have been two, they cancelled it on windows<p>- Some time later, they dropped the price, and also put out garage band, using Logic&#x27;s engine.<p>- Logic&#x27;s product roadmap (from what I&#x27;ve heard) became more general user friendly (can&#x27;t attest to this personally though)<p>Basically, anything Apple owns becomes part of the plan to get you on a mac and iEverything, secondary to whatever it&#x27;s originally purpose is. I won&#x27;t touch any music software now that doesn&#x27;t run on at least 2 operating systems. Fortunately most of them now realize the importance of this.<p>I&#x27;d recommend looking at other options like Reaper, Cubase, or Digital Performer, all of which have been improving steadily and can on windows or OSX.<p>Personally I&#x27;m sticking on High Sierra, and doubt my next machine will be a mac. Man I&#x27;m going to miss Bash everywhere though. Sigh')
