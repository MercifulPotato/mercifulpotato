As a recipient of several thousand in my work email over the years, as an IT contact, I often wonder who’s writing them, and if I was on a list or directly targeted.  Although I can offer my anecdote as a lead about the two I have responded to- 1) sent on New Year’s Day offering basketball tickets to a suite for a meet and greet, and 2) a $50 Amazon gift card for doing a 5 minute survey.')
