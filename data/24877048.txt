Most people think of Jeff Bezos as the creator of the company. “In fact, to be completely technically true about it, he is the founder. But I was talking to him about joining him on the venture before the company was incorporated. He basically was just arriving from the East Coast and setting up his house when I moved up from California. All that existed of Amazon was on paper at that point. Jeff was working on it full-time already, and his wife, Mackenzie, was writing checks every once in a while. But that was it. I didn’t get founder’s stock. It didn’t seem worth the argument at the time, although I kind of felt like, well, you know, I mean I was there at the beginning. And it was all going to work out the same way, one way or the other, regardless of the technicalities. And it just didn’t seem like something that I wanted to make a big deal about at the time.”<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekwire.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;meet-shel-kaphan-amazoncom-employee-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekwire.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;meet-shel-kaphan-amazoncom-emp...</a>')
