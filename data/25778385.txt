Both are subjective and, frankly, plain BS.<p>&gt; if you are truly dedicated to the craft of software you probably should want them to learn Elixir<p>Oh boy,  I don’t even know where to start... so you’re basically implying that Erlang programmers are not “truly dedicated to the craft of software”?  It would be laughable if it wasn’t just sad.<p>This is the Ruby world mentality that just rubs me the wrong way. Not even worth carrying on with the discussion.')
