With many people treating the game like the second coming of gaming Jesus a lot of the disappointment was pretty much guaranteed.<p>Personally I didn&#x27;t expect anything like that, I was hoping for an open world Deus Ex like, with a more &quot;colorful&quot; setting, and that&#x27;s pretty much what I got.<p><i>&gt; not to mention this game is very badly optimized on AMD systems the current gaming king.</i><p>AMD has been the &quot;current gaming king&quot; only since Zen 3 desktop release, which happened <i>just last month</i>, most of these CPUs are still completely impossible to buy at actual MSRP.<p>Regardless of that even Zen 2 is mostly performing very well with the game [0], which the HEXedit fix will only improve once it&#x27;s patched in officially.<p>In that context this complaint sounds very much like still complaining about the lack of an epilepsy warning; Sure it&#x27;s not great to overlook something like that, but it&#x27;s inane to act as if these are unfixable and nonredeemable issues, particularly in an industry where &quot;games a service&quot;, releasing early access products, has become the new low-key norm even for much bigger publishers.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-pRI7vXh0JU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-pRI7vXh0JU</a>')
