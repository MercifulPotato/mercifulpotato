It is rather how Android is packaged.  There is F-Droid type of store out there, it is just that it is not in the play store.  As for iOS there really no proper way to install except jailbreaking any way.  The bottom we don&#x27;t need another App Store, rather a FOSS distribution of OS for Android (e.g:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.replicant.us&#x2F;about.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.replicant.us&#x2F;about.php</a> ) that kind like the Debian distro for desktop Linux.  As for iOS, is Darwin still open source, maybe a distro for iPhone with an open source Darwin fork?')
