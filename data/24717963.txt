Also, essentially nobody was infected with COVID in January, so you are just flat out being disingenuous. You could as well go back to November if you really want to make the numbers look good for your argument.<p>&gt; I get why people thought it was 10-20x in the beginning<p>It <i>was</i> 10x in the beginning. It averaged 12x for an entire <i>month</i>. It was 15x for numerous days in a row, and this is despite it infecting far fewer people than the flu. It was why we had a massive global lockdown, mask mandates, social distancing, the whole shitshow, in case you missed that.<p>At this point I am inclined to disengage because you, specifically, have been all over every single COVID thread with the same misinformation and distortions. Frankly, it&#x27;s tiring. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the numbers are anymore. Never did. &quot;Just a flu&quot;. smh.')
