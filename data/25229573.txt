There is no priesthood of &quot;subject matter experts&quot; who are the only ones capable of studying and interpreting mortality data from the CDC website. There is a very clear anomaly here, that all non-COVID causes of death have reduced at the same time and by the same amount as COVID deaths have increased in 2020 (as compared with all previous years in available history). This is indeed a very interesting observation that requires explanation, rather than suppression by &quot;experts.&quot;')
