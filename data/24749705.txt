If they drop their bad business practices, I will switch back. For now I’m really feeling the need for competition.<p>Heads up, Apple Music doesn’t sound as good as Spotify, unfortunately. Tidal is better overall in my experience and as far as I can tell they’re not being anticompetitive in any way.')
