Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=[25412852], score=None, time=1607873466, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401519, text='<i>&gt; It seems to me the subtle miscommunication between billionaires and the rest of us is the rest of us are asking “what ever will you do with a dynasty” and many billionaires, I think, have a mental model of “I have proven I can employ this wealth more effectively than bureaucrats, and I like to solve big problems, and wealth makes it easier to solve big problems.”</i><p><i>&gt; This is a huge generalization we could easily find counter-examples and counter-arguments for, but we could also probably find fair arguments FOR this view, like Bill Gates.</i><p>You&#x27;re correct in identifying the mental model in operation, but you&#x27;re missing the fact that the people in question are profoundly deluded.<p>Staggering piles of money (including Bill Gates&#x27;) were, almost without exception, a result of the ability to capture value, not the ability to create it. And this is worth noting: many of the most significant decisions that led to increasing the value being captured were value destroying, such as &quot;Windows isn&#x27;t done until Lotus won&#x27;t run&quot;.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that value wasn&#x27;t created at all (quite a lot was), but only that it isn&#x27;t quite what is measured by, and rewarded with, wealth.<p>In the most benign cases of extreme wealth, much (even most) of the value captured IS also created by the person or organization doing the capturing, but invariably, more value is being captured than created (or at least, the market believes that will eventually be the case).')
