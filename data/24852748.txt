Most video content <i>is</i> exclusive to a single platform already?  If you think HBO, Disney+, Netflix originals, etc., are too expensive, you don&#x27;t have other options there either in paying less from someone else.  Why should you expect to be able to do so??<p>If anything YouTube is the most open platform by far, because the vast majority of the content on there is owned by the creators, not YouTube, and thus it <i>could</i> be on other platforms, in a way that will never happen with the paid streaming services.  Indeed this is even happening with CuriosityStream.')
