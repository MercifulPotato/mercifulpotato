In the post-climate-catastrophe world depicted there, there&#x27;s scarcity of energy sources; no energy-dense fuels to power modern technological civilization. The society described in the book instead learned to rely on gravity and mechanical energy, stored in springs big and small[1]. Small springs were used as portable batteries, and everyday technology was ruthlessly optimized to be as energy-efficient as possible.<p>I wonder how much space for this kind of innovation is there to be have? And with modern electrical batteries, is there even a point to storing mechanical energy and avoiding the mechanical -&gt; electrical -&gt; mechanical conversion flow?<p>--<p>[0] - As another biopunk novel to read after Change Agent.<p>[1] - Small springs are wound manually, but one biopunk part here is the use of beasts of burden, genetically engineered for maximum efficiency of converting food to mechanical energy, to wind up large springs and power other machinery.')
