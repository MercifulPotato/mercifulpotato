I really enjoyed the Travelers for example but it sucked for it to end as it did.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that I tend to not watch shows when they&#x27;ve just been released, especially when it&#x27;s the second season of something I like. Instead, I wait until I have the time to enjoy the show but at at that point me viewing it doesn&#x27;t count in the metrics Netfix uses to decide in favor of continuing the show.<p>Right now though, I feel ambivalent about starting a new show on netflix because I don&#x27;t want to be disappointed in the ending.')
