E.g., mine is normally online shopping, but when I needed a leak repaired on my work, I waited until near the end month, flipped the category to home improvement, paid the roofing bill, and then on the first of the next month flipped it back to online hopping.<p>Without the tiered rewards, it is 3% cash back for the selected category, 2% grocery stores and wholesale clubs, 1% everything else.<p>The tiers are at $20k, $50k, and $100k in BofA or Merrill checking&#x2F;savings&#x2F;investment accounts (3 month average combined balance). First tier gets you 1.25x the base rewards. Second tier is 1.5x. Third tier is 1.75x.')
