So, my theory is that the countries that will succeed over the next decades are the ones which can protect themselves from foreign influence, by kicking out foreign interest groups, &quot;aid&quot; agencies, investments, apps, &quot;news&quot; sites etc. which India is doing. The obvious side effect will be that legitimate concerns and legitimate organizations which are detrimental to the establishment will also be suppressed. But I don&#x27;t think there is a way to not do that.')
