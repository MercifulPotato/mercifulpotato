They do not desire tyranny, they think they&#x27;re fighting it.<p>And finally, there&#x27;s a fundamental willing-ignorance on the left when it comes to actually understanding these people. Even if you think they need to be stopped - heck, even if you think they <i>are</i> fundamentally evil - you have to be willing to look at where they&#x27;re coming from, and what&#x27;s motivating them, if you want to be able to deal with the situation in any remotely effective way. And yet there&#x27;s this extreme hostility to the very idea that these people <i>could</i> ever be understood as anything more than demons with pitchforks and pointy tails.<p>They&#x27;ve been pushed and warped by fearful emotions, and economic hardship, and incendiary rhetoric and misinformation (some of which comes from sources that definitely know exactly what they&#x27;re doing and are not simply misguided). And there&#x27;s a debate to be had as to how many and to what degree they can be walked back from the brink of extremism at this point. But at the bottom of it all, they are people. And we will never make progress - whether you see progress as unity or simply as the disarming of a movement - until we start trying to understand.')
