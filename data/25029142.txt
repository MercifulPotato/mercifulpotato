Many people do it because sometimes it is cheaper. Businesses tend to require it for ease of processing or because it&#x27;s legitimate and secure. Like say a guy wants 6k car from your dealership and will pay in cash. For all you know it could&#x27;ve been stolen as part of a crime. That cashed he paid can be seized, potentially even with the vehicle. If it was done through a bank, the headache and loss is now on the bank instead.<p>In my experience as an american, to survive and have wealth, you need to be an accountant with your budget. Almost like treating your personal lifestyle as a business enterprise. Including all the wants and toys for yourself. It&#x27;s a very simple thing to do even but many people forgo it it and just look at their bank account number, often forgetting the oncoming loan payment, things payed with a check, ach&#x27;s, etc.<p>A good one people forget is student loans or cash out refinancing. That money in your bank account isn&#x27;t equity. It is an asset offset by a liability. If you have 6k in cash but a 5k loan, your net worth is 1k. Most Americans just see the 6k, forget the 5k, and think that aforementioned 6k is free to be spent as they see fit.<p>Most Americans are just brained spendathon morons with money. Look at the money people donate to streamers! It still floors me people just make absurd donations...for what? Someone to play videogames on the internet? Not to mention juggling social status with finances, most Americans tend to opt for the status symbol as opposed to the cash in the bank. This is why you see college kids with escalades or camaros when they don&#x27;t even have a reasonable job to afford a payment on them.')
