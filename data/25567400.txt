Where else can&#x27;t you live?  Or, rather, must one live in the middle of nowhere to live the 1930s idyll?<p>If that&#x27;s all you want to claim, then I claim I can live like a hunter gatherer from 19300 BCE in the middle of the woods.  Big deal.  You haven&#x27;t shown me anything.<p>Did you want to even begin to address how I can go to the doctor?  Or are we conveniently leaving that out?  I don&#x27;t think you have even begun to touch the &quot;general point.&quot;')
