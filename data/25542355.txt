Python is nice to work with, javascript is easy to observe in the browser. Both languages are useful and rich.<p>Whatever you choose, find some tutorials online and start. At least for python, I usually recommend &quot;Automate the Boring Stuff with Python&quot; or &quot;Learn Python the Hard Way&quot;, however, you can find many more.<p>The two other things you will need are a code editor and some understanding of the command line. VS code is a good editor, though notepad++ might be okay as well, because it has less features and would be easy to begin with. The command line is a different than the usual way to rund programs, but it is not all that difficult for the basic stuff you will need on the start.<p>Good luck and never be ashamed to ask questions.')
