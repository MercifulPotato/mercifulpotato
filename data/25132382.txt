The ground-based ICBMs haven&#x27;t been upgraded in decades and probably don&#x27;t work well. The subs were supposed to be replaced but were not and there aren&#x27;t that many of them at sea at any given time. And the bomber fleet is out-of-date as well and way overdue for an upgrade.<p>It&#x27;s questionable whether or not it cannot be defeated with some kind of sneaky first strike. Which leaves room for an adversary to find (or think they found) an opening. This could end up being the biggest mistake in history.<p>A good option seems to be to pay SpaceX to create a fourth prong of floating  platform ICBMs in the ocean, or whatever Musk &amp; co can come up with. Of course the U.S. gov should have full command of it.<p>SpaceX could also work on a redundant anti-North Korea missile defense system. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much reason to work on a missile defense system against the major powers, since a solid M.A.D. system makes an attack from them highly unlikely.<p>SpaceX should put the Assured back in Mutually Assured Destruction. And they can use the profits from these projects to make life multi-planetary, which would provide another level of insurance for humanity.')
