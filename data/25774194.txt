In terms of “bad things to do to humans”, it comes in <i>just</i> behind eugenics, and that&#x27;s only because we haven&#x27;t worked out how to do that without horrible horrible crimes against humanity (yet). (Yes, natural selection is legitimately bad enough that “make eugenics  less genocidey and then do that instead” is actually on the table – I am <i>so</i> glad the problem can probably keep for another century or two, so I won&#x27;t have to be responsible if we end up with some dystopia or other.)<p>These aren&#x27;t good things. I mean, war <i>does</i> accomplish them, but… I&#x27;d rather they weren&#x27;t accomplished.')
