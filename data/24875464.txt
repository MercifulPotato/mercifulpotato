The intellectually corteous and honest\nresponse to a comment with which one does not agree is to try and understand\nthe reasoning of the comment. Not to claim that there is only one possible\nexplanation and therefore the comment must be wrong. That is just a straw man\nin sheep&#x27;s clothing.<p>And this is not surprising given that it comes at the heels of nitpicking\nabout supposedly important terminology (<i>necessarily!</i>). This is how\ndiscussions like this one go, very often. And that&#x27;s why they should be\navoided, because they just waste everyone&#x27;s time.')
