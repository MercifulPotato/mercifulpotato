Usually what happens is we discover that &quot;self-made&quot; millionaires grew up in quite affluent circumstances, perhaps not with millionaire parents, but with parents who earned a sufficient income to themselves retire as millionaires. That is to say, they aren&#x27;t &quot;self-made&quot;. It isn&#x27;t meaningful to compare their accumulation of wealth to the struggles of those born in less favorable circumstances.<p>There are no &quot;self-made&quot; billionaires. Or very, very few (WhatsApp founder Jan Koum is literally the only one I can think of who comes close). Every single high-profile billionaire today--Gates, Buffet, Zuckerberg, Bezos, Musk, etc.--came from a family with substantial financial means and social connections.')
