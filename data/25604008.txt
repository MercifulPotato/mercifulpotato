The political goals of developing collaborations between member-states is far more important than delivering a gadget or a trinket.<p>Similarly, we have the Erasmus program that enable higher-education students to spend a year in a school from a member state somewhere in Europe. It&#x27;s disingenuous to assume the goal of the Erasmus program is solely academic.')
