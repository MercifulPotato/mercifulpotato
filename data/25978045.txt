At the toplevel of a project, I like to have only &quot;src&quot;, &quot;tests&quot;, &quot;docs&quot;, &quot;examples&quot; and eventually &quot;containers&quot; if I provide Docker images. With go, it seems that everything should be at the toplevel (or maybe I haven&#x27;t seen nicely structured projects yet?).')
