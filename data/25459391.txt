Ambien is worse, in that it can make you feel like you are going to sleep, but you will not get into the deep states of sleep required for the brain to detoxify itself.  The same is true for weed. Some folks use weed to help themselves sleep, but they are actually depriving themselves of the 4 stages of deep sleep.  Chronic use of Ambien, weed and other drugs can cause a person to have mild hallucinations, delirium tremens or worse.<p>This will be an unpopular opinion, but I believe the better method of improving sleep is to improve eating habits, go easy on caffeine, get exercise, get rid of artificial light hours before going to sleep and stay away from people and things that cause you stress.   Easier said than done.')
