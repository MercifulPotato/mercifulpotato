To blow it off as marginal is disingenuous at best.<p>I take no issue with app developers creating and selling an app off the app store. I don&#x27;t think Apple should be able to interfere with that. I do believe they have the right to restrict another app distributed within the app store from being able to sell apps itself. That would be like Steam allowing Epic to install from its app to sell additional games&#x2F;apps through the Epic store.')
