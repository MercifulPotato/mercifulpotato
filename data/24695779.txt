We don&#x27;t have a server, nor anyone who knows how to manage one. We&#x27;d need to ask IT, that will take months and they&#x27;ll require a budget transfer, so we&#x27;d need to request it to management (which will need a business case to convince) and involve the finance guys. We can&#x27;t just plug a RaspberryPi into the wall, not only that would get me fired, but also it wouldn&#x27;t be able to connect to anything without the company&#x27;s certificates for the proxy or whatever.<p>Second, we need people who can code in PHP (and their backups when they leave). Probably in practice we&#x27;d need IT to do that, so that&#x27;s more months and budget required.<p>Obviously anything stored in the cloud is out of the question, just the authorizations and contracts to do that would take a year.<p>So in the end it ends up as a shared spreadsheet.')
