Although it is technically no longer his money, he still has a significant amount of control over how it is spent, and that money increases is political power and influence.<p>And it is not just Bill Gates and a foundation. If I donate $50 to a charity, it is unlikely I have any influence. It is truly not my money.<p>If however, I donate $50,000,000 to a charity, I exert a lot of control with that money. I can have a huge influence on the direction of the charity, and even likely get somebody fired or appointed to the board of directors.<p>I am not saying those donations should be illegal, just that we should see that it is different qualitively from a regular donation and not give it tax advantages.')
