Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=[25163634], score=None, time=1605897382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159309, text='&gt; No companies on HerJobs are hiring based on gender or country.<p>If that&#x27;s true, then why would these companies be on HerJobs (a platform which - as far as I can tell - seems to be designed specifically to facilitate hiring based on gender or country)?<p>I definitely agree that we need more diversified pipelines, but I don&#x27;t agree that creating a restricted pipeline is the way to go about it; this seems more likely to be used as a means to get token women of color on teams for diversity points than anything.  It seems more patronizing than anything - like women from emerging countries are somehow fundamentally unable to stand out in existing pipelines and thus need their own pipeline.  A less patronizing solution would be to figure out why women from emerging countries are underrepresented in existing pipelines and address those factors <i>there</i>.<p>As it stands, I&#x27;m getting a strong &quot;binders full of women&quot; vibe from this, especially since I know full well that your average company will use it exactly in that way: to check off diversity boxes and make it look like they&#x27;re &quot;woke&quot; as a substitute for actually-meaningful workplace gender&#x2F;ethnic reform.<p>I wish y&#x27;all the best of luck, because this is definitely a problem worth solving; I just don&#x27;t feel like this is the right way to go about it, or at the very least that it needs some refinement and adjustment to avoid doing more harm than good.')
