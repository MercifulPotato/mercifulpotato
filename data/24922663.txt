The issue is that the number of games that just work is small not large as it was implied.  Some popular games will have some patches you need to compile into wine or find a pre-build version with those and other less popular games don&#x27;t work or worse stop working half way through(happened for me with Elex),<p>I would say if you want to play games on Linux that are not official  you will need to be prepared for some reading and trial and error, do you disagree ?')
