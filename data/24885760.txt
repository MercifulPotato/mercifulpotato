It just works for me.<p>I think X11 not seeing a lot of development doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it&#x27;s abandonware, it&#x27;s probably more that people like me who still use it feel like it&#x27;s effectively feature-complete.<p>And I won&#x27;t take the word from some graphics hardware vendor that it is abandonned. Over the years they&#x27;ve always done the bare minimum to support the Linux desktop so of course they&#x27;ll take the first opportunity to claim that X is &quot;abandonware&quot; so that they have a plausible excuse for dropping support.')
