Seems like nonsense[1] to me.<p>^ This is you stating that fact checking isn&#x27;t used by malicious actors and there is no evidence to show it is.<p>I just demonstrated with evidence that it is.<p>You are now trying to twist your way out of this by equating &quot;fact checkers&quot; (IE major organisation presenting opinions as facts that are not up for debate) and the act of correcting misinformation as one and the same thing.<p>Twisting of words is one of many dishonest tactics used by progressives in debate and it&#x27;s the same one you are attempting to use right now.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m good at pointing out dishonest tactics and people who use them in debate, I wouldn&#x27;t continue.<p>Also while this is going down this path, I&#x27;m going to bring up the narcissists prayer so we can refer back to it later if you continue with this approach.')
