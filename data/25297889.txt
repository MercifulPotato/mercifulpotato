Unless you assume that value traded in a market is perfectly efficient (which it&#x27;s not) the value signal is going to degrade over time. so, how long can you trust that the &quot;chain of investment&quot; faithfully represents value added? a year? ten years? how about investments in companies that have been around for 50, 75, 100 years? Why is it that we take as a given that ownership of value necessarily connotes the owner is themselves valuable?')
