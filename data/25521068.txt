(Because they are typed as well)<p>... so that’s the whole problem domain.<p>No move of goal post. And no, like I said with things like typescript (And flow or Sorbet) you don’t need to compile any binary at all let a lone a single one.<p>Also: a monolith does not refer to a single binary it refers to a single application code base. (You can have monoliths in Ruby&#x2F;Python&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;php&#x2F;etc where no binary is produced)<p>I think you are misunderstanding what I’m saying, because I’m basically saying the same thing again:<p>- service A consumes service B\n- they are both type checked (as you readily admit)\n- the call site of service B in service A is type checked as well.\n- there are 0 points in the code or interactions that are not type checked.')
