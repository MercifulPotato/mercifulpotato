Starting salary for grads at FANGs is around a third of what it is at large US cities when living costs are no more than 30-40% lower for example. Compared to rest of Europe London is a lot better with notable exception of Switzerland which is a non-EU country. So to me it would seem that membership in EU is not a necessary condition for good tech jobs with competitive pay.<p>I&#x27;d be a lot more worried about the general shift to working from home than leaving EU when it comes to London&#x27;s importance as a tech center.')
