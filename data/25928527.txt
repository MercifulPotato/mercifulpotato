I have even developed my own keyboard layouts for assignments using genetic programming and I have a pet project using a chorded keyboard, but I wanted to have something relatively standard and well known and likely to be supported by keycap manufacturers. I&#x27;m sure there are better layouts, but Dvorak being a well-known standard trumps most of them.<p>PS- just got notification that my Moonlander Mk1 shipped today!')
