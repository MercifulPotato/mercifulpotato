Therapists are humans.<p>Of course, this kind of raises the question: So therapists <i>have</i> their own biases and we&#x27;re just blinding ourselves to which ones they have?  Is that actually an improvement?  (Cf. the koan where Sussman says &quot;I am wiring a neural net randomly because I don&#x27;t want it to have any preconceptions&quot;.)<p>Perhaps the therapist having to pretend she has no background actually kind of helps her disconnect from it.  A kind of theatre.  (And maybe the brain having a habit of &quot;when in this office talking with patients, don&#x27;t connect anything to your real life&quot; is useful.)  But I would still wonder if it would work better to bring the issue into the open, and say &quot;Well, I do have this background, which might lead me to think x, but I will consciously try to counteract that.&quot;  Perhaps there are cases where this second strategy is indeed better (if the patient comes in thinking &quot;I expect almost everyone to be prejudiced against me&quot;, and the psychiatrist says &quot;Well, you&#x27;re right, but I have lots of practice in noticing my prejudices and setting them aside, and it is a point of professional pride for me to do that&quot;), but most of the time it&#x27;s just faster and less distracting to not mention the issue at all.')
