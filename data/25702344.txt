The concept is that you can simulate reading Chinese textbook passages, except with any text you choose, so it is more contextually relevant and interesting to learn.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duguo-app.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duguo-app.com</a><p>Right now, it only offers pinyin as a phonetic guide -- I&#x27;m looking to add zhuyin next.
