So not the “whole” explanation, but the critical mass of why it works, sure.<p>It’s questionable to assume that Norway’s system could scale up by a factor of even 3x, let alone something sixty times the size. I’d be interested if it could produce results in a country like Spain or France with <i>50m</i> people before calling on the US to simply do what Norway does but with <i>350m</i> people.')
