I don&#x27;t think debating the use of the term &quot;alt-coin&quot; is material.<p>That is just entirely untrue. :(  Whoever fed you that idea was confused or outright lying to you.<p>Lightning is a technique for using Bitcoin&#x27;s smart contracting ability to pay bitcoin without bringing each and every transaction to the network.<p>The basic idea is that you take some Bitcoin and set a script on it that says that if there is a disagreement over who owns it, the involved parties will post to the ledger the last record in an external ownership transcript which is signed by the involved parties, and if anyone cheats and posts an outdated record, anyone else can post proof that a later entry existed and all the coins go to the non-cheating party.<p>With this in place, the parties can then transact back and forth securely as fast as they can sign and send Bitcoin transactions to each other without any global broadcast taking place.  Taking it a step further, collections of these transactions can be made mutually atomic so that they&#x27;re all successful or all fail (essentially by making them conditional on a common secret).  This is how lightning makes it possible to pay people you&#x27;ve never transacted with before, by routing on a graph of these pairwise payments (that&#x27;s what the &#x27;network&#x27; in lightning network refers to).<p>All the transactions exchanged between participants are Bitcoin transactions-- which could be posted at any time to the network at the participant&#x27;s whim, they refrain from doing so to save fees--, the system is built from the novel programmatic ability of Bitcoin, and it is completely ununsable without Bitcoin (or some clone that copies the required functionality, of course).<p>This kind of channelized usage of Bitcoin was foreseen by Bitcoin&#x27;s creator and enabled by the consensus rules of the protocol from day one (particularly: nlocktime and sequence numbers which were explicitly added to support channels).')
