The only thing to do is get on our knees and beg God for forgiveness.<p>I’m not even kidding. As I get older, I am just more and more disgusted by our kind. Any redeeming aspect of a human being is inevitably outweighed by their cowardice, greed, gluttony, ignorance, cruelty.<p><i>Get on your knees and beg God for forgiveness</i>. Every human being is wretched just like the class of phony business leaders. You, me, every last one of us.<p>Edit: to the concerned (thank you):<p>I’ll live. I have found this realization to be liberating actually. We can and should hope and aspire to better the world around us, but it is ultimately doomed by its inhabitants and the only investment that ultimately makes sense is to recognize our fallen nature and hope that God exists so that someone may forgive us.<p>And the flip side of this is that there is so much potential for joy and happiness in the world despite our fallen nature. Enjoy what you can find but remember that you will in the end be disappointed by both your fellow man and yourself.')
