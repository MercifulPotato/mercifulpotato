There&#x27;s a lot of knee-jerk reaction against Black Lives Matter, and an eagerness to establish who the leaders are so it and everyone involved can be discredited. However, it&#x27;s not an organization, it&#x27;s a movement. Do you think the lives of black people matter? Then you&#x27;re part of Black Lives Matter.')
