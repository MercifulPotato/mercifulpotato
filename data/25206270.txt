Number of files processed? Data left to be copied?). The frontend developer could show changing Matrix glyphs instead and the widget would be functionally equivalent but without giving the user false impressions.[1]<p>Given that as a standard, it&#x27;s difficult for me to find more outrage for Turbotax misusing this already mendacious widget.<p>1: Some smarty pants is going to say that at least the percentage is directional and shifting Matrix glyphs are not. Unfortunately, even that isn&#x27;t true-- UIs have a long history of <i>multiple</i> sequential progress bars with no indication how many there are in total-- see Office Space. So progress widgets have burned through user trust long ago-- even if I&#x27;ve experienced Windows 10 having a single percentage counter that persists across restarts, perhaps the next update will be the time they break that pattern.')
