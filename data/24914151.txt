Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603849826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24913930, text='&gt; there were plenty of other equally hot choices, like Yahoo<p>That&#x27;s one. And if you admit Google was a &quot;hot&quot; choice at the time, that already makes my point.<p>&gt; Google&#x27;s candidates weren&#x27;t &quot;highly motivated&quot;<p>No?<p>&gt; Contrary to your assertion<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you take my assertion to be, but let me clarify. My assertion is that if a workplace is &quot;hot&quot; for whatever reason -- rapid growth, high compensation, world-changing product, number of users, prestige, etc. -- then a large number of good candidates will apply there, and almost any hiring method will probably work out for them.<p>When you talk about Google hiring only from elite CS programs, it&#x27;s crucial to note that Larry and Sergey came from Stanford specifically, so of course they&#x27;re going to hire people from Stanford. That&#x27;s always how it goes, as I mentioned earlier with founders and early employees. Let&#x27;s not pretend that&#x27;s a &quot;hiring process&quot;. It&#x27;s a personal network. A number of other people from Stanford were also early Google employees. Scott Hassan, et al. They got seed money from the co-founder of Sun Microsystems. The next year, they got $25 million in VC. When I was in college in Wisconsin, there was nobody around to fund anything! Almost all of the big tech companies were built from informal personal networks, and they only institute a rigid hiring process after they&#x27;re already somewhat successful. Again, any no-name company can have an ultra-high bar for hiring, but that doesn&#x27;t magically attract candidates willing to apply and put themselves through hell to get hired.')
