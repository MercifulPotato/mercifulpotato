Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607219968, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25317299, text='<i>&gt; group norms have evolved over time, incorporating the experiences and knowledge of many people</i><p>While this can often be true, it&#x27;s not always true. Furthermore, it&#x27;s often a testable hypothesis, and in those cases, it should be tested, not just assumed.<p>Also, the &quot;conformity&quot; case in the article involves a group of people (the confederates trying to manipulate the unwitting test-taker) who are <i>violating</i> a common norm (namely, that the normal behavior of people when a fire alarm goes off and smoke is seen is to get out, not calmly continue going about their business). So that case is not testing &quot;how well do you follow group norms that make sense&quot;; it&#x27;s testing &quot;how willingly will people follow a group that is doing something that obviously does <i>not</i> make sense&quot;. That&#x27;s a different thing.')
