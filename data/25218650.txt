It&#x27;s irritating to read. Complexity and nuance are sacrificed because the writer values concision over truthfulness.<p>You can see the problem in the first two sentences of the article:<p>&quot;To write well is to think clearly.<p>If you can think clearly, you can find something worth saying.&quot;<p>These are pleasant aphoristic paragragraphs, but what they say is not actually true. They gesture towards something true, but the drive to simplicity has turned potentially interesting points into falsehoods.<p>And the next sentence is both false and damaging. Good writing is most definitely not &quot;therapy that you publish for the world to learn from&quot;.<p>(Plus, the writer should give balanced sentences a rest. They&#x27;re useful to have in the rhetorical toolbox, but quickly become tedious when overused.)')
