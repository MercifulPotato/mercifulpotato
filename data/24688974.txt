To be fair, I believe there are some design mistakes underlying JS, but even C has its blemishes.<p>IMHO one of the reasons why people are so negative about JS is that they have in mind older versions. Pre-ECMAScript 2015 JS is really bad; ES6 is a reasonable and modern language, it is in fact my go-to language when I want to write something quick and dirty.<p>Java is also like this. Java pre-8 is an unusable stinking turd of a language, Java 8 is tolerable, Java 11 is a modern language that I have few complaints about.<p>Same with C++ pre&#x2F;post cpp11. I&#x27;m sure there are more examples as well.')
