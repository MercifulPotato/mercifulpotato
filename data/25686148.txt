From small websites&#x2F;businesses to large (and especially gargantuan!) are more and more likely to contract out email delivery to a specialized provider (e.g. SendGrid, Mandrill&#x2F;Mailchimp, etc).<p>Even if you focus on transactional emails only (e.g. signup&#x2F;order verification, password resets, billing notifications, etc) where users are implicitly or explicitly opted in... the amount of mail volume involved is massive.<p>Given that this is a pure overhead charge, you can be sure that email providers are going to pass the cost on to the senders (e.g. whoever owns the relationship with the end-user). The larger that organization is the more likely they&#x27;ll build that into the cost of the product and pass it down to the user.<p>SPF&#x2F;DKIM&#x2F;etc are a huge help. Even when spammers use it correctly it provides reliable attribution for establishing (or rather, destroying) reputation for the domain involved. I would love to see something more and think your intuition is good: an increase to the cost of send email is more likely to weed out illegitimate&#x2F;unwanted messages.')
