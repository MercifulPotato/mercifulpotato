I&#x27;m certainly in that neighborhood on most days. If the search results are even just slightly worse, say costing a second more to scan, or - worse - you spend time visiting irrelevant results before finding what you are after, that&#x27;s an enormous time sink.<p>Throwing out any other google service but search is easy. Yet there is basically nothing that google can do in terms of business practices, that would make me go &quot;that&#x27;s it, I&#x27;ll just have to settle for these worse search results&quot;. So while I usually tend to argue the importance of integrity, it turns out I&#x27;m not ready to give up even  a few minutes every day for this cause.')
