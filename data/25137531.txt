I was looking at a to do list that I couldn&#x27;t accomplish in a year.<p>The biggest issue I had is not filtering what I put into my to do list. I was putting &quot;ideas&quot; or &quot;to read&#x2F;watch&#x2F;review&quot; in the same space as my &quot;to dos&quot;. By throwing them all in the same bucket I would quickly feel overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I had to do. By separating ideas into Trello, to read being clipped into Evernote, and my tasks in Asana it significantly reduced the number of tasks I woke up to each day and reduced my stress level (which helped me focus better).<p>Last year I even moved a lot of my tasks out of Asana and into a bullet journal. This has further helped reduce the number of tasks that I am looking at on any given day.')
