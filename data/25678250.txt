They can do whatever they please (almost) and suffer no consequences. If corporations are people they should be treated as such; not just with comical fines but with prison sentence. I don&#x27;t see this happening any time soon though, as they are usually in the pockets of politicians. Expect no change until it is beneficial to corporations and politicians alike.')
