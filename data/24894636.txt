That does not at all change what I wrote. The narrative of Marxism as some big scary bogeyman in UK politics is an alt-right trope.  Suggesting the SNP, which is only moderately left wing even by UK standards, is close to Marxism-Leninism is equally ludicrous.<p>Put another way: If Marxism had any prominent support in the UK, RLB would have been outflanked on the left in the Labour leadership elections, rather than losing to someone on her right.')
