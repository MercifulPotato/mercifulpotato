I am red&#x2F;green colourblind and it was fascinating to learn about how edge detection plays a key role - I’ve always thought it was interesting how I struggle to tell colours apart on a graph, but it’s usually quite easy if there are two blocks to compare.<p>I do also find that it’s quite hard to match up two similar colours in the red&#x2F;green spectrum, regardless of size, unless they are actually next to each other. I also struggle to differentiate between bright green and yellow, dark green and brown and sometimes blue and purple; to the point where I don’t know which of the two to call something. This I guess is not related to edge detection.<p>As an aside, I love this kind of content - well written, interesting and not on some bland platform like Facebook or Medium. It reminds me of the sort of stuff I used to discover with Stumbleupon. Any recommendations where to find this kind of stuff, except for on here?')
