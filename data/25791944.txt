Vim starts up\nliterally 100 times faster on my machine, with 17 active\nplugins. It also runs everything in a single thread and is still\nmore responsive than VSC in almost all scenarios.<p>What are those stupendously complex features that somehow make a\nslow start unavoidable? Or to go with your comparison, why do\nyou think Eclipse has a good reason to start so slowly, on a\nmodern 8+ thread CPU and SSD?')
