As with Covid this year and secondhand cigarette smoke last decade, the problems of gas stoves stem not just from the burner, but from the ventilation of the environment around it.<p>If we had required excellent fresh air ventilation for indoor spaces, we might not have had to ban indoor smoking. I don’t smoke but I don’t mind if others do, <i>as long as</i> I have fresh air that isn’t polluted by their smoke. We might not have had to ban indoor dining during Covid, <i>as long as</i> each table’s air is pulled upwards and away from other diners and exhausted into fresh air, since the ventilation could contain UV scrubbers on intake and exhaust. As another comment here describes, we wouldn’t have people being poisoned by gas stoves, because the pollution would be vented rapidly in any building where they’re used.<p>Confronting the ventilation crisis is unfathomably difficult for America, and it’s unclear if politicians have the stomach to even consider it. I’m a little sad each time I see some new cause spin up to resolve an issue stemming from poor ventilation, even as I’m happy that the cause is correct in outcome. I just wish that we’d stop circling the issue and hone in on it and make it a national crisis, somehow. At the end of the day doing so would demand nationwide investment in revisions to the ventilation of every building in America, which would require national funding as most cannot afford to do so - and those that can would refuse, preferring to lobby against it instead of spending their own money.<p>In the meantime, crack the windows of your home as often as you can afford to do so. This problem isn’t the fault of any single renter or homeowner, and in the short term, that’s all you can do.<p>Ventilation previously on HN (139 comments): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19858155" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19858155</a>')
