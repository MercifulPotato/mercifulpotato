A melting pot implies homogeneity and the loss of one&#x27;s identity and history. A salad bowl is a pleasant mixing of everything, with each component still retaining its identity - a carrot is still a carrot, a radish is still a radish, and so forth. The irony is if I want to celebrate the zest of a radish then I&#x27;m told I&#x27;m being insensitive and appropriating the radish culture. As is so often the case we end up moving neither forward nor backward but sideways.<p>In the end I like the salad bowl metaphor because it scales well globally. We&#x27;re a single human race, all different, yet all the same. It&#x27;s appropriate to celebrate one another&#x27;s histories so long as we&#x27;re mindful of our collective future.')
