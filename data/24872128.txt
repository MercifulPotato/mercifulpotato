For example, the prominent discussion of &quot;Global Solar Minimum&quot; on each page. This scare text flies in the face of the current thinking of the scientific community.<p>From Wikipedia:<p>&quot;The current scientific consensus, most specifically that of the IPCC, is that solar variations only play a marginal role in driving global climate change,[79] since the measured magnitude of recent solar variation is much smaller than the forcing due to greenhouse gases.[88] Also, average solar activity in the 2010s was no higher than in the 1950s (see above), whereas average global temperatures had risen markedly over that period. Otherwise, the level of understanding of solar impacts on weather is low.[89]&quot;<p>I guess if you think the IPCC is a cabal of Satan-worshipping Communists, then this brief analysis is suspect. But show me anywhere a reputable study that links solar variations to &quot;drastic climatic and geophysical changes to our planet. These include increased galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), seismic activity, and volcanism&quot; as IAF claims.')
