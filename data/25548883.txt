This guy is a GREAT teacher and has a LOT of free videos you can learn from: Intros to HTML, CSS, Javascript, and real world mini-projects to show you how to build things you can use yourself or in a portfolio.  Mostly short videos (less than an hour) and a really easy person to learn from.  He taught himself to code and really knows how to explain what might be complex topics in Web Dev and more to people who have never coded before.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA</a><p>Good luck!')
