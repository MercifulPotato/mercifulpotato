You then need to multiply by the number of years that this storage system needs to be online. Again, if we&#x27;re comparing against the alternative of building a nuclear plant, this is 60 to 80 years. Neglecting to factor in the required lifespan artificially deflates the price drastically. And again this figure of $12 per KWh per year is for the &quot;spilled wind&quot; scenario - that is, the assumption that the electricity input is provided at zero cost.<p>The other poster also did more than just cherry pick particularly expensive plants. Among other things, they claimed that existing natural gas infrastructure can be used to transport hydrogen. This is simply untrue, hydrogen would corrode metal pipes used for natural gas. There&#x27;s a factor of 2,000 less hydrogen pipelines. Probably even less overall infrastructure if you count natural gas transported by rail and LNG shipping.')
