I would say Google is ready to squash competition like a bug but really you&#x27;re more like a bug getting splatted on their windscreen. Most of the time they don&#x27;t even consider you to be competition. Maybe in some ways that&#x27;s a good thing - if they don&#x27;t consider you to be a threat then you&#x27;ve got some room to innovate. Until you get big enough that you show up on their radar... then they can just copy whatever you&#x27;ve been doing differently.')
