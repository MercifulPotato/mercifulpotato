Occasionally I&#x27;m approached by someone in my network who needs a few hours of software development. In the past I tried this, figuring that I may as well earn a few bucks on the side during my free time.<p>But then I realized the enormous overhead that comes with taking payments in Israel. I&#x27;d need to open an account with the tax authorities and deal with a bunch of paperwork I don&#x27;t understand. So now I&#x27;m busy learning the tax system or hiring an accountant... it&#x27;s just not worth it unless they&#x27;re going to commit to a large amount of hours, but I do value my free time as well. So either you pay me enough to quit my full-time job at a big company or forget about it. It&#x27;s hard to do small amounts of freelance work because of the onerous regulatory environment.<p>All this is different for USians, who have to file tax returns every year anyway and simply need to add another source of income on their 1040.')
