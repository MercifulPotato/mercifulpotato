A more advanced feature would be: Pick your own moderator. The system could essentially figure this out for you based on upvotes &#x2F; downvotes, but a shortcut would be that if I &quot;follow&quot; someone, it means I generally want to see things that they like as well.<p>Another feature: let me bang on the downvote or upvote button multiple times to tell the system how much I like or dislike something. Show me more or less or none at all of that topic&#x2F;user&#x2F;etc based on that.<p>Finally and perhaps most importantly, I&#x27;d like to see comments and topics sorted by how much my own personal network of influencers rated them.

I care how much the 100 people I followed hated it (so don&#x27;t show it to me, ever).<p>Some people don&#x27;t like my idea because they say it will create an echo chamber.
