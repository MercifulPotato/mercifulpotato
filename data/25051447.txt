Let&#x27;s continue this discussion.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if we have multiple alternative to SBT, some more usable than other. Rust has one package manager (+build tool +distribution tool): Cargo. That&#x27;s it. Whatever the project you just cloned and whatever the platform you&#x27;re using, `cargo build` is going to compile it. Now, if every Scala project starts using a different package manager, that&#x27;s going to be a problem. The best solution would have been to make SBT usable without a prescription from your doctor. It didn&#x27;t happen. That&#x27;s okay, programming languages are just tools anyway, and they get replaced too.')
