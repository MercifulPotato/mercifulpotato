It&#x27;s not even an accurate descriptor (the stuff is running on a server _somewhere_), so it really could mean anything.<p>Something like &quot;cloud functions&quot; to describe Lambda and &quot;managed Kubernetes&quot; for Fargate. Of course, these terms are less sexy, so they&#x27;d never catch on.')
