Item(by='zenexer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609652938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25619667, text='&gt; We can manufacture it in the body. &quot;Essential nutrients&quot; are things we cannot manufacture.<p>Entirely anecdotal, but there are definitely people out there who have to take supplements to achieve normal levels.  My most recent blood tests showed that I had a vitamin D deficiency, so my PCP prescribed vitamin D.  At the time, I was getting outside plenty and was exposed to the sun more than most people with desk jobs, but it wasn&#x27;t enough.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if being stuck inside due to the pandemic has made it worse.<p>Did the prescription change anything?  Dunno.  I haven&#x27;t died yet, and it costs nothing since it&#x27;s prescribed by my PCP, so I&#x27;m not complaining, but otherwise I feel exactly the same.  Would I go around taking random supplements without the oversight of my doctor?  Nope.')
