A browser has to actually download the copyrighted work to play it back, regardless whether it&#x27;s &quot;streaming&quot; it or not. Chunks of the file get downloaded and those protections will have to be bypassed to be able to play it back, no?<p>We know that different media players rely on youtube-dl to be able to play back videos from YouTube. Are they not allowed to be able to play back YouTube content then?')
