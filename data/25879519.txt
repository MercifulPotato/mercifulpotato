I&#x27;m that guy with the hearing accessibility issue. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m mad about people who refuse to be seen.<p>If we use MS Teams or Google Meet, then it&#x27;s mitigable because those support computer generated captions (albeit not perfect). But other technologies like Zoom, Webex, etc. don&#x27;t have that feature, so literally, if there are no captions and I can&#x27;t see you in order to lipread &amp; read some body language, then we are unable to have a productive meeting. You might as well be speaking a foreign language.<p>Even if everyone has normal hearing, it&#x27;s still a good thing to be able to see each other to check-in on everyone&#x27;s body language and well-being. If someone looks really unhappy or looks like they&#x27;re not taking care of themselves at all, then this is information that they need help with something.')
