Go was conceived as a small language, a successor to C, and purposely eschewed &quot;new-fangled&quot; features of modern languages. Whether the result is good is a matter of taste, but I feel that retroactively bolting on a modern type system will simultaneously (a) undercut the simplicity of the core language and (b) produce a language that is not as clean as those conceived with generics from the beginning.')
