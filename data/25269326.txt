We have a very strong product that is highly modular and integrates well with established workflows.<p>We have over 5,000 paying customers and over 10,000 users in total. We run our own CDN which serves over a petabyte of audio data every month. This translates to millions of listeners.<p>Our vision for podcasting is that it should be an open medium that impacts society and people in a positive way. We are against walled gardens and gatekeepers.<p>Our main challenge is internal scaling in order to fulfill the growing demands of our current and future customers.<p>So far we are bootstrapped, profitable, yet preparing for our first fundraise. We have tripled our revenue this year, we want to repeat it next year again.<p>The two founders (I am one of them) are techies and used to be full-stack software engineers before going full-time with Podigee. Until a couple of years ago, we wrote every single line of code, decided every product feature and did all the networking, marketing, accounting and more ourselves. Today we are getting close to 30 employees, will triple the number next year.<p>Our tech stack is mainly based on Ruby on Rails, Angular (legacy) &amp; Vue.js (target), PostgresDB, TimescaleDB, lots of infrastructure-as-code.<p>Feel like you want to work with lots of talented people at a no-BS, performance-driven startup that is not just a moonshot or a fad?
