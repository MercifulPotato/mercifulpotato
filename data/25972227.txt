It&#x27;s not technically a dark sky site (we get some light to the north from Santa Fe), but most nights I sit outside (hot tub) and stare up at the vast expanse. Of course, it never looks like the long exposure shots, so that mythical milky way isn&#x27;t part of the view at all.<p>Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve already noticed how much more I think about things related to what it is in the night sky. The slow movement of Orion. The so-far constant relationship between Aldebaran and the Pleiades. Learning (some) of the names of the most prominent stars. Being reminded month after month of how the lunar cycle changes the experience of the night sky, even on a day to day basis because of approx 1 hr shift in &quot;when the moon is in the same spot&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve spent plenty of time below dark skies, but have lived in cities more or less my entire (57 year) life. It&#x27;s only been very recently that I&#x27;ve really started to have some sense of what is gained when one has the an experience of the night sky that is more like what our ancestors would have experienced: how it shapes one&#x27;s sense of where we are in space and time, of how much vaster things are than our small lives (I say this even living in the American west, which encourages this experience all by itself), and of relationships in the sky that we can see but not really understand (without science and very complex and vast equipment).')
