I&#x27;m probably not going back to Ubuntu for desktop &#x2F; development &#x2F; gaming use.<p>It feels like you&#x27;re in control of everything. Not like you know everything, but you know that if something is going to be on your way, you&#x27;ll be able to find a solution (and learn something new which is applicable to other distros as well) in the day  because things are simple (!= easy) and the Arch wiki is awesome.<p>Somehow, I&#x27;d say the feeling is a bit similar to the one I had when I definitely switched from Windows XP to Kubuntu back in the days, except you don&#x27;t have to change your habits with regard to software you use.<p>In addition to that, you&#x27;re almost always having the latest version of everything, including the kernel. No more unsupported hardware, no more outdated driver, no more missing feature, no more other OS you can&#x27;t run in a container because of your host kernel being too old.<p>One thing, though: there are two cases where I wouldn&#x27;t use Arch (but I didn&#x27;t use Ubuntu for these either): computers I use like once or twice per year and production servers. Having close to nothing to upgrade is a feature for me there, so I use Debian stable.')
