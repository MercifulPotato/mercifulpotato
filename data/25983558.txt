The SPOT tracker is still the solution you want if you’re looking for safety&#x2F;emergency contact.<p>What meshtastic might be useful for on motorcycles (and I’m considering building some of these) is a medium range mesh network between you and your riding group, with super simple super limited Comms UI. I’m thinking 3 or 4 different colour old school video game type buttons that you can mash wearing gloves, that light up a bright-enough rgb led to see in the sun, with 3 or 4 agreed meanings for the colours. “Pull over and check messages”, “Wait for me”, “I’ve crashed”, “Cops!” type messages, that can be sent&#x2F;understood without needing to read a text message on a phone screen (but still having that text messaging available as well).')
