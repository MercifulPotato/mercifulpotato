I have a lot of very sentimental, very-important files, such as family photos and videos. And I simply like to hoard data.<p>I currently have 8TB of data stored on a Synology DS218+ with RAID1, and monthly data scrubs (verifying checksums). It is backed up remotely to Google Drive (in encrypted form), and I also maintain an infrequently-updated, once-per-quarter disk clone with an external HDD.<p>My biggest concern with my current setup is that the memory is non-ECC. Even though the files are checksummed, I am concerned that specific memory corruption &#x2F; bit-flips could propagnate into the checksums, and hence result in data corruption.<p>I am considering:<p>* Building my own FreeNAS box using AMD Ryzen (which semi-officially support ECC memory). My concerns here are the semi-official nature of support: how do I know if ECC works, before a rare cosmic bit-flip?<p>* Purchasing a Synology DS1621+. This is AUD$1400 which is a tough pill to swallow, for the equivalent of a first-gen Ryzen quad core and 4GB of memory.<p>Any options or recommendations is appreciated!!')
