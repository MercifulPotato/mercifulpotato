Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607577893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25355668, text='&gt; Chinese regulations are designed to ensure that the domestic Chinese market is dominated by Chinese-owned companies.<p>All regulations around the world are designed that way. All markets are national security issues and all major powers protect their own turf. China isn&#x27;t special just because you have something against them. From britain to japan to korea to india to mexico and even canada, they all cater their laws&#x2F;regulations to protect their own companies.<p>&gt; Whether or not Facebook can follow Chinese law is irrelevant;<p>It is relevant. Just because you decide something is irrelevant doesn&#x27;t make it so.<p>&gt; The US, on the other hand, at least pretends to have rule-of-law that preempts attempts to use government power to determine economic winners and losers.<p>You mean other than tik tok? Other than subsidies for boeing, etc? Other than the bailouts of car companies? And that&#x27;s not even taking account of all the wars we&#x27;ve engaged in to further the interests of our companies. Our invasion and colonization of china for much of the 19th and 20th century doesn&#x27;t count right?')
