I learned a shortcut, which might not work for others: I try to go a bit hungry. If I&#x27;m hungry, I&#x27;m in calorie deficit. I might even get a bit cold. Turns out I can just listen to the hunger feeling and know whether I&#x27;m currently losing or gaining weight. But walking past a bakery, inhaling the smell of fresh bread... Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m always able to resist.<p>Some other simplifications:<p>- I don&#x27;t keep food at home anymore. Only rice and some bland tasting astronaut food which I can only tolerate when hungry enough.<p>- I love sugar, and I&#x27;m cheating my brain by drinking cola zero. I&#x27;ve gotten so used to it by now that I actually really like the taste and it feels like getting a sugar fix.<p>- No fixed meals: Only eating when actually hungry, not because it is time.')
