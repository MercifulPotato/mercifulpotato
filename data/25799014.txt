I know the former covers key concepts like support and resistance levels.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen CM cover things like BTC Dominance, which is important if you&#x27;re going to play attention to transitions like BTC to ETH to Altcoins, which is important to understand as the market action seems to abandon your favorite coin and moves on to another asset.<p>I really don&#x27;t know how those two Youtube channels rank or what might be better, but take a look and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll learn some interesting stuff. Again, I can&#x27;t express this enough--protect your capital, set stops, set notifications. If you lose 15% you&#x27;ll have to earn more than 15% to make it back. If you lose 2% and get stopped out, that&#x27;s a much easier problem to solve if you are monitoring price resistance and breakthroughs on the high end.<p>I have also made a lot of good trades using technical concepts like the golden cross, three green soldiers, bull hammer, shooting star, bull pennant, bullish wedge, bull flag, double bottom, inverse head and shoulders, cup w&#x2F; handle, etc. You can look these all up for helpful picture-tutorials on your favorite image search engine.')
