But the media (and the democrats in their advertising) cuts off that part of the speech, leaving a false impression in people&#x27;s minds. This alone is evidence that he wasn&#x27;t calling white supremacists fine people.<p>Further, it was a large protest over a statue with thousands of people over a whole day, do you think there isn&#x27;t one single non white supremact there protesting to keep it up? There&#x27;s no evidence that Trump was referring to the tiki torch rally when he said fine people. He made the speech after the large protest and the terrorist attack, where by the law of large numbers there is inevitably going to be non-white supremacists attending to show support merely for the statue&#x2F;history.')
