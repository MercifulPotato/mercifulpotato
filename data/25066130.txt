I previously submitted a post about the Dasung Paperlike monitor[2], and I actually bought it years ago and sold it because I couldn&#x27;t handle the refresh rate, but I was interested to see they are still going and still the best in class for that use-case. The Onyx Lumi actually also works as a second monitor so my dream of working outside on sunglasses might still happen.<p>I love this use of e-ink as wall art, and I have hoped for years the technology could become more ubiquitous outside of e-readers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Onyx_Boox&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jem97h&#x2F;most_of_my_joy_from_the_lumi_has_come_from&#x2F;?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Onyx_Boox&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jem97h&#x2F;most_of_m...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11760676" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11760676</a>')
