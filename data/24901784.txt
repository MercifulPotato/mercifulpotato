I think the question comes down to how much you trust your government&#x2F;leaders (or future gov&#x2F;leaders). I believe in the west distrust is correlated with the rise of authoritarianism. Which with those two correlating I&#x27;m actually more concerned because the <i>potential</i> for that power to be abused. I do not think the west is immune to dictators or autocrats, and far from immune to those in power abusing that power. To me surveillance hinders free speech, I mean isn&#x27;t this the theme of 1984? (Many forget that it isn&#x27;t that the government was always watching, but <i>could</i>.) It makes it more difficult to vocalize our feelings about abuse of power and makes it difficult to share messages conveying as much. We should feel free to communicate and criticize, and surveillance is one means to suppress that communication.')
