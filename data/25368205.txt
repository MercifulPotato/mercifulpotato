You may find that most teachers in this subject also teach <i>other</i> subjects, like math or science, to cover needs (and be employable). You might have better luck at private&#x2F;semi-private schools&#x2F;academies (which still require a teaching degree).<p>My suggestion is: talk to someone running your nearest teacher ed program, and they can give you a clearer sense of the realities of teaching opportunities. Also, consider what other subjects you&#x27;d want to get certified in and possibly teach.')
