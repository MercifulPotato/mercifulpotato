Item(by='gspr', descendants=None, kids=[25914801], score=None, time=1611660995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25914618, text='&gt; Does this mean grid-synced clocks in the south-east part are now permanently ahead of the atomic reference, or are they planning a mitigation (which I assume would have to mean disconnecting again and running the SE part slower for a bit)?<p>That&#x27;s the standard procedure.

So the frequency will slew to slowly compensate back.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s a Tom Scott video on a UKâ€“Continental divergence that happened a while back: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bij-JjzCa7o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bij-JjzCa7o</a>')
