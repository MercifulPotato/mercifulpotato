I&#x27;ve heard a number of times that these will prevent the person who got the vaccine from getting sick, but that it won&#x27;t prevent them from spreading the disease. If that is the case then I could understand why a young healthy person would not want the vaccine as the risk to them from covid is extremely low.')
