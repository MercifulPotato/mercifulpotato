It will teach you how to play beginner piano badly, and then will create intense confusion if you try to learn harder pieces because you will not have learned basic finger techniques - which include counter-intuitive finger-over&#x2F;under moves and unexpected hand position changes that anticipate what you need to play next.<p>Piano sheet music includes these finger position hints. Unfortunately they&#x27;re not optional.<p>It&#x27;s hard to include correct fingering in the model without some kind of camera and image recognition system, or special keys and finger sensors, or something equally obscure.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the idea of gameifying piano, but it&#x27;s a really hard problem to solve well. The usual result with piano teaching apps of all kinds - as someone else commented below - is kids get up to Grade 1 (maybe 2) and then hit a brick wall.<p>The reality is that playing any instrument with non-trivial competence is really fucking hard. It takes everyone a ridiculous amount of time and effort to get good at it - even those with talent.<p>So there&#x27;s a trade off between trying to offer easy but limited success with some entertainment value, and going the whole way and doing it properly - which all but the most musical kids get very bored by, because it&#x27;s such hard work.')
