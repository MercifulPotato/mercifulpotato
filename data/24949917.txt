I have been in a lot of emotional pain this year, likes of which I have never experienced before. Reading stories here now I realize I should be thankful to be alive and functional and still reach out and lift that cup of joe. That mundane action now looks amazing. My best wishes to Scott on his way to healing. His writings have always inspired me including today. May God bring us to the other end of this very dark year.')
