Its murder on the rider and the bike.<p>I don&#x27;t know about that. I pretty much grew up only having crappy second hand bikes and spent more time riding through forests and trails than streets. There was a couple summers where pretty much every day was wake up, get on yhe bike, meet my cousins and friends and spend all day riding through the forest.<p>I never had an actual mountain bike, or even bikes with working brakes sometimes, i&#x27;ve taken bmx&#x27;s through mountain trails, bikes where the chain pops off every half hour, some pretty sketchy bikes. Street riding actually freaks me out more. I don&#x27;t like being on roads and sharing lanes with cars. Give me a rough forest trail on a bike any day over that.<p>&gt;Here&#x27;s a more interesting question: why are bicycles nonexistant on post-apocalyptic stories?<p>Bikes are pretty handy in Cataclysm DDA for town raids.<p>I guess a logical, in universe reason could be the extra calories spent on riding a bike wouldn&#x27;t be worth burning in an environment where food is scarce and conditions may be brutal.')
