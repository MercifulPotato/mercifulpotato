It&#x27;s not even on by default (yet).  If you have some specific wishes; it&#x27;s trivial to pick a different DNS system, or leave https-only off.<p>Additionally, DoH and https-only aren&#x27;t really closed or locked in in any way.  There&#x27;s a cloudflare-base DoH option that&#x27;s used by default, but just as you can pick your own DNS servers, you can also pick your own DoH servers.  Sure, it&#x27;s new (and thus not on by default), so selection is still fairly limited.  But even ISPs are starting to offer DoH, and surely others will too.  There&#x27;s no reason to assume that you won&#x27;t soon be able to pick from several choices for your DoH setup, including local or LAN options.<p>You mention pihole; and though I&#x27;ve never used it, they do have a page on DoH, and a superficial skim doesn&#x27;t have any huge issues: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pi-hole.net&#x2F;guides&#x2F;dns-over-https&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pi-hole.net&#x2F;guides&#x2F;dns-over-https&#x2F;</a> - and looks like it&#x27;s based on code described here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;1.1.1.1&#x2F;dns-over-https&#x2F;cloudflared-proxy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;1.1.1.1&#x2F;dns-over-https&#x2F;clo...</a> - and that supports upstream and downstream DoH, by the looks of it.<p>In other words: all change has some friction, but if you want local control: you still have it.  The only thing you really lose is the ability for networks to hijack DNS of devices that don&#x27;t trust it.  And that&#x27;s a feature, right?  If you trust the network; sure, use that DNS if you want.  But if you don&#x27;t: better that its easier to avoid control by that network.<p>What downsides does DoH have?')
