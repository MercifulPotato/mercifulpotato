And all this questioning has only solidified how secure elections in the US are.<p>Take GA for example. A large percentage of the election officials are Trump supporters. I don&#x27;t know about post coup attempt, but leading up they said they would still vote for Trump again even after he started putting them in danger with his fraud nonsense.<p>Finally, if someone wants to &#x27;rig&#x27; an election, the path is not directly through changing votes, it&#x27;s through social engineering.
