The issue is that they are so ineffectual that most people only know this when they sit through the 2 day bootcamp induction.<p>If they want to pull this kind of stunt off then they needed to have spent the last six months bombarding print and TV with their success stories. But they haven&#x27;t, they&#x27;ve just reached out and referenced numbers that only true believers know.<p>Basically Facebook&#x27;s PR appears to be amateurish and unable to understand how to interpret public sentiment. for a company supposedly so good at data, they are sure as shit terrible about commissioning and understanding opinion polls.')
