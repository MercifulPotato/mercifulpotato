Most samplers only load the attack portion of samples into RAM anyway. SSDs are so fast now, we can stream the rest without issue. The problem has always been CPU-related as we have to set a low buffer size to minimize latency. The previous Mac minis we&#x27;ve worked with struggled with some of the more high-CPU plugins (VSTs as well as FX), so we had to compromise in many cases. I did some testing with an M1 MacBook Air, and it blew the old Mac minis away in terms of performance and stability. Very much looking forward to see how the M1 will be used in these live production situations.')
