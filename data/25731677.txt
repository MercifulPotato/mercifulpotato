Item(by='echelon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610384133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729351, text='&gt; your nihilistic zero-sum America-first attitude is morally indistinguishable from Trumpism<p>I voted for Biden, Warnock, and Ossoff. Just because you&#x27;re left of me doesn&#x27;t make it okay to apply the &quot;Trump&quot; label so broadly. It&#x27;s not Trumpism to have some degree of nationalism (reverence for our demoratic institutions, multiculturalism, values, economy). Nor is it to worry we went too far with globalism and created a system that gave rise to today&#x27;s CCP.<p>We should want for a better, more equitable America. We should want the same for the world. I think we agree on this.<p>&gt; If you don’t want people to say you’re motivated by nativist greed, maybe try having ideas that aren’t nakedly greedy and nativist? At the very least your nihilistic zero-sum America-first attitude is morally indistinguishable from Trumpism, even if in your head it sounds more noble and strategic.<p>I live in America and I want growth. Are we not allowed disappointment over the fact we&#x27;re hemorrhaging technologies and capabilities?<p>If you believe this is a zero-sum game, then do you want America&#x27;s lead to be averaged out over the rest of the world?<p>I believe all people are equal. I want democratic nations to grow. India, in particular, is poised for great growth. But that doesn&#x27;t mean I want our engines to stall or level out.<p>I do not believe all nations or systems of government are equal. China, Russia, and our ally Saudi Arabia are detriments to their people and peace worldwide. These players shouldn&#x27;t be equals. I would love for their citizens to emigrate and gain freedom.<p>&gt; The point should be that democratic countries counter China’s power, not that it should be US v. China.<p>I would agree with you if we had a global democratic union. The moment all nations sign up to protect personal liberty, create a strong worldwide economy with ample opportunity, upward mobility, and commit to defending this in unison -- sign me up. But that isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>Japan and Vietnam have the correct ideas about China. We need to sell them lots of weapons. Europe, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t know where its allegiances lie. And the rest of the world is willing to partner with China to get a better deal.<p>Nationalism isn&#x27;t Trumpism. The world still needs a strong America.<p>&gt; despite the fact that we just saw an attempted fascist takeover of Congress by US citizens.<p>I shuddered at this too.<p>We need to punish Trump, the enablers in law enforcement and positions of power, and all other parties that made last week&#x27;s events possible. But to think a bunch of hillbillies stood any chance of destroying our democratic institutions is a bit much.<p>I agree that this should be called out as an example for now and forever, but do not use this as evidence that America is a fascist state. The results of the election prove otherwise.<p>&gt; First of all, China has the largest population in the world. They should be the biggest economy in the world, regardless of how evil their government is.<p>This is the root of our disagreement. Totalitarian regimes should not prosper.<p>If there was only one government in the world, I&#x27;d want it to be democratic. But democracy won&#x27;t win unless we fight for it. Democracy isn&#x27;t the default. It doesn&#x27;t get to exist just because we hope for it. So far, it&#x27;s just been a blip on the radar. It could disappear in a moment if we don&#x27;t defend it.<p>Europe exists because of America. If America stops protecting it, Russia&#x27;s influence will take it over.<p>China is the next great enemy. Same story.')
