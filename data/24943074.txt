I&#x27;m <i>certain</i> that the Pi 4 does tremendously better at handling crypto than the original Pi processor.<p>The 64-bit versus 32-bit thing is almost certainly software wonkiness, as that forum post indicates. There&#x27;s no reason the 64-bit mode should be slower than 32-bit mode for that task, and benchmarks often show that 64-bit ARM is actually measurably faster than running in 32-bit mode, due to the additional available registers and whatnot.')
