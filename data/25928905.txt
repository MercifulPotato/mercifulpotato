The top is butcherblock and can easily be resurfaced.  This island will last many years.<p>The IKEA &#x27;linmon&#x27; desk I have is laminated cardboard.  The weight of my monitor causes the desk to bow.  The surface has the durability of flat paint.  My phone slipped out of my hand from 12 inches above the desk and put a 1&#x2F;4 inch deep dent in it.  I&#x27;m pretty sure if I squeezed it hard enough with my fingers, I could crush it.')
