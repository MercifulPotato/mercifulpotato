Prop 22 would still pay drivers a floor of 120% * minimum wage while they&#x27;re actually driving in exchange for unpaid idle time,that 20% is a lower bound for how much they&#x27;ll need to reduce the pool of drivers.<p>As a response, Uber&#x2F;Lyft will need to either start assigning shifts or add a limit to the # of drivers that can be clocked in. I know they punish drivers that skip a ton of consecutive passengers, but they&#x27;ll need to take into account the fact that a driver at 3am probably only needs to skip one or two passengers to get paid for the full hour.')
