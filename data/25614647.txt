Item(by='FatalLogic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609609839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614568, text='&gt;Recall what happened to Ripple last month when the SEC reached a conclusion on their activities.<p>Yes, Tether seems to be in all sorts of legal trouble, especially in the US, but it is COMPLETELY different from XRP.  Why would you even mention XRP&#x2F;Ripple here? XRP has always been trying super hard to comply with the rules and cooperate with banks and etcetera, though I think it is probably really a kind of scam, IMHO.<p>But Tether and Bitfinex are always lurking in some kind of dark international space where the law is not clear, they are not like XRP. I hope you can see that, yes?<p>Edit: What you&#x27;re stating as fact is actually only your own opinion, and that has become even clearer when the only evidence you could offer to prove your case against Tether is not even about Tether, but about a totally different organization: XRP&#x2F;Ripple. So it might be better if you did not comment at this time, because you seem to have no interesting facts to offer us, only your opinions<p>[I mean that this has little to do with the XRP&#x2F;Ripple situation]')
