I&#x27;ve been unhappy with the iOS options recently (bugs, no one replying to bug reports, etc). So far your app is working better than the other choices and it handled my 15k+ bookmark collection easily.<p>The most important feature for me is being able to use the iOS share function and quickly add something with tags (and tag auto-complete). It would have been nice to test that ahead of the in-app purchasing but decided to go for it. Happy that all works well. Great work.')
