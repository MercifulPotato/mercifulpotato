However it sells well.<p>Do people use LibreOffice because it&#x27;s Mozilla licensed and not GPL? Do all those people that don&#x27;t dream about modifying Word really want to add secret proprietary features to LibreOffice?<p>Similarly, Oracle (the database) vs MariaDB (GPL) vs PostgreSQL (its own license, basically MIT &#x2F; BSD.) There are definitely people that patch databases but I wonder how many people here decided to use one and not the other because they thought &quot;what happens if I ever want to add something to MariaDB and nobody else must get it?&quot;')
