Do you even know how many other groups have protested there? Nobody burned it down. Nobody defaced any art. It&#x27;s still there in one piece. You&#x27;re being melodramatic.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s easier said as a Canadian, but the problem people like you (yes, you personally) have is that you can&#x27;t find your way to see common cause with the mass of people that were protesting. You think you&#x27;re different from them, for some strange, artificial, media-induced reason. You think that they&#x27;re reprehensible, when at the end of the day, they want the same thing you do: a stable income, a safe city, a place where they can raise a family, some amount of upward mobility, and less financial fragility when something unexpected happens like an injury, disease, or loss of employment.<p>Don&#x27;t you understand that a wedge is driven between red and blue folks in order to ensure you never get these things? Every single media narrative you are reading today is designed to make you hate and scorn those people. The purpose of this is clear from the outside: it&#x27;s to make sure you NEVER make common cause with them, and NEVER hold the entire system accountable.<p>Go ahead and play your side, champ. It&#x27;s what everyone does in their 20s, it&#x27;s natural, but one day you&#x27;ll look back at it and realize that this mob was just as correct in their ultimate yearning for a more just world as any other mob has been. The problem is finding any conceivable step forward that gets you there, rather than continually attacking people who are ultimately far closer to being your class peers than the elites who rule you both.')
