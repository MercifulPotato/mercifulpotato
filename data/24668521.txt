That&#x27;s quite a lot of different things, no wonder we lost people on the way. =)<p>There is one thing I&#x27;d like to insist on though, I&#x27;m not sure whether people could actually notice 100 ms of latency after user input. You assume that users do? but I don&#x27;t think they necessarily do. I think the full delay between when you press a button on a gamepad and when the frame changes on the TV is somewhere around that and gaming consoles are generally considered very usable. (Of course latency in computer networks is a different matter).<p>My daily job among other things is to optimize software and networking infrastructure covering 4 continents and 50 datacenters. I&#x27;d say I have a certain grasp of networking. ;)')
