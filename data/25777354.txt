The thing that I&#x27;ve seen that lands in the &quot;lab&quot; vs production distinction is that these people expect their data to be pristine. They flip out when the world isn&#x27;t as perfect as their models want. Leads to me as just a normal software developer having to do the data analysis and figure out how to clean it up.<p>I also end up having to be the one to talk to data vendors to understand their data feeds and essentially translate that for the data scientists. Having to sit in the middle is annoying for me and suboptimal for the business.')
