As a US-citizen who doesn&#x27;t want to live abroad, my choices are limited if I want to live outside of a de-facto suburb.  I want to walk most places, utilize public transit, have access to stores and coffee shops without a drive, and naturally live close to friends.  My partner and I don&#x27;t need too much space, and I&#x27;d rather go to a dog park and chat with people than play with my dog in a backyard alone.<p>The Le Corbusier spirit of zoning has wrought so much damage in the US.  I dread the idea of having to jump in a car for 15 minutes to shop for groceries in a strip mall.  Most suburbs really destroy natural community (and I suppose that was the point of Le Corbusier&#x27;s ideas around planning: like the gigantic squares in Brasilia) too.<p>(I realize my comment here is all over the place, sorry!)')
