When people muddy the waters and try to undermine the standard terminology of a field, it&#x27;s not some righteous struggle to liberate a term, it&#x27;s just an obstacle to clear communication.<p>In aviation, <i>flap</i> is a precise term-of-art, and is never used interchangeably with <i>aileron</i>, despite that an aileron is plainly a kind of flap (in the colloquial sense). If you adopt your own definition of <i>flap</i>, to refer to both flaps and ailerons, no-one is going to sue you, but no-one is going to know what you&#x27;re talking about. Your use of the term will be considered not merely different, but wrong.<p>Similarly, you could try telling a physicist that you consider the words <i>power</i> and <i>force</i> to be interchangeable. They&#x27;re not going to sue you, but they&#x27;re also not likely to entertain your deliberate misuse of standard terms.<p>Are pilots and physicists gatekeeping by being so insistent that you use their terms their way?')
