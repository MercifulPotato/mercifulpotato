Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606138120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185012, text='&gt; What you refer to is actually an &quot;alt right&quot; meme that was invented to discredit free thinking (free thinking requires people to be well-informed) and push an authoritarian and communitarian agenda in which people are more controlled than in a free society.<p>This itself is a meme, and an extremely popular one at that.  I hear it all the time, all over the place.<p>Did you come up with this idea on your own, via close observation and rational analysis of the highly dimensional, infinitely complex reality that we all live within, including significant interaction with &quot;the alt right&quot; in their natural habitat?  Is that the genesis of this idea in your mind?<p>If so, I wonder how it is that so many people have this very same idea inside their minds.  Did they all come up with it on their own, via the same, skilful methodology that you used?  If so, I wonder why encountering people who give off the slightest hint that they think in high dimensions with strict logic and epistemology, is so incredibly rare.  I&#x27;ve asked <i>easily</i> 100++ people who believe your meme how they know it to be true, and not only have I received no high quality answers, I can&#x27;t recall if I&#x27;ve ever received <i>any</i> answer that isn&#x27;t simply a restatement of the original meme itself.  (Come to think of it, this is a fairly common pattern that I&#x27;ve noticed when asking the same question about a variety of different memes.   Hmmmm, that&#x27;s interesting!)<p>Similarly, did the &quot;members&quot; of &quot;the alt right&quot; also arrive at their beliefs via this same methodology?  Or in their case, is it just a rumour that was adopted without question, without being subjected to the strict critical thinking process that those who accepted your meme into their minds?<p>Another relevant question might be: what evidence (current and historic) can the respective sides collectively offer to substantiate their side of the story?  And if no evidence can be provided, then from where does the confidence in the correctness of the idea derive?  The confidence is there, of that there&#x27;s no doubt.  My question is: <i>where did it come from</i>, or, <i>what is it composed of</i>?  Can the one who is in possession of it articulate it in written language?  Or, are they maybe &quot;very busy right now&quot;.<p>Some other important questions might be: What is actually True?  How might we know, for sure?  How many epistemic states are there: two (True&#x2F;False), or three (True&#x2F;False&#x2F;Unknown)?  And, what might be the possible consequences if our beliefs happen to be <i>incorrect</i> about some of these things - do the history books provide any lessons on that sort of thing?')
