We have listened to falsehoods after falsehoods. A few other examples from the top of my mind:<p>- Masks protect you &#x2F; masks don&#x27;t protect you (I don&#x27;t know which is true but it is one or the other)<p>- Infection fatality rates &gt; 5%.<p>- Virus also dangerous for young people<p>- Drawing any conclusion from comparing daily cases from the first wave to the second wave (when orders of magnitude more tests were done during the second wave)<p>- Virus as dangerous as Ebola (read on the front page of the Times in the UK!)<p>- Hydroxychloroquine is a dangerous drug<p>- You must stay locked-down until there is a vaccine, even if you had it, as we may not develop immunity (it is either one or the other, if we don&#x27;t develop immunity there will be no vaccine).<p>- The virus is not a concern if you go protest BLM<p>- The virus doesn&#x27;t respect borders (of course it does because it is carried by humans)<p>I am sure I could think of more. But my point is the media did everything they could to terrorize the population. And the outcome is x% of the public terrorised, and (1-x%) of the public not believing a word from the media anymore.')
