But I do suspect this makes Hacker News what it is. Good at surfacing a certain x to y percentile of a certain way of looking at things.<p>It’s not a place to brainstorm or be open minded about new ways of thinking successfully - not very very often. More a place to surface small useful bits of information that people find (a) useful and (b) that people are passionate about already. And there’s a lot of value in that as a reader. And some value as writer in practicing articulation of very clearly thought-out ideas.<p>But yeah - today I realized HN and ‘I wonder if...’ comments don’t really jive together.')
