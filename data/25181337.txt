(Debian installer crashed .... )<p>- 4K support is pretty bad for a lot of games. usually some tweaking is required to get the text size - to a readable level.<p>- Internal Sound-card doesn&#x27;t work.<p>- Wifi - had to switch iwd to get stable network. (had lots of packetloss with with wpa-supplicant)<p>- Getting the Geforce and Intel card working was a pain.<p>- Touch screen doesn&#x27;t support reading pressure levels.<p>- Terminator is misses a bunch of feature that iTerm2 has.<p>- Last manjaro upgrade disabled the Nvidia graphics card, without warning. (had to restore a previous timeshift backup)<p>- external monitor doesn&#x27;t work yet.<p>- listening to music while lock screen is on doesnt work<p>- fingerprint scanner doesn&#x27;t work.<p>- have to restart bluetooth swith medium probability because it fails to connect to my airpods.<p>- the UI to unlock your encrypted harddisk at boottime looks also really bad. only text mode. and the text is also not very friendly.<p>almost all issue, i don&#x27;t have on the same hardware with windows, but since i really want use linux i accepted it that the HW support is crappy.')
