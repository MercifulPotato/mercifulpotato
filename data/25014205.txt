Once you have a distributed quantum resistant system good luck on that. There are so many ways this isn’t practical. If everyone just traded back and forth weakly encrypted garbage data chunks it would be indistinguishable from strong encryption. Also you can encrypt something with weak encryption, chunk the file then send them out in two directions and unless you have both or the chunking mechanism is really shitty that would be just as good as one single strong encryption stream. There’s just too many factors to cover for this to be practical. It’s fighting with mathematics and it’s a losing battle')
