Which the &#x27;owners&#x27; of the building have not done. And which informs and can indeed inspire.<p>Hey the museum that holds the David has a half-dozen copies placed around the building, to help reduce the congestion of the line to see the original. Are they crass? Are they not &#x27;earned&#x27;?<p>The &#x27;owners&#x27; of the originals cannot of course remodel them to show how they looked in the past, which can be hard to understand from ruins.  Folks often express regret at the damage done by one war or ruler or whatever. Yet reversing it is a bigger crime, because its a treasure.<p>The meaning of the reproduction is, &quot;Hey this is how it might have looked when it was intact.&quot;  Its interesting and informative. The scale of it has the same ability to inspire the scale of the original had.<p>We build new things all the time. Texas has many outstanding architectural treasures. That has zippo to do with this subject. Drawing a dichotomy is irrelevant, as building one doesn&#x27;t preclude building the other.<p>That all sounds like gobbledygook.
