There is a big difference between someone that served a 90 day sentence for something, then goes and commits a serious crime, and someone that serves 13 years for something.  There is a much more significant lesson in the 13 years.  Also, crime rates decrease among populations as they age.  The mere fact that people who serve longer sentences are older when they get out would have a further push down on crime rates among that population.')
