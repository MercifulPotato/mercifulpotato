Especially since godaddy and google domains include dns, and DO doesn&#x27;t charge for it.<p>I&#x27;ve setup a script to make it easier to manage a handful of dev domains (commit to a repo, and it updates via build&#x2F;event pipeline) with DO.. was surprisingly easy.  I don&#x27;t think doing similar for the biggest cloud&#x2F;dns providers would be all that hard to integrate.')
