I&#x27;ve read about how they constructed the RAM and how it&#x27;s different from the usual architecture. That and YouTube reviews convinced me that if I should save money on something, I could risk it with RAM. I observed how my potato Macbook works with its 8 GB RAM and I could see that most of the capacity is idle, while the computer is slow. That made me think that RAM just isn&#x27;t the bottle neck I&#x27;m fighting. My budget is limited and based on what I knew I decided the RAM is less of a risk than a small disk.<p>In the end, honestly, I don&#x27;t care that much if it&#x27;s the processor, RAM, or a pixie dust. The machine&#x27;s snappy whatever I do on it and that&#x27;s all that matters. I&#x27;m happy with my choice so far, but only time will tell, of course. If you do RAM-intensive stuff on your computer and have the money, buy RAM, good for you.')
