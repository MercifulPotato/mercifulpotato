They&#x27;re about as curious as anyone else you&#x27;d find here and do read similar articles - but in their own language. There&#x27;s a whole world of articles and open source out there not available in English.<p>The link between language learning and curiosity sounds tenuous at best. I would also add that having access to media in a particular language doesn&#x27;t mean a lot unless you&#x27;re prepared to put some effort in. I know expats who&#x27;ve lived in Japan for 20 years and can only speak a few words of Japanese despite being surrounded by it everyday.')
