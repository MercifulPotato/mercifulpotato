I know many times when they were reverse engineered by tuners the major tables such as ignition advance, fueling, mass air flow, etc. would be identified and that would be enough to allow some tuning of the car. But there were always many tables with a mysterious purpose, such as tau adjustments, which were never fully understood. I also wondered how values were interpolated by the ECU considering most things are table based. The tables might have 500 rpm, 1000rpm, etc cells with timing values, but when you log the ECU you do not see big jumps in timing at those cutoff points.')
