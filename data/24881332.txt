In a dynamically typed language, doing this safely requires selecting a subset at the call site (at either the parameter or from the return value). In statically typed languages this is more easily expressed with interfaces(&#x2F;types&#x2F;protocols&#x2F;contracts&#x2F;whatever the language calls them) and you can still safely pass the full state if that’s more convenient.')
