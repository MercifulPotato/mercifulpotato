It&#x27;s just we think about <i>turning around</i> to try to &quot;match&quot; what we see.<p>And humans are more left-right symmetric than up-down symettric.<p>If we try to do a headstand to match the image in the mirror then it actually &quot;mirrors&quot; it top&#x2F;down instead of left&#x2F;right.<p>Another example: looking at writing in the mirror, we&#x27;ve actually <i>turned it around</i> to point at the mirror. If we flip it over to point it at the mirror instead then again it&#x27;ll appear upside down in the mirror instead of left&#x2F;right flipped.<p>Edit: I should have read the article, because indeed this is exactly what it explains.')
