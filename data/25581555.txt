I tried another girl who&#x27;s very pretty but maybe not with the same &quot;va-va-voom&quot; thing and it gave her a 9.  I tried a young Harrison Ford and he got a 6.6.  Two different Audrey Hepburn glamour shots got a 10.0, but a movie still of her without the same lighting and eye makeup gave her a 7.  A picture of a young Richard Gere got a 6.5.<p>I think maybe the problem is the data is based on what people SAY is attractive, which is maybe different than what their brain says is attractive, if that makes any sense.  They&#x27;re paying money to look at the fashion model, Harrison Ford, Richard Gere and Audrey without all the eye makeup yet they&#x27;re only getting 6s and 7s.')
