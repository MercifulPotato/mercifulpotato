The article mentions paying up to a 25% comission to the owner of the place. Even if you somehow get amazing margins on the machine itself like 70% (assuming you refill the machine for free) it will turn into 45% margin after actually putting the machine down.<p>&gt;We surveyed 23 vending machine owners with various-sized operations and found that the average operator in our sample owned 13 machines that gross $309 per machine per month.<p>Warning: napkin math.<p>$309 x 13 x 45% = $4017 x 45% = $1807.65 profit (excluding cost of machine)<p>It&#x27;s just a side hustle. Even with higher margins you can never go above $4017 so it&#x27;s never going to turn into a scalable business. Once you consider the cost of the machines of around $2k each (very low estimate) your first 14 months will net you nothing.')
