Furthermore, we are talking about the <i>Peanuts</i> characters. They had a multi-decade run syndicated across all the national funny pages, long before any of them were ever animated. Do we even have the sort of media environment any more where it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to make this sort of cultural investment, and reach out and touch everyone?
