Often it borders on drama.<p>The other day I commented that I took my Pinebook Pro off the toy shelf and loaded up Manjaro. I commented on HN about how much I liked the user experience. The first reply I got was something about the drama with some dude named Phil. Alternatively I’ll put my head down for a while and forget about the lineage of the various options and then something will crop up about this or that distro is going away, being repositioned or whatnot.<p>Why does this matter? Because I want to use it for real work and I don’t want to spend time planning a long term OS strategy. There are other things to worry about. I’m far from alone in this. That’s why folks reach for Mac OS and Windows.<p>Downvote away, but I really do want to love Linux. I just don’t want it to be so hard to love.')
