My daily driver is a Galaxy S6 (launched in March 2015) and I don&#x27;t feel any need to upgrade for the hardware. (Although the model I own, G920A, is particularly locked down, and which I am not happy about.) I&#x27;m hoping it lasts long enough that I can replace it with a Librem 5 as my daily driver. (Might get a pinephone earlier than that so I can help make that a reality).')
