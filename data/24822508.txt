And when landing on the Moon, Apollo had to deal with irregularities in the Moon&#x27;s gravity due to mass concentrations, called mascons.<p>(If you&#x27;re interested in missile guidance, take a look at the book <i>Inventing Accuracy</i>. Among other things, it discusses some of the efforts to map the Earth&#x27;s gravity field to increase missile accuracy for Trident and Minuteman missiles. I knew a physicist who worked on this.)')
