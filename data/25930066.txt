Would it mean that the shorts would be forced to take a loss and buy that stock?<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what a short squeeze is. They are losing more and more money as this goes up, and at some point they won&#x27;t have more money to lose. They&#x27;ll have to buy (in order to cover their short), which will further drive the price up.')
