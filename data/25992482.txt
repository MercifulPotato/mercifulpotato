I understand this was all driven by &quot;short sells&quot; of Gamestop&#x27;s stock: some hedge fund traders entered into a contract to buy some stocks at whatever price that stock was trading at at some point in the future, and then sold the stock (that they didn&#x27;t yet have) at the price it was trading for now, predicting that the price would go down so they could buy it for less than they sold it.  If that&#x27;s what was going on, doesn&#x27;t it <i>require</i> some uninformed yokel to buy the stocks in the first place?  If people buying stocks drives the price up, and short-selling requires selling the stock before the price goes up, how does short selling ever work for anybody?  Is there some &quot;sweet spot&quot; of stock selling that the hedge fund traders are hoping for where they can make back their money but still let the stock price fall?')
