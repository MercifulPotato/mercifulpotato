There is consistent demand for basic labor.<p>Those doing the labor need to make enough to exist and show up for work.<p>If they do not get enough to make it and show up for work, then they don&#x27;t make it and don&#x27;t show up for work.<p>People have costs.  Existing and showing up for work has a cost.<p>If we truly do not pay those costs, people die and dead people do not show up for work.<p>Clearly, dead people not showing up for work helps no one, so we need to make sure they get enough to make it and show up, right?<p>If we decide government has this responsibility, fine!  Seriously.<p>But that too has a cost.  Literally everything does cost something, and the cost for that is not shaming the fuck out of people who do not make enough to make it and show up for work.  And that happens constantly!<p>Those minimum wage peeps are worthless!  Lazy!  Dumb!  Free loaders!  Queens!  And on and on it goes.<p>Pretty hard to say all of those things when a ton of jobs do not pay enough to make it and show up for work.<p>What do we expect them to do?<p>Work more?<p>Well, life breaks down into thirds.  One to sleep, one to work, one to be a person and do all the human things humans do, laugh, live, grow, build, do, etc..<p>When so many jobs do not pay enough to make it and show up for work, people run out of thirds to work, and they have to sleep, and working all the time does not exactly allow for personal growth does it?<p>Nope and we all know that too.<p>I sure wish we would just settle on one or the other and quit trying to blame and shame millions of people who do basic labors that are necessary and that save a lot more of us a ton of time that we use to do our work and be humans and all that good stuff.<p>If we are gonna say government does it, and minimum wage is super low, fine.  Government needs to do that, and we need to pay appropriate taxes and get on with life and let everyone play their role with some dignity and compassion.<p>Or?<p>We say corporations need to fully fund their labor.  In that scenario, we need to pay them appropriately for their goods, services and insure robust competition so margins don&#x27;t get out of hand.  Taxes will be lower, making room for all that to happen.<p>And again, everyone gets on with life, playing their roles with dignity and respect.<p>Which is it?<p>The current &quot;blame them&quot; scenario is completely unacceptable.  And it is unacceptable because we need those basic labors, someone will be doing them and that needs to be recognized as the value in our lives it truly is and not frowned upon as some how bad, because it just isn&#x27;t.<p>So which is it?<p>This is the national discussion on all this we ought to have.')
