It works, as long as the users can be convinced they are customers to some degree.<p>This business model is not ethically clean, yet very profitable.\nAnd here is the example: Robinhood markets itself precisely as I have said above. Heck, even the name!<p>In reality, its customer is Citadel, and its product is early data on user trades. \nOne could say: It does the exact opposite of what its marketing would suggest - Taking profits from small investors and giving them a large hedge fund.<p>So really, SV is just as &quot;bad&quot;.')
