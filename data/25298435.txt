Remember, it&#x27;s an SoCâ€”the memory is on the same die as the CPUs, GPUs and they all have equal access to it. No bus to go across.<p>What does this even mean? Memory works at a certain voltage, clock speed, and has a capped rate at which it can transfer data if those are kept constant. For DDR4-3200 it&#x27;s generally 3,200 MTs (megatransfers&#x2F;sec).<p>What does every core has equal access to it mean? What does soldering SDRAM change in terms how many transfers&#x2F;sec it can do? What do you mean there is no bus?<p>&gt; The M1 already has features no &quot;desktop&quot; chip has, such as 8 instruction decoders.<p>What makes going wide a &quot;desktop&quot; class feature? Going wide isn&#x27;t free, there is transistor cost associated. A M1 chip has 16 billion transistors for 8 cores. AMD&#x27;s EPYC Rome has 39.54 billion transistors for 64 cores. That&#x27;s 8 times as many cores. And that&#x27;s including ~9 billion transistors just for the I&#x2F;O die.<p>If you look at just the chiplets, AMD&#x27;s 8 Core complexes take up only 3.9 billion transistors each. And these are 8 high performance cores with SMT, even removing GPU&#x2F;NPU engines from M1, AMDs design clearly has a lower transistor cost.<p>&gt; The Zen3 barely beats the M1<p>AMD was&#x27;t trying to make an entry level laptop chip, so it&#x27;s not good at being a entry level laptop chip? How do you think M1 would fare if we try to compare them on datacenter CPU metrics?<p>I understand why everyone is excited, but they aren&#x27;t looking at the whole picture.')
