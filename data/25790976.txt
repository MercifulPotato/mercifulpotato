Item(by='thih9', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610719125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25790357, text='&gt; As the title is just more informative, but not expressing an opinion<p>What is more informative or less informative (e.g. &quot;phones containing magnets&quot; vs &quot;iPhone 12&quot;) could be an opinion itself. The &quot;iPhone 12&quot; title definitely stands out more; at the same time it puts a slightly different focus on the article. I think people here prefer to trust the author and their judgment (as long as the original title isn&#x27;t open clickbait).')
