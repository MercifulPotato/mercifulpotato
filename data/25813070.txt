If it&#x27;s not new operating system, breakthrough in artificial intelligence or self driving washing machine think how can you prove your concept without a co-founder.<p>First think how can you prove your concept without any technical skills. Can your idea be implemented via spreadsheet? Can you do everything manually? Can you write fake forms and then send email by yourself?<p>If not then second question comes to mind: Can you hire someone to build a prototype to prove the idea? Are you willing to invest few thousand dollars into a prototype to prove your hypothesis, gather initial data and then approach investors to raise initial capital to hire team of engineer that would build the product?<p>Again: rarely there is a need for a technical co-founder and if your startup is not progressing only because you can&#x27;t find one, well I have bad news for you son. You have 99 problems but technical co-founder won&#x27;t solve more than 1!')
