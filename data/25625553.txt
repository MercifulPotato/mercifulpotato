The very next day, we both received pop-up ads on Facebook about cheap return flights to Tokyo.<p>&gt; A private conversation with a friend about how I’d run out of data led to an ad about cheap 20 GB data plans<p>&gt; Suddenly I was being told [sic] mid-semester courses at various universities<p>I absolutely belive Facebook can find system information like data caps, or can read notifications (as they explicitly ask for this to auto-fill SMS-based 2FA logins). As far as being in the same location as your buddy you took a trip with, that&#x27;s a lack of imagination on the advertisers part - you get ads to return to Japan the same way you get ads for the vacuum you <i>just. bought.</i> As far as the writer possibly going back to school? I&#x27;d say many writers enjoy writing - so many, in fact, that prices have been depressed for decades. I&#x27;d assume many writers have to return to school and change careers.<p>Is it possible Facebook is listening? I won&#x27;t dismiss it without at least reading the article.
