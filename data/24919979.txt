My parents will have to renew their houses roof next year and obviously, adding solar with a battery would make sense. However, while doing so would technically be cheaper than buying power from the grid, it would be even cheaper to do it in two (or four, or six ...) years to come as batteries will be even cheaper then. So they probably will not buy them now.')
