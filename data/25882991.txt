Microsoft joined in with Visual J++ and it was also obvious that it was going to be important on the Mac.  (I couldn&#x27;t get it to do anything useful on my IIcx, unfortunately.) Then, with the introduction of the HotSpot VM along with Java 1.2, it got really good.<p>These days, we&#x27;re spoiled with our wide variety of available, free languages, but at the time most software for Windows was written in Visual Basic, Pascal (Delphi), or C++, none of which was free.  And Windows was almost all of the desktop PC market share.  The promise of write-once-run-anywhere also made Java really interesting.')
