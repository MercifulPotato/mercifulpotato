But if you monitor the raw values for the important parameters (unreadable, reallocated, etc sectors), I&#x27;ve had good luck with replacing drives before software notices. At least for spinning drives; SSD failues were way more rare, but resulted in the drives completely disappearing from the bus, and no reliable prefail indicators. I did have one SSD go through a big reallocation that tanked throughput and the alerts from throughput and the alerts from SMART thresholds fired simultaneously.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s great for a server farm; in home use monitoring is a lot less structured.')
