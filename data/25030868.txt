Is that not enough influence? Cali and NY make up almost a third of the electoral votes.<p>Is it really fair for these two places to control and dictate the policies of a country spread as far and wide as the US? Hasnt the blue&#x2F;red divide, not only in the country but within states themselves show that the desires and attitudes of people are heavily influenced by their geographic location? Isn’t a good thing there’s a political system (the electorates) that accounts for this?')
