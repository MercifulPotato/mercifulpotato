Banks lend when it makes business sense, then, because of legal requirements, they search for reserves in the inter-bank system.<p>If the inter-bank system doesn&#x27;t have spare reserves, the interest rate goes up. If the central bank doesn&#x27;t want the interest rate to go up, it will add reserves to the system, independently of the quantity of deposits in the system.<p>For instance, the reason the interest rate is so low now in most of the world, it&#x27;s not because there are a lot of deposits, but because there are a lot of reserves coming from the central banks.')
