You need to include that in your analysis.<p>There&#x27;s strong evidence that the economy suffers whether or not governments institute lockdowns, mostly because people choose not to go out on their own. For example, take a look at the Swedish unemployment rate over the past year: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;527418&#x2F;sweden-monthly-unemployment-rate&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;527418&#x2F;sweden-monthly-un...</a><p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t say &quot;the FDA&quot;, I said &quot;institutions&quot; in general. That includes both government organizations like the CDC and the WHO and the mainstream media.<p>The CDC didn&#x27;t lie either, AFAIK. The WHO is irrelevant in this case because they&#x27;re not in charge of approving vaccines in the US.<p>&gt; Oh, you want me to reinvent society from scratch?\n&gt; You&#x27;re right that I don&#x27;t have a working alternative society in my back pocket, but our current society is clearly not working. The first thing to do if you&#x27;re in a hole is to stop digging.<p>There&#x27;s no need to reinvent society from scratch, but if you criticize a situation harshly it&#x27;s best to have your desired alternative in mind: what, exactly, do you want people to start or stop doing?')
