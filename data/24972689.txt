I found it via an article about Santa Fe, NM and Fort Collins, CO. I actually went and visited Santa Fe and would never have if it weren&#x27;t for this site. There are pages on &quot;jokes&quot;, sections devoted to chocolate, antique sewing machines, bookbinding, x-files, etc., etc. This is a total time warp back to the old style internet. It&#x27;s a treasure.')
