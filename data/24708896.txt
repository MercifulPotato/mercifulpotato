I wonder what that&#x27;s for? Making it a bit harder to reset the clock and disconnect internet to work around time limits? Do they do game rentals on PlayStation?<p>Liquid metal is surprising. I think the only other consumer product that uses it is some Asus gaming laptops. They made a video [0] talking about the difficulty of application in a production environment.<p>That cooler is impressive. So many heatpipes, complex geometries, lots of copper. Squirrel-cage (blower) fans are usually a bad sign but that thing is so huge it probably doesn&#x27;t have to spin very fast. That was pretty much the only way they could fit a big quiet-er fan in a traditional console rectangle. Microsoft took the other approach of changing the case to fit a traditional 135mm PC fan.<p>The dust catchers are a nice attention to detail. Nice to be able to clean the thing without voiding the warranty (in some countries). Wonder how well they work, there&#x27;s no mesh or anything so I suppose they just designed the airflow to slow down and leave dust behind?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they&#x27;re selling these at a loss at $499.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pbCw1FD22Bo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pbCw1FD22Bo</a>')
