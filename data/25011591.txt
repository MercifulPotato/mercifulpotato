Item(by='nurspouse', descendants=None, kids=[25011967], score=None, time=1604700114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25009304, text='&gt; Several of the engineers I worked with a few years ago left Intel (for the company I work at) after they switched to hotdesking to save money on facilities.<p>Throwaway account as I work there, but I&#x27;d like to make some minor corrections to this: I don&#x27;t think most of Intel ever switched to hotdesking. It was a trial program. In my building it was on one or two floors. I can&#x27;t speak for all the locations, but most of the other buildings at our site did not have this at all. Unfortunately I was on that floor and hotdesked for 2 years.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure none of the process&#x2F;fab folks were hotdesked (I used to work in that area and stayed in touch with those folks). Nor did any of the circuit designers&#x2F;architecture folks get hotdesked. After a few years, the trial was over and everyone reverted back to having their own permanent desk.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly unlikely that this is a reason for Intel&#x27;s decline.')
