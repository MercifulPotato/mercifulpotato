Item(by='wongarsu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605113366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025391, text='Passenger cars all moved from a body-on-frame structure to a more integrated unibody construction where a lot of the rigidity is provided by other parts that happen to be located on the underside of the car. In an electric car that has a battery on the underside, delegating some of that structural integrity to the fairly rigid battery pack seems like an obvious extension of that trend. I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s what Musk means when he talks about structural batteries. That will probably mean some changes to the battery packs to make them more fit for that purpose (that could mean changes to the cells, but doesn&#x27;t have to)<p>Integrating battery packs anywhere else in the body of the car seems much less practical. These car batteries aren&#x27;t like notebook batteries: they have dedicated heating and cooling systems in addition to high current connectors, fire proof casings, emergency shutoffs etc. You can&#x27;t just pepper those around the car.')
