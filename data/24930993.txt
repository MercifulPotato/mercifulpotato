It just seemed so odd to hear them say that when at the same time the doctors and nurses were screaming that they didn&#x27;t have enough.<p>There have been so many mixed and misleading messages I understand why some people doubt the efficacy of masks.<p>Remember &quot;Don&#x27;t touch your face&quot;? What happened to that?<p>I think if the communication people had just come clean and admitted they mislead the public in order to secure the PPE the healthcare system needed and prevent hoarding (Like what happened with TP), there would be far less anti-mask rhetoric.<p>Unfortunately these politicians doubled down and tried to differentiate between medical and non medical masks. Totally a CMA attitude that understandably has been met with a degree of mistrust.')
