There’s really no probably about it; it’s just the way it is, might have been intentional, might have been completely unwitting. The solution should be to refactor if you have to but in a way that doesn’t change the underlying functionality.<p>If you think about it, there is an extreme case as a contractor where the code you need to change is so convoluted and impossible to understand (imagine a neural net without the training set) that you just can’t change it without refactoring. So I would argue refactoring is necessary sometimes.')
