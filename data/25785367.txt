The intercept decided not to publish greenwald&#x27;s piece because the sourcing was too thin (in their opinion and mine, I get it if others don&#x27;t agree), and he took it personally. I&#x27;ve reacted badly to this kind of thing too, so I get it I guess, but it still makes him a bitter man who can&#x27;t handle the hit to his ego.')
