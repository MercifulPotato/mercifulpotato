Period. I&#x27;m probably never going to switch to Linux either.<p>This sounds to me as if you were saying &quot;since I won&#x27;t be switching away from Apple, I find criticism of Apple tiring because it won&#x27;t change my mind&quot;. Which seemed to imply to me that you were taking Apple criticism as an invalidation of your personal beliefs &#x2F; preferences. But I don&#x27;t think it should be construed that way. It&#x27;s just criticism of a company.<p>I apologise if I misconstrued your position.')
