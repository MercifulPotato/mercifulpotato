Original thought requires more energy expenditure (to push against entropy) than simply copying someone else&#x27;s thinking.<p>So my hypothesis is that if your body is better at providing energy to the brain and not &quot;wasting&quot; it on other energy sinks around your body, you&#x27;ll be better at independent thinking (and also intelligence, since it also boosts your ability to create models).<p>But that&#x27;s just my totally unproven and anecdotal hypothesis, although I guess it might be worth checking out scientifically.')
