I have to run certain calls through an external VoIP system in order to record them, because intentionally or not Google has gotten call recording in Android into an utterly broken state. Most of the time proper call recording is not possible. Some of the time it might be, if you have rooted the device, for some devices. It is next to impossible to figure out what the case is for a given device unless you buy one, root it, and try. I have resorted to using an old-fashioned stick-on microphone made for a desk phone and an external voice recorder in some cases, but this obviously isn&#x27;t a very portable solution and given the obvious potential of smartphones it&#x27;s ridiculous that external hardware is required for such a basic feature.<p>A feature that Google themselves once made a big point of offering with Google Voice, but one wonders if that&#x27;s just because it was a feature of Grand Central they didn&#x27;t feel they could cut without losing too many users---not that Google Voice has ever felt like a very active product on Google&#x27;s end, with the decade plus UI stagnation and Google Hangouts integration.<p>There is some technical complexity involved here because, at least on older phones, during phone calls the baseband seizes direct control of some audio hardware, so the speaker audio may not &quot;pass through&quot; the operating system at all. But it <i>used</i> to be that call-recording was straightforwardly possible on older devices as a baseband feature and for the large part it seems to have been intentionally removed after the first generation or two of Android devices.')
