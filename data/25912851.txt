(I paid 12% of total income the last year I worked in Toronto.)<p>3) Everybody I know in Canada is happy with health care, and infinitely happier than Americans who&#x27;ve received false bills.<p>4) Startups have a big advantage in Canada because of the state health care, and unrelated lower salary expectations.<p>However, salaries are lower in Canada because companies pay less (like Europe or anywhere outside the US), but that&#x27;s not related to taxes or health care.')
