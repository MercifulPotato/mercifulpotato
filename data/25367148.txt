Real-time collaboration is smooth. Somehow it’s much more performant than using word locally. You can add comments, assign tasks to others (also using comments and +&lt;email address&gt; To tag the assignee). You can also write suggested edits for someone else to approve. Annotations&#x2F;references and figure numbering are there via plugins.<p>Share point&#x2F;teams real-time collaboration also works, although not as well, but it has a fatal flaw: it’s too easy to download and work locally, so most users will do this and break the real-time collaboration aspect, without even realizing this was a feature in the first place, falling back on passing around v2_final.docs files that have to be merged.<p>In google docs, you can even use word docs natively now, though a few features are missing. You need a bit of discipline in the team to live with missing this or that tiny formatting detail, again to avoid breaking real-time collaboration.')
