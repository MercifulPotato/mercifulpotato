If you are any company involved in South Africa during apartheid you should choose a side on apartheid and voice that position.<p>If BLM means just the simple definition of what the words imply (that black lives matter), there&#x27;s no point in saying it. Because there&#x27;s literally no one on the other side. I suspect that&#x27;s not what it means, because saying a broader statement &quot;All Lives Matter&quot; seems to be considered a kind of slur.<p>So &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; means something deeper. More like &quot;Black people are killed indiscriminately by police in this country. The cops get away with it, and it&#x27;s a huge problem.&quot;  That is full of assumptions and political beliefs that reasonable people can disagree about. And I don&#x27;t see why every company should take a side on that issue.')
