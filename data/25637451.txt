I was really excited going into the interview because I&#x27;m a big fan of Atul Gawande and I thought there was huge potential for a transformative impact. But when I talked to them it was clear that they didn&#x27;t have a clear vision of how specifically they were going to transform healthcare. I got the sense that the engineers were just messing around waiting for the healthcare and product people to tell them what to build. They clearly had a lot of talent and resources and I&#x27;m sad they weren&#x27;t able to make it work.')
