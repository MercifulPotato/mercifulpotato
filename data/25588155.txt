I think it’s the idea that we all get so many years. A 25-year-old and an 85-year-old both getting terminal cancers tends to be looked at very differently. Maybe by them, too.<p>Or look at it in a probabilistic sense. I think the actuarial table puts an 85-year-old at having about 5 years left on average. For a 25-year-old it’s more like 55. So a loss of one causes a loss of much more human life.')
