I don&#x27;t see why the crime of the person should matter. What do people think they&#x27;re going to vote for, a rape and murder party?<p>Being incarcerated is the punishment; denying the vote is just cheap populism, being seen to be &#x27;tough on crime&#x27;, with the added benefit (for politicians) that if prisoners have no vote there&#x27;s no incentive to treat them humanely.')
