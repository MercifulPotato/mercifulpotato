I had 3 different doctors tell me I was crazy before I said fuck this.  The most helpful book that I have found is &quot;Why Isn&#x27;t My Brain Working?&quot; [1] by Dr. Datis Kharrazian, he is both an MD and a naturopath.  Lots and lots of insights into why the brain fog is happening, and even more advice on diet, lifestyle and supplementation measures to minimize it.<p>I seem to have some dietary autoimmune stuff going on as well which is incredibly difficult to deal with, my friends know me as that person who brings home cooked food around everywhere, as I know there are no spices or grains that will set me off.  Eating out I usually just order a salad with no croutons, no cheese, no nightshades, no dressing outside of olive oil, and a meat to go on it.  But even then, if the meat has spices, I&#x27;m in trouble.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brainhealthbook.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brainhealthbook.com&#x2F;</a> -- also available on the large book piracy site')
