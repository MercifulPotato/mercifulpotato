As far as the participants of the experiment are told the learner is, like them a volunteer.  That means the learner has just as much autonomy to end the experiment as the teacher.<p>So why isn&#x27;t the learner calling an end to the experiment - why should this be on the teacher to call it quits?  Either the learner is making a fuss, but that&#x27;s just how they react to a bit of pain (think about how people can squeal getting into a cold bath voluntarily) but they are happy to continue.  Alternatively they are being actively coerced into continuing - in which case the correct response for the teacher is what exactly?<p>Maybe try and jump the supervisor and make a bolt for the door?  You are clearly trapped by some kind of sadistic serial killer and you are unlikely to make it out alive.')
