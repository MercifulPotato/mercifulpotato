Generally, uploading whole content owned by someone else is not fair use absent something like the content being newsworthy in itself (such as video of a police beating). Otherwise, fair use would generally require some transformative effort.<p><i>Likewise, since they are unit testing rather than viewing the content, I doubt there is any commercial harm and the market overlap between video viewers and unit testers is zero. </i><p>Copyright violations don&#x27;t require the copyright holder to prove commercial harm. That&#x27;s the entire point of statutory damages.')
