Yet companies like Shopify are some of the biggest success stories and I know engineers who are very, very happy there.<p>You can give every engineer and team complete freedom, and you’ll end up with too many microservices to count, with ineffective higher level strategic alignment. The result? Horrible environment to get the things that matters done. Little upside for your stock.<p>Stop thinking of VPs and executives as harmful gatekeepers.
