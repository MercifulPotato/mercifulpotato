Item(by='boogies', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611685447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919145, text='Read, my first favorite comment was <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17613281" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17613281</a> and I find it pretty accurate. Sometimes great comments turn grey just after posting only to bounce back up later, thanks to people taking time to read them. I’ve also had showdead enabled in my profile settings virtually the whole time I’ve been here, and been able to vouch for some wrongly killed posts, as the mods say:<p>&gt; Currently, when an account is banned, a software filter trips, or enough users flag a post, the post goes [dead], meaning only users with ‘showdead’ turned on in their profile can see it. The trouble is that some posts end up [dead] when they shouldn’t be. Banned accounts sometimes post good comments, software filters sometimes have false positives, and users sometimes flag things unfairly.\n[<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ycombinator.com&#x2F;two-hn-announcements&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ycombinator.com&#x2F;two-hn-announcements&#x2F;</a>]')
