There are many scenarios to which I don&#x27;t know how cherry-pick would react.  Maybe I should just try them.<p>&quot;applying the diffs onto other commits&quot; is all well and good for simple scenarios where there are not multiple interpretations of changes.  But for other scenarios, it requires one to know what&#x27;s actually in a diff, which I don&#x27;t know.  In fact, different git clients present diffs differently.  Is that evidence that diffs aren&#x27;t a real thing?  I don&#x27;t know.')
