The real degree of censorship is minimal and liable to remain such.  You don&#x27;t understand how societies process information in the context of our increasingly balkanized asylum.<p>Allowing the lunatics to spread their message via effective platforms that are designed to promote your brand of bullshit to the people most likely to be vulnerable to it does NOT stop it from festering it actually maximizes the spread of the cancer.  If it spreads fast enough you wont have a society to inform anymore because fascists only believe in free speech when its their speech if they gain enough power they will quickly take yours from you.')
