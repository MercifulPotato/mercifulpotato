I have jailbroken iPhones and an iPod Touch before, they were my devices and I did as I saw fit.<p>On the other hand I don&#x27;t feel I have the right to dictate to anyone else what sort of products they may or may not sell, or how they work, beyond health and safety, accessibility, etc. I don&#x27;t see that I have a right to tell Nintendo that they must write software to support side loading games for my Switch for example, or demand via government regulation that Sony can&#x27;t charge a fee for developers to create games for the Playstation.  As long as I know up front what the features and services are that come with my purchase, I have a free choice whether to accept them or not.<p>In particular, I certainly don&#x27;t think I have the right to tell other members of the public that they should not have the option to buy those products on those terms if they wish. What right do I have to interfere in the product design of popular products, used by millions of people that are perfectly happy with them? Especially if that will force the company involved to change it&#x27;s business practices and charging structure in ways those customers would not be happy with.')
