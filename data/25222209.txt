Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606413834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25221714, text='#2 was the most frustrating thing (to me) about writing software, and ultimately what got me to move out of coding over to other areas of the business. This universal acceptance of low quality and crashing. You always have the classic &quot;Schedule, cost, quality, pick 2&quot; tradeoff, and 99 out of 100 places you&#x27;ll work will throw quality under the bus when push comes to shove.<p>I remember the exact turning point. We had a super buggy Windows application that had tons of crashes in it. Instead of root causing each crash and fixing them, I was asked to simply write a launcher app that sat in the background, waited for the application to crash, then re-launch it. That was the great solution. And it was totally acceptable to the customer. Arghhhhh! I remember thinking: I didn&#x27;t spend four years in university to shit this kind of finished product out.')
