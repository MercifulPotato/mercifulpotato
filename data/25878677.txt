Back in the days when CMOS scaling was simple, it referred to the half-pitch, half of the center-to-center distance of the Metal 1 lines.  The gate length was roughly the same, usually.  But scaling had to be changed starting in roughly 2003 because atoms don&#x27;t scale; the joke was that transistors were no longer switches, but just dimmers, because leakage was an increasing problem.  Designs could no longer be simply scaled, producing a faster clock cycle for free; they had to be revised, and a FinFET looks very different from a traditional FET.<p>To make further progress designs had to be changed, and things have gotten fuzzier.  Processes from different foundries have different densities.  Intel&#x27;s process for a given node is denser than that of the big foundries like TSMC.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikichip.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;technology_node" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikichip.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;technology_node</a> for more on this.')
