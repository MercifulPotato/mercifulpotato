So now we&#x27;re left with a bad network and legal structures in place to stop it from being privately superseded.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itnews.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;tpg-calls-for-nbn-protectionism-to-end-554297" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itnews.com.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;tpg-calls-for-nbn-protectioni...</a>')
