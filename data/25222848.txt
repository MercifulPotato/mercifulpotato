For spatial computing we need to scale all three simultaneously <i>in a single computational construct</i>. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, these are real-time systems that need to support extremely high write throughput while all of those operations are happening -- offline batch reorganization isn&#x27;t an option. These are petabyte scale systems in the trivial case (tens of TB in the most minimalist data models), so you aren&#x27;t going to be building a bunch of indexes or similar.<p>It is a vexing computer science and architecture problem. And even if you solved that elementary computing infrastructure problem, there are several more hard&#x2F;interesting computer science problems related to topological types and conflict resolution that you&#x27;ll likely need to solve before you have a useful system. It is headaches all the way down.')
