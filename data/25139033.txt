I am not an expert, but my humble, quick one-liner to describe how I see Unions is the following:<p>Unions are good to protect employees that don&#x27;t have negotiating power (e.g. factory workers), otherwise companies would take too much advantage of them.<p>I am not sure this necessarily applies to knowledge workers, especially if their work can be done remotely to some extent.<p>And I am not saying that I am against unions; but like with everything else in life, everything comes with pros and cons.<p>I have personally witnessed several examples of unions using their position to drive their political agenda at the expense of well-intentioned companies (most of it in my home country, Italy, in the 1990s and 2000s). So, beware: unions do not solve everything; they bring their own set of problems.')
