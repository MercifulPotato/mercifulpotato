Of course, the rest of Catholic Europe sent in several crusades to crush the heretics, without much success.<p>One of the many reasons why the crusaders failed were so-called Wagenburgs [0]. Basically, the Hussite army would be underway with very heavy wagons and, if the scouts brought back information about an approaching enemy, would build a provisional fort out of them fairly quickly. Such a fort could not be swept away by a cavalry attack and if the defenders had enough guns (and by that time early firearms were already used in Europe), the knights tightly packed around the wagenburg would present a perfect target.<p>Plus, there were kids under the wagons with very sharp scythes, hacking at the unprotected horses&#x27; legs just in front of them, just as you mention.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wagon_fort#Czechs_and_Hussites" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wagon_fort#Czechs_and_Hussites</a>')
