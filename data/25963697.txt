By Uk standards I&#x27;m probably just to the right of centre.<p>However, it _shouldn&#x27;t_ matter what &quot;side&quot; you are on, if you&#x27;re being a shit, you should be punished.<p>However that doesn&#x27;t excuse doxxing, pileons, knowingly spreading fake news. We have to accept that we live in information bubbles unless we activly seek the edges. Its perfectly possible to deliberately ignore bad&#x2F;illegal behaviour if we think it perpetrated by &quot;our&quot; side.<p>For example in the US, the majority of the &quot;right&quot; are sympathetic with the &quot;insurrection&quot; but don&#x27;t like the rioting and looting. However they are not going to speak out because the people doing it are &quot;one of our own&quot;<p>In the same way that those who align more with the BLM movement will not publicly condemn the rioting and looting that happened in the summer, because it happened by &quot;their side&quot;.<p>Rioting and looting is wrong, and more often than not causes more pain to the people the rioters are supposedly trying to stand up for. But, I have empathy for those who are rioting, its fucking fun, thrilling ans intoxicating')
