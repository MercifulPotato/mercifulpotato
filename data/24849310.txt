I.e. think about something like<p><pre><code>  auto self = shared_from_this();\n  document.onclick([self](){self-&gt;doit(); } );\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not sure there is a way to express that in C++ without use of enable_shared_from_this.<p>It is very easy to accidentally run this kind of code from a constructor where shared_from_this() is a 0-ptr.<p>make_shared also only helps in 95% of cases.  E.g. it does not allow specifying a custom deleter, which is a use-case that is allowed by the shared_ptr&lt;&gt; constructor.  It also won&#x27;t fix any of the problems WRT shared_from_this() being called in the constructor.')
