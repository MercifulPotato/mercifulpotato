Each site had a single master, a couple read replicas, and some queries were cached in memcached.<p>The problem in MySQL we eventually ran into was the read replicas fell behind master during peak load (by 30-60 minutes depending upon the day).  So we still had to hit the master for certain queries.  I left before we took the next step to fix this issue.')
