Behavior in Preview is by far a more likely cause of the problem. Generally the thing that changed is what broke...<p>2) To the user, this looks 100% like a problem in Preview no matter what&#x27;s happening, and it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s responsibility to not do this kind of thing to users. The PDF opens properly the first time, so de facto it is &quot;valid&quot; as determined by the product that later corrupts it. As I said, handling questionably valid PDFs is part and parcel of writing PDF software, and failure to handle a PDF that otherwise renders correctly looks like a bug on your part... <i>especially</i> when it otherwise renders correctly <i>in your own software.</i>')
