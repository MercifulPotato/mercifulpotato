I use Firefox Nightly, but your prior comment implies the existence of a &quot;dev mode which is a separate install that doesn&#x27;t update&quot;; Firefox Nightly updates just fine, and it&#x27;s not a separate install, it&#x27;s the only Firefox on my machine. It&#x27;s perfectly stable, I haven&#x27;t had a crash in years. And I didn&#x27;t need to change any settings to install my add-on, I just clicked the &quot;install from disk&quot; option in the add-ons menu.')
