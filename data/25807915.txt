You can&#x27;t survive in a liberal environment if you don&#x27;t support abortion and you can&#x27;t survive in a conservative environment if you support gun control.<p>Your friends will argue with you, you&#x27;ll be surrounded by memes making fun of people who believe what you do. There&#x27;s incredible social forces to conform to the exact set of beliefs espoused by political parties, which are mostly set by corporate interests.<p>It&#x27;s a huge part of what the Republican party has struggled with: There&#x27;s both the clear vision of conservative values and ideals... and Donald Trump.
