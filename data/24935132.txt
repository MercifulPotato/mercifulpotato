In my opinion, there is some evidence: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24934971" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24934971</a><p>Of course it&#x27;s not proof, but there&#x27;s currently some evidence indicating it&#x27;s real, and currently no evidence indicating it&#x27;s doctored. Given the circumstances, it&#x27;d be extremely irresponsible for any media outlet to assume they&#x27;re definitely true, but it&#x27;s almost as irresponsible to assume they can&#x27;t possibly be true and to not even raise the possibility they could be real.')
