International packages from suspect countries (e.g. The Netherlands) might be checked more frequently. As far as I understand, in the case something is caught by customs it&#x27;s possible to just deny you ever ordered anything and I doubt law enforcement or customs would bother taking it any further unless it was a huge amount, they&#x27;ll incinerate it and move on.')
