It&#x27;s a legal liability for them, and most of them are struggling to work at the scale their customers demand already. But <i>publishers want high advertising rates</i> and that means <i>advertisers want to make good bids</i> and that means <i>both actually want a data broker involved</i> to deal with the technical (collection, filtering, aggregation, ETL) and legal (GDPR) bullshit.<p>But then <i>publishers and advertisers</i> don&#x27;t do their due diligence or decent engineering and just shovel illegal shit to data brokers on the backend. The ones that shut up and launder it do well; the ones that actually try to do a good (technical, legal) job drown in account management and data processing overhead.<p>So fuck that site. They <i>are</i> the ones that care about your data, they&#x27;re just making a show of keeping their hands clean while they pay someone else for the dirty work and hiding behind their (half willful half stupid) ignorance of how their own industry works.')
