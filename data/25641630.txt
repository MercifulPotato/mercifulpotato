There was no such law...  did they somehow secretly know what was happening 5 years down the road and said, uhh, let&#x27;s wait this out.<p>No, they could have done this before AB 5.  They did not.  This seems to say that this move would have happened if conditions allowed it and the situation was right for business.<p>What that means is sure AB 5 would have nixed this option.  However, the trend before AB 5 was to off-load &quot;non-core&quot; competencies.  Prop 22 re-instated the previous status, it did not introduce an altogether new status.<p>Prop 22 indicated the people preferred the original status to the new status introduced by AB 5, so we&#x27;re back to where we started before AB 5.')
