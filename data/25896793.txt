Because this seems like beating a strawman.<p>&gt; Copyleft licenses such as AGPL force adopters to publish changes back to the source repo or offer them via network protocols.<p>The AGPL specifically does this, other copyleft licenses (like the GPL do not for “adopters”, only for people redistributing executables)<p>&gt; This is meant to deter third parties from offering competing hosted services<p>No, copyleft in general is about prohibiting downstream <i>proprietary</i> distributions (and also, in the AGPL case, proprietary hosted versions) it is not supposed to prevent <i>competing</i> software&#x2F;services.<p>&gt; Instead, why not do what traditional businesses are doing, sell a product, and simply charge for the value it provides?<p>That&#x27;s what “open source” companies do. The thing they sell <i>is</i> the product (whether it&#x27;s support and consultancy, the value-add of the enterprise version of an open-core product, or hosted SaaS.)<p>The problem with “prop-tech” is often, as this piece itself points out, but entirely fails to address in recommending “prop-tech”: “the world of FOSS is full of strong and established offerings with a zero-dollar price tag.” And making your tech proprietary doesn&#x27;t stop you from having to compete with the open-source competition.')
