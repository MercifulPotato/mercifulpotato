Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25900514, 25902468, 25900265], score=None, time=1611557046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25899025, text='It&#x27;s weird to hear you say that, because SMS is terrible.  Unreliable delivery, delivery receipts that come back even if the recipient&#x27;s phone is turned off, no media (MMS is also terrible, just try to send a video over it and watch the pixelated garbage that comes out the other side), no privacy or security to speak of, carrier interop issues (character encodings, message length, shortcode support), identity tied to your phone number, no ability to send&#x2F;receive messages without being tethered to the phone (to be fair, Signal and WhatsApp also have this problem)...  I could go on.')
