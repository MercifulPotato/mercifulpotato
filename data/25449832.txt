I just demonstrated he was worth 650M while at MS, and that that amount would be 1B today, yet he&#x27;s worth 800B.<p>Are you going to claim he spent that 650, then made the next 800M on IV? If so, provide some proof. Handwaving is not proof.<p>Hopefully you can provide more evidence than your initial post, which was clearly all speculation without evidence. It&#x27;s funny you call mine a bunch of speculation, when your statements are quite a bit more speculative.<p>&gt;Nathan&#x27;s founding of Intellectual Ventures caused everyone in the world to get slightly poorer.<p>Well, if you&#x27;re to be believed, it must have made Nathan and investors richer. Maybe you&#x27;re not using words in the normal usage when you make such absolute claims.<p>&gt;In turn Nathan caused the current patent trolling we see from IBM,<p>Nathan forming a company in 2000 made IBM do patent licensing since it was founded?<p>That is impressive.<p>They&#x27;ve licensed patents since nearly their beginning in 1911. IBM&#x27;s current licensing push started in the late 1980s&#x2F;early 1990s, well before IV started. They were not just amassing patents for over a century solely to use themselves. They have been in the patent licensing business for decades [1], likely well before any of us were born.<p>You&#x27;re making stuff up to suit a narrative.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;mac&#x2F;classes&#x2F;6.805&#x2F;articles&#x2F;int-prop&#x2F;heckel-debunking.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;mac&#x2F;classes&#x2F;6.805&#x2F;articles&#x2F;int-p...</a>')
