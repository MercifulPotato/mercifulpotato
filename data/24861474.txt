I&#x27;ve never had a problem with strength the way that I use it in my designs, PET-G is plenty durable for a small device which spends 99% of its life inside a larger device. Also the heat resistance makes it tolerate the summer heat of cars which is also important.<p>Also PET-G has the added benefit of not giving me cancer like ABS. It definitely has a learning curve and I wouldn&#x27;t fault anyone for going other routes rather than taking the time to get a feel for it.')
