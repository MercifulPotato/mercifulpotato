If it makes you feel any better, I&#x27;m a Hurricane Electric certified IPv6 sage and I implement text-based telecommunications protocols so well that even Chinese operators use my code, because they like to implement creative extensions like the ones you describe, and the stuff I write is just so generalized that it can smoothly &#x2F; easily enable that multitude of visions. Why? Is it because I&#x27;m unique? No. It&#x27;s simply because my work follows the same free-spiritedness that&#x27;s always guided IETF publications. They built us the best of all possible internets, and nothing, including IPv4 address exhaustion, is going to change that.')
