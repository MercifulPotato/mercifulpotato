Suppose that you remake say, Batman, with Batman as a black woman instead of a white man. Even assume that there&#x27;s some nefarious political agenda forcing that decision. How does that make the show less entertaining? It seems like how good the show is would be orthogonal to that choice. And it doesn&#x27;t take any more effort to have a black woman star than a white man, so it&#x27;s not like that choice reduces the energy they can put into making the show good.<p>On the other hand, if quite a few people just prefer to watch the version with a white man, that seems like it would correlate to the shows being cancelled, independently of how entertaining they are..')
