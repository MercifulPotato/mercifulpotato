The precise semantics of how much or how little the license diverges from the requirements of open source is an interesting topic for another time. For one, no other license, copyleft or otherwise, extends your obligations to software which is not actually a derivative work, which if nothing else requires a novel interpretation of the OSD. For now, though, I&#x27;d rather focus on the conclusion: this license does not qualify as open source, and that betrays those who choose to use or contribute to Elastic on the basis of its open source nature. They didn&#x27;t get on board with the project in order to see how a dubious new license would hold up under scrutiny. This change was made for dubiously-justified commercial reasons on the false presumption that Elastic has the sole right to exploit Elasticsearch (and Kibana) for profit, software that they have <i>shared</i> ownership over (including in terms of copyright) with the broader community. They were <i>allowed</i> to do this, by the letter of the law, but it is fucked up regardless.')
