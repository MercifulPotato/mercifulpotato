Item(by='guscost', descendants=None, kids=[24802839], score=None, time=1602855134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24798123, text='&gt; I think that moderation is a consequence of the rights to speech and association. The ability to choose what content you host, and whose content you host, is a consequence of those rights.<p>The right to speech does not mean that you are also immune from libel laws. That’s the controversial part, Facebook enjoys <i>both</i> the rights (plus consequences), <i>and</i> a special immunity under Section 230 that does not apply to any other kind of speech.<p>&gt; And when they pass laws that, de facto, restrict the ability of companies to associate and speak freely, they restrict those essential liberties.<p>Do you think that being banned from <i>Facebook</i> does not also restrict an individual’s ability to associate and speak freely, in 2020?<p>&gt; Section 230 ensured civil liberties, both Facebook&#x27;s, and yours, and mine.<p>I’m sure lawmakers are hearing this exact line from lobbyists, but it rings hollow. One of those is clearly not like the others, and perhaps the law should favor “yours and mine”.')
