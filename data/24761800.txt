Hillary on the other hand only hit 48.2% which shows 5.7% of the population was willing to go 3rd party for whatever reason.<p>In the end it’s never a single issue, Hillary supporters stayed home on Election Day in part because she was predicated to win.  That’s the kind of issue that makes predictions so difficult. It’s rarely a question of undecided voters, but rather who is willing to show up to vote.  Something as simple as a little rain can swing elections.')
