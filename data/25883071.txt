If you want to have market exclusivity for answers, you effectively need to prevent that community from growing so that people <i>must</i> go to you.<p>It might be possible to do this at scale. This is <i>part</i> of Red Hat&#x27;s business model, for instance: they have a customer-facing knowledge base that isn&#x27;t public that includes answers to tricky questions. But Red Hat doesn&#x27;t depend on the secrecy of this knowledge base. Your entire organization can get access to the KB if you buy a <i>single</i> Red Hat license of any type, which costs something like $50&#x2F;year. And developers at Red Hat would be happy for those problems to get fixed in the upstream projects.<p>Red Hat&#x27;s business model is more strongly around support instead of secret documentation, that is, around responses to specific questions instead of restricted-broadcast answers that help everyone. If you&#x27;re having a problem in production, Red Hat can help you figure it out (as long as you&#x27;ve been paying them for server licenses for all your servers). And the knowledge base mostly exists to deal with the problem of people having limited time - they document something that&#x27;s broken, but the intent is to actually solve it, not to leave it in the long-term state where it requires reading the KB article.<p>Now, people have been trying to do smaller-than-Red-Hat-scale support contracts for their OSS for a long while, and it&#x27;s worked in some cases (e.g., SQLite, Postgres) but not in general. It might be the case that restricted educational material works out better in practice!')
