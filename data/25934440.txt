After the invariant is established (typically by a constructor) every member function can be called for the object. An invariant can be stated informally (e.g., in a comment) or more formally using Expects.<p>&gt; If all data members can vary independently of each other, no invariant is possible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isocpp.github.io&#x2F;CppCoreGuidelines&#x2F;CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-struct" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isocpp.github.io&#x2F;CppCoreGuidelines&#x2F;CppCoreGuidelines...</a>')
