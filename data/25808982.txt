It is moving remarkably slowly, despite reusing old technology (the RS25 engines) instead of inventing from scratch like with SpaceX&#x27;s new Raptor engines. And several of the launches planned for SLS have already been shifted to commercial providers because it is not ready. I think this is ultimately a failure of federal contracting favoring large incumbents with little by way of performance incentives, instead of cultivating a healthy competitive ecosystem to get the maximum bang for the taxpayer&#x27;s buck. They need to just move on and address the systemic problems associated with how government agencies get work done (which is to say, slowly and poorly).')
