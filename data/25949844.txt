It tells a story that is set closer to the Culture and is less about its violent interventions into other civilizations; rather, it&#x27;s portrays the consequences (moral, personal, etc.) of such interventions, and about the resulting trauma among those involved.<p>Personally, I would rank Surface Detail, Consider Phlebas, and Use of Weapons higher than the others. I thought The Hydrogen Sonata had some fun parts, but was otherwise quite slight. Matter was good but also severely bloated, a bit like The Algebraist, with a long middle journey portion that felt unnecessary.')
