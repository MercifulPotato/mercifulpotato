The ancient civilizations produced a lot of masterpieces with simple hand tools. Not to mention the French periods of fine furniture such as Louis XIII which was the late 1500&#x27;s IIRC. You can do a lot with hand tools, power tools just save you a lot of time. Much of the old furniture was built with a handsaw, hand drill, planners and chisels. You could reasonably build nice things with just those, but you are going to spend months rather than weeks doing it with those tools.')
