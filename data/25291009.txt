That&#x27;s over $40k at 50 hours a week. That&#x27;s enough to live on your own in most places. If you have roommates, it goes even further.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t the $16. It&#x27;s the circumstances in very very few geographic markets where $16&#x2F;hour isn&#x27;t enough because cost of living is out of control in those few markets.')
