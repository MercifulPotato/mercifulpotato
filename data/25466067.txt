But the achilles heel of Sqlite in my experience is network filesystems - it&#x27;s well known &amp; documented that Sqlite can suffer corruption on NFS, because of issues with locking. That doesn&#x27;t really matter for iOS &amp; Android apps, where you know storage is local, but it&#x27;s a serious sticking point for desktop applications, where e.g. NFS home directories are not unusual.')
