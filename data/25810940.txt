Travel is so much easier now that I’ve usb-c-ified all the things. The only thing I wasn’t able to find a usb-c option for (back in the dizzy) was a 4g modem, but that’s ok I just stopped using it altogether and started tethering my phone or iPad instead. I often use my iPad Pro as a second screen, so usb-c there also. I do carry a small dongle that I got just in case, but I think I’ve used it maybe five times in the past two years.<p>I really don’t miss MagSafe, and I find the MagSafe usb-c adaptor solutions one can easily get these days to be quite a good compromise for those that truly want it.<p>The only thing bothering me is that lightning connectors are still a thing on iPhones. The second they release a usb-c phone I’m getting it. Usb-c all the things!<p>Oh almost forgot, hard pass on replacing the Touch Bar though. I know people hate it, but for me it’s much more useful than Fn-keys. I don’t miss them, and once the Touch Bar with a physical escape key showed up that was it –  perfection. I hope they keep Touch Bar as an option at least, brilliant piece of design in my opinion.<p>As always, mileage varies etc.')
