There might be a nuance that you (or I!) hadn&#x27;t considered, for example driving stick shift with an unsynchronised manual transmission, or shifting without clutching, or something else entirely, and the point of the &quot;fully understand&quot; qualifier might be to call attention to something like this.<p>For example: Say I can implement paxos in my sleep, debug someone elses implementation, and I can even design and implement a new consensus algorithm based on paxos where I may satisfy requirements of parts in slightly different ways that are extremely domain-specific but may be beneficial from a performance&#x2F;time&#x2F;space&#x2F;cost perspective. This is what someone might mean by &quot;fully understand&quot;-ing paxos, but making some changes to paxos may take time for me to convince myself it is correct (or incorrect!), or there might be parts I think are essential&#x2F;important that aren&#x27;t (in some situations), and so I would still be interested in learning something new. Who wouldn&#x27;t?<p>However, I don&#x27;t have good experiences with people who say &quot;there are only X people who fully understand Y so you should use Z&quot; -- it&#x27;s \nusually means they don&#x27;t understand Y as well as they understand Z, and that&#x27;s not what I want from an expert.')
