Facebook as an entity would be investigated.<p>&gt; The action on Marketplace doesn&#x27;t mention Facebook at all, so other than using the action (which doesn&#x27;t require anyone to publish it to Marketplace), which goodies exactly did Facebook get?<p>That would be having it work they wanted it to work.')
