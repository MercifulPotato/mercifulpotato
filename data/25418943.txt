Not freeing resources is a very common error; it would be nice if the compiler could help detecting it.<p>A possible explicit solution I can think of is to introduce a new function attribute that gives the name of their ‘cleanup’ function (so that the compiler would know <i>fopen</i> needs a <i>fclose</i>, for example) and a compiler that uses these attributes to issue a warning if a function has a path that calls a function and doesn’t either call its cleanup function or returns its result.<p>I don’t know whether that would cover all bases, though.')
