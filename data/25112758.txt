You can try searching for &quot;covid vaccine trial&quot; in your area, or reaching out to your local department of health. My wife is in the Oxford-Astrazeneca trial here in Minnesota. She was recruited through a Facebook ad. The downside is you don&#x27;t know whether you got the placebo or the real thing :) My wife has a 2&#x2F;3 chance of having the vaccine. It&#x27;s unclear to me when they will unblind her. It seems unethical not to unblind participants if a safe, effective vaccine is available, but I&#x27;m not an expert on trial methodology.')
