That&#x27;s a heck of a lot of bandwidth.<p>I was doing the specs from memory and conservatively: 128GB sticks across 48-channels.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermicro.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;system&#x2F;7U&#x2F;7088&#x2F;SYS-7088B-TR4FT.cfm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermicro.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;system&#x2F;7U&#x2F;7088&#x2F;SYS-70...</a><p>This 8-way Supermicro system supports 192x DIMMs. So... 128GB sticks  x 192 == 24TBs of RAM or so, maybe 48TBs.<p>&gt; At a certain point, you&#x27;re better off investing in making your application work on an accelerator of some kind, in the form of a GPU or an FPGA or task-specific ASIC, rather than giving Intel all your money in the hopes of eeking out a marginal performance improvement. Alternatively, finding software that can scale to more than one machine.<p>I mean, these 8-way systems are what? $500k ? Less than $1MM for sure. How many engineers do you need before a machine of that price is reasonable?<p>Really, not that many. If you can solve a problem with a team of 10 engineers + 48 TBs of RAM, that&#x27;s probably cheaper than trying to solve the same problem with 30 engineers with a cheaper computer.<p>-----------<p>&gt; An 8-socket system is going to consume an enormous amount of power, cost an unbelievable amount of money, and the complex NUMA domain combined with Intel&#x27;s interconnect isn&#x27;t going to &quot;just work&quot; for almost any software, so you&#x27;re likely going to put a lot of effort into making that system barely work.<p>NUMA scales better than RDMA &#x2F; Ethernet &#x2F; Infiniband. A lot, lot, LOT better.<p>All communications are just memory-reads, and that&#x27;s a real memory read. Not an &quot;emulated memory read transmitted over Ethernet &#x2F; RDMA pretending to be a memory read&quot;. You incur the NUMA penalty but that&#x27;s almost certainly better than incurring a PCIe penalty.')
