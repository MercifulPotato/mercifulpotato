At the time the group was pretty small, about 12 engineers depending on how you counted. Besides Mark Miller who had done the foundational work on Joule at Agorics I also had Whit Diffie to help with the cryptographic aspects, and access to some of the top infosec people of the time.<p>Literally as soon as we started prototyping &quot;Webrunner&quot; (which later became &quot;HotJava&quot;), the web browser written in Java, we started talking about the risks associated with loading executable content from a server you didn&#x27;t trust and running it on your computer.<p>Everyone agreed we had to do <i>something</i> but not everyone agreed with how much we should do given that Sun was going to toss the language anyway and so we would be lucky if we got half the number of users that Tcl already had.<p>I was nominally tasked with solving this problem and chose to solve it to the best of my ability.<p>To do that I created a system for signing Java code, a capabilities model that would prevent unauthorized code execution, started Sun on the path of licensing a right to use the RSA <i>patent</i>, added an entire crypto subsystem to the sys.* code base, negotiated with the NSA a system that would allow Sun to actually ship strong encryption in an interpreted language, and designed some structure that had to be in the JVM to support this framework.<p>But what you have failed to grasp is that <i>at the time</i> the prevailing attitude at Sun corporate was that this was a &#x27;throw away&#x27; project and amongst some of the engineers in the team, they were more interested in showing off their language design skills rather produce something that was an actual <i>product</i>. After all, as these language designers reasoned, Java had removed all the things that made C and C++ unsafe right? So if the language was correct (as the reasoning went) it couldn&#x27;t possibly be used to do something bad.<p>One of them felt all of this &quot;security complexity&quot; was unnecessary. They also felt that my checking into the code base this complex stuff was disruptive. But they did agree that there needed to be &quot;something&quot; so they wrote the SecurityManager class over the weekend and called it done. And threatened to quit when I tried to get it undone.')
