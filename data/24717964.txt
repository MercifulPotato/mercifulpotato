Developing new and novel algorithms, or applying already existing algorithms to new and novel problems, domains and datasets? If it&#x27;s the latter then high level math skills aren&#x27;t that necessary.<p>A solid understanding of the domain and data under investigation is much more important, as is being a decent programmer, knowing your way around data cleaning and data management and having a solid understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithms out there.<p>If you&#x27;re interested the absolute best way to get started is just to start. Download a well studied data set like this one:  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yann.lecun.com&#x2F;exdb&#x2F;mnist&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;yann.lecun.com&#x2F;exdb&#x2F;mnist&#x2F;</a>\nGrab one of the dozens of tutorials that talk about how to approach this data set and follow along in something like scikit-learn or Flux.jl. You&#x27;ll soon enough have gone from zero to having developed a tool that can recognize handwritten digits. From there you can just keep going.')
