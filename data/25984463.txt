So you have a USB socket on one side, you plug your normal USB keyboard or mouse into it, then that socket is connected to the microcontroller, and there are two wires (PS&#x2F;2 clock and data) connecting the microcontroller to the FPGA.<p>Some hobbyist and educational FPGA dev boards do that, because handling PS&#x2F;2 on the FPGA is so much easier than raw USB. Here is one example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reference.digilentinc.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;programmable-logic&#x2F;nexys-a7&#x2F;reference-manual" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reference.digilentinc.com&#x2F;reference&#x2F;programmable-log...</a><p>&quot;The Auxiliary Function microcontroller (Microchip PIC24FJ128) provides the Nexys A7 with USB Embedded HID host capability. &quot;')
