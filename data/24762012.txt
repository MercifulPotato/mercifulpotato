The &quot;mass audience&quot; is just a selling point.<p>Neither investors nor the web&#x2F;mobile &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; care whether the &quot;audience&quot; is complaining or not, they just care whether the audience is captured.  If the audience cannot &quot;leave&quot;, if it is made excessively difficult to do so, if there&#x27;s no other viable alternatives, that&#x27;s a positive in the eyes of the investor and hence a first priority of every web&#x2F;mobile &quot;entrepreneur&quot;.<p>&lt;s&gt; Why not support these generous &quot;entrepreneurs&quot;. They give away so much &quot;for free&quot;.  Accept all advertising and tracking. &lt;&#x2F;s&gt;')
