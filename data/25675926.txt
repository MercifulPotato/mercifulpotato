The hard shell and protective door would lead to people throwing the discs everywhere. The 5.25&quot; was meticulously stored in a sleeve and disc case, only being exposed when inserting into the drive. Every time I find a 5.25&quot; it glistens like brand new. Good luck getting data off any of these after sitting for a decade. I had to refresh discs (rewrite all the data) after sitting for only a few years.')
