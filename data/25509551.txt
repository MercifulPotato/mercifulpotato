A very important part of component selection is to make sure that you can obtain the parts in the quantity necessary. My general rule, is if I can&#x27;t source it from digikey, I probably can&#x27;t make the product, but I tend to design products that do runs in the hundreds, maybe thousands of units, so I don&#x27;t have the same access to components as someone who&#x27;s doing 10s of thousands of production runs. That said, you may be surprised what your factory can get it&#x27;s hands on. And if you don&#x27;t have a factory, then that might be an important step earlier than you might think. Sadly, I have no experience on how to build a factory relationship, and I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s especially hard to find a factory with low expected volume. Yet another thing that makes hardware more expensive than you might think...')
