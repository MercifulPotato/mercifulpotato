This causes one to move the goal posts further and further in order to save one&#x27;s ego.<p>Inevitably, the goals to &quot;save&quot; one&#x27;s ego become more outlandish and impossible, further setting one up for feelings of failure. These failure feelings often cause one to retreat to the passive, short-term pleasurable &#x2F; long-term destructive habits (e.g. procrastination, substances, video games, etc).<p>That stuck feeling happens because it feels really hard to let go of that narrative, which causes these Emotional Phugoids [0] that ultimately lead to further inaction.<p>There are various things that have worked for me, but most of it is around acceptance and recognition of this pattern. Meditation helps too, to recognize that voice that says &quot;in order to make up for pissing away 2 days tweaking your Emacs config when you need to write that unit test, you must finish the project by the end of the week!&quot;.<p>In addition to meditation, practicing boredom has been enormously helpful. If you can step away from that feeling of always needing to use every second of your time to the max (e.g. catching up on twitter while using the bathroom), it can help close those mental open loops. When one frantically is trying to listen to podcasts at 2x speed while reading a tech blog post while getting jostled around on Caltrain (at least when we used to do that...), your brain just lobs these open problems at you and it&#x27;s easy to get overwhelmed.<p>I find these self-binding contracts to be a smaller portion of the equation for making progress in life. I know people who have one note on their phone with their TODOs that are successful and people who have email auto-responders, a bunch of accountability buddies &#x2F; apps, and a mindmap &#x2F; Zettelkasten &#x2F; Roam &#x2F; Notion account that looks like the graph of sites on the internet, yet they accomplish nothing.<p>Relying on a system of any sort without changing your brain through emotional work is attempting to build a house without the foundation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phugoid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phugoid</a>')
