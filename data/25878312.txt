On road trips the stop for gas was always an excuse to stretch your legs, use the restroom, grab snacks at the convenience store, and just GTFO of the car.  A gas stop is never just 5 minutes to fill up.<p>I moved from GA to CA last summer.  I drove a moving truck towing our Leaf and my partner in our Model 3, we made it a point to take the same route but not stick together.  When ended up staying together for most of the trip and would arrive at our hotels within half an hour of one another, usually the Model 3 arrived first.  Often we would pass them charging at a Supercharger only to be overtaken when we stopped or just due to speed.')
