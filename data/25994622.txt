What happens with my Stadio investment in hardware when they shut it down soon?! How many times we need to say: &quot;Not again!&quot; investing any time with a new product&#x2F;service from Google?! My daughter got a Pixel 3a - it has so many issues and Google won&#x27;t fix saying it has to do with my carrier. Their forums are flooded with people from different carriers having the same issues, but, not, they blame Bluetooth problems to T-Mobile! Same with Google Home Max - I bought one wanted to buy another until it&#x27;s gone (when it was $179) just to be brought back at full price ($299) and then be gone again! Same with Google OnHub - I bought it, then it became unsupported and gone!<p>Google cannot run a business, they really don&#x27;t know how to protect their brand, and never fail to piss off everybody and especially their early adopters!')
