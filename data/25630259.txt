Though constant changes may also be applied to legacy code.<p>&gt;&gt;\nOne common developer bias is that old code is bad. You&#x27;ve never heard anyone say the phrase &quot;legacy code&quot; without contempt in their tone\n&gt;&gt;<p>As for the &#x27;code age&#x27; point, I&#x27;d think it is more related to recency of the requirements, when was that problem domain last worked on and understood.<p>So maybe the issue points to clarity of requirements capture, and perhaps the coding&#x2F;design corresponding to the requirements.<p>Another commenter referred to automated testing, which hits on having test cases to match the requirements. With that level of functional documentation, the code is likely to be easier to understand.')
