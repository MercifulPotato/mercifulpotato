This might be nice for a static hierarchy of not too many office documents, but for the very heterogenous files I deal with, I&#x27;m happy with the first level of division being a &quot;project&quot;. There are only ever a handful of projects I&#x27;m working on at a time, and different projects&#x27; files are usually suited to very different directory structures.<p>That said, the only documents I need to keep in long-term storage are invoices and contracts, which I can just put into two directories. If I ever get too many of such official documents, I might look into a structure like this.')
