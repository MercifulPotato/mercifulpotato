The question is whether our IP law results in &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; effects on our culture, whatever those terms mean. I think the current length of copyright harms our culture more than it helps it. I don&#x27;t care about any particular media property&#x27;s copyright status, I care about what impacts copyright has on our culture.<p>I feel like you are not responding to the points I am making, and are hung up on something else.')
