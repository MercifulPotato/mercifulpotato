So if I&#x27;m working on a larger feature and want to PR an intermediate part and continue working, I&#x27;m in for a bad merge.<p>If I want to merge my hotfix topic branch into both the release and the master branch, their commits won&#x27;t match so I can&#x27;t check if it&#x27;s present in both automatically.<p>If a topic branch is left up instead of deleted after a squash merge, I can&#x27;t even see that master is ahead of it!<p>Squash is an ugly hack that creates as many problems as it solves.<p>I desperately wish git had a &quot;group commits&quot; feature that let me manage a cluster of related commits as a single commit for the purposes of history-viewing, reverting, and cherry-picking.')
