So it might be considered &quot;a public place&quot;. So no association is done over accounts arriving from that IP. Your home, OTOH, might have only two accounts on its IP for years, so the association here is stronger.<p>A cookie shared between two accounts is even a stronger indication, as a person used the same browser to log in with both.<p>The system might not be created &quot;to prioritize Maps suggestions&quot; only and has multiple benefits in other places. Most obvious of these is to prevent people banned from the service to come back with a different account.<p>(I don&#x27;t work at G and never did, but worked at another place where we linked accounts.)')
