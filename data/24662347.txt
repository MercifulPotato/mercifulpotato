It&#x27;s usually trivial to do a search on the input side and identify the source of the problem code. Commenting it out and reprocessing results in it being removed.<p>You only run into complications when there is some odd dependency between the static site generator and the inputs. Generally, it&#x27;ll delegate everything to the templates it uses (good separation of concerns), but sometimes there is a weird config option, or convention you are supposed to use.')
