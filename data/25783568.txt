With that said, I would be surprised if Google shut Fitbit down. Wearables seem to be big business when done right, and Fitbit is the best thing outside of Apple watches (not counting Garmin, they are in an upper tier imo). I think it&#x27;s in Google&#x27;s best interest to properly integrate Fitbit into their company and help it grow.')
