It’s a foreigner trying to buy in-roads to allow business deals or possibly cull favors to help elites in China get places to dump their money in America. Rich people act rational too.<p>Local politics isn’t exactly going to shift macro foreign policy with respect to the Asia question.<p>Feels like we’re painting a boogeyman. A large portion of the NBA literally parrots Chinese rhetoric on human rights with respect to Hong Kong (‘You don’t understand our culture, and are not fit to critique this situation’), what kind of nefarious spy Wormtongued their way into Lebron James and Adam\nSilver’s ear? That was some really macro stuff, and even that had very simple reasons. Massive market, massive cash.<p>Local California politicians being wine and dined is the same as enterprise sales cajoling an executive to buy, geez I don’t know, some shitty project management software.<p>And this is all coming from me, a guy who still thinks Covid came from\na Wuhan lab, nothing close to a CCP apologist. These are rich people doing rich people shit, and we should label it as such - corruption, not foreign espionage. When we mislabel the theaters of war, we proverbially bring a gun to a knife fight, and a knife to a nuclear war.<p>But, with all that said, I suppose the attack vector has to start somewhere. Wish we could all just be friends.')
