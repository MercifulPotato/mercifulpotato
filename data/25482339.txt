Otherwise I think it&#x27;s mostly a matter of preferences.<p>I understand you prefer to be more detailed in your naming, that&#x27;s fine, but in natural languages your names would sound unusual&#x2F;verbose as much as they do sound unusual&#x2F;verbose in Python.<p>You say everybody understands what a &quot;washing machine&quot; is therefore a short name.<p>Are you saying that when washing machines were still a novelty they should have been called &quot;clothes-washing machines&quot; instead? Unusual naming right? People do seem to have a distaste for long and overly-detailed names in spoken languages as well, don&#x27;t you think?<p>And what&#x27;s the point of a dictionary if names embed a full definition that leaves nothing to be guessed?<p>&gt; Sure and I&#x27;m saying most people are wrong about where this &quot;balance&quot; actually lies. People place too much emphasis on conciseness.<p>Where to draw the line can be a matter of preferences, no intention of debating that, but people do tend to <i>draw the line the same way</i> whether they speak English or Python. No incoherent behaviour there.')
