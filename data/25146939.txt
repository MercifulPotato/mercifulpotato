Hell, I remember the <i>US</i> before 9&#x2F;11.<p>The ironically-named Patriot Act represented a massive seizure of power and a wholesale trampling of American civil rights. None of the airport security measures introduced were necessary or effective, and yet they continue to this day.<p>Since 9&#x2F;11, the United States has been at war in the Middle East for twenty years, squandering trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of innocent lives to achieve... nothing.<p>This was neither legitimate nor logical. But it did make a bunch of politicians and their friends very powerful and very wealthy.<p>I also remember, at the time, the moral frenzy that enveloped the nation after the fall of the twin towers.<p>Things now feel the same from where I sit.')
