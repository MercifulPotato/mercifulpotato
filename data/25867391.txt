I wouldn&#x27;t say it was there fault...I&#x27;d actually say it was mine and it was societal. I&#x27;m a first gen college grad, but from a very successful household. I was raised on hard work, use your brain, don&#x27;t give up, always do more. I brought that mindset to work, and no one was going to really stop me. I had to push back, and I had never been taught how. I worked a full time job and a part time job while an engineering student and graduated with a 3.8. Then, it impressed people and it made me proud of myself...now I wonder what I missed out on and take a very different approach to work life balance (although I&#x27;m still a bit of a workaholic, because I really do love what I do).')
