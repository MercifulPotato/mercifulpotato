You can rip people into pieces in game for a family entertainment because it almost never happens anymore. Sexual violence still happens way too often so its nastiness is more real for people.<p>Also sex is generally taboo way more than just murder. Soldier killin people - good. Even innocent women if it&#x27;s indirect enough like bombing. Soldier raping people? Oh, no, we can&#x27;t have that!<p>Also not all murder is equally safe for entertainment. Chopping enemies on the battlefield - great. Stalking innocent people in the city to murder them... Way more on the edge of what&#x27;s acceptable. Even gunning down civilians in the airport raised some eyebrows.<p>As I&#x27;m getting older I&#x27;m getting softer. Recently I was sad because I unintentionally squashed Jeff in Half-Life Alyx, blind mutant that was pretty much helpless if you were careful about the sounds you make. Game characters cheering totally didn&#x27;t sit well with me.')
