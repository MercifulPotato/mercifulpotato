Browsers will already automatically add in &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt; into the DOM if they&#x27;re missing on a page, so literally, you could have a website that&#x27;s just a &lt;script&gt;&#x2F;&#x2F;do DOM stuff&lt;&#x2F;script&gt; and it&#x27;d be parsed and run without issues.<p>The index page at this point is mostly just a DOM skeleton on which to hang references to CSS, media, scripts and metadata. We might as well cut out the last step already.<p>If there was an official HTML-to-JSON format, we could even use that as well. It would probably already exist, but the question is always what to do with node attributes, text nodes and child-nodes. There&#x27;s a dozen ways to organize them in JSON.')
