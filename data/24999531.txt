You can sorta approximate it with TUIs, but then you&#x27;re basically building a simplified UI anyways.<p>I say this as someone that&#x27;s a heavy CLI user, but I simply don&#x27;t care to remember CLI options for anything I don&#x27;t use a ton of times every day (like git).<p>Just the AWS Lambda page in the AWS Console would take a whole bunch of CLI requests to even gather the basic information that&#x27;s shown there, and that&#x27;s ignoring you won&#x27;t get the metrics visualization that&#x27;ll tell you that your function every now and then has some outlier durations.<p>My point being: UIs (GUIs) are not just for non-power usersâ€”they are indeed for power users as well.')
