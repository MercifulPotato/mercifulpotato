So heat engines can use absolute zero as the ultimate heat sink to build a Carnot contradiction: They don&#x27;t actually sink any heat at all, and can extract all of the heat energy as work.  Quantum mechanics forces them to actually sink a tiny amount of heat proportional to process entropy.  Those tiny fluctuations are the &quot;subspace signatures&quot; that get detected anyway.<p>Its still more fantasy than science, but hey, so are warp drive, hyperspace, and all that jazz :)')
