We don&#x27;t like all the data Chrome collects on it&#x27;s users, but it makes up for the vast majority of usage on desktop and Android so it&#x27;s important to test it most thoroughly on the most thoroughly used browser. We did the same on Safari which is a bit more private than Chrome, but not totally. We need to test more, perhaps something like browserstack needs to make it&#x27;s way back into my toolchain.')
