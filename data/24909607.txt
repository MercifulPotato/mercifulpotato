Teams policies are basically “please don&#x27;t talk in the $FOO channel, it&#x27;s for $FOO messages only”; the actual access is done through Sharepoint. (Though make sure you&#x27;re not using Channels for security; it&#x27;s trivial to get into all the Channels in a Team once you have access to the Team.)<p>Also? Teams is a glorified website running in a (hopefully up-to-date) embedded version of Chrome. If they replace some of the scripts it requests with “redirect to this updated Teams client”, then by golly it&#x27;ll do that, and server-side API changes won&#x27;t matter in the slightest.')
