Item(by='samcheng', descendants=None, kids=[24804179], score=None, time=1602866043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24802062, text='Like many wildlife populations, Silicon Valley is cyclical, with a boom-and-bust cycle.  101 was quiet and San Francisco was a hipster haven rather than a tech-bro mecca during the dot-com bust, for example.<p>The fundamentals that make this a great place to live and venture will remain, though.  The weather is great. The mixing pot of global languages and cultures stretches back to the gold rush.  World class educational and &#x27;big tech&#x27; institutions aren&#x27;t going anywhere.  Investors express difficulty in gauging personal rapport over a video call, and are still largely clustered in the Bay Area.  The network effects around having a critical mass of brilliant technical minds are substantial.<p>I hope that this abundance can flow outward, to other cities, like Denver or Austin or Seattle or SLC, even if that makes my property values dip a little.  I&#x27;ll enjoy digging up sand crabs at the beach (nobody I know calls them mole crabs) long after the latest wave of tech migrants have left.')
