The volumetric energy density isn&#x27;t fantastic, and you need to store it in cylindrical tanks rather than just using the wings as tanks.<p>There are several projects to make smaller hydrogen planes, but I suppose larger planes will always need liquid hydrocarbons. Considering that the very smallest planes will probably be battery-electric, hydrogen may end being squeezed from both ends of the market in the long term.<p>For long distance sea transport, ammonia is a big competitor.<p>Fundamentally speaking, hydrogen is not a good fuel. It&#x27;s hard to handle and not very energy dense (volumetrically). What&#x27;s good about it, is that we have relatively efficient ways to make it from electricity, and to convert it back to electricity. But it&#x27;s possible that methods to produce&#x2F;use other fuels could be almost as efficient over time.<p>Hydrogen will be very important in the next 3+ decades, but I can see it being made irrelevant again over time, by better batteries at one end, and better ways of making&#x2F;using hydrocarbon fuels on the other.')
