Godel&#x27;s completeness theorem has nothing to do with the existence of models. It is about the provability of sentences that are true within all models.<p>Also, the incompleteness theorem doesn&#x27;t say anything about the nonexistence of a model. It gives the existence of at least one sentence X (for sufficiently nice theories that include enough arithmetic) such that there ARE two models where X is true in one and false in the other.')
