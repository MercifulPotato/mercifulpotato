Cooking is a lot less of a hassle and challenge when, as long as the heat is on, you&#x27;re simply adding ingredients to a pot or pan and stirring or flipping occasionally. While what you&#x27;re doing is perfectly reasonable, context switching still takes on mental effort, and chopping ingredients while things are cooking adds undue stress to the process.')
