Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25679731], score=None, time=1610065562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679174, text='&gt; So they are trying to prevent the cosplayers from successfully impersonating actual electors.<p>The cosplayers are the people who pretended to be the Republican electors in the states of Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, despite failing to meet the statutory requirements of meeting in the appointed place, having the vote signed by the respective Secretary of State, and having the vote receipt submitted to the National Archives.<p>In other words, these are people whose actions as purported electors are not legitimate. It is as if I were to put on a shirt with the word &quot;POLICE&quot; on it and print out a badge that had the same word of it--it doesn&#x27;t actually make me a police officer, merely someone cosplaying a police officer. (Although as electors are not public officials, they are unlikely to run afoul of any laws, unless there is some fraud statute that is broad enough to cover this).<p>Their actions did not have the force of law. The seditionous mob who wanted to stop the electoral count are the people who want to install cosplayers as electors in flagrant violation of the law.<p>&gt; Thats hyperbolic and undemocratic.<p>A lynching is a mob taking it upon themselves to murder someone in response to an alleged crime in an extralegal attempt to achieve justice, completely in violation of all due process. What happened yesterday was a mob taking it upon themselves to overturn the lawful results of the election in response to an alleged crime in an extralegal attempt to achieve justice, completely in violation of all due process. <i>That</i> is the antithesis of rule of law; it is not hyperbolic or undemocratic to draw that comparison.')
