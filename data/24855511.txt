Reckless driving, up to officer discretion. Drove over the speed limit?<p>No, no and no. All of those are serious misconducts that are rightfully punished. Stop signs exist for a reason. Signalling on a highway is very necessary to inform other drivers where you are intending to steer your heavy machine thats hurling down the street at speeds evolution didn&#x27;t prepare us for. Every driver caught speeding who is punished for it is a win for society in my book.<p>&gt; Ever forget your wallet and drive without your license? Drive with slightly over a legal limit of alcohol (hard to judge correctly)? Cross over a signed private property you don&#x27;t have permission to access?<p>I don&#x27;t know where you live, but driving without license results in either a verbal warning by the police or a ten buck fine if you&#x27;re very unlucky. Anyways, I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone who ever got controlled for his drivers license so far. If you steer your car while drunk, you deserve to be punished. I don&#x27;t care that you&#x27;re in danger of an embarassing death by tree, but you&#x27;re also endangering everyone around you. What do you expect from the police? To let that go unpunished?<p>Also why wouldn&#x27;t you be punished for crossing private property without permission? If you had a lawn and some guys would come and walk across it every two hours, wouldn&#x27;t you be pissed and expect some kind of retaliation for that?<p>&gt; Maybe you smoke and you are too close to a federal or state building access. Maybe your uncle gave you some hooch he made. Maybe you went to an unofficial nude beach.<p>Smoking is known to cause cancer and is very unpleasant in general, even if it wouldn&#x27;t. You may stick to your designated drug consumption spots for that matter, but if you decide its okay to annoy and poison the general public around you it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to punish you.<p>You don&#x27;t go to an &quot;unofficial&quot; nude beach without knowing it&#x27;s unofficial. You don&#x27;t undress yourself in public. Therefore, you know you commited a crime because most others really don&#x27;t want to see you naked.<p>&gt; Been &quot;drunk&#x2F;disorderly in public&quot; ? Again officer discretion but could easily be applied to majority of people leaving a club most Friday nights.<p>Good. I hate drunk mobs hanging around, yelling and being generally unpleasant for all others around them.<p>All cases you listed deserve punishment, especially the car related ones. Cars are no joke and should be treated with care and respect, not as reclessly as you seem to prefer it.')
