I would sometimes create 10 commits or so a day, all of them very small. This way everybody gets the latest code much earlier.<p>Feature branches discourage refactoring because if the work that is off master is bigger merge conflicts can easily get much hairier<p>Small commits also forces one to have a good automated tests because one is not going to test everything manually after every very small commit. It ties in very nicely with the TDD cycle.<p>Not all work can be done this way so sometimes one needs a feature branch but most of the time it is not needed. In many cases feature switches are a good alternative, if needed.')
