We&#x27;re not talking about a week-long or even month-long surge that&#x27;s starting to fade; it&#x27;s been like this since the dine-in ban was lifted in early summer, and has only gotten worse now that the weather has turned. If this generalizes to the rest of the country (which is obviously not a given, but I think rather likely), we&#x27;ll be back to pre-pandemic levels of dining as soon as restrictions are lifted.<p>Also, delivery is only a replacement for dining out if your reason for going out is the food&#x2F;drink. If, on the other hand, you dine out for the social aspect, then delivery is never going to be a replacement for you. My hunch tells me that the latter is more common, but I&#x27;m not as confident in that prediction.')
