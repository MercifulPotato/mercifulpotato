We had just set up an in-house Kubernetes cluster running on AWS.<p>We were attempting to run Cassandra on top of it and let&#x27;s just say the majority of our time for a few months was spent fine tuning the setup (iirc this was early days StatefulSets). In the end we gave up and went to EC2 for Cassandra.<p>Persistent volumes have come a long way, and container technology in general has rapidly evolved. I have yet to try any databases on K8s in a production environment since that attempt, but I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s as bad as it was back then.<p>Many people are scared of it, one of the biggest reasons usually given is that containers are meant to be ephemeral. While containers allow for applications to be ephemeral, and quite frankly makes it a lot easier, I don&#x27;t believe that they&#x27;re meant to be ephemeral. At the end of the day, containers are just somewhat isolated processes. Processes don&#x27;t need to be ephemeral, and often aren&#x27;t. With the right setup, databases can be run from containers, and I believe the rapid evolution of container technology has allowed for this to be possible today.')
