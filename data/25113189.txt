Maybe the dataset pushes it out of cache, but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on them creating many millions of rows.<p>Not sure, but may not fit in cache<p>* Google&#x27;s PDFium render. Not sure about the library itself, but a 200dpi map doesn&#x27;t sound like anything worth mentioning<p>* Camera test gives very little in specifics, but with several steps and a handful of libraries, this probably overflows cache a little.<p>* Ray Tracing 3.6K triangles and 768x768 output. I&#x27;d put it elsewhere, but they <i>could</i> be using a huge number of rays (though I seriously doubt it)<p>Undoubtedly doesn&#x27;t fit in cache<p>* Clang rendering 730 LOC (seriously?) Clang is pretty big and most likely needs to cache.<p>Zero actual details<p>* Speech Recognition<p>* N-Body Simulation<p>* Rigid Body Simulation<p>* Face Detection<p>* Structure from Motion<p>All in all, them saying these things are &quot;real world&quot; would be a huge overstatement at best. I don&#x27;t see anything here to contradict Linus&#x27; assessment.')
