The grace of a boozed uncle who wants to dance on your grave.<p>The other fun part is how long T_D was allowed to run Amok. Special gloves to avoid looking bad, something that’s also forgotten.<p>If you want to know how bad it is, simply see what their voat&#x2F; parler versions look like.<p>And I’m also not the kind of person who actually did the history digging and detective work on user accounts. This is all passive observation of internet drama.<p>The T_d crowd was happy with dog whistles and coded racism.  For them to find r&#x2F;politics or any other sub offensive is but  natural.')
