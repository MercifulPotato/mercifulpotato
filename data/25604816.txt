Item(by='azangru', descendants=None, kids=[25604986], score=None, time=1609521886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604562, text='&gt; Is there any theory or data that more the R or transmission rate less deadly the virus is in itself?<p>There&#x27;s a vague evolutionary argument that the less deadly for the host a parasite is the more widely it can spread and thus the more evolutionarily successful it will become. But there is no mechanism that guarantees the inverse â€” that an increase in infectiousness will be accompanied by a decrease in lethality. From the molecular biological perspective, the molecules responsible for viral spread and the molecules responsible for the damage that the virus does to its host (or that the host does to itself when attacking the virus) are likely to be quite different, so there is no reason for a change in one to be accompanied by a change in the other.')
