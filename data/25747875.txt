As soon as a lawyer becomes aware of a situation where an individual is using the service they are required to act to mitigate risk. There is no obligation for anyone to have access to a private service and they&#x27;ll be weighing factors which include what 3rd parties might do.<p>In this case it seems that they would have considered the actions of the companies running the paywalls. How likely would they be to take legal action (not all of which is public) against Twitter? Fairly likely, if they feel that Twitter is helping to publicize the service they want to take down.<p>This is both in the legal and financial interest of Twitter. There is no real blow back from kicking off this person and their service versus dealing with US corporations. Copyright law changes and the impact of court decisions likely play a factor too. I find it hard to believe that some court somewhere, hasn&#x27;t held Twitter (or similar service) liable for indirect copyright damages (that is likely being appealed.)')
