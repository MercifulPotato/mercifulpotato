It&#x27;s an elementary result that if the solution for a circle of radius 1 is k, the solution for a circle of radius 2 will be 2k.<p>That was already done in the 19th century without computers. But like you say, that gives only a &quot;close enough&quot; formula. Close enough for farmers, or even rocket engineers who might need much more precision, but not good enough for mathematicians.')
