It&#x27;s a fully featured interactive design studio built into the browser. We also support Markup (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markup.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markup.io</a>) and Chartblocks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chartblocks.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chartblocks.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>). We&#x27;ve been growing in spite of the pandemic and recently received a $100 million investment from Sumeru Equity Partners (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;ceros-announces-100m-strategi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;ceros-announces-100m-strategi</a>...)<p>The engineering team at Ceros has always been remote, but as of last summer, the entire company is remote first. We have a very collaborative culture, so we aim for everyone having overlap roughly between 10 am EST and 4 pm EST, but are generally flexible. We currently have DevOps in the US, Portugal, and Canada. The wider engineering team has people in the UK, Kenya, Nigeria, Japan, and Brazil.<p>The Devops team follows an agile&#x2F;scrum process with a strong emphasis on the collective decision making and commitment aspects. We work together to define our sprints, manage our changes for minimal disruption, iterate on our process to prevent repeated mistakes, and conduct blameless post mortems. We plan stories ahead of time so that we can agree on the path forward, have intense code reviews to hold ourselves and each other to high standards, and determine our own roadmap in conversation with the feature developers and executives.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a Senior DevOps Engineer (could have systems administration or software engineering background before adopting DevOps) and a Senior Devops - Systems Engineer (systems administration background before adopting DevOps) to add to our current team of six. These are both senior roles, so we&#x27;re looking for at least 5 years of experience (preferably more) in the field.<p>These are the first of several hires we&#x27;ll be doing this year. We&#x27;re just beginning to migrate our codebase from Cloudformation to Terraform. We have a pretty mature Jenkins server and a reasonable CI pipeline set up that we&#x27;d like to improve, and we&#x27;re pushing towards CD. We currently use ECS and a number of other AWS offerings, but are considering a migration to Kubernetes. All of our services are containerized or run on Lambda. We have a long roadmap and a lot of work to do, but we&#x27;re pushing hard towards a fully automated, self service infrastructure that enables our feature developers to release on demand and that can remain stable in the face of all manner of disruptions.<p>We&#x27;re looking for experienced DevOps or SREs who like to collaborate, work well in collective decision making contexts, and are eager to help us push our infrastructure and CI&#x2F;CD capabilities forward!<p>Full job description and application information below:<p>Senior Devops - Systems Engineer: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;labs.ceros.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;#&#x2F;job&#x2F;2580924" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;labs.ceros.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;#&#x2F;job&#x2F;2580924</a><p>Senior Devops Engineer: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;labs.ceros.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;?gh_jid=2570090#&#x2F;job&#x2F;2570090" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;labs.ceros.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;?gh_jid=2570090#&#x2F;job&#x2F;2570090</a>')
