But if we are talking about a hobby project (as opposed to work), what’s wrong with that? It’s a good learning experience anyway. And maybe one day you really will need to port something to something big endian, and now you’ll know how.<p>Like Solaris SPARC (pretty dead I think), or AIX or IBM i PASE or IBM Z (none of which are dead yet, but all smaller than they used to be)')
