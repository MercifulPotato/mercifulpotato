That was a joint venture between American companies in the 90&#x27;s, when there was a concern that we were falling behind Japan.  I&#x27;m sure there will be people who try to claim otherwise, but my view from inside AMD (at that time still doing its own manufacturing) was that nothing much ever came out of Sematech.  It was a lot of hype, but not much result.<p>If, at the time of the founding of TSMC, you had tried to get a consortium of companies, much less nations, to agree on the idea of a semiconductor foundry, you would not have been able to get agreement to do it.  Consortiums can help to pool resources when everyone knows what needs doing, but even Intel has had a problem getting the latest generation of semi manufacturing going, and their problem sure wasn&#x27;t a lack of resources.  Sometimes the problem is the speed of innovation, and the more parties you have involved the harder it is to get agreement to try any given thing, especially if it is innovative (i.e. not certain to work).<p>I wish them good fortune, it would be good for the stability of the world economy not to have all the world&#x27;s advanced semiconductors made in one region, but I am skeptical of whether or not this can make a big difference, no matter how much money is spent.')
