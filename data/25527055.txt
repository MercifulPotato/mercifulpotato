It does not imply that judgements about racism are purely a matter of optimism or pessimism. It already incorporates the fact a person&#x27;s influences cause them to make those judgements.<p>Of course someone who is at risk of experiencing racism is more likely to judge an act to be racist, but that doesn&#x27;t make them right. In fact, they may be more likely to attribute innocent acts to racism, just as someone who rarely experiences racism is likely to make the opposite judgement more often than is justified.<p>My point is that we are arguing about something that was already expressed by the parent under what I believe to be a more generous interpretation of their use of that metaphor.')
