GC likely kicked in as you allocated the last object, and after the collection phase, still didn’t have enough memory and so failed.<p>I believe objects with destructors can keep an object alive for an extra collection phase, but I believe if that’s the case it can easily be solved with a using block before allocating the next object.')
