As such, most of the competency they may have been forced to gain is lost, along with potential passion.<p>Even repeating exercises can be fun when you understand the motivation behind it. For example, if you have a real passion for understanding Newtonian physics, the parts of calculus that might be &#x27;rote&#x27; when unmotivated and part of a purely rote process can become some of the most enjoyable.')
