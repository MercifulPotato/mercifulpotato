This in conjunction with improved thinness of the tapes enabled large increases in tape length for the same cartridge size (nearly double the length from LTO-1 -&gt; LTO-8), has in turn led to the enormous jumps in capacity we&#x27;ve seen in LTO.<p>Meaning unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be possible to do super interesting things with VHS.')
