Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605700518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135702, text='&gt; I have no idea what Apple&#x27;s plan is between this and the Epic fight, but it&#x27;s fun to watch!<p>Their plan is to turn down the political heat&#x2F;volume coming from the underdog stories (David vs Apple), which are potentially endless in numbers. Apple risks a PR death by a thousand cuts from all the negative stories, a never ending bad PR run. Few have sympathy for the giant companies and conflicts between giant companies, so Apple isn&#x27;t too worried about big apps not getting further discounts. The media loves to write underdog vs big bad giant corporation stories, they sell (and draw a lot of unnecessary anti-trust attention); Apple wants to throw water on that first and foremost.')
