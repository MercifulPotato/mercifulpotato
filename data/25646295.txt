It really is a very cool, polished product.<p>The video cuts when you remove &quot;uh&quot; and &quot;um&quot; are too jarring for anything professional, but OTOH for some internal work stuff I could see a use for this. And as someone who has used 0 video editing software, I was able to start making changes within like a minute, which I think is quite impressive.<p>That said, not sure I have enough use case to pay for it, personally.<p>NB: it&#x27;s kind of impossible to prove you&#x27;re not a sock puppet, because of _course_ a sock puppet account would say they&#x27;re not a sock puppet account.')
