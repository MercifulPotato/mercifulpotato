At least one did a year at a FAANG company prior to starting so it isn&#x27;t like they don&#x27;t know better. They are paid well enough and don&#x27;t need 400k salaries. They love their research topic and love the freedom to work on the topics they care most about. They love mentoring students specifically. They don&#x27;t care about software engineering as a discipline and would rather spend time learning other things. They (most of them) like teaching. They like being part of a research community.')
