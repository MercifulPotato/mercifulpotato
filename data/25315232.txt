I’m now going to be ‘that guy’ - apologies.<p>After years of being annoyed by Rust people claiming C++ is  dying or too unsafe or whatever, I expected this to be another C# - a sort of C-with-training-wheels for people who care more about productivity than perf. Something I could safely ignore.<p>This ‘borrow checker’ stuff sounds great for kids, but for disciplined experienced C++ guys it’s at best a non feature and at worst would just get in the way, like GC, right?<p>In fact, I’m finding the reduced mental overhead (not just from borrow, but from the language as a whole being smaller and more consistent) is a huge win. Even learning the language and stdlib as I go.<p>I’ll still use C++ proudly where it’s the best choice, but I’d put some effort into trying Rust first. As a cpp-master-race guy, that surprised the crap out of me.')
