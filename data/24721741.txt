It is no different than a hammer in the sense that you can break someone&#x27;s limbs and kill them with a blow to the head. Combat staffs were not non-lethal.<p>Take for example the Bo that can easily break bones and can bend even a Katana with a proper strike.<p>Even pool cues will kill when used in bar fights.')
