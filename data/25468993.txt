This isn’t the last pandemic and all things considered this one was a pretty benign one to have to fight.  The next one might not just kill mainly the old and weak and might need much more than a mask (that we still can’t get people to wear!) to prevent its spread.  Hopefully before then, we can work to get everyone more on the same page and have a rapid vaccine task force ready.<p>My brother is a doctor and he got his Pfizer shot yesterday.  Less than one year has passed since the first case in the USA.  I consider this one of the great accomplishments of science.  It will go unnoticed by many idiots on social media but it is an amazing achievement by all the scientists and doctors involved.')
