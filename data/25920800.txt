Try to avoid using derivative Postgres products, or employing distributed approaches, or home-brewed sharding at all costs â€“ until you have, say, less than 1 year of breathing room available.&quot;<p>Very healthy approach. I&#x27;ve always followed the idea of vertical scalability when writing my modern C++ app servers with local Postgres. Since I do not sell those to FAANG I&#x27;ve never failed finding decent very reasonably priced piece of hardware be it dedicated hosting or on prem that would not satisfy client&#x27;s need for any foreseeable future. More then that. I&#x27;ve never needed even top of the line hardware for that. I concentrate on features and robustness instead. Using C++ also gives nice speedup.')
