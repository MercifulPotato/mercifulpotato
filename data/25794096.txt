What good your &quot;deep learning OSS spellchecker&quot; will do if there aren&#x27;t good (and open) models for it which cover as much languages as existing Hunspell dictionaries do? And what if adding a bunch of new words requires laborous model retraining? It is not unsolvable, but non-trivial.<p>I believe all the giants have something like this inside (I don&#x27;t think spelling correction in Google search bar is handled with Hunspell, right?), but it is much harder to do as an open tool, ready to embedding into other software.<p>There are a notable attempts, though: JamSpell for one (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bakwc&#x2F;JamSpell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bakwc&#x2F;JamSpell</a>), which has an open &quot;free&quot; models, and more precise commercial ones; source code is open (maybe also only for using &quot;simplistic&quot; models, haven&#x27;t dug deeper).')
