The US federal and state level governments are not supposed to regulate speech, per the US Constitution. In this case they are not regulating speech.<p>Private companies are regulating speech (in their applications, through their services and websites, etc.) as they are free to do under the US Constitution. While there may be a market for the speech Parler promotes and amplifies that market is not sufficiently large (in the opinion of these companies) to offset possible bad public relations or the loss of other customers.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any place for legislation that forces private companies to take a loss in this manner. It&#x27;s clearly anti-free market and definitely anti-free speech, forcing Amazon to associate with speech they feel might harm the companies financial outlook.<p>Also, is it necessary? There are many BitTorrent tracker sites that are treated as illegal in the US and are still available. If Parler was really dedicated to keeping their website running they could surely do so. Maybe they won&#x27;t have applications in the Apple App Store but that&#x27;s not a right, is it? You have to have product that Apple feels helps the overall goal of their App Store, which is to make money for Apple.')
