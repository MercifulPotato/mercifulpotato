That is FOUR OR FIVE TIMES the number of daily per capita deaths in the USA at the moment. It is perfectly reasonable to believe that on this basis, Switzerland is having a tougher time <i>right now</i> than the USA.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you are so doggedly refusing to accept the very simple point I have made here, which relies on nothing more than public facts and basic arithmetic.<p>Thanks for the discussion, but I have to assume you&#x27;re not here in good faith, so I&#x27;m done.
