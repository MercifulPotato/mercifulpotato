We&#x27;ve grown up but our social media hasn&#x27;t. Slyde isn&#x27;t meant to be an idealogical anti-facebook. Slyde is meant to help us connect more meaningfully and privately with the people we know. Privacy doesn&#x27;t have to be an idealogical decision, it can be a design decision from the beginning that could still result in a viable model.<p>Myself -- an ex lead architect and senior engineer at Vacasa and Nike -- and a few of my non-engineering friends got together and decided to build the next social media platform. We just made it public late last week and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback both from our closed testing (with just friends and family) and our single post about it the day we went public on Reddit. We had more people check it out and get accounts than we anticipated; it feels like we&#x27;ve hit the right nerve. We made something we wanted to use and we already have a lot of people who have never had social media who now have a Slyde. We hope you all on HN will like it too.<p>There is a video on the front page you can watch that is only 2 minutes long but explains the basics of how it works.')
