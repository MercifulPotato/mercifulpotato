If they aren&#x27;t allowed that freedom, then they aren&#x27;t free, and you have a bigger problem. In this sense, censorship is free speech, as you point out. But it&#x27;s still a form of censorship. It&#x27;s just censorship that should be allowed and encouraged like any other form of speech or expression by non governmental entities.<p>EDIT: (At least, that&#x27;s how it works in the US. Other nations, other laws.)')
