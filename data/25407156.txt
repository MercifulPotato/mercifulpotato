Then the amount of time to upload n*x amount of data will be 1+2+4+8+...+2^(n-1) units of time, which obviously diverges. As such, it&#x27;s not unlimited storage even in theory. I know this is the point of such approaches, but I&#x27;m curious why there aren&#x27;t more lawsuits to this effect.<p>Similarly when you get e.g. 10GB of data on cellular networks and are charged for each subsequent block, there&#x27;s really no way to use your 10GB. You either have to stop just before you hit the limit, leaving some data on the table or you have to go over and pay for another block. Ideally the networks should use up all the data and then ask you if you want to purchase another block. Otherwise there&#x27;s no way you can actually use exactly what you ostensibly pay for.')
