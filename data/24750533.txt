But essentially what you&#x27;re saying boils down to unmaintainable, untestable, unrefactorable, obsolete code being a liability. I don&#x27;t think anyone disagrees with that and I personally have been involved with a (semi-popular public cloud) service deprecation myself precisely because it was legacy and simply had to be rewritten to be moved to a shiny new home that used new-age systems owned by another team that was doing a stellar job at upkeeping and innovating on those (though one could easily classify their &quot;innovation&quot; as NIH). The code that they wrote wasn&#x27;t a liability at all, but in fact, it kept seeing active investment from all engineering and product management angles.')
