Lots of D politicians, granted. But I can&#x27;t believe you seriously think that the &quot;the election was fraudulent theatrics&quot; (which I&#x27;ll take for granted as theatrics, though a more careful treatment is warranted) of D politicians and e.g. Rachel Maddow could ever have had the same effect as these theatrics from Trump and co, which call for armed citizens to take action.')
