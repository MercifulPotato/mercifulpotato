Going to prison is a traumatic experience, and would be even in a country that had a <i>real</i> commitment to safe rehabilitation. In the US, it&#x27;s all too often multiple traumatic experiences one after the other. Nonetheless, I think former felons absolutely deserve every chance to reintegrate. I just worry about <i>their</i> psychological safety when things get tense and others get combative. This is just one more reason why more people in tech need to grow the hell up and treat people around them with basic respect.')
