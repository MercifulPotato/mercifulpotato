I used to struggle with Chrome&#x2F;Chromium hang and chew on CPU cores, crawl to a halt, crash, or just simply run out of memory or a regular basis. Switched to Firefox ~67-69 and such issues are completely gone. I still have significant CPU usage from background tabs occasionally even in Firefox, but the rest of the issues are all nearly inexistent (even though I have on average 30+ tabs open).')
