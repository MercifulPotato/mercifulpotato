Credit implies some sort of ability to be able to pay for something essentially out of the creditor&#x27;s pocket with the agreement you will payback the creditor based on agreed upon terms. A debit card is a digital version of cash where if I don&#x27;t have any, there is no transaction as the bank says no funds.<p>I have never heard of a debit credit card. Are we using the term credit card as a generic term meaning the little plastic card in my wallet?')
