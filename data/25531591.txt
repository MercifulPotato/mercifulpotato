I do not agree on the usefulness of algebra in daily life, nor on that of maths beyond primary school. I&#x27;ve been trying to use this as a motivation too, but it falls flat. Calling it extremely useful is almost taking the piss.<p>And stupid people exist, really. If you take IQ, a considerable portion, almost one in six, of the population scores below 85, classified as intellectual disability, borderline functioning, or worse. These people do not know what&#x27;s odd and even. It&#x27;s not sad. Many can lead normal lives, and find joy in other things.')
