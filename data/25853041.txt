Definitely more so than the spectrum of good&#x2F;mediocre&#x2F;bad that reviews generally sort games into.<p>The idea is that broadly there are eight basic ways that people get enjoyment out of games: challenge, narrative, sensation, fantasy, discovery, fellowship, expression, and submission. They’re basically self-explanatory except the last, which is “turn your brain off and unwind” games candy crush or a slot machine.<p>Everyone has preferences in these categories to different degrees, and they go a long way to predicting what we’ll enjoy. Into challenge and discovery? You’ve probably already beaten dark souls. Expression and discovery, and can do without narrative? Minecraft. If I was running a game review site, I’d break games down by which categories they hit, and how well.<p>And for my fellow (former) EVE Online players, this explains why different portions of the player base find each other totally incomprehensible.')
