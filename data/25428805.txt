Engineering classes kicked everyone&#x27;s asses. Everyone was equally smart, but some people studied harder than others.<p>On the other hand, I know I am well above average at certain things because I&#x27;ve been doing them for many years. I have an above average interest in those things, and put an above average effort into learning them.<p>This is also true for other people. My dad is an average dad, until you ask him about cars or motorbikes. I knew he <i>liked</i> cars, but I didn&#x27;t get to appreciate the breadth and depth of his knowledge until I started wrenching on vehicles. He spared me the details out of politeness, because I wasn&#x27;t into cars. Now, he doesn&#x27;t spare me, and it turns out he&#x27;s a mechanical grandwizard. It was right under my nose this whole time.<p>I suspect most people are like that. They are average, except at one or two things. We tend to judge others based on the one or two things <i>we</i> value, and fail to appreciate them for what they&#x27;re good at.')
