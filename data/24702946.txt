There&#x27;s a more distant distance, called the innermost stable orbit or the photon sphere, where the <i>orbital</i> velocity is equal to c (so photons will orbit if you emit them tangentially at this height), but the escape velocity is only ~0.69c.<p>0: It&#x27;s not quite right to say that that&#x27;s <i>because</i> the escape velocity is equal to c, though.')
