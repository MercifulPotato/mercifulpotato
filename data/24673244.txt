I’m 42 and have been using a computer since I was 6. Now I’m both nearsighted (since I was 8) and farsighted (since my late 30s), which means I can’t read without glasses of some kind. Similarly, “light mode” is far easier to use and more legible than “dark mode” despite the recent trendiness of the latter. I can also back up his exhortation to not use the thinnest possible lines for text.<p>4K monitors have been a blessing, not directly (though they sure are nice) but because they’ve brought good fonts and UI scaling into the general use case.')
