This sentiment was also echoed by Jeremy Howard doing the same with Fast.ai (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twimlai.com&#x2F;whats-next-for-fast-ai-w-jeremy-howard&#x2F;)<p>I recognize these moves were made over a longish time period and some time ago but the coincidence was remarkable (to me, a developer who has dabbled but doesnt work with either). Is there some bigger picture going on here?')
