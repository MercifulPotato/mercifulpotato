Item(by='scotth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609528915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605211, text='I have belonged to teams with abusive elements, and it certainly felt similar to what the author describes (while not nearly to the same degree, and for that I feel for them).<p>Approaching HR or higher ups at the company doesn&#x27;t feel like an approach that is likely to bear fruit. It sucks, because it should, but reality is that you&#x27;re likely to be labelled a problem â€” especially if it&#x27;s your word against a team that is as closely knit as this one is described.<p>I have to wonder whether gritting your teeth and trying to get through it is a better approach (that is, if you want to stay). There is something about being friendly, eager, unemotional, and unopinionated that tends to placate the jerks.<p>You only have to do this as long as it takes to escape to a more emotionally supportive situation. A couple good review cycles, and you can wave goodbye.<p>I realize that this may not be possible depending on your situation. Just an anecdote.<p>In any case, I hope the author lands on their feet. Don&#x27;t let it get you down.')
