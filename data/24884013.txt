All of my work and personal projects are moved to gitlab (the CI&#x2F;Kubernetes&#x2F;etc integration are just too good to pass up).<p>I know a sample size of 1 has an effectively 100% error rate, but, I think Microsoft is losing mindshare with GitHub. Stuff like this doesn&#x27;t help. I could see a small company like GitLab needing to toe the DMCA line, but, Microsoft has the deep pockets and could have built some major community will here by handling this better. Unfortunate that they didn&#x27;t.<p>Anyway, fun hack, I wonder how long it will last, or will they merge it? It must be the most approved PR in GitHub history at this point!')
