Item(by='2Gkashmiri', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603436011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866372, text='No. I am paying for a 100 Mbps as well as a 300 Mbps connection and my usage is around 800-1.5 depending on the number of users at home. my argument is, why put the limitation? why do they decide what purpose of a home connection is? BTW, i am running one home as well as an enterprise connection with jio but enterprise connection has more cost, less speed and less data. that makes no sense other than they are forcing me to pay more for same stuff.<p>besides, as a home user, if i am paying maximum &quot;THEY&quot; are offering, why the limitation? as world has already come to realize, data caps are total bs so why enforce them even on their highest plan?')
