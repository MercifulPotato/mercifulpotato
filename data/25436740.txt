It blows my mind that Google can even have problems like this. Aren&#x27;t their apps highly distributed across tons of CDNs? Don&#x27;t they have world class Devops people that roll out changes in a piecemeal fashion to check for bugs? How exactly can they have an issue that can affect a huge swath of their customers across countries? Insight appreciated.')
