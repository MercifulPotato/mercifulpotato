Sure, the process is a hair more confusing, but there’s massive benefits and it’s FAST. In particular, I’ve been impressed with systemd-boot and how you can use systemd-analyze and logging to really understand _everything_ that’s going on in your boot chain.<p>I also really like the capsule firmware update mechanism, I’ve been able to use fwupdmgr to keep all of my devices firmware up to date, from Linux, without freeDOS or windows foolery. Additionally, the Dell UEFI BIOS supports booting right to the firmware update cab or exe, further strengthening the utility of a Linux-only install.')
