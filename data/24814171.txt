The classic case is diets: instead of saying &quot;I will lose 10kg in a month&quot;, timeboxing says &quot;I will eat healthier and take some exercise every day for 2 weeks and see what happens&quot;. The difference is to do something different for a set period of time, and then see what the result was, rather than set a goal and a deadline.<p>For those of us immersed in Lean Startup thinking, where goal-setting doesn&#x27;t really work any more as a motivation method (who cares if I fail in my goal, that I set myself 2 weeks ago, the important thing is what have I learned in that failure?). Time-boxing is a great alternative because it doesn&#x27;t judge, it all about learning what happens if we change behaviour.<p>Timeboxing as setting goals and &quot;exclusion zones&quot; misses the point of it. If you say that you&#x27;re going to &quot;timebox&quot; writing those two missing features today, but don&#x27;t manage to complete them, then what happens? Do you extend to tomorrow? Then you&#x27;re not really timeboxing, you&#x27;re just saying &quot;I&#x27;m not answering any calls until I&#x27;ve finished these features&quot;. Which is a totally different thing.<p>Properly timeboxing this would be &quot;I&#x27;m going to spend today working on those features&quot;. I don&#x27;t make any commitment to finish them. I don&#x27;t know if I can finish them in a day. There&#x27;s no judgement if I don&#x27;t - I successfully spent a day working on them, and that was the requirement. After that one day I will know more and may be able to make a judgement or commitment about completion. Or not. I&#x27;ll know after I spent the day working on them, not before.')
