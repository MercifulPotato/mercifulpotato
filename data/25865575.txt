Screenshots happen in an opaque way to the iMessage user. And while you&#x27;ll get a blue bubble in iMessage when sending over SMS, you won&#x27;t see that until after you start the conversation. The point is, if you don&#x27;t trust someone to have a secure phone, that&#x27;s a talk you need to have with that person, it&#x27;s not a problem with the Matrix protocol.<p>If you think that Matrix presents a novel, undetectable way to exfiltrate data, then you trust iMessage too much and you should rethink your approach to secure communication. Thinking in terms of, &quot;the bubble is green so my contact can&#x27;t be doing anything weird&quot; is the wrong way to think about security. Don&#x27;t do that.<p>Especially since, again, you should not be using iMessage for seriously private conversations in the first place, you should be using Signal, or in a pinch (ironically) Matrix&#x2F;Element itself, since both platforms actually have full E2E encryption that forces users to validate sessions and doesn&#x27;t break itself by default.<p>It&#x27;s fine for you to be skeptical about the security of this company, but if you think it breaks some taboo or compromises your phone in some unique way just because it&#x27;s a bridge, then you&#x27;re putting too much faith in Apple and approaching message security from the wrong perspective.<p>&gt; possibly using a wholly unprotected iOS device<p>Just as a sidenote, this in particular is weird to me. Your argument is based on the idea that you trust Apple. But <i>Apple</i> is the one that makes messages from those old devices show up green. If your argument is that they might be unpatched, shouldn&#x27;t you bring that up with Apple and ask them to start requiring updates to be installed before green bubbles appear in chat?<p>Why is it Matrix&#x27;s fault that Apple considers old iPhones to be secure?')
