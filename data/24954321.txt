They state that the decision “cannot be reversed”. This is very confusing because she very seldom even posts to Facebook and had not posted recently. She is not involved in anything controversial or off-colour either. She has some photos and posts in her account which she would like to recover. Also, it’s very frustrating that she can’t communicate with certain friends.<p>Has anyone dealt with this before? Any suggestions?')
