A wet market is just a place that sells fresh meat or vegetables. The butcher who supplies your favorite restaurant is a wet market. The fruit &amp; veg stand where you buy organic heirloom tomatoes is a wet market. Every farmer&#x27;s market is a wet market.<p>&quot;Wet market&quot; just distinguishes from &quot;dry market&quot; where durable goods like electronics are sold.<p>China never banned wet markets, which makes about as much sense as saying someone has &quot;banned supermarkets&quot;. They banned the sale of certain items at wet markets.<p>(I live in Asia and shop at a wet market multiple times a week.)')
