Your entire original comment hinged on a bizarre metaphor you created out of your false premise that in protection rackets, the &quot;threat&quot; is fake or choreographed. It isn&#x27;t, so your comment isn&#x27;t an intelligible critique of the comment it was intended to respond to. Yes, that&#x27;s my point: your critique is wrong. I told you how: it is based on a false premise.<p>&gt; (i&#x27;m citing them, you are not)<p>You cited Wikipedia, and you haven&#x27;t cited a single source for any proposition other than the one you were specifically wrong about.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sorry i&#x27;m not basing my arguments on movies i&#x27;ve seen.<p>Deliberate obtuseness. The obvious implication of the reference to gangster films is that anyone who has even a passing familiarity with protection rackets knows that harm from the racketeer is not the only threatened harm. The third sentence of the Wikipedia entry you mentioned confirms this: &quot;Through the credible threat of violence, the racketeers deter people from swindling, robbing, injuring, sabotaging or otherwise harming their clients.&quot; That means that the analogy between the CIA and a protection racket is perfectly tenableâ€”in the parlance of your Wikipedia entry, a &quot;broader protection racket&quot; rather than a &quot;pure extortion racket.&quot;<p>Not sure how to spell it out any clearer than that. I&#x27;m not implying you&#x27;re getting concepts wrong. You got them both wrong.')
