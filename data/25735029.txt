You can see that the vast majority of that article is devoted to problems within psychology.  (Medicine also seems to have problems.)<p>In economics 1&#x2F;3 of 18 studies failed to replicate?  A study that small, what are the odds that study itself would replicate?  Note that this claim is restricted to experimental studies, which are usually testing human decision-making on economic questions.  This is the field of economics closest to social psychology.  It seems plausible to me that the model of &quot;get a bunch of people in a room and ask them some questions&quot; is not a reliable methodology.<p>Economics as a whole may have a problem with replication, but we can&#x27;t tell from the information on that page.  There are whole fields that aren&#x27;t even mentioned -- no physics, no chemistry.')
