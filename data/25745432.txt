I have a friend who works at DWP(Department of Work and Pensions) and they are forbidden from wearing badges or any identifying work insignia outside of their buildings because of personal safety and the risk to data and equipment.<p>Hell, I work at a games studio and we&#x27;re maybe not forbidden, but <i>heavily</i> discouraged from wearing company merch at conferences and such to protect ourselves(we&#x27;ve had several incidents in the past years where employees were targetted specifically by thieves and scammers to extract company information. I don&#x27;t think it was much because of possible disgruntled players, but nowadays you never know).<p>I think the article is framing it as a recent development related to Trump, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that weird in tech world, it&#x27;s just basic employee safety.')
