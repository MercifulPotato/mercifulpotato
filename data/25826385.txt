Most I’ve ever had the misfortune to encounter haven’t been <i>locking</i> issues, just <i>closing</i> them, which isn’t quite as bad (but almost).<p>I loathe, despise and abominate the GitHub bot with the name “stale” and think it should be discontinued with prejudice. I have never had a positive experience with it, and genuinely cannot imagine <i>any</i> scenario in which it would provide more value than the harm it causes.<p>What of other stale bots that are more nuanced or that provide more meaningful descriptions of what and why? Well, I can think of one or two interactions over the years that seemed more reasonable (e.g. TypeScript’s “it’s been a while, there aren’t ten votes and it hasn’t been accepted, probably nothing’s going to happen, speak now or it’ll be closed”), but even they still cause substantial harm (duplicates, <i>&amp;c.</i>) because GitHub’s search defaults to excluding closed issues. But most of them should definitely be killed with fire.<p>Ooh, ooh! If we’re ranting about issue management systems, here’s another of mine: free-form text fields with templates. You ever tried searching for a word that happens to appear in the template? Yeah, it’s completely useless. I guess this one could be mitigated by a more intelligent indexer that filtered out the template first.')
