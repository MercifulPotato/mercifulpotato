The proxy has no visibility into the DNS messages, with no ability to identify, read, or modify either the query being sent by the client or the answer being returned by the target. Only the intended target [resolver] can read the content of the [DNS] query and produce a [DNS] response.</i><p>&gt; <i>The whole process begins with clients that encrypt their query for the target using HPKE. Clients obtain the target’s public key via DNS, where it is bundled into a [SVCB&#x2F;HTTPS] HTTPS resource record and protected by DNSSEC.</i><p>&gt; <i>Clients transmit these encrypted queries to a proxy over an HTTPS connection. Upon receipt, the proxy forwards the query to the designated target. The target then decrypts the query, produces a response by sending the query to a recursive resolver such as 1.1.1.1, and then encrypts the response to the client. The encrypted query from the client contains encapsulated keying material from which targets derive the response encryption symmetric key.</i><p>&gt; <i>...50% of the time ODoH queries are resolved in fewer than 228ms.</i><p>BTW, DNSCrypt supports &quot;oblivious&quot; encrypted DNS queries via what it calls <i>Anonymized Relays</i> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DNSCrypt&#x2F;dnscrypt-proxy&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anonymized-DNS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DNSCrypt&#x2F;dnscrypt-proxy&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anonymized-D...</a>')
