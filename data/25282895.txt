Are we doing a good job?<p>The U.S. sits atop the world economy, and politically we&#x27;ve been divided over issues like gay marriage and walling off Mexicans. Nobody trusts congress, yet the federal government grows ever more powerful. Corporations have manipulated us into a culture focused on consumerism and greed, half the country loathes the president, health care is a god awful mess, Americans pretty much have no clue imperialistic their country is, we&#x27;ve invented the internet and are along for a ride, at its mercy, etc. And given the unprecedented complex interrelatedness of all this we can make really big mistakes really quickly.<p>So much of this stuff is effectively already out of control. We are reduced so often to reacting, putting out fires, and more concerned about who to blame. Theoretically we could address any of these problems through reasoned action, but human nature being what it is we don&#x27;t even seem to agree on what the problems are.')
