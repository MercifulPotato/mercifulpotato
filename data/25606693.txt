It&#x27;s not quite Berkeley or Stanford, but I absolutely would put it on a part with anything just outside that very top tier (certainly equivalent to UCSD or USC, which are very influential research universities).<p>That said, I do agree with the general thrust of your argument - California has a silly number of top research universities overall and in engineering (Berkeley, Stanford, UCSF, UCSD, USC, UCLA, Cal Tech... and many of the universities in CA I <i>haven&#x27;t</i> mentioned would be considered a tremendous asset to any region trying to build a tech center).<p>California does have a tremendous lead here.')
