It&#x27;s amazing to read this because I think I was part of the group that began the exponential curve of new technologies. I wasn&#x27;t exposed to this &quot;hazing&quot; at all. I was believed in. I was valued. I was encouraged to explore.<p>The religion of the time was to work on things that increased developer productivity time. Performance be damned. It flowed naturally at the time. Computers were (and are) fast enough to create these web apps! We just need to get more features (and better looking ones!) out the door!<p>And now here I am sitting on the other side, looking at all my peers work and thinking &quot;slow down, everyone. We&#x27;ve made too much stuff. We need to organize and catalogue and refine and optimize&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like culture is a Tick&#x2F;Tock cycle. This guy was a Tock - a refinement of existing technology. I was a Tick - an explosion of new technology.<p>And now (I believe) we are witnessing another Tock - a refinement, a culling of the weak, a centralization.<p>I love reading the historical programmers account. As I near 30 I realize, that I will become that, a history lesson for the fresh minds of the era.<p>I think I have lots to teach you. I need only to refine, cull, centralize, and catalogue my thoughts. Piece them into theories of abstraction, class hierarchies of ideas, if you will.<p>For I experienced the polar opposite of this. I experienced the explosion.<p>And yet still, I agree.<p>Discipline doesn&#x27;t scale. This encoding of discipline into system. I agree with it.<p>That defines a large part of my job - to take the &quot;best practise&quot; and encode it into the day-to-day.<p>This concept: &quot;discipline doesn&#x27;t scale&quot; is fundamental to our history. It seems trivially true.<p>This prose is excellent, this history lesson is important and valued, and the fable of this story rings true.')
