Of course there is going to be lots of experimentation in different directions. The ecosystem then matures around a smaller number of solutions, and tries to improve them in depth instead of breadth. That&#x27;s just the natural product development cycle<p>Sure, we dont have a lot of new groundbreaking languages, but are you really going to tell me that haskell or javascript is the same now as it was in 1996. Would someone from 1996 even recognize it now? Their improvements are probably more unrecognizable to someone programming from 1996 in that language than go would be to a c programmer in 1996')
