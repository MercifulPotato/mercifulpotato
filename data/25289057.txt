The reason for MCAS existing in the first place is, without it, the flight characteristics of the plane are quite a departure from the standard 737 and can be rather unstable. And the only reason Boeing did that was to circumvent some regulatory restrictions around airframe certification and pilot training. So, you&#x27;re right in the sense that the MCAS was poorly implemented, but it was only required in the first place because of the abnormally sized engine. Well, not so much the size but the increased size with the same airframe caused it to be moved to a different part of the aircraft.')
