Rust certainly has built-in support for immutable data, it lacks what the author is calling ‘support for immutable data structures’. In particular, the author only seems to be considering support for persistent, immutable data structures, as referenced in all the functional language examples. Rust does not have any concept of an immutable list which is changed by simply adding a pointer to the unchanged part of the list to some new derived list. I think the author should have been more explicit in qualifying the immutable characteristic as persistent all the way through the article.')
