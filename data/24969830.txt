The thing that really kills the range in the winter is if your car sits outside unplugged for long enough to cool down completely.   Which shouldn&#x27;t happen on a long trip, as long as you book hotels with chargers or block heater outlets.<p>The main reason I&#x27;d not want to do it in winter is the possibility of getting hit by a blizzard while crossing Northern Ontario which is basically unpopulated, and there are stretches without cell coverage.  But that&#x27;s a risk whether you have a gas or an electric car.<p>One rule for winter driving is to never let your tank go below 50% so you have enough for heat if you get disabled.   Heating the cabin in an electric car is really tough on batteries, but you should be able to survive just on seat heating in an emergency, so half a battery should last a long time.   Tesla has enough chargers to let you stay above 50% on a cross-Canada trip, but you&#x27;re going to be spending a <i>lot</i> of time charging.   You&#x27;ll be charging more often, and that last 20% is really slow.<p>The normal advice is to take I95 instead of the Trans-Canada in the winter, but with borders closed because of Covid, that&#x27;s not currently an option.')
