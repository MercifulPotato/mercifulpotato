After a Firefox update, they were not allowed anymore, because they&#x27;re not signed. The extensions page cannot load local extensions. Then I discovered the secret debug-extensions page of Firefox where I could load them.<p>Unfortunately, Firefox removes local extension when it closes. I had the choice between loading each local extension after launching a new Firefox, which mean a dozen of clicks, or installing web-ext in order to sign my extensions, and sign them again after each change (no idea if there were extra actions needed in the process, like manual reload). I opted for a much simple option: with Chromium-based browsers, you can enable the extension-developer mode, and then you&#x27;re allowed to load local extensions from the normal extensions page. Extensions are kept across restarts.')
