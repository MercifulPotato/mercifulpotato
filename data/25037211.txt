First amendment. Freedom of speech. Freedom of thought. Freedom is the basic human right.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to bother falling into the tangential tarpit of acting like someone is a bomb maker without them having gone to trial is a &quot;1st amendment right&quot;. After all, if your best defense of a statement is &quot;I&#x27;m legally allowed to say it&quot;, it&#x27;s probably not worth much consideration.<p>&gt;  Notice that this covers the rights of someone &quot;who has been charged with an offence&quot; in &quot;a public trial&quot;.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t. It covers the rights of a person. Period. That&#x27;s literally the point of a <i>universal declaration of human rights</i><p>You&#x27;re trying to play word sashimi to make a point that isn&#x27;t made. The definition of <i>guilt</i> is specific to a public trial <i>exactly because</i> a &quot;trial&quot; of public opinions is so easy to manipulate.<p>Sure it can&#x27;t force the general public to be decent people and understand that people should be presumed innocent until proven guilty... but it&#x27;s also not endorsing the public not do so. It&#x27;s not limiting presumption of innocence to trials.')
