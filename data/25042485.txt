Here&#x27;s BBC article[0] with CCTV screenshots you can look at yourself. You seem to be under the belief that I was going to produce evidence that would <i>satisfy you</i>, which I never claimed to do. I wanted to disprove your assertion:<p><i>&quot;The only evidence is &quot;everybody knows&quot;, or the U.S. intelligence community being &quot;certain&quot; of his fate.&quot;</i><p>This is obviously a silly statement. There is a ton of evidence, some more damning (CCTV screenshots, audio transcripts) than others (claims from Turkish officials that aren&#x27;t backed up in the reviewed audio). Never did I state that I had access to non-public evidence, just that it was reviewed (by multiple independent agencies, I might add). But it is very much a fact that there is <i>also</i> public evidence that you yourself can review.<p>But I understand you conspiracy-types. What if it&#x27;s a false flag op? We never saw footage of Khashoggi getting sawed in half. We all know that intelligence agencies are run by the &quot;DEEP STATE,&quot; taking orders from a cabal of lizardmen. If your burden of evidence was actually met, obviously the evidence was forged.<p>But this is the dumbest form of conspiracy. &quot;Admission of Guilt&quot; is a form of evidence in US law, and Saudi Arabia has very much admitted to the fact that Khashoggi died while in the consulate, as well as to the premeditated nature of his death.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-middle-east-49826905" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-middle-east-49826905</a>')
