After living most of my life in Brazil, I still bristle at how stuff happens here in the US, with much less papertrail than I&#x27;m used to because people often trust the systems and people in place.<p>When I bought a home I just wired the down payment, didn&#x27;t get anything other than the bank statement saying I had wired the money. In Brazil I&#x27;d get a paper proving they got  it and stuff.<p>So while the fear of &quot;bothering&quot; is real, the fear of losing a considerable amount of money because the person on the other side is not trustworthy (and I&#x27;d say Brazilians in general assume no one is trustworthy) is worse in a much bigger scale. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever be as carefree as americans but not having to care as much as I used to back in Brazil has been a huge boost for my mental health.')
