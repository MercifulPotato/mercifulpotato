They gave me my earliest understanding of how software runs in memory and the nature of the memory.  Was great to just poke at parts of the memory with it and just see what happens.<p>I didn&#x27;t need to be reminded of another reason to hate Nintendo.  I think I air my grievances in every HN thread about Nintendo.  But this does add to the pile.  Around the same time I lost interest in Nintendo, games like Halo became attractive because Bungie explicitly wanted people to mod the PC version of the game.  At the time, it was really cool for a game company to embrace the creativity of their players instead of putting a lock in their imaginations like Nintendo wanted.<p>Nintendo&#x27;s misguided hatred of memory editors goes beyond just punishing players.  They essentially against the <i>nerds</i> who one day might have become inspired to build their games.  The only kids I knew who had the Game Genie&#x2F;Shark were nerds.  Average people didn&#x27;t really have them and being able to &quot;cheat&quot; in the games wasn&#x27;t really going to ruin their experience.')
