Use praise and positive reinforcement for any contribution the children make to family business.  Make them feel like active members of Team Family.<p>In my experience, small children want more than anything to feel like part of Team Family.  If a child does something counterproductive or destructive, that is the time to take the author&#x27;s advice and replace positive reinforcement with graciousness.<p>My experience is that children who have been treated to a constant flow of positive reinforcement will be more upset by even a temporary cessation of that flow that by any punishment, and will do anything to get back to membership in good standing of Team Family.<p>I find it astounding that scientists have found that positive reinforcement is the only reliable way to shape long-term behavior constructively, in both humans and animals, in experiments going back to the 1930&#x27;s, but people refuse to believe the results, so scientists keep finding new ways to run the experiments, and get the same results.<p>I committed to using only positive reinforcement techniques with my own child, and I was delighted but not surprised by their effectiveness.  My biggest surprise was when my child started using positive reinforcement on me.  Which in my mind validates the linked post author&#x27;s assertion that the biggest influence on children&#x27;s behavior is the parent&#x27;s own.')
