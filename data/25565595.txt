I would imagine if someone at the office started claiming your work at your own you would probably experience something rather analogous to anger.<p>I know it&#x27;s a bit nitpicky but I would imagine that what you&#x27;ve done is become excellent at managing anger rather than banishing it entirely. (Which is an impressive accomplishment that you should feel very pleased and proud of nontheless.)<p>My understanding from modern psychology as well as buddhism that one never really gets really of anger, but rather, can develop excellent control of it. It might also be your life situation is such that people don&#x27;t really try to take advantage of you or mistreat you very often.')
