These items will typically have different SKUs than their equivalent normal priced electronics and often have at the minimum reduced feature sets, like fewer HDMI ports, anything really that can get the BOM lowered is likely to be removed from the electronics. I haven&#x27;t heard if they go as far as to use SoC with known issues, but certainly I can see them getting binned chips that fall with &quot;acceptable&quot; parameters, where acceptable is quite low.')
