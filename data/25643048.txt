AFAIK it never left the POC stage but it was a really neat demo.<p>My team at WDAS mirrored pretty closely what Pixar did with VDI although we didn&#x27;t fully switch to it for different reasons (power and heat constraints in the datacenter and price). IIRC the VDI hosts had static VMs and the teradici connection manager did all the smarts of routing user requests to a VM. There was no dynamic orchestration for us because we only had 60ish users using full VDI VMs, but even our plans of hundreds of users was still to use teradici and standard VMs on each host.<p>We rendered different than Pixar which also made our system a bit more static. We didn&#x27;t have a separate render VM and instead rendered directly on the workstation VM when users were idle or disconnected.')
