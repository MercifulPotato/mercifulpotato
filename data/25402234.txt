Here we show that D614G was more infectious than the ancestral form on human\nlung cells, colon cells, and on cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 or of ACE2\northologs from various mammals, including Chinese rufous horseshoe bat and Malayan pangolin. D614G\ndid not alter S protein synthesis, processing, or incorporation into SARS-CoV-2 particles, but D614G affinity\nfor ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron\nmicroscopy showed that D614G disrupts an interprotomer contact and that the conformation is shifted to-\nward an ACE2 binding-competent state, which is modeled to be on pathway for virion membrane fusion\nwith target cells. Consistent with this more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting\nthe S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated.&quot;<p>full text link here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;cell&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0092-8674(20)31229-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;cell&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0092-8674(20)31229-0</a>')
