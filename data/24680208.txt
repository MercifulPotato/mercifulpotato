You would have to change the entire legal landscape of software including certifying and licensing developers as well as banning a lot of hobbyist open source development in order for these code of ethics to be anything more than voluntary.  And anyone who is willing to voluntary agree to a code of ethics probably wasn&#x27;t the person who was doing ethically questionable work anyway.<p>I am a strong proponent of software ethics being taught in schools, but I don&#x27;t think an Hippocratic type oath makes any sense in our profession.')
