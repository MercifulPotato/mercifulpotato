I see the same web fonts being used time and time again.  It just makes sense for browsers to have an intelligent &quot;permanent cache&quot; - not based on your specific history but a common set of frequently sourced fonts, libraries, etc.<p>This would be especially helpful now that shared caches are going away.<p>One other option is to actually install the font into your OS.  Any correctly-coded website will try a local source first, which should help a lot for poor connections.')
