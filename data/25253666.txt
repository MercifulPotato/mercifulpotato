It&#x27;s not recommended that you should reimplement TLS. &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t&quot; is the wrong word in use.<p>Why should you not? You only learn by developing. Precautions follow with such, as likes not running in production. But how else do you learn if you do not?<p>If your interested in learning about secure sockets and the rest, you should reimplement TLS. Because that will teach you the inner workings of TLS.<p>The vibe &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t&quot; crushes the development side of things.')
