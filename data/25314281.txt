It&#x27;s not like making an account is overly difficult or demanding. You are not required to send two forms of ID or a blood sample by mail.<p>Anyone who really wants to contribute to the project (and scratch their itch) will not have a problem with entering a username, password, and perhaps use a validation link from an e-mail. It might discourage people with just fleeting interest.<p>And as a hypothetical FOSS project maintainer, I know I&#x27;d rather have one of the first kind of contributor than ten of the second kind. Especially if the alternative is to be beholden to the likes of Microsoft.<p>Of course, the best solution would be something like ForgeFed, but I can&#x27;t see that meaningfully taking off (there&#x27;s no way Github will ever adopt it). I&#x27;d love to be wrong, though.')
