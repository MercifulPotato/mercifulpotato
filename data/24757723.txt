This feels good if you’ve already made it or you grew up with the right connections, but it’s far from ideal you’re a promising developer who doesn’t yet have the right credentials on your resume to unlock the job.”</i><p>Perhaps we could interview different people differently?<p>I don’t know why we have this obsession with subjecting experienced candidates to the same whiteboard gauntlet as a new grad. In fact, after a candidate has a bunch of experience you’d <i>better</i> be screening for other factors, since the role of an experienced developer can&#x2F;should be dramatically different than someone with a\nfew years of experience.<p>But no, still with the “challenges”.
