Item(by='gjm11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611158395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25845591, text='I think you&#x27;re conflating &quot;natural&quot; with &quot;familiar&quot;.<p>Here are two processes Timmy could use to count the pens on his desk. (I have numbered them starting with 1, because I considerately adapt to the needs of my audience :-).)<p>1. Say &quot;0&quot;. Then increment for each object. So he goes: zero, (points to pen) one, (points to pen) two, (points to pen) three.<p>The advantage of this is that you don&#x27;t need a special case when the number of pens turns out to be zero. Hey, Timmy, how many unicorns on your desk? Timmy starts by saying &quot;zero&quot;, looks around, no unicorns, finished: it&#x27;s the same process as for pens, it just stopped earlier.<p>2. Number the objects from 0, and then the count is <i>the next number after the ones you listed</i>. So he goes: (points to pen) zero, (points to pen) one, (points to pen) two, so the number is three.<p>This corresponds more closely to how indexing works in computers, and matches up nicely with the so-called von Neumann construction in mathematics, but in other ways I find it less natural than #1. But I am confident that you could teach it to children, and they would find it natural, and think it weird to mix up &quot;the number of objects&quot; with &quot;the number of the last object&quot;. In this case, the only thing that changes from your dialogue is that Timmy says &quot;Well, since the next number is three, it totally makes sense to announce that I have three pens.&quot; You count the pens, then you say how many there are. <i>Zero, one, two, three</i>. Not <i>zero, one, two, two</i> as you would prefer. What are you, some kind of weirdo or something? :-)')
