Does it really matter in a computer?<p>Could you elaborate on your argument that scale (in terms of calculation speed; in terms of memory it surely matters) does indeed matter?\nI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more plausible for a huge pool of fast-moving &quot;magic sand&quot; to be conscious (excuse me for once again committing a scientific fallacy here, I&#x27;m open for suggestions on methodology).')
