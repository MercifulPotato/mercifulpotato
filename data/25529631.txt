Item(by='whatshisface', descendants=None, kids=[25530137, 25529794], score=None, time=1608832074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516343, text='Something&#x27;s wrong with all of the &quot;deduce from patterns&quot; answers in the article&#x27;s comments. None of the patterns are deduced! It&#x27;s definitely not an axiom that an even number minus and even number is even; that would have to be proven from the definition of even-ness. The definition of even-ness is what decides whether or not zero is even. It would be equally coherent to define 0 to be even, or exempt from even-ness. An example of a definition where exemption would make sense would be to say that even numbers are those whose unique prime factorizations contain a factor of two. 0 is exempted from having a factorization, so exemption from even and odd would follow naturally. Whether or not 0 is even is a random accident of math history with at most a little justification from convenience. Nobody can be blamed for failing to deduce it because it cannot be deduced.<p>I think the people claiming that the right answer is obvious are making a mistake much more severe than the mistake made by people who guessed that zero was exempt. They are confusing the direction of reasoning by trying to prove axioms from conjectures by first assuming that their conjectures are theorems.')
