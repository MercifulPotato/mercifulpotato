Consider a $50k car, dealer offers you 1% via bank. At <i>best</i> the bank is only taking half of that (0.5% is already ridiculous for a not-really-secured loan, considering new car depreciation), so over a 5yr loan the dealership makes... $1250. That&#x27;s, what, one week of salary for one of their salesmen? I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as much of a factor as we think it is. People talk about the dealerships handing out $10k discounts because &quot;they make their money on financing&quot; but the math just doesn&#x27;t support that unless you&#x27;re doing credit-card-interest-level loans.')
