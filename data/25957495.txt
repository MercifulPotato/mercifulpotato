Business is always hard no matter how much time you put into it. I run a bootstrapped SAAS bsiness that grew &quot;only&quot; 20% last year. I know that is not even close to what VCs want if I wanted money but that 20% growth was great for our team and we can continue to working on building a great sustainable and profitable business. However, I can assure you there is nothing &quot;lifestyle&quot; about it. As the founder, I grind my ass as much as the founder of a VC backed company.')
