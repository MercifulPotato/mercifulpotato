I hadn&#x27;t considered this, but my build process does indeed include a compilation step done on Amazon Linux to pull in all the packages and build them with node-gyp. That then gets uploaded to Lambda.<p>So you&#x27;re correct that people will have to care if they don&#x27;t already generate builds through CI; otherwise it should be relatively simple so long as none of the included packages drop down to assembly for some weird reason.')
