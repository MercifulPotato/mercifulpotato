I&#x27;m looking for a replacement. Years ago Apple stopped selling anything except the iPod Touch, which is too large and fragile for me. I want something that fits into my pocket, with a long battery life.<p>&quot;Long&quot; means can be used for a couple of days without needing a charge, or in standby for weeks. As an example of &quot;too fragile&quot;, I had a 7th gen. iPod with touch screen that broke after a month or two of the same treatment my 5th gen. handled for years. I went back to my 5th gen. after that.<p>I only need it for podcasts. I like dedicated hardware to reduce the temptation to connect to the world.<p>Since Apple decided to split up iTunes into different apps (I haven&#x27;t upgraded my Mac yet, to keep iTunes), I&#x27;m also fine with switching to a new app to manage podcasts.<p>Any suggestions?')
