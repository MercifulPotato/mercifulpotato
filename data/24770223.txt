The core of the ideology is that a suite of technologies, designed by a small technical elite, can and should become autonomous from and eventually replace, rather than complement, not just individual humans but much of humanity.<p>On economical and social damage: The article mentions that less than 10 percent of the US workforce is counted as employed by the technology sector, that essential contributions of others aren&#x27;t counted as &quot;work&quot; or compensated, that this has &quot;hollowed out&quot; the economy and contributed to the concentration of wealth in an elite, and that this has contributed to concentrating power, as well.<p>On mutual exclusivity: The article proposes paying people for contributions, rather than writing them off as non-work. It also mentions humans with &quot;AI resources&quot; outperforming AI alone.')
