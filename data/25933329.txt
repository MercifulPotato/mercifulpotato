If its ruling would still stand, it would overrule Bavarian legislation.<p>Which ECHR ruling are you referring to? My understanding of the ECHR precedent on this is that displaying a cross in schools <i>is permissible</i> under the 2011 <i>Lautsi</i> decision: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lautsi_v._Italy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lautsi_v._Italy</a><p>&gt; It granted that, &quot;by prescribing the presence of crucifixes in State-schools classrooms – a sign which, whether or not it is accorded in addition a secular symbolic value, undoubtedly refers to Christianity – the regulations confer on the country&#x27;s majority religion preponderant visibility in the school environment.&quot; But it declared: &quot;That is not in itself sufficient, however, to denote a process of indoctrination on the respondent State&#x27;s part and establish a breach of the requirements of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1&quot;. It added that &quot;a crucifix on a wall is an essentially passive symbol and ... cannot be deemed to have an influence on pupils comparable to that of didactic speech or participation in religious activities&quot;.<p>&gt; Confusing, as your nation&#x27;s claim seems to be &quot;In God we trust&quot; if I am not wrong? For a country that claims separation of church and state, that&#x27;s pretty Christian, in fact I wonder what US atheists have to say about that.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure American Christians would happily take &quot;in God we trust&quot; off the currency in return for religious education in public schools, as is the case in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d like to point out the following: Germany has - contrary to how US Americans both from the left and right use it as a space for projection - traditionally been a socially conservative country, one of the more conservative ones in Western Europe<p>I&#x27;m aware of that. My wife lived in Germany for a while. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m using Germany as an example, to illustrate how another socially conservative democracy works. The United States is even more conservative, more comparable to Poland or Turkey than Germany.<p>&gt; - gay marriage<p>The German Constitutional Court decision on same-sex marriage, like the abortion decision, was precisely <i>the opposite</i> of what happened in the U.S. In the case of same-sex marriage, the Bundestag legalized it (over Merkel&#x27;s objection). The Constitutional Court then held that the Constitution <i>allowed</i> for legalization of same-sex marriage. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irishtimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-german-gay-partnership-law-is-fully-constitutional-court-decides-1.1088928" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irishtimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;new-german-gay-partnership-l...</a>. In the U.S., it was the opposite. The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution <i>required</i> legalization of same-sex marriage.<p>&gt; - disallowing the cross in schools (as mentioned, overturned by the ECHR)<p>The mildness of the German Constitutional Court decision illustrates what I&#x27;m talking about. Germany required schools to remove the cross if someone complained. In the United States, the Supreme Court eliminated religion from schools completely, in a blanket fashion. (And it happened 70 years ago!) American public schools can&#x27;t even offer religious instruction, while German schools are required to offer it (unless the parent opts out).<p>- giving up the Mark for the Euro<p>Again, this was a scenario where the German Constitutional Court deferred to the legislature.<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t believe that the US Supreme Court has not sided with conservatives at times.<p>On social issues, it consistently sides with liberals. This is due to the dynamics of the legal profession, where the conservatives tend to be what people call &quot;coastal elites.&quot; They are economically conservative, but often relatively liberal socially. For example, while abortion remains technically illegal in Germany, I count only 3 votes to overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i> (which would not make abortion illegal, but simply allow Americans to adopt an abortion law like Germany or France).<p>&gt; The difference in Germany is that the political role of the Constitutional Court is widely accepted and politicians handle the issue responsibly. Bashing of the court system because of decisions that go against own beliefs is rare and frowned upon.<p>How much of that comes from the fact that the German Constitutional Court tends to be deferential to the society&#x27;s conservatism?')
