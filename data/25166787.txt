It didn&#x27;t start as my cup of tea, but I eventually got used to it. Hell, I even started enjoying using my MBP. It checked the right boxes in my list.<p>Since Catalina, it doesn&#x27;t anymore. Or, at least it doesn&#x27;t check as much boxes as it used to. And, frankly, it&#x27;s not worth the cost anymore. I could justify the expense for an used 2015 MBP, which felt like a slick and comfortable machine. Can I justify the expense for another Mac, now that it feels distinctly uncomfortable?')
