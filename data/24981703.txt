That is basically the end of it. Marriage is ultimately about creating family. You can&#x27;t undo your marriage once you have a child anymore than you can undo your parentage or undo your relationship with a cousin.

How awful. The wisdom of the past says that the old way was simply superior, and we see that when we look at things like the mental health crisis, the lack of grit, the prevalence of anxiety disordes. Generations past would look at our current system and say the obvious -- which was said at the time no-fault divorce became a thing as well, just forgotten by this day -- that the prevalence of family dissolution causes severe, apparently unrelated social ills.
