Too often have I been disappointed by &quot;premium brands&quot; that are not really in the business of designing headphone drivers and so their sound is subpar.<p>These Sennheiser headphones switch sources automatically, they are made from metal and leather, they sound great, they have all the battery I need and, most importantly for me, they have actual buttons. After using other headphones without buttons, I can&#x27;t tell you how much better I like that &quot;feature&quot;.<p>I think Apple can make headway with noise cancellation, battery and ergonomics. That will be enough for most people.<p>However, for myself, I am most curious if they will actually sound good, especially given that their marketing quip on that topic is - well let&#x27;s call it &quot;more than a few empty phrases&quot;.<p>Let&#x27;s see!')
