I want to try and record information in such a way that it has the meat of that byte of memory, but pair it with something that could be used to trigger that memory-byte - like your image example.<p>In the end i&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be a revolution, but nevertheless i&#x27;m hoping to find ways to bridge knowledge store &amp; retention (ala SRS&#x2F;etc).<p>I&#x27;m also quite interested in areas of learning. Eg i expect&#x2F;desire to store far more information than i can retain. So i want a system that can help me move areas of knowledge based on my ability <i>(or time availability)</i> to retain.')
