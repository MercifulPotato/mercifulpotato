The fact, that it may be hard to formalize the concept and deal with all the edge cases, does not change that.<p><i>Yet various exact scientific inquiries work very well without assuming it&#x27;s existence or that there be a difference between same and different identity.</i><p>Can you provide any example?<p><i>It is a very simple problem. The answer is: “identity is a pseudoscientific concept that is “not even wrong”.”.<p>It is so vague, so bereft of any definition that the claim of whether that two references share the same identity is “not even wrong”.</i><p>I am pretty sure people doing homotopy type theory [1] would disagree. And I am just picking this because it has gotten quite a bit of attention in recent years but people have put a lot of work into thinking about identity and equality over the centuries.<p><i>And that is why the various models of exact sciences typically to not require that such arbitrary lines be drawn of what is and isn&#x27;t a different “thing”.</i><p>Same as above, I would like to hear an example.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homotopy_type_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homotopy_type_theory</a>')
