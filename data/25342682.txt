Per FTB-1004 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftb.ca.gov&#x2F;forms&#x2F;misc&#x2F;1004.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftb.ca.gov&#x2F;forms&#x2F;misc&#x2F;1004.html</a>) you will be taxed whenever you exercise, whether you&#x27;re a resident or a non-resident. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re out-of-state for a particular tax year.<p>It is not really correct to cast this in terms of owing taxes on income in the state that you earned it because options are not income. There is a non-symmetry here with financial options generally: if you lived in California and bought some options, then left the state, and then, as a non-resident, exercised the options and sold shares, you would not be taxed in California because there was no income in California. Income on a stock transaction is generally recognized at the time a security is sold. Obtaining options and stocks both represent an outflow of money, not an inflow. It&#x27;s a regressive policy to treat options purchased in-kind with labor in an unfavorable way, with regards to taxation, relative to those purchased with cash.')
