In a truely threaded application, handing data from one to another using a queue requires the new thread to be scheduled by the OS (unless the target thread is so busy that it pops the item off the of the queue immediately after handling the previous item). In a single-threaded async design, if the workload is light then, after the first strand adds an item to the queue and yields control, the second strand might pop the item off and deal with it immediately in the same time slice.')
