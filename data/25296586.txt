Offline storage of course can also suffer bit rot&#x2F;theft&#x2F;damage, but it erases the possibility of malicious access over the web and makes it that much more secure.<p>Use the 3-2-1 backup method (3 instances of data, 2 of them not the original (backups), 1 of them offsite). I use cloud backup(s) for my offsite(s) and the remaining backup lends itself to being an external harddrive (or a very well firewalled NAS if it must be on the network).')
