Item(by='marcinzm', descendants=None, kids=[25659230], score=None, time=1609950198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658136, text='&gt;The VC model, as best as I can tell as a distant observer, is focused first on identifying the winning ideas, and then securing the right team as a secondary item.<p>I see the exact opposite.<p>I keep hearing that (early stage) VCs care about the team a lot more than the idea. The idea is necessary as a way of knowing that the team can come up with a concrete idea but not more than that. Later stage VCs focus on other things but those aren&#x27;t close to a film studio.')
