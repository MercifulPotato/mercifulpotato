Hiring SWEs is very meritocratic, you can&#x27;t get in just because you are of a certain race or ethnicity.<p>UX and design have several Beckies. Hiring is much more fluid&#x2F;subjective.<p>By painting UX as requiring &quot;empathy&quot; and claiming that white women have this magical quality but Indians or Asians are soulless robots who don&#x27;t have empathy; it is subtle racist attempt to keep them out while favoring Beckies or handsome white guys.')
