Item(by='gwd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604395784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24975788, text='&gt; I keep seeing people write that they &quot;don&#x27;t like ads&quot;, which seems silly because nobody likes ads, of course.<p>I actually do like <i>some</i> ads.  I have money, and I like to buy cool and interesting things.  Occasionally, ads tell me about a new thing or service I&#x27;d never heard of.  Those are ads that I&#x27;m really glad I saw.  When they&#x27;re respectfully informing me of things I <i>might</i> actually be interested in, then I don&#x27;t mind them.<p>When I don&#x27;t like ads is when they slow the page load down by 100x.  When I don&#x27;t like ads is when they have malicious exploits of my browser to install malware on my computer.  When I don&#x27;t like ads is when they auto-play video or put intrusive obnoxious things all over the screen.  (Seriously, does <i>anyone</i> respond to those kinds of ads?)  When I don&#x27;t like ads is when they chase me around the internet trying to get me to buy the thing <i>that I just bought</i>.<p>Using Brave, I see the static ads, and I get to choose to see ads through the Brave network or not.  At the moment, I don&#x27;t mind the Brave network ads -- they&#x27;re mostly for crypto, which I don&#x27;t care about; but they&#x27;re not obnoxious and I know I can turn them off.  And occasionally they&#x27;re for things I might actually be interested in, like chess or electronics.<p>Right now only 2 of the sites I visit regularly are signed up to be Brave content creators; when this reaches a critical mass, I&#x27;ll probably start putting in $10-20 per month specifically to support them.  At that point, maybe I&#x27;ll disable the Brave netork ads... or maybe I won&#x27;t.')
