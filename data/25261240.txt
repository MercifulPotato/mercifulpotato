Law of Sines<p>sin(a) &#x2F; A = sin(b) &#x2F; B = sin(c) &#x2F; C<p>Apparently, MY trigonometry is awful and needs more practice! Law of sines is basic &#x27;non-right triangles&#x27; stuff.<p>There are three legs: A-0, B-0, and B-A. Hmmm... B-A seems like a vector operation (but its a really easy one, so... probably can be figured out without formally studying linear algebra).. That gives us the &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; for lengths.<p>Aaaannnnd I&#x27;m stuck again. I have the lengths but I don&#x27;t have the angles. I only need to find one angle and the other two are solved with law of sines.<p>Maybe a system of equations at this point (lol, another subject where linear algebra helps). The law of sines gives 3-unknowns, but only 2-equations. So I still need one more constraint before I can math-out a solution.<p>------<p>EDIT: Law of sines is fully:<p>sin(a) &#x2F; A = sin(b) &#x2F; B = sin(c) &#x2F; C = d<p>Where &quot;d&quot; is the diameter of the circumcircle of the triangle. So the circumcircle&#x27;s diameter gives us the 3rd equation needed to solve the above system of equations (using non-matrix math).<p>So yeah, I think its possible. Its just waaayyyy harder to do. I also am handwaving a difficult part. I guess... take the average of 3 points, which would give the center of the circumcircle. Then sqrt(x, y, z) from the center to find the radius, then 2*radius = d.<p>Wow, that&#x27;s a lot of work compared to an easy projection matrix...')
