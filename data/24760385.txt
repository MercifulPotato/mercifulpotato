And no major left wing figure outside the US has ever argued strongly for unrestricted free speech. Freedom of movement doesn&#x27;t seem something that is strongly one way or the other, but I&#x27;d note that the requirement to carry identification is something that was kept in left leaning countries after WW2 but abandoned in right leaning countries.<p>Libertarianism seems - in principle - more like what you are describing. And in the US Libertarianism is generally seen as a more right-wing view (primarily because of economic issues rather than social though).')
