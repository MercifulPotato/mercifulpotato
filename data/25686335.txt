Item(by='VikingCoder', descendants=None, kids=[25686604], score=None, time=1610123445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25686240, text='I&#x27;d like to discuss each objection, one at a time.  Sound good?<p>1) Dominion voting machines changed counts.<p>No, they did not.  There was a hand recount in Georgia, and the counts matched within a reasonable degree.<p>Are we done with that objection yet???<p>If not, please walk me through how we have not definitively resolved this issue.<p>And that&#x27;s my point - people KEEP RAISING THIS ISSUE.  That means they are not listening to reason.  It is unreasonable to <i>mention</i> Dominion Voting Machines in regard to Georgia.  The issue has been settled.  Continuing to raise it is proof of bad faith, rejecting clear evidence, without any new evidence that would make us re-evaluate the issue.<p>If you care to move on to one next issue, may I recommend &quot;video of ballots being counted after election observers had gone home for the night&quot;, which is very related to this first issue, and has similarly been resolved, and it&#x27;s also unreasonable to keep raising it, for reasons I&#x27;d be glad to discuss.')
