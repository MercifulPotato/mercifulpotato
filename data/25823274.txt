The rest is mostly in the form of hot, dilute gas in intergalactic space.<p>The idea that about 5% of the total mass-energy budget of the universe is in the form of baryonic matter is well-determined by cosmological observations (including the relative amounts of hydrogen and helium formed in the Big Bang). It if turns out we&#x27;ve overestimated the amount of baryonic matter in stars by a factor of two, that just means that 95% of the baryons are in the hot intergalactic medium instead of 90%.')
