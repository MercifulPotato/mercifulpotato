Crops are not lost due to uncontrollable events and a lot of savings in chemicals to protect them from bugs<p>Monocultures are spectacularly fragile. You have to be extraordinarily careful about your air system to ensure that you don&#x27;t suddenly loose your crop to aphids&#x2F;greenfly&#x2F;other. Thats also not counting fungus or bacteria.<p>&gt; - Good for the environment to save so much in transport<p>None of this is good for the environment. It takes a huge amount of resources to setup, keep heated and lit.<p>&gt; - Independence from other countries<p>Actually this is the only real selling point. Theoretically you _could_ grow crops that are difficult to cultivate in your climate.<p>&gt;  - 250x less water<p>Yes, but I am sceptical. It should use less water than an open field, but the same as a greenhouse. if it truely is 250 less water then great. But I suspect thats clever comparison. There are ofcourse low cost ways to save water, like multch, or constricting water supplies and frequency just after germination.<p>Look, the problem I have is that a lot of these systems are basically hype machines. They are invented by tech bros who&#x27;ve just discovered that nature exsists. But instead of looking at the vast reams of research they head straight for the vertical&#x2F;hydro&#x2F;LED segment.<p>What agriculture really needs is an effective way to make and keep decent soil. After that its water management, after that is pest management. If you can make an automated, sustainable &amp; cheap way to do that, you&#x27;ll be actually helping the world<p>Up until that point, your just pissing dollars into the wind and wasting everyone&#x27;s time inveting solutions to problems that are not actual problems.')
