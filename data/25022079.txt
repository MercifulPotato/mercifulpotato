The implication behind them being that the history people shouldn&#x27;t repeat is rising up for their rights.<p>As a Jew, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any comparison that can be made between confederate statues and Auschwitz once one knows the history of both. Statues celebrate. Auschwitz mourns and remembers. You don&#x27;t see statues of Hitler, and for good reason.')
