Plus, if you want to be terse with Python (whiteboard space is limited after all), it quickly becomes alphabet soup.<p>If I had to describe the perfect interviewing language, it&#x27;d be something with C&#x2F;Java-like syntax, but without the cruft, that can optionally be typed, with easy fine grain control over looping. All the big-tech companies work with way too much Java, but Java is way too verbose for coding by hand. C# is about as close to Java as they come. Scala&#x2F;Kotlin is excellent if you write it like Java.')
