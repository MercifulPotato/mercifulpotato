I think someone asked &quot;what&#x27;s the probability this number is chosen?&quot; and many people respond with 1 in 42 million or something like that. But in fact this is only true <i>under the assumption the lottery is implemented perfectly</i>. But this assumption is what is under scrutiny here. Because the lottery is not some ideal process in the mathematical universe, it&#x27;s a process in the physical universe implemented by humans. Because it&#x27;s a real process implemented by humans, there&#x27;s all sorts of ways we can imagine the results could be skewed by the implementation details, and we can imagine all sorts of outputs that might be more likely given the most likely flaws in the implementation.')
