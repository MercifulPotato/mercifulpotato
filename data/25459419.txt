When I make changes to a file, it&#x27;s not enough to know just the few lines before, I need to know what versions of code are operating dozens of lines away and in different files.<p>Further, diffs only make sense if you have the full version of the files, pre-diff. Without that full file state, diffs could operate in all sorts of incorrect ways.<p>I think this is one thing that git actually does correctly: save full checkpoints of a directory structure. I want the same thing when I&#x27;m dealing with, say, edits of an essay or book. I want the saved full state, and may produce a diff for convenience, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to save the diff as the fundamental object of interest.')
