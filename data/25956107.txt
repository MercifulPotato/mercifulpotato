Furthermore the contract will always stipulate that external and incidental factors in the supply chain security and production process may impact delivery. There will be a clause. You cant force someone to give you something that doesn&#x27;t exist.

The EU built little contingency into their vaccine strategy. The EU had not even approved the vaccine in question that they want delivery of.<p>This is childish politics from a bunch of over promoted people who are screaming blue murder when faced with the consequences their own incompetence.<p><i>Edit</i>: The contract has been published<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;commission&#x2F;presscorner&#x2F;detail&#x2F;en&#x2F;ip_21_302" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;commission&#x2F;presscorner&#x2F;detail&#x2F;en&#x2F;ip_21_...</a><p>Exactly as i thought.<p>&gt; WHEREAS, as part of that scale-up, AstraZeneca has committed to use its Best Reasonable Efforts (as defined below) to build capacity to manufacture 300 million Doses of the Vaccine, at no profit and no loss to AstraZeneca, at the total cost currently estimated to be  Euros for distribution within the EU')
