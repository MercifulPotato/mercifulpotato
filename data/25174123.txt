My hand size is average, I can comfortably reach all ninths and most tenths. (F# - A# pisses me off.) It always bugged when my teachers would take umbrage about hand size complaints, they always had some piano pro to point out that had smaller hands than me. Yeah, I get it, I can arpeggiate, but you still can&#x27;t make me learn Rachmaninoff.<p>There&#x27;s this Brahms 2nd rhapsody that I just love, but the climax of the entire piece is this chord that I can only hit if the stars align, and it just hurts my heart to arpeggiate it.')
