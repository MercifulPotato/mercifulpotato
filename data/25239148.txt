You don&#x27;t need a car to do grocery shopping in a city in Germany, since public transport works well. In Switzerland, public transport is even better, so you might not need a car even if you don&#x27;t live in a city.<p>I know that the US is very different - many cities are not necessarily pedestrian-friendly - but over here, the idea that it&#x27;s more environmentally friendly to have stuff delivered to you is definitely false.')
