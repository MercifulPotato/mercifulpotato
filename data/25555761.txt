Gold, silver, bitcoin, land in desirable places. I also have the normal index funds and certain hand-picked stocks. One issue with stocks is companies can offer more of them in response to demand, unlike land or bitcoin.<p>We are in a period of rapid inflation but mainstream economists and the government pretend we aren’t. It has been going on for decades but the official inflation rate is supposedly sub-2% while healthcare, education, daycare, high-quality food, housing, and all manner of highly-desirable-yet-cannot-be-easily-created assets have gone way up in price and are unreachable to even the middle class let alone the poor.<p>Yet many applaud the “heroic” actions of the central banks and government when all they are doing is printing ever more money and patting themselves on the back. We as individuals need to act in our own best interests to avoid this disaster because no one is going to help us.')
