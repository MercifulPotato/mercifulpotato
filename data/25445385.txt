Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25451369], score=None, time=1608139778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434556, text='<i>The glycemic index of most milk substitutes (oat,soy,almond) are equivalent or greater than a can of coke.</i><p>That&#x27;s true of oat and rice milk, but not of almond or soy. That&#x27;s to be expected: the former two are made out of starchy grains, the latter two out of fatty nuts&#x2F;pulses. Those are on a par with milk for glycemic index (~25).<p>The worst case (&quot;obese cows on a grain fed diet in a feedlot&quot;) is also the common case: if you go to the grocery store and buy generic &quot;milk&quot;, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to get. Organic may be slightly better, though it&#x27;s unclear. You can go out of your way to get more sustainably-produced milk, but you&#x27;re going to pay at least twice as much for it.<p>That&#x27;s a decent choice, though I&#x27;d be happier if it were easier to verify. (I don&#x27;t trust the labeling of &quot;grass fed milk&quot;, and locally-sourced milk that I can check myself is hard to come by.) The small comfort is that dairy cattle have to be treated relatively well, since they can&#x27;t produce good milk if they&#x27;re sick or abused.')
