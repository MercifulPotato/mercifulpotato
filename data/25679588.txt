I&#x27;m working for Nexedi in France and we&#x27;re probably one of Europe&#x27;s largest open source publishers.<p>We&#x27;re doing strictly FLOSS software and earn our living by (1) customizing solutions for industrial clients and (2) participating in R&amp;D projects. Our main product is ERP5 (think open source SAP) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lab.nexedi.com&#x2F;nexedi&#x2F;erp5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lab.nexedi.com&#x2F;nexedi&#x2F;erp5</a>. \nOther solutions are built on top, such as SlapOS (ERP for cloud orchestration) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lab.nexedi.com&#x2F;nexedi&#x2F;slapos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lab.nexedi.com&#x2F;nexedi&#x2F;slapos</a> or Wendelin (ERP for big data)- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lab.nexedi.com&#x2F;nexedi&#x2F;wendelin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lab.nexedi.com&#x2F;nexedi&#x2F;wendelin</a><p>We&#x27;re recruiting mostly for our R&amp;D projects, since it&#x27;s a good way to familiarize yourself with our stack - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stack.nexedi.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stack.nexedi.com&#x2F;</a><p>One project is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osie-project.eu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osie-project.eu&#x2F;</a> - building an open source&#x2F;open hardware framework for industrial automation and robotics\nAnother one is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cython.plus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cython.plus&#x2F;</a> - trying to port multi-core concurrent programming from Golang to Python.\nThird project about deploying SlapOS on swarms of drones has no site online yet as we just started.<p>We have also launched a hyper-open cloud provider, called <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rapid.space&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rapid.space&#x2F;</a> - hyper-open meaning open source, open hardware &amp; open service. One other notable for Rapid.Space is the upcoming release of our openRRH project through the free software endowment fund we&#x27;re working to establish - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fdl-lef.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fdl-lef.org&#x2F;</a><p>Albeit all of this, we&#x27;re still only a small team of about 40 scattered across the globe. Our main offices are in Lille, Munich and Tokio. Our learning curve is quite steep, so pre-Covid it always helped to have new Nexedians start out in one of our offices or at least spent a few months with us. Depending on your topic and Covid, remote work is not a problem. Aside from this, we have a flat hierarchy and expect everyone to be able to work autonomously. If this is not your thing, you&#x27;ll have a hard time here. We&#x27;re also obviously opinionated about open-source, our stack is mostly Python and Javascript and we only use Chromebooks (with our own OS). We&#x27;re free of VC-funding to keep our solutions free, the downside being that we don&#x27;t have the marketing budget for flashy sites and large communities. C&#x27;est la vie as we say in France :)<p>If you&#x27;re interested, our current offers are on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexedi.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexedi.com&#x2F;jobs</a> , my mail is on my profile.
