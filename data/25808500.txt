Item(by='_Gyan_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610862461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802366, text='I provide Windows builds of ffmpeg, linked via <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ffmpeg.org&#x2F;download.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ffmpeg.org&#x2F;download.html</a>. The site is entirely static, no user data is collected or stored.<p>Starting in late October, lasting for around a month, users would get the dreaded red page upon visiting the site at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gyan.dev&#x2F;ffmpeg&#x2F;builds&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gyan.dev&#x2F;ffmpeg&#x2F;builds&#x2F;</a><p>Search Console would show a couple of files as &#x27;install malicious or unwanted software&#x27;. Never mind that all files are plain archives (7z,ZIP) with no installers or even self-extraction, containing CLI apps. These file URLs when scanned via Virustotal (Google-owned) would be flagged by Google Safe-browsing and no other engine. Weird thing is, the same files mirrored at Github would be detected as clean. A review request at SC would get rid of the warning temporarily only to return after a day or two.<p>I found no support email so I opened a thread at Google Webmaster community (now called Search Central community). But there was no help and none of the regulars seem to be Google employees. Finally, I found an email through Mozilla&#x27;s page on their use of Google&#x27;s Safe Browsing blacklists at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;kb&#x2F;how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;kb&#x2F;how-does-phishing-and-m...</a>\nwhich leads to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safebrowsing.google.com&#x2F;safebrowsing&#x2F;report_error&#x2F;?tpl=mozilla&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safebrowsing.google.com&#x2F;safebrowsing&#x2F;report_error&#x2F;?t...</a>. This page&#x27;s title is &#x27;Report Incorrect Forgery Alert&#x27; which would indicate a different purpose but I managed to get hold of human attention. After 10 days or so, the warnings disappeared. Till date, I don&#x27;t know what triggered the warnings in the first place, and so how to prevent a recurrence.')
