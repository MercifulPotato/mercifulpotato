Let alone the idea that abstraction will make system flexible and easier to change in the future. Where they don&#x27;t know the future and then always comes a plot twist which does not fit into &quot;perfect architecture&quot;. So I agree with that idea that abstraction is not always best response to complex system. Sometimes making copy, paste and change is better approach.')
