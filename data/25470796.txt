Democracy doesn&#x27;t work because several powerful groups lobby to keep civil forfeiture. There&#x27;s no way they can resist this. Their government can label any citizen a threat to national security and strip them of whatever rights they still have. Their dragnet surveillance allows them to monitor and stop any organized opposition. Attempting revolution is unwise since that&#x27;d probably result in the &quot;terrorists&quot; getting curbstomped by the US military forces.')
