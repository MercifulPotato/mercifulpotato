In our case, we sometimes have MR&#x27;s that specifically mention things like &quot;I did X as a shortcut to get this running, we will have to optimize this before we can do Y&quot;, which are totally fine and laudable.<p>However, we also have MR&#x27;s where e.g. moving the mouse causes jank &#x2F; slows updates down to &lt;20 fps. Doing a paired review on those leads to the observations above: many developers simply don&#x27;t know how to measure and optimize code, and even less how to estimate impact before writing that code. It would be easy to dismiss this as &quot;bad developers&quot;, but I&#x27;ve seen it so many times over the last two decades that I think it runs deeper than that.<p>And then we all end up on HN with our favourite complaint: slow bloated Electron apps - except VSCode which is fast. The problem is not Electron, it&#x27;s a systematic lack of knowledge and incentives about performance in the field.')
