Skip it and you&#x27;d have the same meaning without sounding like you&#x27;re sucking up to a company.<p>&gt; Hashicorp pushed back on the dogmatism of pure static. Their team is laser-focused on the user experience. They don’t care if an application is CSR, SSR, SSG, etc. as long as their end-user is delighted.<p>This has no meaning to me, personally. If Hashicorp doesn&#x27;t care about pure static as long as their &quot;end-user is delighted,&quot; why did they push back? Was there some kind of drama you&#x27;re revealing? How is &quot;end-user delight&quot; related to any of the acronyms? Are you suggesting pure static pages &quot;delight&quot; fewer users?<p>The writing is pretty bad. Funnily enough, on the webpage they link from the &quot;CSR, SSR, SSG&quot; string doesn&#x27;t contain the words &quot;CSR&quot; or &quot;SSG&quot;, so it doesn&#x27;t explain much unless you have the time to read the whole page.')
