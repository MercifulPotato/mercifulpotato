We don&#x27;t have viable safety nets and support systems but we do have a burgeoning &#x27;homeless industrial complex&#x27; that is intimately linked to the prison industrial complex. This is profoundly wrong IMO and I am very vocal about that. \nThis lack of a safety net coupled with labor and cost intensive care for the mentally ill and addicted is corrosive to society on so many levels and fundamental to everyone&#x27;s quality of life. The only way to change this is to be extremely noisy and aggressive about what our &#x27;leadership&#x27; is doing IMO.\nI am partially motivated from a young bay area relative dying from opioid o&#x2F;d this February after his family had burned through a huge sum on rehabs, chasing after him + the emotional burn out toll. We are headed in the wrong direction...')
