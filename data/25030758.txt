I still have a feel for btrfs and think this tool&#x27;s great explanations provide some good hints. I can also finally get a good and fast sense for a snapshot&#x27;s size (I used to use to use btrfs send).<p>But ... is it normal to have massive amounts of data like everything except snapshots&#x2F; and var&#x2F; in my system subvolume being one of them, as error-nodes (&#x2F;open (No such file or directory))?<p>Also: Is there a way to stop sampling after some time or amount of samples? It turns out your idea is correct and you don&#x27;t actually need all that many to get a good impression  :-)<p>Thanks for making it!')
