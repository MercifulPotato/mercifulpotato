Everyone who has thought about it for more than a second understands GME is not worth 22 Billion dollars.<p>So the people who are buying now are going to collectively lose a ton of money when it inevitably crashes back down to 8 bucks a share.<p>The people knowing engaging in the short squeeze are taking that risk, so that is on them.
