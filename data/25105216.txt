Assuming you&#x27;re most interested in the US Presidential election, it&#x27;s also specifically delegated to the states to choose how they wish to select their electors (it just happens that most use a popular vote of their citizens in a winner-take-all setup per state).<p>There are a number of groups trying to push for more transparency, but it&#x27;s fundamentally a per-state issue in the US. California has a bill [1] that seems like it &quot;passed&quot; but is referred to committee (stuck). It would establish $16M in funding, at least half of which goes to development, which must be AGPL 3:<p>&gt; (1) All of the system’s software developed at least in part using state or county funds pursuant to this section must be licensed exclusively under the GNU Affero General Public License 3.0 or a later version.<p>and<p>&gt; (2) All of the system’s software components must be open source during development, using a process that is open to public feedback. Development must be carried out in public repositories by January 1, 2021.<p>So some folks definitely agree we should have open-source election software. Most likely, if a system becomes successful in California (the largest market) it could spread to other states. As frustrating and repetitive as it sounds: you need people to vote in local elections, and contact their local representatives.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1784" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billTextClient.xhtm...</a>')
