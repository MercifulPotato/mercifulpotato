They robbed me of two years of my life. The worst for me was derealisation and strong hallucinations. I started strongly believing that life isn&#x27;t real, that what I am seeing is just a dream or that other humans are just objects that happen to move and speak. Hallucinations were crazy scary, like I saw things as if atoms of objects got magnified hundreds of times or everything was constructed of polygons (like you would switch wire frame rendering). Absolutely crazy thoughts like I was convinced that if I cut myself with a knife it will give me pleasure  like scratching an itch. I had a couple of suicidal episodes and ended up in hospital. Somehow nobody connected that this could be anti depressants. I then stopped them on my own and few weeks later started CBT therapy. That fortunately was the most I needed to &quot;repair&quot; my thought processes. I am okay, but I sometimes have the flashbacks of what happened. It&#x27;s just a reminder to stay away from these things. I understand this may help other people but it didn&#x27;t help me. When I talked about hallucinations with the doctor he just prescribed a different one. Every 4-6 months I had a different one.')
