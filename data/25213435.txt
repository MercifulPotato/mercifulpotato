All of which I have included in the title.<p>&gt;for the obvious reason that reporting a user would be meaningless without that.<p>This is a change from past behavior. WhatsApp didn&#x27;t forward a copy of messages when you reported people previously. Now they do. Which is what I clearly mentioned in the title. This meaningless way of reporting people was what users were used to.<p>None of the comments commenting about click-bait are mentioning what is factually wrong with the title.
