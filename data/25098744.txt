They will most likely start monitoring content to look for your preference of Doritos they can advertise you.<p>People won&#x27;t abandon Discord until all your private chat&#x2F;call logs are hacked and dumped. When that happens, only a fraction say 10-15% of the userbase will look for a permanent solution (i.e. something that has always-on E2EE). My guess is about 40% will change to another service with better track record, but that isn&#x27;t architecturally any more secure (i.e. that&#x27;s still TLS-only). The remaining 50% will stay on the service because 1) they don&#x27;t care, 2) their peers don&#x27;t care or, 3) because they consider the incident response and related PR good enough.<p>To get people to switch from discord you need something that&#x27;s faster, that just works better, that fixes some issues faster than Discord staff can fix them, and that adds something the users didn&#x27;t even know they needed, say, in-game HUD for discord that fits the theme of the game or something, more intuitive management like push-to-talk management commands for the client via secondary button.<p>As long as it&#x27;s about decentralization (value&#x2F;belief system stuff) or about privacy (It&#x27;s just in-game talk I don&#x27;t care), and not about helping the user focus on head-shots and kill-streaks, it&#x27;s not going to be adopted.')
