For example, Alice can write on a piece of paper: &quot;Anytime anyone wants to sell this paper back to me, I&#x27;ll pay a sum equal to the price of GME at that moment&quot;. Now if Alice sells the paper to Bob, Alice is short and Bob is long, even though none of them touched any stock.<p>Of course if many Alices do that, that will push down the price of GME, because it&#x27;s market-relevant information that many people think GME will go down.<p>The real problem is counterparty risk. What happens if Alice runs out of money and can&#x27;t pay up, or there&#x27;s a run on all Alices at once? So a system of guarantors is needed. But this is far from the simple argument that &quot;selling a borrowed car is stealing&quot;.')
