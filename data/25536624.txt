Googling &quot;upscale imagemagick&quot; seemed to indicate that it is suitable for the task.<p>More generally, upscaling is probably going to be &gt;95% established algorithms with at best a small amount of perceptual heuristics to accommodate human vision. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect perceptual heuristics to be common outside of tools like Photoshop because most of the time it won&#x27;t matter and SEO is going to generate more revenue for a web service than quality.<p>I doubt there&#x27;s much proprietary technology, it&#x27;s understanding graphics sufficiently to make good judgements that&#x27;s going to be rare.')
