You still have to get potentially expensive peripherals and the overall experience is worse. Especially when you consider the risk of corrupting the SD card. That&#x27;s negative value right there.<p>If you are desperate you just get an old Thinkpad on ebay for $200.<p>Beyond a certain point you lose more in value than you save in money.<p>So you should embrace that and choose a completely different computing experience for sub $200. At that point you are better off with a cheap tablet. They do not cost significantly more than a Raspberry Pi 4.')
