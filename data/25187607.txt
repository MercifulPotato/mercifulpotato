It only talks about &quot;in America&quot;, meaning the US. There are 192 other countries.<p>2. I haven&#x27;t said it&#x27;s unfathomable. It&#x27;s ridiculously unlikely, though. Journalists are not exactly known for their secrecy, even if they wanted to they wouldn&#x27;t be able to hide a gigantic mind control collusion among the six corporations you&#x27;ve mentioned. There is no grand conspiracy. On a side note, editorial policies are not &quot;mind control&quot; either.<p>What people say about the media and mind control is not only crazy, the very same people tend to propagate extremely bad information sources such as blogs and partisan news aggregation sites that are primary examples of what they criticize and allegedly reject. As I&#x27;ve said, there is an agenda behind these conspiracy claims, and it surely isn&#x27;t to improve the quality of news and information sources for citizens.<p>As a result, the vast majority of normal and well-informed people now have to endure all this insane nonsense, from Covid conspiracy theories by vegan cooks over Pizzagate to a complete denial of reality by flat earthers (&quot;I don&#x27;t believe in trigonometry&quot;). It&#x27;s an unfortunate but perhaps inevitable consequence of the fact that small, radical minorities can so easily find their own esoteric peer groups and create their own small echo chambers nowadays. The same kind of radical groups also existed in the past, of course, but it was much harder for them to meet and gain followers.')
