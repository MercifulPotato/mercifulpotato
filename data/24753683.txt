Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602505476, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24753166, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not sure why you mention off-topic GPT3.<p>I mentioned that because there are true scams where they accept literally any text (and payment!) and &quot;publish&quot; it on their online only &quot;journal&quot;. I believe instances of GPT-like nonsense being &quot;published&quot; by those scams have been posted to HN in the past. I was just trying clarify that I was NOT levelling that accusation against SPIE, in my case my original comment had made it sound like I did. Your offense at me bringing it up, just to say that I&#x27;m not accusing SPIE of that, is frankly an overreaction.<p>&gt; SPIE has a different audience compared to basic research.  ... it is a venue for applied research<p>&quot;Applied research&quot; is not an excuse for articles that contain little or no technical content. I have seen several articles that are just a description of a demonstration that took place of a new product. That product undoubtably contains interesting technical innovations, but those innovations are not described in the article, at least not in any sort of detail that would benefit future practitioners. That is not a serious research article of any kind, including applied research.<p>&gt; There have been many highly cited papers from SPIE in my applied field. SPIE cooperates with OSA on the largest optics conferences ...<p>First of all: Regardless of this whole SPIE discussion, I have seen some truely awful articles that have been cited a lot. Infamously, there was an article in a medical journal that reinvented the centuries-old (millenia-old maybe?) trapezium rule for estimating the area under a curve and was cited thousands of times. Citation count, I&#x27;m sure we can all agree, is not an indicator of quality, at least not by itself.<p>But, as I said before: I can believe that interesting original articles with some real technical content are published to SPIE, particularly in its original field of optics. (The articles I&#x27;m referring to are more like products that include a camera or similar as a component, which technically falls under the field of &quot;optics&quot; but is rather far away from something more basic than a study of an individual type of lens, as in this article.) If you have seen articles like that then I&#x27;m not trying to invalidate your experience.<p>But I have also seen papers very unlike that, as I said above, and I ask you not to invalidate my experience by claiming that those don&#x27;t exist. Ultimately, the conclusion for a reader like me that hears &quot;this paper was in SPIE&quot; is that maybe it&#x27;s like the dubious papers I&#x27;ve seen in the past. If SPIE publishes some serious papers and some rather less so, perhaps in different journals under the SPIE banner, then the blame is on them for tainting their previously good reputation by accepting lower quality articles.')
