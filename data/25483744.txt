Itâ€™s not even close anywhere else so it is difficult for both US residents and people of other countries to fully comprehend.<p>I honestly feel as though this is a lack of awareness of other regions and the differences inside of them. I don&#x27;t know how you can make sweeping statements like that. A cursory look at a linguistic diversity map should immediately hint at a different reality, and that&#x27;s just one metric. There are places in Africa where you have genetic lines that are distant by tends of thousands of years from surrounding villages as measured by their Y chromosomes.')
