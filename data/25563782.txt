The serving player rolls two dice and moves the ball that many spaces. So 12 is out, anything below 6 hits the net.<p>Following a successful serve the opposing player gets to choose whether to roll one or two dice. Other than that its normal tennis rules. It&#x27;s mostly luck with the main skill deciding whether to roll one or two dice.<p>Or how about Rock, Scissors and Paper?')
