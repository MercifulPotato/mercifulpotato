Item(by='makomk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603675132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887924, text='Before Google was so aggressive about paying everyone to set themselves as the default search engine, Bing used to pay to be the only search option on a number of mobile devices <i>and disable the ability to change that default</i> (presumably because everyone would just switch back to Google). So for a while, a lot of Android devices sold by mobile networks in places like Europe forced searches to Bing with no way to change that.<p>If the Justice Department contines with this attempt to stop Google paying to be the default, I can easily see this ending in a situation where their non-search competitors are worse off financially and consumers have substantially less choice than they do now.')
