Item(by='bzbarsky', descendants=None, kids=[24849598], score=None, time=1603297850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846754, text='&gt; 4.1 billion internet users, firefox has 4% market share<p>Note that the denominator for market share as measured by StatCounter is &quot;page views&quot;, not &quot;browser users&quot;.<p>So for example, say you have 4.1 billion users, who use their laptop and phone evenly for their web browsing.  On their phone, none of them use Firefox.  All of them load the same number of pages every day.  In this scenario, 4% of page views corresponds to 8% of users using Firefox on laptop.<p>Note that these are not realistic assumptions, of course: people vary widely in terms of how many pages they load, vary widely in terms of how their web activity is split between mobile and non-mobile, etc.  For example, in 2010, I would bet that the average Firefox user used the web more than the average IE user, so the StatCounter number for Firefox was inflated compared to the actual fraction of users using Firefox.<p>If you want to measure actual number of Firefox users, you need to use a data service that tries to measure users instead of page views (i.e. not StatCounter).')
