Good.) but I cant blame them, that they always seem to fall back to easily digestible YouTube videos and sensationalist news articles.<p>In the past it was harmless debates like, is raw garlic good? How good? In this call they threw things like big pharma, Bill Gates and mandatory masks&#x2F;vaccines activism crap. (At least no vaccine nanobots)<p>I tried to send them some articles to get them to read some legit research sources. But then after I hit some paywalls, even for covid research :(, I came to the HN community to ask for any suggestions.<p><i>Question:</i>\nAny thoughts, or links for material (other than teaching them to use sci-hub) that will let them keep up to date with research?<p>Thanks')
