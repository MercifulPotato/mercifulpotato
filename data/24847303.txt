Some languages use end keywords, others parenthesis of whatever kind and yet others use indentation and whitespace instead, which perhaps could also be considered to be a form of delimiters. Having visible and matching delimiters or support for recognizing what end delimiter matches which start delimiter is essential for editing code efficiently, in my opinion.<p>I use a lot of Python, but the whitespace usage and non-visible delimiters are one of the downsides of the language syntax for me. Editing code when everything is an expression and is clearly delimited by matching parens is so much more efficient and fun.')
