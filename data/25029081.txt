Like if our group of mostly brown people with kids is at a festival, security gaurds or cops would all of sudden hangout next to us. We would just laugh it off and cops are not rude or anything. But I rarely noticed cops hanging out near us when we are in mostly white group.<p>Another thing, a little worse service especially at upscale suburban resturants. Now brown&#x2F;desi people are known to be cheap when it comes to tips, so that does have some effect on the service. However, before 2016, we rarely got bad&#x2F;slow service. But it seems we had more issues at resturants in last 4 years than before. (Btw I always tip decent 20% standard and more depending on the service)<p>From cool I meant people now openly sterotype minorities especially on Facebook. Both young and old. Like friends complaining that they didn&#x27;t get a job because company was trying to hire a black woman. And, in fact, I have heard from multiple of my Republican friends that a Black Woman is the most powerful person in the US. (Ofc, I don&#x27;t believe that)')
