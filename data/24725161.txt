The Justice Department is claiming that those African Americans accepted into Yale are actually hurt by being accepted because their acceptance is reinforcing stereotypes that they needed extra assistance to get accepted.  This is just the same conservative talking point that we have heard for generations that you can&#x27;t do anything to help anyone because any assistance just makes them weaker.')
