I dabbled with it over the years, but it never stuck.  I felt like you do.<p>2016 the CV1 came out and I was briefly reunited with a strong interest in VR which, eventually, faded.  The next few years I didn&#x27;t play much, and when I did, it wasn&#x27;t for very long.<p>The problem was entirely CONTENT and it is FINALLY in 2020 starting to come around.<p>We have seen some absolutely excellent AAA games released that are loads of fun and not just glorified tech demos (though to be sure, those still exist).<p>-  POPULATION:ONE<p>-  Metal of Honor: Above and Beyond<p>-  Half Life: Alyx<p>-  Asgard&#x27;s Wrath<p>Any many more.  I&#x27;m finally finding myself using my VR headsets DAILY.  In fact my Oculus CV1 which came out 4 years ago is still my all around favorite!<p>I think as content improves (especially multiplayer content) and the headsets get more comfortable and easy to put on &#x2F; take off, we will hopefully see continued expansion of this medium.  It&#x27;s THE way to game, if you ask me.  Nothing is more engaging then jumping off a building, spreading my arms to fly, then pulling them together to grip my gun and land a quick snipe on someone in mid air.  Keyboard and mouse can suck it.')
