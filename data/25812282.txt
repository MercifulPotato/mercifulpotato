Item(by='generalizations', descendants=None, kids=[25813694], score=None, time=1610902710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812054, text='That was an interesting read. Thanks.  I&#x27;m not sure how the linked article expresses more than an alternate translation, though.  It says that <i>benei</i> doesn&#x27;t &quot;necessarily&quot; translate to sons, which doesn&#x27;t rule out the translation but merely suggests an alternative. The word <i>elokim</i> also refers generally to God, as it says, but can be translated differently.  It&#x27;s an interesting alternative, but the claim that the translation &quot;sons of god&quot; is specifically wrong only seems to be based on the declaration of a single earlier source.<p>&gt; It gets passed around as legit probably because it enforces the idea that Christ is a son of God.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of that before. Not sure where you would have, or how it even does reenforce that idea.')
