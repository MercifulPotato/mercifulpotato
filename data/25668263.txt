I don’t let WhatsApp access my contacts or photos. I tried very hard for a long time to not give Facebook my phone number. But if any of my contacts agrees to this, my phone number is given to Facebook (without my consent). So, what are my options really? Delete my account? And then what? My number will be given to them anyways.')
