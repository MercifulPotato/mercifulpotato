WebAuthn only, no passwords!  I was tired of typing a password for things like Grafana and PGAdmin, and IP whitelisting my home Internet for things that didn&#x27;t have built-in authentication.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;jsso2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;jsso2</a><p>If I were starting from 0 today, I&#x27;d just use Dex and Envoy&#x27;s built-in OAuth support.  OAuth is overly complicated, requiring a bunch of configuration for each app, and a ton of code in each app... but it won.  So use that.<p>jlog: I read a lot of log files in my day-to-day work and really like the idea of structured logs, but found them hard to read.  jlog translates timestamps to my local time zone, lets me query them with jq, highlights errors with color, etc.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;json-logs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;json-logs</a>  Can&#x27;t live without it, I use it many times every day, and have even convinced other people to use it without writing any documentation.  (There are binary releases and a --help though!)<p>&quot;kubectl jq&quot;: I wanted to play with writing kubectl plugins, so I made one that is just &quot;kubectl get x -o json | jq&quot;.  I use it pretty regularly, but the Kubernetes client machinery doesn&#x27;t give you autocompletion for free, so it&#x27;s pretty painful to use.  When they fix that, I plan to write more kubernetes extensions (including one that invokes jlog on the logs, saving a pipe ;)  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;kubectl-jq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;kubectl-jq</a><p>alertmanager-status: How do you know if your Prometheus&#x2F;Alertmanager is working?  If it breaks, it won&#x27;t be sending you an alert, after all.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;alertmanager-status" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;alertmanager-status</a><p>ekglue: The good parts of Istio, for internet&lt;-&gt;internal proxying, written by someone who read the xDS spec :P <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;ekglue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jrockway&#x2F;ekglue</a><p>For my day job, I work on Pachyderm Hub, which you should totally use if you want to run production-quality data science workloads (data provenance, reproducibility, etc.): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.pachyderm.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.pachyderm.com&#x2F;</a>  I could write a lot about it, but basically... we have customers that want to use Pachyderm, but the complexity of Kubernetes stands in their way.  How do you store logs?  How do you monitor things?  How do you give your coworkers access?  We solve those problems by letting you click a button in a web UI.
