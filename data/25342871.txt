Effectively, what this means is that the buffer is always formatted: every keypress triggers reindentation of the entire buffer and emacs “knows” about these semantic indentation rules. With this setup, the rules are pretty trivial to enforce and other environments, such as Calva or Cursive, can be configured to approximate this pretty closely. I dislike this style in other languages, but in lisps, the two-dimensional layout it creates is very useful for quickly scanning code and understanding its structure.')
