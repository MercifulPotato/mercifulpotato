It seems everyone is assuming that they should. Some seem to suggest they should for abstract &quot;free speech at all costs&quot; philosophy. Others are assuming they have some kind of positive effect, either on personal growth or economic activity.<p>&gt; Would the open source software community survive?<p>I&#x27;m not sure how Section 230 applies to code but I don&#x27;t think public forums like Facebook, Twitter or Youtube are necessary for open source software to continue (any more than they were necessary for it to start, which happened long before they existed).<p>Besides, what I&#x27;m pondering is the centralized aggregation points. People could still host blogs, they are just directly liable for the content they post (as they likely are now).')
