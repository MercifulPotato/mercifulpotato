So, here goes, or rather, how it looks from the outside:<p>The political spectrum in the US is fascinating in the worst way possible. If there is a range of the political spectrum that more closely reflects reality, it contains a part of the blue, but almost everything else is outside it. So, if one were to sensor dishonesty, and preserve what&#x27;s more factual, it would really not surprise me that, from a political point of view, its very biased against the right.<p>Then the question is if its correct to focus on the political nature of it, or the factuality of it. Imagine if one were to sensor a press conference from the White House based on factual correctness. Not much would get through, and one would say it is &quot;Liberal sensorship&quot;.<p>In any case. I should know better by know that comments like these are not welcome. But, those were my two cents.')
