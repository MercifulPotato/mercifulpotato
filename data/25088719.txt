It&#x27;s a fairy tale told by the news industry to the uneducated masses. Whenever you hear the news say the US has always been a champion of free trade, just know they are lying.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Protectionism_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Protectionism_in_the_United_St...</a><p>There is no such thing as &quot;free market economy&quot;. Every economy is a protected economy. It&#x27;s just a matter of degree. Go ask huwaei, iran, venezuela, zimbabwe, cuba, etc about &quot;free market economy&quot;.<p>All markets are manipulated and controlled nationally&#x2F;geopolitically. The price of oil isn&#x27;t determined just by the &quot;market&quot;, it&#x27;s decided by the FED, subsidies, war, etc.<p>The only core principle shared by all nations is to lie, cheat and steal as much as possible. And things ultimately work out. The idea of governance, checks and balance, rule of law, etc are just frivilous distractions. Not to mention propaganda like &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;western values&quot;. Surely saudi arabia is a shining symbol of democracy and western &quot;values&quot;.')
