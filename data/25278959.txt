This is why the phone feels warm under high use.<p>A more simple solution would be to keep a portable power bank (less than 30 dollars on Amzn)in your pocket and power your phone from it with a long usb cord.<p>If you dont mind the bulk and have a big enough pocket you can get one with a hand crank, flash light, bluetooth speaker and tuner. If space is an issue there are small ones available that can attach directly to the phone.<p>A power bank might be a good way to keep your phone warm too, you can pick up a peltier thermal module and usb adapter (less than 10 dollars on Amzn) and tape it to the back of your phone.<p>Just make sure you dont heat your phone up too much (+30C) as charging lithium cells above that temp will damage them.')
