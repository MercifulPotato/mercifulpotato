It really is the totalitarian dream. You&#x27;d have to leave The Internet proper as we know it now, and create the next one, just as AOL&#x2F;Compuserve were walled gardens that the internet grew outside of, a new network that resembled the 90&#x27;s era internet could emerge in as little as a few years.<p>Think about what Linux was: a new kernel for bare metal that broke out of the constraints of an OS landscape that looked a lot like today&#x27;s internet giants. At the time, global communication was novel, today, privacy and regional networks are novel. Most linux users had a bsd&#x2F;solaris&#x2F;windows machine to connect to the legacy world, so you don&#x27;t have to design the whole thing at once.<p>A p2p-reddit that used a blockchain that operated with a kind of old fidonet&#x2F;UUCP&#x2F;nntp over bittorrent as transport could be a source of new community. A bare metal blockchain client kernel for open RISC and ARM processors that uses a wireless mesh, and includes a kind of regional pub&#x2F;sub pattern would do it.<p>The tech is there.')
