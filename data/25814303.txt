In no particular order...<p>- The traditional start menu &#x2F; taskbar is genuinely nicer than what Gnome attempts to force on me. OS X is also genuinely nicer than what Gnome attempts to force on me. I&#x27;d take either over Gnome.<p>- The Linux desktop environment is laggy. This is difficult to measure objectively, but nothing moves <i>smoothly</i> and responsiveness is through the floor. I&#x27;m using a 144Hz screen; why can I see windows jerk from position to position when I drag them?<p>The Zen kernel helps with some of that, bringing it about to the same responsiveness as Windows -- which is still well below OSX. No desktop environment provides it by default, and in most it&#x27;s difficult to install. On NixOS it&#x27;s just &quot;boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_zen;&quot;, but it&#x27;s still not the default.<p>- nVidia&#x27;s drivers are poor, and there are a lot of sharp edges. I&#x27;m using one of their GPUs. No, I can&#x27;t switch to AMD; I need it for CUDA, and anyway GPUs aren&#x27;t exactly cheap.<p>- AMD&#x27;s drivers are of inconsistent quality, and I couldn&#x27;t buy a 6800XT even if I&#x27;m willing to sell my first-born. Ok, that&#x27;s also true for nVidia&#x27;s newest GPUs, and Zen 3, and... different rant entirely.<p>- HDR basically doesn&#x27;t work.<p>- Mixed-DPI screens basically don&#x27;t work.<p>- HiDPI in general is glitchy.<p>- kanjiTomo doesn&#x27;t work on Wayland, because there&#x27;s no solid story for the screen capture protocol.<p>- Bluetooth audio basically doesn&#x27;t work.<p>...<p>Windows isn&#x27;t perfect, but for me the Linux desktop died to a thousand paper cuts. Every two or three months I make another attempt at getting it up to the same standard I get from Windows, and every two or three months I fail.<p>Does the above sound kind of entitled? It&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m not demanding that anyone should make this work for free; I&#x27;ve never <i>paid</i> for the Linux desktop. The fact is, however, that it isn&#x27;t good enough to use without unpleasant consequences, and I&#x27;ve spent far too much of my life fiddling with it already. At this stage I just want something that doesn&#x27;t eat my evenings.')
