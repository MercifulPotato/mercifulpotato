Item(by='seba_dos1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608272542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25462917, text='&gt; Free Software is, largely, Open Source software that also respects user freedom.<p>No. Open Source software also respects user freedom. OSI definition of Open Source license is pretty much compatible with FSF definition of Free Software license. Those terms are mostly interchangeable - but the whole point is that while technically they&#x27;re similar, philosophically they point to completely different concepts.<p>&gt; Unless you are making the claim that the &quot;respects user freedom&quot; part of Free Software is so huge as to make up 90% (or some other large percentage) of the importance of &quot;Free Software&quot;... but I don&#x27;t really agree with that claim.<p>That&#x27;s the exact claim of the article you&#x27;re commenting under. And I happen to agree with that claim. User freedom is what&#x27;s important, the rest are just consequences of respecting user freedom.')
