In terms of both performance and development effort.<p>The reason? The other part of the product is an app, which is written in React Native, so this kept a similar tech stack. The server component is node, for the same reason. And the app is React Native in order to be cross-platform. We have ended up sharing very little code between the two, but using the same tech everywhere has been nice, in a small org where everyone does everything.')
