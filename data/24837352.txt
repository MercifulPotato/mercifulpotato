If you’re allocating and building multiple GASes in parallel, then it might mean you have to defrag your snapshot in a separate pass using GAS relocation. Once you put all that together, it is possible that copying is faster than rebuilding, so just be aware I’m not certain that my suggestion to build every time is a winner in your case.<p>I can also envision some other strategies that may save considerably on snapshot copies in many cases ( and may be difficult to implement :) ). If you keep going with this and would like more support or suggestions or perf tips, please feel free to get in touch via the OptiX forum (Feel free to DM me there if you like). We’d be happy to try to help you squeeze out more samples per second.')
