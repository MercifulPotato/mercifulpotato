I do not think it means what they think it means. ‘Propaganda’ implies that 60 Minutes knew some of the information was false or misleading, yet used it anyway because it supports their agenda.<p>The author presents no information to support a claim that 60 Minutes has such an agenda. Much more likely is that 60 Minutes didn’t understand the story and got it wrong. Absent evidence, to do otherwise is to claim the ability to read minds.')
