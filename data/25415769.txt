Item(by='BlargMcLarg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607944747, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25414677, text='Really really over-simplified, I feel it comes down to a combination of when it was invented and for what reason.\nWhy was Java invented? People wanted a simpler language.\nWhat do simpler languages do? Attract more people who aren&#x27;t willing to put up with a lot of hassle (e.g. memory management, garbage collection, cross-platform).\nUnfortunately, software dev back then was arguably much simpler (less requirements, less competition) and incredibly lucrative (= people less interested and without affinity come in for the money). The worst seniors I meet are generally Java one-trick ponies, incredibly knowledgeable in Java and the domain of the app, but that&#x27;s it. Despite most of these apps doing incredibly basic CRUD stuff, they tend to end up more complicated than a freaking game engine, the complete other side of the spectrum.<p>As a younger dev, it is really difficult to fight against these seniors. Most seniors that care have left, they got the whole market begging at their feet. Other seniors have given up. There&#x27;s a small number of seniors that still care, and there are layers of bureaucracy between suggesting a change, incorporating it, and seeing the results. It isn&#x27;t unheard of to have half a year pass by from the suggestion of a change to the first signs of its effect. For many a young dev, that&#x27;s half a year away from moving jobs without falling under immense scrutiny.')
