I think the first word I\nwould use to describe, before inspiring, is &quot;terrifying&quot; :),\nbut happy to hear it all worked out.<p>I was a little surprised to read this because I worked in\nthe low code Web IDE space in 2013 as well, and don&#x27;t remember webflow back then, but then when I go back through my old emails I see we exchanged ideas and motivation! Very cool. So so happy you all ended up making this a reality. We ended up taking an early exit, which was great too, but I felt guilty we didn&#x27;t solve the problem we set out to solve. Thank you for doing that!')
