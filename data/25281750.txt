That&#x27;s true. It doesn&#x27;t mention that the world relies on it because it&#x27;s reliable. It doesn&#x27;t disappear for 6 months of the year, or stop producing for 3 out of 5 days or during peak demand periods. Make renewables cheaper and more reliable and they will replace fossil fuels in a snap. Cheaper is not enough if it doesn&#x27;t do the job.')
