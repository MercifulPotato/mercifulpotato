I&#x27;ve been using PayPal to receive our Patreon balance each month and pay various project (sqlitebrowser.org) related experiences.<p>Just over a week ago, when I tried logging in to PayPal (2FA is <i>not</i> enabled) a new screen appeared saying they&#x27;d sent an SMS with code to my phone number, and I need to type it in.<p>Problem being, the phone number they displayed is <i>not</i> mine.  I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> given them my mobile number, as they&#x27;ve always had a little blurb about that saying people have to also give them permission to receive marketing messages.  Hell No.<p>So now I&#x27;m locked out of my account.  With sufficient screwing around in their help system, there is a phone number you can call:<p><pre><code>  +44 203 901 7000\n</code></pre>\nTrying to get through to a human being there however has proved an impossible task (after <i>many</i> attempts).  From just being hung up on by their system, through to being told they&#x27;re out of business hours (nope, double checked that), etc.<p>Looks like in about 51 weeks, they&#x27;ll start stealing the remaining balance until the account is empty.<p>Fucking scammers.<p>PayPal is the main reason I&#x27;m not positive on Elon Musk&#x27;s history... they&#x27;ve been &quot;known bad&quot; for many years, including when he was there.  He started his fortune from building a company that knowingly scams people. :(')
