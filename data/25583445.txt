So naturally they don&#x27;t trust it. Just like developers who do outsourcing, never do their own products because they know it&#x27;s bs, and priests usually don&#x27;t believe in God because they know dirty insides of the Church. In general, it is very hard to sell stuff if you buy into your own bs. Many otherwise great people failed for that, like Hitler - he lost because he started to believe his own propaganda.')
