Item(by='cableshaft', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608216577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444428, text='I had a really good habit last year where I went to Starbucks most mornings and wrote, and ended up writing 130,000 words last year. It dropped precipitously this year as my routine and motivation got shattered thanks to Covid-19, but I still managed about 60,000 words so far this year, most of it was me being really good about it from July through September (dropped the ball again the last couple of months).<p>I didn&#x27;t make a concerted effort to start doing this regularly until 2017, where I was writing it by hand, not just typing (I tried writing by hand a bit this year too, but it just takes so much time and gets so hard to keep up with). Before 2017, my total word count from all journals from 1998-2014 was just over 100,000 words, so it&#x27;s a bit crazy how much more well-documented my recent past couple of years have been.<p>They used to be very private, but when I started it back up again in 2017, it was with the idea that I wouldn&#x27;t be totally embarrassed if someone came across them, so there&#x27;s some self-censorship in there, and also an attempt to add context that others beside myself might need to understand things. In 2017 it was 95% to record game design ideas and things I was doing in regards to games, but by 2019 I started including more what was going on that I might want to remember that was not just game design, so it&#x27;s probably about 65-70% game design now, and the rest what&#x27;s going on in my life. And this year has pandemic stuff mixed in.<p>Just the past two months I haven&#x27;t recorded I&#x27;ve come up with like six more game ideas, developed each of them a bit, and made significant changes to some other game ideas, as well as some programming on two of my video games, so there&#x27;s a lot of catching up to do, probably at least 6,000 words worth (probably would have been &gt;15,000 words if I wrote them as it happened).')
