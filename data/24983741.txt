It&#x27;s not from the linked article.<p>&gt; &quot;10 mi &#x2F; day is absolutely abysmal for a normal thru hiker.&quot;<p>To the best of my understanding, unless he flip-flopped, he was not a thruhiker as he started in NY.\nIt is not clear either if he made his way south in a continuous footpath.<p>Moreover, even for a thru-hiker, the 10 by 10 gold standard of hiking does not apply for the majority of hikers on the A.T. It is true it is a gold standard on a well graded trails such as the PCT (well... not counting Sierra Nevada and North Washington), but it is not uncommon from what I&#x27;ve heard, even for thruhikers on the A.T to average 10-12 miles a day. Personally out of the triple crown of US hiking trails, I only thruhiked the PCT, but hiked other long trails where 15 miles&#x2F;day can be a real struggle where as on the PCT I was able to do 25&#x2F;day and sometimes more.<p>Also, it should be noted that he was found dead in Florida, which the Applachian Trail doesn&#x27;t go through. He might have attempted the Florida Trail which goes through Big Cypress NP.')
