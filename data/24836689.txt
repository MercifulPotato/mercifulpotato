Exposing a full language at compile time isn&#x27;t a difficult feature, but doing compile-time execution in a sound, safe way is not simple. For example, cross compilation becomes more of a thing. It is easy to accidentally break the type system. I don&#x27;t actually know how Zig implements comptime, but I expect given Andrew&#x27;s chops, it&#x27;s probably in a good way.<p>(And, one can argue that there are pros and cons here too, the article gets into them a bit. Doing everything this way has significant drawbacks, as well as significant pros.)<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what to say about this, except that it&#x27;s surprising that there seem to be a lack of voices about this in the Rust community. How can anyone comfortably write `unsafe` code without knowing what the rules are? Especially when the compiler is so &quot;good&quot; at depending on the &quot;rules&quot;? I don&#x27;t understand. I have pretty limited experience with unsafe, but I have written some, and was often confused about which bugs were my logic bugs and which were the compiler assuming I didn&#x27;t break some rule I didn&#x27;t know about. Combine this with a poor debugging story overall, and you have a pretty miserable experience programming.<p>There&#x27;s just not a lot to say. The exact details are being worked on. This takes time. The team isn&#x27;t going to make rules that invalidate large swaths of existing code, and has a history of making compatibility warnings with a long time before things break.<p>There is a fairly clear list of &quot;this is absolutely <i>not</i> acceptable,&quot; and a bunch of &quot;it depends...&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also just that the vast majority of people never need to reach for unsafe in the first place, so it isn&#x27;t a huge pressure on a lot of people.')
