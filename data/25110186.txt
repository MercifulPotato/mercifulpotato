Achieving 25Mpps throughput with all of those tasks to do per packet is amazing, even more with the headroom they have in resources.<p>However, I miss more discussion on how to increase the number of concurrent flows, which would be the more complex part. Even with no rules, they only can process 500k concurrent flows, which is nowhere near enough for a 100Gbps network. For reference, in 10Gbps networks we&#x27;re seeing between four and six million concurrent flows, depending on how much is that network exposed to the Internet.')
