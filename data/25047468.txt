The problem is that you&#x27;re claiming &quot;no one, not even SecureAppy can unlock or see your data&quot; which is just not true when the user uses a 4-bit&#x2F;6-bit passcode. Apple doesn&#x27;t claim that.<p>Not only should you not make a misleading security claim, I think the risk should be clearly communicated when users choose those options. The encryption may very well be sound, but it&#x27;s only as strong as the passcode.')
