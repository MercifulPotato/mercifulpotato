I love mine and have recommended them to my friends. I had the V6 for, I think 5 years, got the battery replaced twice even though the warranty had expired. The entire process was super hassle free.<p>After that I recently got the V10. What I like about it specifically is the ease of use. I can grab it off the wall and vacuum which makes me use it many times a day.<p>But to each their own of course.')
