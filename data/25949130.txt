It is set up as a margin account to allow them to trade on your behalf before the money hits your Robinhood account. But the money will be hitting, so you will have cash to cover the trade. It&#x27;s not the same as actual margin trading (where, for example, in this case, the user did not have cash to cover and so his position was liquidated by the broker.)')
