It would violate Twitter&#x27;s free speech rights to force them to do otherwise?<p>This is an ancient argument and Twitter neither &quot;banned a whole side of the political spectrum&quot; (the asshole Trumpian wing is hardly all of conservatism) nor did anything new to US history.<p>The reason Trump is pushing for the &quot;public square&quot; aspect is because in a decentralized world, his crowd would still be pushed to the fringes <i>because it&#x27;s expressing fringe (but loud) views</i>. 90 out of 100 forums would have issues with him. So instead, he wants to have access on his terms.')
