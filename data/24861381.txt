I just wanted a medium where your site and it&#x27;s art work would bubble up on occasion since I&#x27;m not always buying artwork. I think IG is perfect considering you just share art work. Perhaps promoting the IG channel more on the website would help?<p>A mailing list is nice because you&#x27;re actually collecting emails and can use them somehow in the future. You could collect emails and then send users a welcome email that also promotes your IG channel. It just wasn&#x27;t obvious you have an IG channel. Hopefully this is helpful.')
