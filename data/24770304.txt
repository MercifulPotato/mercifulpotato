It apparently is not good enough for the main screen.<p>The thing is that scaling works just fine if all your displays use the same one. Two 4k screens -&gt; awesome. Two fhd screen -&gt; works just fine. It is only the combination of one hires and one lowres screen that is problematic.<p>So my maybe naive take away is that if you care that your main screen is 4k, then no your old screen is not good enough. And if you think it was good enough, then why did you feel the need to upgrade your main screen?')
