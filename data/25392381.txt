Just because he doesn&#x27;t have the letters doesn&#x27;t mean he isn&#x27;t deploying the knowledge and approach of an MBA.<p>His companies have successfully deployed plenty of MBA-style strategies and their &quot;creative&quot; financing&#x2F;PR indicates this. I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the premise of his argument (I actually agree to an extent) but using his public voice to downplay the expertise of a large group of people is... odd. Fundamentally, his businesses have plenty of weak spots and maybe criticizing the credentials of those who criticize his businesses is a valid strategy?')
