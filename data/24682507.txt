The dark grey and orange skies would all come out looking blue or something. It&#x27;s like the &#x27;camera&#x27; is telling me I&#x27;m f&#x27;ing crazy for taking a picture of smoky skies, and surely I want to pretend the smoke isn&#x27;t there at all! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m taking a picture right? So I can pretend that reality isn&#x27;t real. I have no photos that match the smoke. I have only my memory and other people&#x27;s photos. WTF.</i><p>That&#x27;s automatic white balance adjustment. It&#x27;s not used to an orange sky, so it can&#x27;t figure out what color should be considered &quot;white&quot;. If you want an example of why this is important, turn off automatic WB and take a photo under fluorescent light followed by a photo lit by candles.<p>I have no idea about Android phones, but iPhones do some amount of denoise, contrast adjustment, and a few other limited postprocessing steps automatically.')
