They&#x27;re debugging, source control, static analysis, test runners, profiling tools, database tools, etc.<p>Secondly, the state of LSP clients is a long way from matching Visual Studio or Intellij. When LSP is competitive with the major IDEs, I&#x27;ll happily switch, but I don&#x27;t see that in the next 5 years at least. As an example, try opening UE4 using any of the LSP implementations.')
