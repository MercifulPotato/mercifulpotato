Item(by='pinky1417', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609852092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635658, text='One of CPI&#x27;s big limitations is that it only considers consumer goods and services (the &quot;consumer&quot; part of &quot;consumer price index&quot;). But &quot;consumers&quot; themselves spend a good deal of money on other things, namely health, education, and housing. SlateStarCodex had an article about that: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;considerations-on-cost-disease&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;09&#x2F;considerations-on-cost...</a><p>Do I think those who stay wealthy in real terms are able to do so via &quot;what amounts to fraud?&quot; No. Nor do I buy your 15-20% hurdle assertion: if your annual salary of say $100,000 was worth just 10% less each year (as in, real inflation of 15% minus 5% worth of nominal income growth, a generous income growth assumption) $100,000, over just five years, it would be worth the equivalent of ~$60,000 in year 0. It seems like a stretch to suggest that everybody but the rich are seeing their real incomes almost sliced in half every five years. Use the 20% number or a more conservative assumption for income growth and the numbers start to square even less with reality.')
