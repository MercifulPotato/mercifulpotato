Cool.  Glad you agree!<p>&gt; ignoring the fact that EPIC are buying their way into the market. Which is very important thing to consider.<p>Cheaper is cheaper.  Thats all that I care about.  I care about the end result of lower fees.<p>&gt; it is not representative of the whole.<p>It is representative of Apple actions unfairly causing prices to be higher for this specific competitor is being kept out though!<p>All I need is a single example, to show that Apple&#x27;s actions have prevented a lower priced option from competing.<p>&gt; Once they wedge themselves in it will raise their take I would wager.<p>Even so, that still means that prices are lower for this previous period of time!  Thats still lower pricing, for a period of time.<p>&gt; The company will pocket the cash. You are living in fantasy land if you think anything else.<p>Even if we agree that this is the case, I would still prefer this to Apple receiving any of the money.<p>I would still rather the game companies receive all of the money, even if they pocketed it, because I want more money to go to game devs, and less to go to Apple.<p>&gt; Apple deserve the money because the devs agreed to put their software on their store<p>Nope!  Because their actions are illegally anti-competitive, and Apple has significant market power.<p>Regardless if game devs agreed to the contract, the contract can still be illegally anti-competitive.  And the law can be used against Apple on that.<p>And even further more, I still want any and all actions to be taken, through whatever means possible, whether they be through the existing laws&#x2F;court system, or that is through changing the law to retroactively target Apple and its employees, or if it through game devs working together to oppose apple, so as to make the game companies get more of the money, and for Apple to receive less of it, no matter how it happens.')
