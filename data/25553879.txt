You have to be evaluated by a committee of people who&#x27;re indifferent to your manager, aren&#x27;t under the gun to fill a slot and are less likely to be swayed by a one-time positive conversation.<p>Do you think this process came out of nowhere? That&#x27;s just one example of them settling on something that worked, I am sure having previously tried other less structured approaches and tracking the results.')
