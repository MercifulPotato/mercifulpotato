I can see the case for EULA around virtualization when you&#x27;re running multiple instances of macOS.

Could Apple really put up a good case in court?<p>It seems unlikely that they could successfully sue me if I buy a bunch of Macs and give some people physical time-limited access (say, students in a classroom).
