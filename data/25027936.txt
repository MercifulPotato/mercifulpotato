So when you walk into your local phone shop pick out a nice shiny handset and decide on a monthly plan (because you can&#x27;t afford 800 quid plus to buy it outright) you&#x27;ll be signing a credit agreement. It&#x27;s the underlying finance company that this app is aimed at, not the retailer or the telco. Until that 24-48 month plan is paid up you don&#x27;t own the phone, the finance company does.<p>This is why I buy my handsets outright, not locked to a carrier (and also because of recent financial bad luck my credit rating is a total dumpster fire).')
