Now if the CFR was 50% and you had 0&#x2F;10, maybe it&#x27;d be worth looking into it.<p>I&#x27;m curious though, have any of your friends had longer term effects? longer term smell&#x2F;taste loss, brain fog, heart issues, memory issues, breathing issues, etc? The early reports on long term impact are at ~10-20%, so you may have 1 or 2 in your sample, but again your sample is small enough that you very easily could&#x27;ve had 0 too. Again, it depends heavily on what you&#x27;re trying to disprove and what the rate of it is.')
