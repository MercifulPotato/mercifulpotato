So what?<p>I think that you should look up what trauma and dysfunctional early setup does with kids. Because it can be very hard on caregiver and test all their abilities including self control. The adoption agencies themselves are quite open about these issues - they do not want people to adopt and then be unable to handle things.<p>Which are all euphemisms mind you. Basically, there are issues with violence, inability to create relationship or even inability that relationship can be &quot;true&quot;. Which causes whole other bunch of behavioral problems. Like, the eagerness to &quot;test&quot; caregiver by really going out of way to create trouble. And if caregiver fails, result is basically abuse. And the kid can&#x27;t help itself, but adults should.<p>And adults when they see they don&#x27;t have time and resources and patience to deal with above, do better to adopt baby.<p>&gt; People are willing to take classes and things and learn, are they not? It just isn&#x27;t the same as babies.<p>What did that even means?')
