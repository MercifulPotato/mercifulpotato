I think it would be better if employees could choose to accept more risk in the form of profit sharing in place of salary, but it’s not typically on the table, even at a startup.<p>Second, the point here is that PG is misapprehending (or deliberately obfuscating) what people mean by “exploitation.”<p>When Marxists talk about exploitation what they mean is that employees (workers) are not paid the full value of their labor. This is usually explained away with “risk profile” by capitalists, as you did above, but most employees don’t have a choice to accept a higher risk profile in return for getting paid the full value of what they produce.')
