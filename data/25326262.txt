Docker (the company) made some poor decisions that led to their troubles.  I&#x27;m not here to crap on docker, but they quit investing in and moving their tool forward because they were focused on the EE offering.  This opened the door for &quot;competitors&quot; to do the things docker wasn&#x27;t doing (daemonless, rootless, cgroups v2, just a few).  They also did things that scared people, like the whole &quot;moby&quot; rename thing.  It made people worried that (fairly or not) Docker the company didn&#x27;t have the best intentions for the open source version.  They had poor direction on product. \n They would routinely refuse nice features that people wanted (many that included PRs) for things with terse, unkind &quot;do not want&quot; rejections, and then 6 months later they would end up adding it anyway.  Some of these were suspected to be refused so as not to allow open source docker to compete with EE feature sets.  docker-compose was the worst at this (To be fair I think it was mostly one very loud&#x2F;very powerful person wrt docker-compose).<p>Docker started the race way ahead of everyone.  To this day people still use the name &quot;docker&quot; to generically refer to containers.<p>Anyway, my point is not to crap on docker, just to say that in my opinion, in so many areas important to an open source leader, they made decisions that undermined their long term outlook.')
