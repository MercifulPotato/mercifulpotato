Gitflow is a workflow. What do you believe it&#x27;s supposed to be? It&#x27;s irrelevant how you see commit histories, because with regards to the master&#x2F;mainline branch it&#x27;s always linear, isn&#x27;t it?<p>What do you personally believe gitflow is?<p>&gt; Quoting the original git-flow post:<p>I don&#x27;t know what you expected to show, but you are only describing a workflow. Changes are made in dedicated branches, and later these changes are merged back into the master&#x2F;mainline branch in a single commit, which is expected to have been validated and tested and working. That&#x27;s a workflow. How the log ends up looking is entirely indifernet or irrelevant, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Again, what do you personally believe is the whole point of a workflow like git flow, specially in light of allowing large teams to continuously integrate their work ? I mean, what do you believe is the whole point of getting devs to work on branches independent of what changes go into master&#x2F;mainline, and leave merging as a last step that&#x27;s the responsibility of the developer prposing a change?')
