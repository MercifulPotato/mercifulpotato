You just need to start with a slow, not very optimized, implementation, which CPython pretty much is.<p>As for 5x, Javascript has had much more than speed bump than that with its JITs (compared to the interpreted Javascript pre-JSCore, Tracemonkey and V8 circa 1997-2005) and it&#x27;s just as dynamic as Python...<p>&gt;<i>There are other lower hanging fruits, like optimizing core data structures (e.g: the implementation of python dicts).</i><p>Funny that you should mention it, because the author of the proposal has already done significant work (available since Python 3.3. or so) optimizing the dicts...')
