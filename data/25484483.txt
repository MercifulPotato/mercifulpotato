One of the defining traits of an introvert is avoiding conflict. Thus, no, introverts don&#x27;t INHERENTLY make good leaders. If you&#x27;ve ever dealt with even a moderately diverse group of individuals due to their capabilities (not in the sense of level of skill, but range of skills), you&#x27;d know that the motivations of individuals vary wildly. Even if they are similar, they&#x27;re oddly unique in their own ways at their own times. Regardless of your unicorn-fart fantasies, extrovert personalities are better equipped to handle groups with varying motivations to achieve the same goal. Not to say introverts can&#x27;t be good or even great leaders. To name one, Eisenhower was an introvert and he is regarded as one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century for a multitude of reasons. Leadership takes intent and purposeful practice&#x2F;training for them to achieve. The absolution concept that they&#x27;re the &quot;best&quot; just means you&#x27;ve never been in even a mild range of real world team projects. You would have seen many easily fall apart in the midst of dealing with somewhat strenuous situations. It&#x27;s an easier absolution that extroverts make the best leaders, yet even that is untrue. It just takes extroverts less practice to achieve &quot;great&quot; than it does for introverts since they already possess a lot of the skill sets that introverts are lacking. Ultimately, leaders are made, not born.')
