Google will keep funding it just to say they dont have a monopoly in browser market. But it will continue its path towards irrelevant by mainstream usage. They will continue to shrink the engineering as budgets are cut. Until no more silly 20% project and management goals that drains resources ( they wont have that luxury anymore ).<p>And someday Firefox will require a reboot, not its code base but from a management perspective.<p>From a user point view, Firefox will stay pretty much the same for another 5 - 6 years at least. Both the Browsers and its Cooperation. There are still quite few improvement coming from Rust Servo in the pipeline. So technically it should be competitive enough.<p>- From someone who has been watching &#x2F; following Firefox since before its birth.')
