It was quiet, empty, you got offered a drink, etc. If it was a long layover, sleeping was likely an option, and with the attendant there you could ask them to wake you up if there was an issue with the flight. But, theoreticals; flying first class is 3-6x as expensive and I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth it.')
