The renewables industry likes to downplay the sheer volume of fossil fuels required to manufacture the parts. The energy ROI on this is quite poor, and in many cases, we would have been better off skipping the intermediate step and burning the oil and gas directly.<p>I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re referring to Ferroni and Hopkirk (2016) which claimed ERORI of ~0.8-1.7.<p>You should be aware that their work has been pretty thoroughly picked apart - the rebuttal produced immediately after the above, by 27 international scholars, suggests a ERORI of 7-8. It has likely improved since that time.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0301421516307066" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S030142151...</a>')
