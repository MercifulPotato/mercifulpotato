I learned a new word - &quot;hyperlexia&quot; - which I now think applied to me in some form when I was very young.  It&#x27;s been interesting reading about it.  I picked up reading when I was very young, much faster and earlier than people expected, and reading things people thought a young child wouldn&#x27;t be able to.<p>I don&#x27;t remember it being a problem, just unusual.<p>But now I think about it, as an older adult I don&#x27;t just enjoy reading, I&#x27;m addicted to reading, to the extent it stops me getting as much work or other things done as I&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s strange to admit that, but it&#x27;s true.<p>It&#x27;s intriguing to consider that might have roots in a neurological structure associated with what is now a named disorder, rather than just a habit.<p>Though I wouldn&#x27;t say I remember lacking comprehension skills, perhaps I did have some aspect of that when I was very young, it&#x27;s hard to be sure.  I completely lacked the ability to write creatively though (stories etc), until about age 13 when a single insight while stuck transformed that from 0% to 100% in moments.')
