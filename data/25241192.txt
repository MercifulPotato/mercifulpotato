Personally I think that we as a society impose on a lot of people for a lot of things and a lot of it is wrong.<p>I like the principal of imposing on others as little as possible, preferably not at all. Otherwise there&#x27;s nothing to stop the more powerful majority from screwing over the less powerful minority at some point.<p>Some examples: Drug laws to imprison african-americans, zoning laws to keep the poor out, voting for taxes on others for charitable causes, blue laws, corporate monopolies, the environment and the tragedy of the commons, making it illegal for the homeless to sleep, algorithms and bureaucracy imposed on others, punishing non-conformity, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought the principal of not imposing on others is a good idea. I thought it would make a great amendment to the constitution. With this principal to limit the tyranny of the majority, and the manipulated or fickle masses, we could still tackle all of societies problems, and filter out a lot of abuses along the way.<p>But lately I&#x27;m thinking that this just seems to be impractical. It seems that too many individuals, groups, corporations, and leaders want to impose on others. They are selfish and want the world to be as they say and they don&#x27;t care so much about who has to pay or suffer for it.<p>I wish this got talked about more. I assume we all have in common that we don&#x27;t want to be imposed upon by others.')
