It can <i>induce</i> racism, but cannot be racist in itself. Facts are scientific, and science is not political.<p>&gt; More crime than who?<p>Of non-Aboriginal people.<p>&gt; Or, More crime than all other groups with the same economic opportunities?<p>Maybe or maybe not. That is beside the point. If you compare incarceration rates of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people you have already decided that that is the division of the population you want to reason about. You cannot argue that the reason group A has higher incarceration rates of group B is because of racism, and when someone else proposes crime rates as an explanation, suddenly you switch to different population subdivisions: by economic opportunities, by health issues, etc.<p>The question about incarceration is: are Aboriginals more likely to be incarcerated <i>for the same crimes</i> than non-Aboriginals?')
