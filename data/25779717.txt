Item(by='freedomben', descendants=None, kids=[25780171, 25780005], score=None, time=1610647338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25777431, text='Thanks, I&#x27;m not GP but have the same questions.<p>What about access control?  That&#x27;s often directly tied into business logic, but it&#x27;s so elegant and convenient to do it in the controllers or even the router using the pipelines.  In fact a ton of the examples (I think even the Chris McCord Phoenix book) does exactly this, presumably for that reason.<p>However I did that with an app and haven&#x27;t been very happy with it because while the bulk can easily be done in the router&#x2F;controllers, there are things that are totally inappropriate to do there and so it ends up in the context.  Then your logic is distributed and messy, which is awful.  But putting <i>all</i> access control in the context also bloats and complicates a ton of otherwise very clean, elegant API functions.  I try to keep the Repo query building code clean and separate but that often leads to inefficiencies (such as filtering fields in the caller instead of in the generated SQL, which is vastly preferred for obvious reasons).<p>Anyway, interested in thoughts on that.')
