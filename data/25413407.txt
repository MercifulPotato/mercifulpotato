In these games you try to predict the best opponent move responding to yours, the worst case basically, and then try to find the best response you have to it, and so on, until you cannot spend any more time on that line or reach your horizon. You are not &quot;hoping things do not happen&quot;. If you did that, you would be a bad chess or go player. You make sure things do not happen.<p>So that analogy works against your point.')
