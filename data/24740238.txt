Not sure if the YC path that pg promotes in this article fits that.<p>(I&#x27;m thinking about this a lot lately because my company is currently at this crossroads. We raised a little, turned that into profitable growth, but we could raise more to grow faster.)<p>EDIT: meta-level comment: it&#x27;s kind of weird how we managed to create a world where nearly everybody has a boss. CEOs answer to the board, who answer to shareholders, who work at investment funds that have bosses and shareholders and LPs of their own, and down the rabbit hole it goes. I wonder if there&#x27;s any general way out of this, different from &quot;bootstrap a SaaS&quot; which is a little specific to be good general advice.')
