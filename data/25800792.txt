People using these services largely want them to be a transparent layer between them and the thing they&#x27;re trying to access. Basically the person is there to provide the same access a sighted&#x2F;hearing person would have. If they form a relationship with the person helping them, they may be less inclined to read sensitive documents. Additionally this gives the helpers a more clear window into the life of another person (which can be used nefariously) rather than, more often, bits and pieces without context.')
