There are only two types of companies that do this though: companies where they&#x27;re working at such a scale that spending a few extra months to years of developer time doesn&#x27;t make a dent compared to the BOM savings. You&#x27;re more likely to get vendor support by name recognition at these kinds of companies, so it&#x27;s not as bad as the hobbyist experience. The second kind is where either the project or the company can&#x27;t afford the capital outlay for better documented chips (or support packages). Stay the heck away from these if you value your sanity or know your own worth.')
