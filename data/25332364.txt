Since this is pretty general support library code, the result of this philosophy is defensive checks in all support functions and that means checks every spinlock, mutex&#x2F;semaphore, and god knows how many other places... everything really.  We also would want these checks at multiple levels since we shouldn’t trust that other people checked things.  This would have a significant effect on performance and many would prefer their system not to run however-many percent slower.  All to avoid a possible issue that can’t be very large or systems would be kernel panic’ing all over the place.<p>From a black box, zero-knowledge, perspective it’s maybe worth remembering that code  built this way successfully runs mission critical systems all over the world every day.  Thoughtful people would have switched to other (slower, more pedantic) systems if doing things differently was a real overall life improvement.  People have had the choice, there are plenty of OS’s out there... some far more formal&#x2F;pedantic.  Linux wasn’t the safe choice back in the day, it was just better by several important metrics consistently over time.<p>Perhaps these insanely experienced kernel devs know what they are doing.')
