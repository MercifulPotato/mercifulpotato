We were looking for cars back in February, and one thing I noticed is that many of the new cars did not come with navigation.  When I asked why the dealer told me everyone just wants CarPlay because they use Google Maps on their phone.  That made sense to me, since I too did not want to pay for navigation since I just use Google Maps via CarPlay.')
