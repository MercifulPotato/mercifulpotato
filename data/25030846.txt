I&#x27;d start by generating arithmetic from your AST. Then focus on getting a simple function to compile. Don&#x27;t worry if this requires a lot of hard coding. Once you get to the harder concepts like closures, consider making a secondary IR that simplifies code gen. I have a typed AST representation that desugars various concepts like  first class functions, destructuring, etc.<p>I&#x27;m actually compiling to WebAssembly but it&#x27;s the same principles')
