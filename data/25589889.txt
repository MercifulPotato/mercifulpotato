(like you said).<p>My side project in the past have always been good (sarcasm), but it&#x27;s the marketing &#x2F; advertising side that I always seem to fail at miserably. When that fails, then the project seems to dry up and I move on to the next half idea.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly how to market something like this, but I like the idea if that matters. Maybe something in the way of talking to a marketing person to find new avenues to drive traffic?<p>Your website loads fine in my mind, it might be slow but I didn&#x27;t notice until someone said something. I was able to quickly see your value prop. Website speed can be fixed, the key is your product is interesting.<p>Best of luck!')
