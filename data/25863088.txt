Reading this bit about Gary definitely made me wonder about the tradeoffs you describe.<p>The experience also has me strategizing on our next move. I&#x27;m applying the Lean mindset and focusing on the feedback we got from paying customers: &quot;longer and more songs&quot;, &quot;loved the clear crisp audio&quot;, &quot;you played X, it&#x27;s my favourite&quot;. We&#x27;re doing a St. Patrick&#x27;s day album next which is focusing on those pillars. I also may have splurged and commissioned an album cover off Fiverr.')
