If I feel tired, then it&#x27;s in my and my employers&#x27; best interest for me to nap since I will be much more productive for the next few hours.<p>I&#x27;ve tested this also by not sleeping, and my code becomes worse and I need to rewrite a lot of it anyway.<p>In fairness, I do try to go to bed on time, but my issue is that I sometimes only sleep 5 to 6 hours. My body just won&#x27;t sleep, so I make up for it during work time.<p>It is what it is.')
