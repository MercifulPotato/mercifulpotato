Using my phone means I can&#x27;t (easily) use my condenser mic and pro headphones like I do with my laptop.<p>2. Rights&#x2F;Distribution: I currently have 100% ownership over the content I create and I can choose where to distribute it because I have the raw files. Your terms seem on the face to be amenable to me being able to pick up and move my content. I&#x27;ll be interested to see if you make the content I send through you available for me to download - or if it&#x27;s required for me to (somehow) also make a recording of my own , which might cause trouble later.<p>I&#x27;m excited for this and think it could be big, and understand it&#x27;s an MVP right now, so plenty to come just a couple things to think about.<p>Awesome!')
