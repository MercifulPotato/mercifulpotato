Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609163662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25555122, text='&gt; I had a similar experience in Japan last year when I learned the same family has ruled for something like 1500 years and trace their history back 2600 years.<p>Indonedia, Turkey and Egypt are next for you if you want your mind blown; the monolithic structures there are way older and far more intricate than a cup and are going back +10,000 years: Gunung Padang, Gobekli Tepe and possibly some of the older Egyptian Pyramids if you follow modern archeological studies on time periods that depict water erosion from rain in the Nile.<p>Graham Hancock&#x27;s work is what confirmed my innate intuition that Agriculture has to be older than the claimed ~10,000 years as it is just to complex of a technology and a Scientific discipline to not be: these monoliths are a testament of Human ingenuity as that complex level of division of labour and highly specialized engineering, infrastructure and planning are only possible because of surpluses of food and water in civilization. Everyone I know that&#x27;s been there dismisses the propaganda that the pyramids were &#x27;built by slaves&#x27; as it falls flat on its face when they see the level of intricacy and precision required to build a symmetrical pyramid with no variation its construction, its baffling to me that for all of our amazing technology we struggle to come close to this day using modern tools and equipment and probably can&#x27;t make something similar from those materials. And yet there it is a monolith that stood the test of time and is only a dull glimmer of what it was in it&#x27;s peak when Egypt served as the beacon for Human knowledge but also serves as a reminder of what we&#x27;re capable of when we collectively apply ourselves to an endeavor that defies all possible expectations of what is&#x2F;was thought to be possible. And we still haven&#x27;t excavated most of what is at Gunung Padang as it goes down very deep and is only visualized through radar.<p>I&#x27;ve never been myself, but I hope to go to all 3.')
