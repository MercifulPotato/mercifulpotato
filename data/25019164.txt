Both sides being problematic also doesn&#x27;t imply that one side isn&#x27;t more problematic than the other.<p>I think it&#x27;s crazy that so many people voted for Trump and honestly believe he&#x27;s the best person to run the country. I&#x27;d have a hard time respecting someone who didn&#x27;t see how bad Trump was in a lot of ways. But I think most people on the left seem to have no idea why <i>anybody</i> would vote for Trump, and don&#x27;t realize that is more of an indictment of the extent they are out of touch with 49% of the country, rather than an indication of the idiocy of their political opponents.<p>An effective rejection of Trumpism must first involve understanding and relating to the people who supported him, and I think a lot of people are lamenting the general lack of interest in such discourse.<p>Edit: fixed two words which drastically changed the meaning of sentence.')
