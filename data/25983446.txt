I ordered one in October, but won&#x27;t get it until August. I do enjoy these old retro computers and some games.<p>I find most of the original games to be unbearable (I didn&#x27;t play games during that era so there isn&#x27;t even nostalgia for me), but the new games people are building for the Spectrum and Commodore 64 are fun and a bit more modern in some respects. Ex: I recently bought Attack of the Petscii Robots and the graphics&#x2F;music&#x2F;gameplay&#x2F;manual... everything is great. They&#x27;re also more amenable to the very limited time I have in adulthood. I doubt I&#x27;ll play another MMO until I retire.')
