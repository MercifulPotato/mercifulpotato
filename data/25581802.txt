It smooths out motion.<p>The “dog” jumping with too much hang time would be explained by this.<p>This was sometimes done in 90s music videos. See the first 20 seconds of the Beastie Boys “So What’Cha Want” video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ru3gH27Fn6E" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ru3gH27Fn6E</a> In that video, I believe the Beastie Boys were lip syncing to a much faster version of the song, then the video was slowed down so it matched the normal tempo of So “What’Cha Want”. (Another example is Len’s “Steal My Sunshine” video.)<p>I think the same thing was done in the Boston Dynamics dancing video. I haven’t measured the hang time of that dog, but it doesn’t look like it’s in Earth’s gravity.')
