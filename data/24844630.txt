What if they go bankrupt? What if they are malicious and disappear with my money?<p>You don&#x27;t have to trust the stock broker. If they go bankrupt or steal your money, you&#x27;ll get it back through SIPC insurance (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sipc.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sipc.org&#x2F;</a>)<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t trust corporate executives to have my best interests.<p>You don&#x27;t have to trust corporate executives to have your best interests at heart, only that they have their own best interests at heart: corporations pay executives with stocks and stock options, thus aligning incentives between executives and shareholders.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t trust corporation revenue numbers because they are inflated by artificial currency supply and manipulation (e.g. corporations feeding off of debt-fueled shell companies to generate fake revenue).<p>You don&#x27;t have to take corporate revenue numbers on trust,  since they are audited.
