Privacy loss is often irreversible.<p>You&#x27;re not wrong, but on the other hand has &quot;the market&quot; shown any serious signal that it cares about privacy? From what I can see people seem more than glad to trade privacy and personal information for free services and cheaper hardware. Take Samsung putting ads on their &quot;smart&quot; TV&#x27;s UI and screenshotting what people are watching for profiling, that&#x27;s been known for a while now. The market seems fine with it.<p>And I mean, at this point I could just gesture broadly at all of Facebook.')
