The TCP implementation is betting that data will be sent shortly and will make it unnecessary to send a lone ACK. Every time a delayed ACK is actually sent, that bet was lost. The TCP spec allows an implementation to lose that bet every time without turning off delayed ACKs. Properly, delayed ACKs should only turn on when a few unnecessary ACKs that could have been piggybacked have been sent in a row, and any time a delayed ACK is actually sent, delayed ACKs should be turned off again. There should have been a counter for this.')
