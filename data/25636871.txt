People have died because they haven&#x27;t gotten heart surgeries. If someone comes in for getting their wisdom teeth out, and tests positive for CoV2, they&#x27;re listed as a COVID case, even if they have zero symptoms (and with 40+ PCR amplifications for each test, the false positives are high).<p>Hospitals are over-crowded ever year in the winter for all kinds of seasonal illnesses including flu, strep and others. The Bakersfield doctors said as much back in March and were censored on all platforms for it. They&#x27;re also overcrowded because America&#x27;s health system is just bad as expanding care for bad seasons in general, and we haven&#x27;t really noticed until this crisis.')
