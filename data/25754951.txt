The US has proven to the entire world that people can&#x27;t be trusted to act civilised and honestly discuss issues, and that lack of trust extends from the highest levels of government down to the average citizen.<p>That&#x27;s not to say I am advocating the suppression of speech. All people should be free to speak about corruption and misinformation. But the last twelve months or so have, at least to me, shown that most people would rather burn the public square to the ground than speak of corruption and misinformation. And it does make me wonder what elections would be like in all countries if, at least for the campaign and election period, sites like Twitter were just outright banned.')
