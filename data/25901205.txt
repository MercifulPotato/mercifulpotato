Or better than states that have extensive lockdowns like New York, New Jersey and California...<p>&gt; Political reasons ... aggressive lockdowns in Australia<p>Locking down a small country like Australia is much different than locking down a country like the US. Australia is only 20% smaller than the US yet has 10% of the population. The layout is different. Temperature. Density. etc.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indexmundi.com&#x2F;factbook&#x2F;compare&#x2F;united-states.australia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indexmundi.com&#x2F;factbook&#x2F;compare&#x2F;united-states.au...</a><p>Locking down Australia would be like locking down one of our less densely populated states - not only does the President not have the ability to do it - he&#x27;s a President not a King... but locking down the country make zero sense for a virus with a 99%+ survival rate.<p>again... we can take precautions to protect our hospitals and to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; (which we are loooooong past) and to protect the vulnerable (old, existing conditions, etc)... but locking down America? Coast to coast? No chance this side of turning the President into a Dictator - which was never on the table for Trump and definitely not for Biden.')
