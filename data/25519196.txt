It&#x27;s saying by allocating ~500k vaccines (or as few as ~100k), we can raise $50 billion dollars, and show people that other &quot;influential&quot; people see the vaccine not only as safe, but as something that should be sought after. In the grand scheme of things, that represents a very small portion of the total supply, and hence I&#x27;d argue the upside ($50B + more people getting the vaccine) would be worth it.')
