Without some kind of affirmative action <i>somewhere</i> in the system we are just perpetuating old power and money dynamics extant since the founding of the country, if not before.<p>As a person in the discriminated against group of the DOJ complaint, I am against the DOJ motion. I agree Yale probably violated the law, but I don&#x27;t view AA as inherently immoral.<p>Downvote time: my solution for Yale to serve the least empowered historically groups in this country, descendants of slaves and equally disempowered groups through generationally unfair&#x2F;racist laws (e.g. interment camps, 3&#x2F;5 compromise, Jim Crow, red lining, etc) is to say if you can trace your family history to any of these events, you get a boost. Same effect, not race based.')
