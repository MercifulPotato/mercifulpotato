If this is done with a GET request (to get the manifest as a first step towards pulling layers), it counts towards the rate limiting.<p>&gt; <i>Has this mentality not continued into the Docker era? It seems pretty easy to set up [0] and has all kinds of advantages even without the upcoming limit.</i><p>Maven separates the domain of a Maven repository from the coordinates of packages. Docker does not. Dockerhub&#x27;s domain is inferred into any shorthand reference like `foo&#x2F;bar`, meaning that it will ignore a pull-through cache.<p>You can ostensibly configure a docker daemon to treat another registry as a trusted mirror, but it&#x27;s harder than it looks in practice, because on most production systems that won&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t) be enabled.')
