Either everyone uses steroids or they&#x27;re completely banned - there&#x27;s no middle ground.<p>In the jargon of game theory, in the absence of a ban, everyone doping is the only strong Nash equilibrium.<p>The fear is gene edited babies would trigger the same effect: If I&#x27;m in my country&#x27;s richest 3% and I know parents in the richest 2% are gene-editing their children to be healthier&#x2F;smarter&#x2F;prettier, can I afford not to do the same?<p>And we can&#x27;t rely on national governments to provide bans - if I&#x27;m Country A&#x27;s leader, can I afford to ban gene editing if our rival, Country B, is making full use of it?')
