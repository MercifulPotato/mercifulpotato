But, I also know that even a beginner WPF tutorial shows how to arbitrarily adjust controls with a resource dictionary.  Meanwhile, I don&#x27;t recall <i>ever</i> learning how to change the color of a win32&#x2F;c++ button short of taking over the entire drawing responsibility (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible but that&#x27;s beside the point).  So as a result of that emphasis, it seems to me a <i>lot</i> more WPF&#x2F;UWP apps use arbitrary non-standard colors&#x2F;fonts&#x2F;highlights&#x2F;animations, which would be completely at odds with user-selected themes.  I know mine did, anyway, so I guess I was part of the problem!')
