Hawking radiation is not charged, but it also turns out that there is a maximum amount of charge a black hole of a given mass can have, and the lower the mass the lower the maximum allowed charge.<p>So it would seem that a charged black hole would evaporate by Hawking radiation until it reached the point where any further mass loss would put it over the charge limit. Physicists donâ€™t think it is then simply going to stop radiating, and so what happens then is I believe still quite open.<p>There was an article in Quanta a few months ago on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;black-hole-paradoxes-reveal-a-fundamental-link-between-energy-and-order-20200528&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;black-hole-paradoxes-reveal-a...</a>')
