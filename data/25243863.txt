The other half is lowering needs. This is already how I managed to save most of my pay each month, but the older I get, the more extreme I take it. Not only does it ensure my stash will last as long as it needs, but I acquire lot of new skills on the way (by learning how to build rather than buying). Oh, and I don&#x27;t have a family, it probably helps a lot.')
