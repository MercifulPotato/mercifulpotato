Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609771896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25626352, text='&quot;Gyro&quot; is pronounced just like it&#x27;s spelled, since it&#x27;s an English word. There is no word &quot;gyro&quot; in Greek.<p>There is a Greek word γύρος, transliterated &quot;gyros&quot;. In Greece there are several pronunciations, including &quot;zhee-rohs&quot;, &quot;gee-ros&quot;, and &quot;yee-rohs&quot;, though the latter is preferred. Either way, the last syllable includes a long O and an S, roughly rhyming with &quot;dose&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a singular noun, with the Greek &quot;-os&quot; ending similar to the &quot;-us&quot; ending in Latin. The plural is  γύροι, &quot;gyroi&quot;, though that word hasn&#x27;t really been imported into English. Under the English rules, the plural of &quot;gyros&quot; would be &quot;gyros&quot;, though a case could be made for &quot;gyroses&quot; (and Google turns up a few uses of that word).<p>There&#x27;s no good justification for &quot;yee-roh&quot;. Of course English pronunciation doesn&#x27;t require justification, and no such thing as &quot;correct pronunciation&quot; of any word beyond what people understand. Any restaurant will give you meat on a pita when you order a &quot;yee-roh&quot;. But if the owner is Greek, they&#x27;ll be quietly rolling their eyes.')
