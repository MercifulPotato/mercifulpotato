However I have also witnessed enough suffering in not just India but also in the US to not buy into the &quot;safest wealthiest longest life expectancy&quot; era. Averages can lie and here I think they lie real bad indeed. I don&#x27;t believe that The majority of the people today in India and Us are better off today than they were say in the eighties. If you include all other countries sure the average might look positive; but my working hypothesis is that this just a metric that&#x27;s lagging behind trigger events that have already been set in motion. With the erosion of fact-based argumentation and the invasion of climate change induced instability I don&#x27;t think the world is rosy by any measure compared to what my parents grew up in.<p>Given that I am not someone who can&#x27;t make a difference, my argument is that I should try my level best to make a difference, which is what you are sounding like you are suggesting as well.')
