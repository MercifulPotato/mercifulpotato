Item(by='djur', descendants=None, kids=[25703555], score=None, time=1610216210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25701074, text='Mato&#x27;s translation comparison doesn&#x27;t cover this line, so I can&#x27;t easily link to the full context, but this is a young girl (Rydia) scolding an older man (Edward&#x2F;Gilbert) for being too overcome with grief to take action. In the original US translation, the dialogue is &quot;Crybaby! You are a man! You are a grown-up! You are not the only one who has lost loved ones!&quot; The more literal translation would be &quot;Aren&#x27;t you a man?&quot; but the meaning is the same.<p>&quot;Brother&quot; seems to be coming into it because Rydia is addressing Edward as &quot;o-nii-chan&quot;. Pretty classic example of something that you couldn&#x27;t translate accurately without knowing who the characters are.')
