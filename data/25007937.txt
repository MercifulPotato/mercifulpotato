I&#x27;m not conversant enough in the jq query language to not have to look things up when writing even somewhat complex scripts. And I don&#x27;t want to learn awscli&#x27;s custom query syntax. :)<p>Thought at first that it might be possible to replicate gron&#x27;s functionality by some magic composition of jq, xargs, and grep, but that was before I understood the full awesomeness of gron - piping through grep, sed maintains gron context so you can still ungron later.<p>Nice work, thank you!')
