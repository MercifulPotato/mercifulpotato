The first is simple (but IMO probably not right): 3-SAT is (probably) exponential, but the language definition document qualifies the linear claim by saying that macro expansion can also be exponential.<p>The second is probably more accurate, though. General 3-SAT is (probably) exponential, but we&#x27;re dealing with 3-SAT for a constant number of variables. You can solve 3-SAT by producing all combinations of values for the variables and testing the expression for each one, but while testing an expression should be linear there&#x27;s an exponential number of combinations. If your combination count is constant, though, the whole complexity becomes linear ... with a shockingly bad constant factor.')
