Facebook has far more numerous instances of cheese pizza being thrown around but Facebook is a far more sympathetic entity than something with the name &quot;Pornhub&quot;.  The people who went after Pornhub were looking for any angle that would be palatable to the Left in a bid to remove adult material from the US landscape.  There is a reason that they changed their name from Morality In Media to something else.')
