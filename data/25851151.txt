The Senate is supposed to represent the interests of the states.<p>Each state is supposed to be an equal member of the union, which is why they each get equal voice in the senate. Up until the early 1900s senators were appointed by state governments rather than being popularly elected.<p>It&#x27;s sort of fallen out of fashion to identify strongly as a member of your state rather than just as a citizen of the United States, but I think this year has demonstrated that state governments still have a lot of influence and autonomy.<p>I for one have been very pleased with my state&#x27;s handling of the situation and have been glad to live here rather than somewhere else.')
