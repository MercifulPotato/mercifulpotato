Those BD&#x27;s would happily take this flow for free (as evidenced by the fact that they now _mostly_ pay for it).  The executing BD, not the brokerage, is on the hook for trading fees _if_ they need to execute the order in the public market - which is rare as they mostly internalize that flow.  The executing BD&#x27;s business model is based on the assumption that the flow is not particularly toxic and that at scale, the profit margin per share exceeds any execution costs.<p>The larger point stands though: from the perspective of the executing BD the payment for order flow + price improvement are both costs, which they want to cap.  If you dial up PFOF, you naturally get less price improvement.')
