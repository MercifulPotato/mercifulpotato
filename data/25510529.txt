It seems the same to me.<p>It&#x27;s much different based on a preliminary reading of Hotwire&#x27;s docs.<p>Live View uses websockets for everything. If you want to update a tiny text label in some HTML, it uses websockets to push the diff of the content that changed. However you could use LV in a way that replaces Hotwire Turbo Drive, which is aimed at page transitions, such as going from a blog index page to contact form. This way you get the benefits of not having to re-parse the &lt;head&gt; along with all of your CSS &#x2F; JS. However LV will send those massive diffs over websockets.<p>Hotwire Turbo Drive replaces Tubolinks 5, and it uses HTTP to transfer the content. It also has new functionality (Hotwire Turbo Frames) to do partial page updates too instead of swapping the whole body like Turbolinks 5 used to do. Websockets is only used when you want to broadcast the changes to everyone connected and that&#x27;s where Hotwire Turbo Streams comes in.<p>IMO that is a much better approach than Live View, because now only websockets get used for broadcast-like actions instead of using it to render your entire page of content if you&#x27;re using LV to handle page transitions. IMO the trade off of throwing away everything we know and can leverage from HTTP to &quot;websocket all the things&quot; isn&#x27;t one worth making. Websockets should be used when they need to, which is exactly what Hotwire does.<p>I could be wrong of course but after reading the docs I&#x27;m about 95% sure that is an accurate assessment. If I&#x27;m wrong please correct me!')
