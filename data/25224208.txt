It needs a host, a living one to be able to spread effectively unless you bomb a whole country at once with bio-bombs. You might as well use nuclear weapons then. Ebola has a very high death rate but doesn&#x27;t spread as fast.  A virus doesn&#x27;t have some internal goal to kill humans. It&#x27;d rather not kill the host, it&#x27;d rather spread as far and wide as it can; speaking from the evolutionary standpoint.<p>A well engineered bioweapon would be a virus that goes undetected for a few months and then happens to kill the host due to complications. That can wipe out an entire country or possibly the whole human race. I don&#x27;t think this is possible biologically.')
