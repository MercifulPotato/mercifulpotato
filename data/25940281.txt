It drives me insane to see people take for granted and abuse the things that (visit) visas on arrival offer them.<p>When I want a visa to most countries (especially western countries) I have to present bank statements, proof of employment, flights in and out etc. but a random bum from &lt;insert_country_that_gets_visa_on_arrival_to_destination_x&gt; can come in without any such checks. I get particularly angry at stories where travellers run out of money half way through their journey and start selling things like photographs or busking to make money.<p>I&#x27;m jealous of but never angry at people for the ability to do multi-destination journeys without the phenomenal logistical planning ahead involved in getting visas for all those destinations - please don&#x27;t take that privilege for granted. (TL;DR - i can never do the &quot;let&#x27;s just fly to x and see where we go from there&quot; on a whim)')
