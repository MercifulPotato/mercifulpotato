For me, part of the problem is that in math, you have options.  If you forget the quadratic formula, you can:<p>- Re-derive it by completing the square on the general quadratic<p>- Solve a specific quadratic you&#x27;re interested in by factoring or graphing<p>- Try to find zeros with numerical methods<p>The point is, everything&#x27;s connected to everything else, so it doesn&#x27;t matter if you forget any part of it as long as you remember some critical mass.<p>To be fully fluent in a programming language, you have to memorize two or three dozen keywords and a handful of operators (mostly the same as standard math).  To be fluent in a natural language, you have to memorize two or three dozen words <i>a week</i> for <i>years</i>.  Not to mention understanding all the insane grammatical stuff.<p>With human languages, sure it&#x27;s easy enough to remember that &quot;nec-&quot; means &quot;dead&quot; (especially if you consume fantasy novels &#x2F; games where necromancy is a school of magic), but you&#x27;re still totally screwed if you can&#x27;t remember whether the word you need is &quot;necare&quot; or &quot;necire,&quot; &quot;necobitis&quot; or &quot;necabitis&quot; or &quot;necibetas&quot;.  There&#x27;s no rhyme or reason to any of it, your knowledge won&#x27;t help you figure out whether that letter&#x27;s supposed to be an &quot;o&quot; or an &quot;i&quot;, or the difference between past tense and future tense and perfect tense and imperfect tense and tensile strength and gaaah why is this all so complicated!?')
