I surrendered to VLC et voil√†. It bugs me to no end that I use a video player to play music files but that&#x27;s life.<p>It plays everything, it doesn&#x27;t need an insane backend scanning framework, it doesn&#x27;t randomly crashes, its controls have been consistent for years and I can easily select the output device. I hate using it to play music but I love that I can use it to play music.<p>Oh, and I can&#x27;t wait for someone to release a VLCMedia distro with a keyboard&#x2F;kiosk mode to get rid of XBMC&#x2F;Kodi which has an insane amount of incoherent keybindings and defaults.<p>edit: I also use cvlc to create an RTSP stream from pi-0, those streams are read and converted by a pi4 to HLS files in ssh shared folder with a VPS that has an index.html file with a js player. Works flawlessly. Only downside is when wifi gets flaky. How cvlc is the easiest and fastest option to do that on a pi0 is beyond me but thank you.')
