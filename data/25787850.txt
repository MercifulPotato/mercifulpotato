The idea is that each recommendation has a chance to be anything, more likely something suggested by karma, but has the tiny chance to be the thing that karma suggests I least like.  I like the idea of seeing a subject that I didn&#x27;t know I was interested in or posts I would find objectionable some of the time.')
