I think other commenters miss the basic point that mobile is frictionless and can be used anywhere.<p>I think OP is thinking along the following lines: I’m on the bus &#x2F; in the loo &#x2F; waiting for my lunch to heat in the microwave. How can I use these moments to produce creatively? I already have a great tool that I know can deliver content efficiently and accessibly to me in these situations—I use my phone here already. But are there any ways to change my behavior to not flick through another feed, but actually advance my own creative goals?<p>Successfully being a creative person isn’t a matter of ‘tear it all down and start from scratch.’ It’s important to use the resources that are already available to us!<p>For my part, I wish it was easier to write long form quickly.
