That still works. One unique feature from livecode is its ability to cross-compile a standalone and I decided to demo that in the post because I felt many people would like to distribute applications, that dosn&#x27;t mean it is the only way to do it.<p>A technique that many of us use is having a &quot;loader stack&quot; which just load a stack from disk or network, then we build a standalone from that loader stack, while still being able to edit the real stack. This made creating self-updating applications really easy before the days of sparkle and notirizaton. I remember shipping auto-updating applications on early MacOS X (and I bet people did it in classic).<p>As for XCMD they used to work but they don&#x27;t anymore. Now, livecode has &quot;livecode builder&quot; language which is a low-level livecode-like language that allows you to do FFI, and you can still build &quot;externals&quot; which are native modules that you can call from livecode.')
