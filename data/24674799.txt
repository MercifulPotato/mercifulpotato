Although there is still a bit of a learning curve, there have been massive improvements have to the software suite.<p>The ability to code audio&#x2F;visual in blender is just incredible. I describe it like this: Imagine yourself as someone trying to code an image that looks like a tree in machine code. Then imagine your partner comes over, sees what you are working on, and hands you Python and a fully setup IDE, it&#x27;s like being given literal magic.<p>I downloaded the latest version earlier this year to write some basic AI simulations (cube wars!) and to create models for my 3D-printer. Like when I first learned to code, the fun of the machine totally sucked me and I got completely off-task from my original goal. Lately I&#x27;ve been working on two things with the same lines of code, music videos and simulated walks through forests(Think the movie Avatar). With only a few hundred lines of code I am able to generate infinite forest trails in which you can walk (or fly a drone-style camera) through, synced to music that is generated by the AI-mushrooms WITHIN in the scene itself! Literally was able to go from 0 to highly visually engaging trippy music videos in the last year with minimial musical production experience and with no music-video production background. The ease in which you are able to generate things via code is stunning and the limits feel completely boundless.')
