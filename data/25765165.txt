I&#x27;m really excited to see this space getting a lot of attention and traction lately. I think it&#x27;s one of those things that basically every app has to &quot;reinvent&quot; to some extent, and I would love to just be able to spin up a container that handles a lot of this stuff. Especially considering the security implications.<p>I dug into this space recently and Keycloak is really the best, most full-featured (open source) solution at the moment. But it&#x27;s a hefty and can be difficult to work with at times (documentation can be lacking and confusing, customizations difficult). It doesn&#x27;t seem to jive well with a modern containerized stack, either.<p>Ory and Supertokens are the two open source projects that I&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on and I think are making great progress and will be real viable alternatives to Keycloak soon. Last I checked they weren&#x27;t _quite_ ready for real production usage (for various reasons, I&#x27;ll have to revisit my notes), but they both seem to be moving quickly so looking forward to trying them again soon.')
