This is why sites like 538 were able to model the various outcomes with some degree of certainty and ONCE AGAIN manage to get results within the range of expected probabilities.  You really seem to have a hard time understanding both polling and probability and in particular the relationship between sample size and error.  I suggest a bit more research.')
