Most of those workers don&#x27;t have better options. Work in conditions that are illegal, or for much less pay elsewhere, and probably still illegal. Safety standards are not as high, but they get better as the companies learn from us. (Even at the least flattering look, cleaning up body parts and training a replacement takes time. Most people are better than that )<p>But I still avoid slave labor. The workers need to be free to leave for a better option if there is one.')
