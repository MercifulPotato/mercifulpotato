He is my sister&#x27;s youngest, and is 10 years younger than his sibling.  This isn&#x27;t a coincidence.<p>Parents who have their children in their mid 30s and later are orders of magnitude more likely to have an autistic child than people who conceive in their 20s&#x2F;early 30s.  It&#x27;s a massive increase in probability.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the topic of delayed parenthood and the very real health impacts it results in are almost taboo amongst the media elites who have driven huge amounts of attention to autism due to so many of them having autistic kids.  An additional topic related to this that goes undiscussed is the massive increase in twins (and consequentially premature births) caused by couples who had to use fertility drugs to conceive for the same reason.<p>I want to emphasize that I&#x27;m not criticizing anyone for making the decision to delay having kids until they are older.  I just wish it was discussed more because I personally think that corporate structures should be changed to not punish women for having kids.  It&#x27;s a horrible injustice that our most successful citizens are forced to suffer medical side-effects because corporations were designed for men, and sweeping discussion of these side-effects under the rug results in flawed approaches like Sandberg describes in &quot;Lean In&quot;, where the solution is to just embrace the existing structure to a ridiculous degree.  It&#x27;s horrifying to me that work culture has impacted human culture to a point where we are forced to step in and correct for biology.')
