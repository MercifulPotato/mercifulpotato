I&#x27;m saying: just because Bush did lie America into Iraq doesn&#x27;t mean that we should shrug our shoulders at people like Jones who prey on random parents of murdered children for personal fame and money.<p>Yes, government conspiracies exist. That doesn&#x27;t mean we should take every ranting of publicity-addled nutcases seriously. People like Jones are not performing a public service, and aren&#x27;t going to actually uncover future real conspiracies. That&#x27;s not the business they&#x27;re in. They&#x27;re in the business of making shit up for money.')
