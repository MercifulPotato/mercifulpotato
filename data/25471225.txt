Some tickets have been known to sell at 20x markups, Rammstein concerts or Wacken tickets are usually outsold in a matter of hours and end up on ebay the day after.<p>That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s built-in scarcity by virtue of physical limitations of a venue.<p>If your stadium only holds 15,000 people, but your city has 11 million or more like, say, the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, you can easily find 15,000 metalheads. Probably an order of magnitude more.<p>People keep talking about &quot;artificial scarcity&quot; with these GPUs, but its not artificial. The foundries that make these are running at max capacity 24&#x2F;7. They <i>are</i> trying to get these cards into the hands of the people that want them, there&#x27;s just simply not enough foundries and capacity available.<p>There isn&#x27;t some grand conspiracy in this case. In this case, this is the effect of increasing consolidation of the computer industry as a whole.<p>Look back the 1980s at the amount of hard disk manufacturers. There were easily 10+ companies... Western Digital, Seagate, Connon, Maxtor, Quantum, etc. Now what are there? Three? Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital?')
