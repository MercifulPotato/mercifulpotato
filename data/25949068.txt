I understand that in the past and in some places still today children were&#x2F;are essentially treated as slaves, and thatâ€™s possibly what you are thinking when you write Child Labor.  I agree 100% that that is evil.<p>I assure you that these teenagers are not being mistreated, and there are adults doing this same job with them.  Our society has come a long way.  No teen spends 100% of their time on school work.  Like anyone, they have a price they are willing to trade their time and labor for. Why should they, or anyone not be allowed to make that trade?<p>And yes, it is an emotional argument.  We are emotional beings. Doing a useful job and being rewarded for it satisfies those emotions immensely.<p>In addition to that, it teaches things in ways that a classroom simply cannot.  In a very real way it <i>is</i> paying them to get some education, as you suggested.')
