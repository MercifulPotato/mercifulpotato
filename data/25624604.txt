It&#x27;s an open secret that ads don&#x27;t work and that most of the data is fraudulent. There are thousands of companies with deliberately complicated relationships to pull a giant shell game with advertiser&#x27;s money. All of the data that supports the lie is built out of massive internet surveillance dragnets. Ultimately, even casting all of this in the best possible light, it&#x27;s designed to psychologically manipulate people. No one wants to see an ad. Adtech is despicable.')
