Item(by='ben1040', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607738747, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25394424, text='&gt;There are apparently some DNA sequencer machines that only interface with older macs.<p>I used to work in a Human Genome Project lab.  Two of the 1990s workhorse DNA sequencing machines, the Applied Biosystems models 373 &amp; 377, connected to Mac machines of similar vintage (my recollection is we had a lot of Power Mac 7100s, or at least machines in the 7xxx form factor).<p>IIRC the sequencing instrument had an interface to plug into the LocalTalk port on the Mac, but I might be wrong on this, it&#x27;s been 20+ years. And the software needed the classic MacOS.<p>The ABI 373 and 377 are so old and obsolete at this point that you might find one in your local science museum.  I know my city&#x27;s science museum has a display with an ABI 373 from my old lab.<p>ABI&#x27;s successor Sanger sequencing machines, models 3700 (1998) and 3730 (2003), had Windows-based companion computers and connected to the instrument via Ethernet port, so you didn&#x27;t have as much lock-in to super old hardware.')
