Five&#x2F;one star extremes tend to read overly emphatic and aren&#x27;t as likely to include both positives and negatives, so as a consumer (and perhaps as a platform hoping to show &quot;good&quot; reviews), these more moderate reviews will likely give a more accurate picture of the product, and thus could get priority for display. That said... as soon as you do that, obviously you&#x27;re going to see four stars getting gamed as well.')
