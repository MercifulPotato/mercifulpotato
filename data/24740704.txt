And I say that as someone who returns items more than most of my friends. My estimate is about 3-4% of items that I have returned over last 15 years of online shopping. And my friends think that is too high and guilt me for abusing the system. But maybe I should not feel as guilty.<p>The reasons I return items is usually false advertising. I used to spend hours reading reviews and product specs before buying. But now I don&#x27;t have time to sift through reviews. And of course, fake reviews make it harder.<p>So all I got is maker&#x27;s ads and if ads are lying then I don&#x27;t feel guilty returning an item.<p>It seems most people have an attitude that if a buyer got duped with false advertisements then it is buyer&#x27;s fault.')
