I also entered this conversation proud&#x2F;grateful for my experience, and worried about the politicization of the entrance process. (I also believe in structural racism and have been concerned about the ethnic balance at TJ, but I would have said the solution should come way earlier in the educational process, and still think that most effort should go there.)<p>However, I think treating this as the abandonment of meritocracy is a straw man.  Discourse with other grads changed my mind.  A key factor is how much the test is now being gamed.<p>Based on some facebook polls of ~500 alumni (not scientific but moreso than any other direct evidence presented!), the percentage of accepted students going through specialized test prep has climbed from &lt;2% in my day to &gt;50% today.  Some of these programs cost thousands of dollars for a <i>chance</i> to change your admissions outcome.<p>A test that draws this much financial investment is no longer a tool of meritocracy.  And the plan that replaces it is not devoid of meritocracy.  It includes a baseline GPA requirement, a holistic application package, and a lottery.  I think we can and should do better than the lottery, but the test isnt it.<p>Those of us who are activated about keeping TJ meritocratic and advanced, let&#x27;s put energies into fairer approaches than this test, which wouldn&#x27;t be viable with Covid anyway.')
