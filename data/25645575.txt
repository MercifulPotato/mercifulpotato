I also now realize I misread your comment as saying quitting was &quot;easy&quot; when you said it&#x27;s &quot;easily one of the best quality of life decisions&quot;.<p>In reality I have quit caffeine and gone back to it. I didn&#x27;t see the same benefits as you. After a few days of adjusting, I felt about the same as before. The only difference was I didn&#x27;t get to enjoy a morning coffee anymore.<p>† It probably wasn&#x27;t really by Mark Twain.')
