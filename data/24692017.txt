You guys seriously seem to be completely disconnected from what reality looks like for 80%+ of the population.<p>&gt; In reality, only a tiny proportion of people drive while so tired that they might actually fall asleep at the wheel<p>You have no idea how microsleep works. It does not involve &#x27;knowingly driving while tired enough to fall asleep&#x27;. This single statement makes it clear that you&#x27;re expressing some pretty strong and sure-sounding opinions on a subject that you know nothing about. You (as in specifically you) could be experiencing microsleep on a regular basis and never even know it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microsleep" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microsleep</a><p>And even when talking about the other cause - fatigued driving, are you suggesting that people come in to work late after every night they had poor sleep? I mean that would actually be a decent policy if not for the fact that a handful of instances of that in a year would get most people fired? Are you suggesting that someone shouldn&#x27;t drive home after a long shift? (do they like, sleep at their workplace? have you thought through this?). And we&#x27;re back to my first point - I don&#x27;t think you understand what life is like for the majority of the population who live paycheck to paycheck and work any job that they can get just to survive and keep their kids fed.<p>As someone enjoying the &#x27;privilege&#x27; of working in tech and having flexible hours and being able to arbitrarily work from home and having enough savings to take a 6 month long sabbatical without any financial strain, I can see where you might be coming from. As someone who spent the first half of their life working blue collar jobs and having a panic attack over an unexpected 300 dollar expense which literally meant I spent 2 weeks eating nothing but pasta, I&#x27;m pretty sure you either never knew or have forgotten what life is like for most people out there. Yeah for you and I being banned from driving is just a mild inconvenience and &#x27;sigh, now I have to use Uber for all travel&#x27;. For most people, it&#x27;s a life and family destroying sentence.')
