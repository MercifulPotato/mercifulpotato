The code required to do this was byzantine and frightening to maintain.<p>Because all of these features could not be included in maintainable code on systems with very low memory, the POSIX shell eviscerated the ksh88 language standard.<p>Surprisingly, checking the HP-UX man page (man sh-posix) gives most ksh88 functionality, which is definitly not in the Almquist shell (AFAIK the most popular POSIX shell).<p>It is unfortunate that the POSIX shell had to take such a large step backwards when a far more powerful language predated it, but the reasoning is clear (and mostly centered on Xenix on a 286).')
