Here&#x27;s what I said:<p>&quot;WhatsApp is now sucking all of your convos (including baby photos, etc.) into Facebook with their recent policy update. We&#x27;re switching our family group chat to Signal&quot;.<p>My mom, who&#x27;s nearly 70 did it almost instantaneously.<p>EDIT: My parents began to understand why FB is bad by reading books and watching documentaries. Those spooked them about how harmful it is for kids. So the &quot;think of the children&quot; might be a good motivator too.')
