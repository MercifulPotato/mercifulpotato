We were the ones who were always learning new stuff about programming. We picked up javascript before anyone else in our community at an early age, and we also explored Digit magazine CDs and discovered Ubuntu earlier. This was a time when most people didn&#x27;t even have an internet connection (oddly me included)\nThe two others who were with me were better at it than I was. One is at Broadcom, if you have a Samsung phone, your Bluetooth works because of her. Quite literally. She is the best at the drivers.\nThe other is in some silo at IBM. He&#x27;s been there forever, and he says he&#x27;s found his peace there.<p>These two wrote their own music player in VB during high school, called it FireAMP. They used to do things that I couldn&#x27;t understand. Right now, neither of them is even writing a blog. They&#x27;re in their silos and I&#x27;m praying someone gets them out and helps them share their knowledge with the world.<p>They&#x27;re the best programmers I know, and I&#x27;ve been at several conferences and spoken at a few. I wish they&#x27;d not sunk into their corporate holes so hard.')
