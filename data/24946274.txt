In reality, this is impossible because so many of the rules in a CoC are subjective, and therefore are enforced based on the opinions of the people enforcing the CoC.<p>&gt; but more importantly, give organizers something tangible to point to when there is a violation.<p>This just gives the enforcers a sense of moral authority to impose their opinions, nothing more.  I don&#x27;t see that as a benefit of what is inevitably an incomplete document, and frequently poorly thought out as well.')
