Less than 5 crashes a year.<p>KDE4 would crash as soon as I attached an extra display. KDE5 also crashed often when it was immature. Now it works like a breeze. As somebody who has watched (and tried regularly) KDE since the inception of KDE3, I can say KDE has finally reached maturity (if not perfection) about 1.5 years ago.')
