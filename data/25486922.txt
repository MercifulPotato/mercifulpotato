Radar is typically really good at measuring distance, but because of the physics of wavelengths and antennas, it needs a relatively huge aperture to achieve good angular resolution.<p>SAR technique create a virtual or synthetic antenna by imaging coherently over a path that draws out the synthetic aperture.<p>Of course, time continues as the the platform (satellite in this case) is moving. SAR then requires precise spatial&#x2F;temporal  awareness to combine the returns from the ground into a coherent image.<p>It is similar to long exposure in photography leading to seeing dim objects far away.<p>In both cases, if objects in the imaged scene are moving during the scanning period, they become blurred in the final result.')
