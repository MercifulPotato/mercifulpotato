It may be time to change the kinds of places you work at and what you work on. As an example, I have worked in the defense and aerospace industry (so far my whole career, working on changing that). We get a <i>lot</i> of people coming to us at 50+ and 60+ years old with a lot of useful knowledge that&#x27;s more applicable to our domain than most other domains, even though they weren&#x27;t in our field before.<p>This works because, even though many of our projects are new, they&#x27;re still very much &quot;legacy&quot; in the way things work and the languages and tools used. You could explore employers who have those kind of legacy systems that you have expertise in. Either to help extend their useful life, or to help dismantle them and migrate to a more &quot;modern&quot; (whatever that means to them) system.')
