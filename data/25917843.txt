The last time I looked, adverts were adding an additional ~35% load time to the page. Anywhere from 5% to _60%_ (!!) of vistors were navigating away before page load completed (Varied depending on company&#x2F;product of course) and a staggering 80+% of those vistors would have had a full page load if the adverts were not there.')
