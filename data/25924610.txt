Item(by='julianmarq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611724769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924481, text='&gt; You seem to be lumping speech restrictions and privacy violations into the same bucket, but I see them as very different, often even opposed to each other.<p>And yet today there was an article in the front page claiming that Signal is a problem because its end to end encryption can be used by anyone, even &quot;bad actors&quot;, to communicate. That&#x27;s an attack on both privacy and free speech, and I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if GP had that article (and others like it) in mind.<p>Mind you, most of the comments here rightfully called that article out for the absurd fear-mongering it was, and even the increasingly common censorship apologists were unusually silent. I was pleasantly surprised, even if it did still get a lot of upvotes and reached the front page.')
