It&#x27;s got 100 different video sources, 80 different destinations, and &quot;layers&quot; (you can route audio differently from video, though you usually route them together).<p>You have 6 or so different sources of control (different panel systems, automation systems that use serial interfaces, other automation that uses Ethernet).  Each of those is a different thread.<p>All those different sources of control need to see the same image of what&#x27;s connected to what.  So when one thread makes a change, it has to change for all the threads.<p>You could think about separating that state into parts, but does that really gain you anything?  If you&#x27;ve got 80 variables that behave identically instead of one 80-element array, are you really ahead?')
