Failure to stay relevant and understand the world as it is without your blinders on doesn&#x27;t make you the victim of time. That&#x27;s a choice you&#x27;ve made.<p>It&#x27;s simple to lose touch. You did what the youth are doing a decade ago; hell, you&#x27;re still in the game, albeit in a much different role. The world shifts around you, but you are so rich and powerful that people in your personal circle either don&#x27;t see it themselves because of their wealth and power, or would NEVER point out your shortcomings because they need access to your wealth and power.<p>In other words, assigning that statement - die a hero or live long enough to become the villain - says, to me, that he hasn&#x27;t actually done anything wrong. That it&#x27;s not his fault, he&#x27;s just been around so long that tastes have changed. He&#x27;s the victim, is what I read there.<p>I would argue, though, that it is his fault. He&#x27;s out of touch with the world as it is for people just starting out, AND he&#x27;s made the mistake of believing his view is <i>the</i> view, right and proper.<p>No idea what all that means in this context, but there it is, I guess.')
