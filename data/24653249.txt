MacBooks certainly didn&#x27;t get cheaper when they switched to USB-C only.<p>I did not have any dongles before Apple moved to USB-C, so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with any of the above. Also, none of these things needed to happen! Apple could have done what they usually do - gradually transition. Add 1-2 USB-C and then only eliminate the other ports when most folks could do without.<p>EDIT: One more thing to add - this &quot;transition period&quot; is probably going to last 10+ years for me because I bought a $350 Kinesis Advantage keyboard with a USB Type A connector. It&#x27;s a solid keyboard that I expect will live at least 10 years.')
