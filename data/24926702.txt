And these were presentations that the same organizers consistently have praised. Maybe it&#x27;s something about punching up vs. down.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen someone asked to cover up a company T with an IMO utterly innocuous joke on it (at a different event).<p>But, yeah, if you want to run a conference with a CoC that basically says we&#x27;ll ask you to leave if anyone is offended by you for any reason, just please let me know so I can choose not to attend.')
