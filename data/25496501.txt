The rationale for making student loans persist through bankruptcy is that students could just declare bankruptcy after graduation, since they probably have no assets. Maybe make the exemption only last 10-15 years. The permanence of student loans means lenders have no qualms against writing loans for people who will likely not be able to pay them off for decades, or ever. Reducing ability to default makes the loans more accessible, yes, but in effect it&#x27;s shifting the burden to students - students who are often young people not well equipped to make long term financial decisions.<p>Yes, this will mean lenders will be much more reluctant to issue student loans. It will likely prompt lenders to offer loans contingent on certain majors. This is a big, big reason why universities are heavily opposed to student loan reforms. The uncomfortable reality is that many universities are funded through what essentially amounts to predatory loans, and halting the practice will cut into university funding.')
