Freedom of speech is not the same thing as a (nonexistent) right to post whatever you want on a private platform regardless of the consequences for others or for the platform itself.<p>I never said it&#x27;s not censorship. You can post links on a number of competing services (or start your own), therefore statements like<p>“A group of unknown people at a technology corporation should be the ultimate authority on what I’m allowed to say, read, or share with my friends.”<p>are the real non sequiturs.')
