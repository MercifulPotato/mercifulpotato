While such abstraction and incorporation naturally would take time and make philosophy lagging behind, the majority of philosophy don&#x27;t even bother to do it and dismisses the reality outright, a very stupid thing to do.<p>The philosophy&#x27;s role of being a guiding science on the bleeding edge of scientific exploration of the world have been  lost by the &quot;philosophers&quot;  as the hard work of understanding of scientific reality was replaced by pseudo-scientific hand-waiving. That hand-waiving is easily noticeable even by casual observer and results in total loss of respect.<p>More than 30 years ago a freshman at University i had a great interest in philosophy, the new market capitalism in USSR resulted in great availability of books, including philosophical one, and we had a blast. With years as my knowledge grew, i started to see the philosophy&#x27;s failure to provide both - a well build abstraction as well as exploration guidance - and started to see it only just as temporary mind crutches, a band-aid for the lack of knowledge, like those  Ancient Greeks&#x27; myths.<p>And Plato today would have got Deep NN PhD and would be sitting at Google as a senior manager or director pulling $5M+ a year.')
