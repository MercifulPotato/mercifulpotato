A faster disk goes a long way in this respect, letting you run more instances with smaller  buffers.<p>Memory does pose a bottleneck for huge arrangements in the studio, but in the live setting you literally don&#x27;t have enough performers at the keys for the same constraint to apply. The stuff they might trigger can be bounced out into multisamples, so the remaining bottleneck is with effects processing.')
