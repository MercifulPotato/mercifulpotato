Item(by='sriku', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604484654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24986727, text='I ask myself two questions -<p>1. Is this paper of interest to me?\n2. How will I assimilate the knowledge of this paper into my existing framework?<p>For (1), the title+abstract helps a lot. Followed by the conclusion, which can indicate whether there is something really to be absorbed.<p>For (2), I need some grasp of the &quot;related work&quot; - i.e. &quot;how have others tried to solve this problem before this work?&quot; So once I affirm interest, I might scan some of the references. If I&#x27;m familiar with them, I know enough to assimilate. Otherwise if the paper describes them adequately for the purpose, I settle for that with a note-to-self to dive into anything in detail.<p>A third kind of &quot;always on&quot; mode for me is &quot;can I reuse any techniques or results in this work?&quot; and I read more carefully to gain that.<p>For abstract and structure, my preferred structure (because I was trained like this) is .. in this specific order .. -<p>1. Introduction - broad sweep description of area to clue people in.<p>2. Related work - a survey of how people have solved some key thing.<p>3. Problem statement - What remains unsolved&#x2F;unaddressed relative to the &quot;related work&quot;.<p>4. Solution - How does this solve it. This includes methods.<p>5. Validation - How does the author claim that their solution actually solves the problem they set out to tackle. In some cases, this may involve user studies, in others it may be a mathematical result, etc.<p>This is both my communication framework as well as a knowledge assimilation framework.<p>edit: I find an abstract that&#x27;s pretty much like one sentence or so for each of those items in that order easiest to assimilate. However, I admit this wasn&#x27;t easy to develop initially and I struggled a lot with it before it became normal.')
