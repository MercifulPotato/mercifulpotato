Maintaining a shell CLI is work.<p>If you write a shell CLI don&#x27;t aim for full flexibility - a script already fulfill that role.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of shell CLIs (command --option=1), but I think this way of thinking has merit. I would consider a script a subset of CLIs though, using a python REPL with preloaded modules is certainly a type of CLI, no? Code is a sequence of commands.<p>That being said, as the author mentions, new libaries make it really easy to expose some functions to a shell CLI. If the task mesh well with piping, exposing some primitive to the shell is probably worth it.')
