Item(by='wisty', descendants=None, kids=[25703398], score=None, time=1610163152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691957, text='I think what really annoys the far right is how the far left seems to get an easy ride.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of left-wing conspiracy theories. The current ones seem to be that the Capitol Police were allowing it to happen (not just through incompetence). This is given a huge amount of credence, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that it will mostly be proven to be conspiracy thinking and hysteria.<p>It&#x27;s actually a bit exhausting.<p>It&#x27;s not at all clear that the police are &quot;opening gates&quot; on that one shakey zoom shot (hundreds of people, but it&#x27;s just one zoom shot that shows it, hmmm). It looks to me like an officer has their hand forced aside as a large number of protesters push the barrier, which looks a bit like they are &quot;opening the gate&quot; (it&#x27;s not a gate). And they do abandon the post once they&#x27;re outnumbered and no longer have a barrier, so what? If there&#x27;s a shot from another angle that makes the police look better, I expect very few people on the left will want to share it.<p>I don&#x27;t expect any real thanks for pointing this out. Rather, like hysterical conspiracy theorists, I expect people will then say &quot;Yeah, well ... how about the selfie?&quot; (You mean, the cop who was encouraging criminals to post evidence of their crime?). That&#x27;s what conspiracy theorists do, they don&#x27;t stop and critically reassess their position when they&#x27;re shown that a piece of evidence is weak. They don&#x27;t realise that they&#x27;re caught in a bubble where poor evidence is amplified as long as it supports their position, they just assume that the debunker is a bad guy and reach for a new piece of evidence to use as a weapon.')
