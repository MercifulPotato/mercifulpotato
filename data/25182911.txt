Debian maintainers maintains packages from the very beginning of the process. They won&#x27;t just wait until a package has entered stable.<p>Moreover, when comparing different distributions, it would make more sense to have a closer look at the release process rather than compare how they label their packages. Since Debian tests its packages for a longer period of time than Arch, Debian testing should be just as stable as Arch stable.')
