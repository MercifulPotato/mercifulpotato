It just takes a while.<p>So they&#x27;ll always be slower than Tesla?<p>&gt;&gt; Just like it was with cars - they were behind Tesla, now they are in the driving seat in terms of numbers on the markets that are truly developed (in Norway Audi, VW and others are eating Tesla&#x27;s lunch).<p>The European car market is very different than the American one. For starters, a shit load more land... where getting charging networks right matters a lot. And fast.<p>&gt;&gt; The chargers will become a commodity in 5 years time<p>Would easily take the over on that if we&#x27;re talking United States. No other company is remotely close to building out a nationwide fast-charging network close to Tesla.<p>I don&#x27;t even own a Tesla nor do I think the company is a good investment, and I think Elon is FOS on a lot of things.<p>Charging networks and batteries aren&#x27;t two of them, though.')
