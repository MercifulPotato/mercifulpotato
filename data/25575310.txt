The main reason I still use GMaps&#x2F;Waze is because they give better arrival estimates than anyone else, because they have more traffic data, because of network effects.<p>I think the winner of the maps wars will be the one who gets the best traffic estimates, and I think Google&#x2F;Waze are still way ahead on that front.<p>I just wish the GMaps UI and Waze UI would be combined.  I love the cop, traffic camera, and hazard notifications of Waze, I love the lane markers in GMaps, as well as their navigating by landmark (I was once told &quot;turn in the driveway after the Chipotle&quot; by GMaps).  I also love Apple&#x27;s &quot;turn at the second stop sign&quot;.<p>So if I could get a UI with all those things and Google&#x27;s traffic data, that would be peachy.')
