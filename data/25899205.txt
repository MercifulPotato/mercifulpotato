For one, changing occupancy can&#x27;t &quot;reset&quot; it to market rate.  The current state of things just keeps people in the same place for many years past when they&#x27;d like to move, simply because they don&#x27;t want to give up their low rent.  It also severely disadvantages potential new residents who haven&#x27;t moved here yet, as they&#x27;re always faced with a market-rate rent rather than a lower rent-controlled one.<p>SF rent control currently allows landlords to raise rent by 5-10% per year (depending on how large the yearly cost-of-living increase is), and can also raise rent somewhat for capital improvements[0].  To offset the above change, maybe we could bump that a little bit... but honestly 10% a year seems like a lot already; if you look at the other side of the equation, most renters are probably not getting a 10% raise each year, and a lot probably aren&#x27;t even getting 5%.  Does a landlord&#x27;s costs really increase by 5-10% a year?  I&#x27;d be surprised if so.<p>We also need a vacancy tax.  Landlords should not be allowed to keep units vacant when doing so makes more financial sense than leasing it.<p>[0] Because I had to look it up myself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sftu.org&#x2F;rent-control&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sftu.org&#x2F;rent-control&#x2F;</a>')
