They provide nice fast, cheap, fibre broadband (1Gbit&#x2F;sec in both directions). I started allowing remote connections on my Plex (media server) but couldn&#x27;t get it to work, which is puzzling as I have been setting up put forwarding for 25 years, so thought I had run out of unsolved mysteries. Then I read about CGNAT. Then I found out Hyperoptic uses CGNAT. I felt like I had been swindled, an internet connection which ample bandwidth for hosting services with no way to have any incoming ports (as no matter what portforwarding I set up on my router, the ISPs CGNAT router doesn&#x27;t let me set any portforwarding up as it is out of my control).<p>I spoke to Hyperoptic, they said I could have a fixed (non CGNAT) IP for five months for free and then £5 per month thereafter. After five months I noticed they had started charging me £1.25 per month. I am not sure if that will increase to £5 at some point, but either way, I am happy to pay to have a &quot;proper&quot; internet connection.<p>I share this as perhaps others will be in similar situations but not realize some ISPs will let you escape the CGNAT. They switched me after a five minute chat and within 2 hours (considerably less but they said up to 2 hours) I restarted my router and I was good to go.')
