There will be some common ground, but there will be some fuzzy bits around the edges. Who do we give the power to decide which of those fuzzy bits to enforce end which not?<p>Trump won’t be in power for much longer in the US, but someone like him will probably be in power again. Is that the kind of person you want defining what is and isn’t hate speech?  Or perhaps is should be Jeff Bezos who decides what is and isn’t hate speech?<p>What happens when someone in power decides that talking about the wrong god or the wrong kind of sexuality or the wrong kind of people is “hate speech”?  What checks and balances will be in place to prevent that from happening?  We have some recourse against a US president in the form of the constitution, but we have none against Amazon.
