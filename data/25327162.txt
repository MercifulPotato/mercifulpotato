The only significant parts which aren&#x27;t are the coroner&#x27;s courts which investigate deaths using an inquisitorial process.<p>[Edit: we also sometimes have public enquiries, sometimes headed by judges, but these aren&#x27;t courts as such: there are no civil penalties or criminal punishments as a direct result of the enquiry]<p>Our procedural rights are mostly similar too (we have corrected most of the abuses since the 18th Century). Your right to silence <i>is</i> qualified, though, and has been since the 1990s. Basically, you can&#x27;t remain silent during questioning and then run a &#x27;surprise&#x27; defence: so if you&#x27;re going to claim an alibi at trial, you can&#x27;t wait until the trial has started to mention it. If you do, the magistrates or jury are allowed to draw adverse inferences from your earlier silence.<p>I don&#x27;t much like this change. I don&#x27;t know how much of a difference it makes in practice; there aren&#x27;t ongoing campaigns by defence lawyers to have it overturned, for example.')
