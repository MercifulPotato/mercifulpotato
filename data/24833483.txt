Item(by='ncmncm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603162079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24822426, text='That seems like a winning strategy: an array of ultrasonic transducers could both detect and range the bug, and then you just play back a loud impulse spike with the same phase delays as you heard. No moving parts, no misses, no calculations. If the spike is short enough, you physically can&#x27;t damage anybody&#x27;s ears.<p>Maybe you only deafen them, so they die of old age without mating.<p>I once priced out an array of half-inch-sized ultrasonic transducers. Seems like they were astonishingly cheap... like under $.50 each? Plus $.50 microcontrollers and a drive transistor for the spike. Maybe an FPGA running parallel convolutions?')
