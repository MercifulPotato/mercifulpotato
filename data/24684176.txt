It&#x27;s the height of privilege. And if you subscribe to the theory that intelligence is a product of a child&#x27;s developmental environment (nature over nature), it serves to increase social stratification and decrease class mobility.<p>Builders and electricians are just as much key employees as software developers. In Australia, a skilled electrician can earn the same salary as a software developer, and that&#x27;s the way it should be. My job is easy, I sit at a desk all day. I don&#x27;t have to wake up at 5 AM every day and spend 8 hours a day (more like 6 in Australia, thanks to the unions) running cables in a construction site.<p>I&#x27;d love to see most software developers try their hands at a trade, it&#x27;s backbreaking work.')
