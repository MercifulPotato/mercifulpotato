Kotlin already very quickly replaced Java for new Android code at many places, and it offers big productivity advantages without any downsides. So, on Android there’s a strengthening incumbent.<p>I think Flutter could evolve an interesting platform for “line of business” or “rapid application development” projects, similar to Lazarus&#x2F;Delphi. In that respect, I agree that we could see growth for flutter for low-cost cross-platform projects, and on Linux.<p>But, after the failures of React Native, none of the mobile developers I talk to have any interest in these non-native, layered-on-top frameworks that need a plugins ecosystem to call into native code or native APIs. Your productivity is basically held hostage by the runtime to an even greater degree than it already is on a mobile OS.<p>I also don’t thing Google needs any new web APIs to make Flutter accessible. They can position some invisible divs with the right spots with the right WARIA attributes.')
