I read The Miracle Morning on a recommendation of a friend, and now I wake up at 430am to start my routine then go straight into my side hustle before &quot;showing up&quot; for work @ 10. Think about it like this: The best hours of your day are the ones in the morning when your head is clear and you&#x27;re all stocked up on willpower. Those should be yours. The leftovers should be for whoever you&#x27;re working for. Not the other way around. The most difficult part for me has been making sure I&#x27;m in bed by 9pm.')
