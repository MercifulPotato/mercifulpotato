We are using billions of developer hours every year to keep up with all the changes, where is it going, why do we need to spend so much time changing things? Changing things doesn&#x27;t just force people to rewrite, even worse it forces people to relearn instead of achieving mastery.<p>How many percent of developers understand how everything in their stack works to such a degree that they&#x27;d be surprised if there are any problems when they test things? Basically nobody, yet it isn&#x27;t really an unachievable goal. Why can&#x27;t a web developer reach that point after 5 years of full time? Simple, it is all the damn changes to everything that happens constantly. It is so bad that most seems to think it is impossible to master anything in software engineering, yet if you just pin down the versions of all your dependencies and work like that for a few years everything will be crystal clear, that is how the human brain works.')
