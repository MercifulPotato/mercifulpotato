I find it so hard to get work done. It causes me a lot of anxiety to even sit in the chair. Once there I feel so antsy it takes awhile to be able to focus (instrumental music helps with that sometimes). I&#x27;m dreading having to go back into the office.<p>I&#x27;m also in my 40s and have a family to provide for. I totally think if I could just have a change of scenery (moving somewhere new in the world) it would help me so much, but as you know it&#x27;s not that simple at this stage in our lives.<p>For now I try to get stuff done around the house to let me feel tangible things. I also work on side projects to let me work on something that I find interesting.<p>I wish you the best of luck. I don&#x27;t have the answer, but would love to know what it is.')
