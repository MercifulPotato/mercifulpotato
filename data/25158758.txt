For code that relies on highly optimized assembly, like a good chunk of the crypto&#x2F; code, the Intel machine wins (although I wouldnâ€™t be surprised to see significant gains for the M1 as arm64 assembly implementations get more attention and are further polished).<p>Basically Go lacks lots of optimized assembly code for ARM64.')
