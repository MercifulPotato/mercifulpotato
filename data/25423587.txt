Sounds like a great place to work &lt;&#x2F;sarcasm&gt;.  Definitely sounds like some communication issues going on.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for the past 8 years on remote teams, and from my experience, having a shared mind is very important to a highly productive team.<p>My suggestion to you would be to communicate with your coworkers that you&#x27;ve already talked about your weekend with so-and-so, building resentment with your coworkers is never good.  Maybe even create a channel specifically to talk about your weekends!  Who knows, you may like it.  :)')
