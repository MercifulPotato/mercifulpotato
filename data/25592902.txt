Employees who then accept whatever that was are indeed bound by it when they want to consider moving to companies B, C, or D, but I see all of those as market actions.<p>If some employees take jobs without thinking about their future position, I’m not convinced that’s a widespread market failure. I’ve asked about and read IP and non-compete clauses at every role I’ve ever taken before accepting the position. Only once has it affected my choice; several times I had to negotiate redlines in the documents (which went smoothly as both sides were being reasonable).')
