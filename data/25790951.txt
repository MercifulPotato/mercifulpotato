If at a later date they find they need them back they request a decryption and give their reasons.  If the ICO thinks the reasons are valid (ie the police have the right to have the data and therefore should not have deleted it), then they decrypt, but otherwise the police don&#x27;t have access to the data.<p>Usage of the private key could be subject to an audited break glass procedure to prevent abuse.')
