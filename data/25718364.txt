I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed with my 2020 16&quot; MBP that I bought after owning a 2015 MBP for 5 years. This one is faster for sure, but also noisier, gets hot often for no good reason (even with the lid closed for the whole day!), takes 7-8 seconds to wake my Eizo monitor, while the previous one would take only a second to do the same.<p>To be honest and quite unexpectedly the 16&quot; MBP is not the best Mac I ever owned, despite the hype. The display is amazing, the speakers are incredible for a laptop, I&#x27;m also glad the T arrow keys are back, but everything else is a disappointment.')
