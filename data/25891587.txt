And while that hasn’t gone away entirely it has diminished <i>massively</i> as companies deprecate on prem hardware as hardware ages and replaces those resources with cloud services.<p>Stuff like NFS made sense for on prem but it’s a terrible solution for building services on AWS (for example).<p>Security wise, any popular CMS will be a security nightmare. It’s not even a PHP thing. In an ideal world you’d stick your CMS behind a WAF and put some additional policies around your admin APIs (if at all possible).
