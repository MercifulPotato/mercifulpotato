Probability is subjective, it depends on what you know, and everyone has a different set of things they know.<p>I flip a coin and look at it, then ask two other people for their probabilities. One of them knows the coin is biased towards head such that it&#x27;s twice as likely to land heads than tails on any given flip. The other knows nothing about the coin.<p>The first person guesses a 66% chance of heads. The second guesses a 50% chance of heads. I, having seen the coin, say it&#x27;s a 0% chance of heads.<p>None of these probabilities are wrong. They&#x27;re all correct given the set of knowledge that person had. Probability is subjective.')
