A modern refrigerator for example can consume less than 1kW per day.<p>The only common appliance that I can think of that produces a lot of unwanted heat would be a dryer. But instead of a gas dryer that sends all the waste heat outside, you could get a condenser dryer with a heat pump which consumes much less energy and hence produces much less heat.<p>From a residential standpoint it doesn&#x27;t really make sense.')
