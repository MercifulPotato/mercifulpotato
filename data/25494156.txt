Item(by='gpderetta', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608552563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493582, text='&gt; regarding &quot;modern C++&quot;, I have seen that moniker applied to even language features that were already available in pre-ISO C++98, like RAII, or type safe collections.<p>That&#x27;s not surprising as modern C++ predates C++11. Newer standards &quot;merely&quot; make it more convenient to practice it.<p>At the end of the day, modern c++ is really about emphasizing value types, RAII and parametric polymorphism as opposed to OOP.<p>Anyway, these days we have it good conformance to new standards comes relatively quickly. It took forever for most compilers to be C+98 conformant (and technically most never reached it).')
