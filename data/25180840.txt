I have two sizes in my kitchen, the larger one I think of as a &quot;soup spoon&quot; does seem to maybe be about a tablespoon indeed!  I think. I may not have had the best technique to compare, trying to pour water from one to another (also &#x27;almost filled it&#x27; can be deceiving depending on the shape of the thing, &quot;almost&quot; could really be ony around 60%).<p>That the eating spoon is so much shallower than my actual 1 tbsp measuring spoon would make it less convenient to try to use it to measure for a recipe.')
