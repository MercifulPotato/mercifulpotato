Item(by='saagarjha', descendants=None, kids=[25940587, 25940527], score=None, time=1611832081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903771, text='I&#x27;ve recently picked up a new iPhone 12 and what I would summarize it (and I am sure every new phone these days, probably–I&#x27;m just comparing it to my iPhone SE I had before it) is that it is <i>really</i> good at making random pictures look pretty decent, no matter what you are pointing it at. And I think that&#x27;s pretty remarkable; it&#x27;s akin to what point-and-shoots did to the average person&#x27;s pictures but now it is in a device that you literally never leave behind and it also does a much better job. I like to think I have a basic eye for framing and some general knowledge of what ruins a picture (like, I can tell that those super-HDRed pictures with the saturation turned way up are fake and not good) but I&#x27;m no photographer, even an amateur one, and I have been amazed by what it does. I&#x27;ve actually been mildly frustrated at the lack of opportunity to really test the camera with the pandemic, but I snapped a couple of quick pictures to try out things like HDR, the wide angle lens, or low light performance (read: I pointed my phone at some random trees, or my family in the dimly-lit living room, or directly at the sun–usually things that don&#x27;t photograph well) and they have all come out shockingly good for the effort I put into them. It&#x27;s truly amazing how well it works for someone who just points the camera at something and taps the shutter button. It&#x27;s so good that I&#x27;ve almost even forgiven them for making a phone that doesn&#x27;t lay flat on a table :P')
