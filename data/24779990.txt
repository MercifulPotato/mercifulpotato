So rather than focusing on &quot;we&#x27;re using base-image:1.0.2&quot; you need to start asking questions like &quot;list all packages and versions and start comparing those&quot;.<p>If there&#x27;s a security issue you need to rebuild your images anyway and optimally you have a system in place that represents images and their dependencies as some sort of dependency graph structure, so when you upgrade your base image all dependent images get rebuilt automatically.')
