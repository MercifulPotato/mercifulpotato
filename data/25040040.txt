I don&#x27;t know where to &quot;put my ear&quot; every time I get a call, and as a result the audio quality for calls is terrible - muffled, muddy, unclear, awkward.  Switch to speakerphone and it is like someone pulled cotton wool out of your ears so it is not like the network connection is poor, just the speaker. It has been a pain in the backside to use as a result since day one of getting it, and the times when I borrow someone else&#x27;s phones I am just blown away by their &quot;HD audio&quot; they get compared to the pixel 5.<p>What were they thinking. This must have been brought up during testing?! Surely?<p>Its not even like the full-height screen adds anything really as you have a stupid extra-large notification bar as it physically needs to be larger to fit the front-facing camera in.<p>Finally, it does not connect to 5G where Vodafone UK says there is 5G on their coverage maps (and yes my account is enabled for 5G).  Either Vodafone is telling porkie pies on their coverage maps, or the pixel 5 can&#x27;t connect to 5G and so is a total disaster?')
