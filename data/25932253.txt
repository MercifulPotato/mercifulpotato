Thank you!<p>Doppler does not do End-to-End encryption, so their service has plain text access to your secrets.<p>What&#x27;s crazy about a desktop GUI to manage secrets to me is that it&#x27;s overkill when doing vim with the equivalent of a .env file is perfectly adequate for many use cases.<p>Envwarden is great, but with CloudEnv you can do access control via IP addresses, you can grant new IP address access via email approval, you can grant read-only access to some IP addresses... so you get a lot of flexibility over who and when the access to your secrets is given. In addition, there is an auditable access log that keeps track of when and where every access attempt was made.')
