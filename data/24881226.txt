E.g. The egg industry adopts a solution whereby the chicken are tracked on a blockchain so people know which chickens are kept outdoors and which are indoors. The eggs are then tracked and checked in at each quality gate and the consumer then gets a QR code for an app that tells them where the egg came from and where it was checked for tampering etc.<p>A blockchain isn&#x27;t the only solution available, and it doesn&#x27;t require a public blockchain. A blockchain could work in this space for storing decentralized time-series signatures.')
