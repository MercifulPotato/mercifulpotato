There are literal ads on TV that show how wealthy you can become if you just buy a lottery ticket.<p>&gt; <i>that they should borrow money to buy as many of them as possible because they will make a nice easy profit</i><p>You clearly haven&#x27;t read any of the GME threads on WSB. Pretty much everyone is saying to only invest what you can afford to lose. Most people are buying small amounts just to f##k with the hedge funds, and they are outspoken about it.<p>&gt; <i>but at least people playing don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re doing arbitrage.</i><p>Buying a lottery ticket for a dollar, hoping they make much more? Isn&#x27;t that the whole point of a lottery?<p>&gt; <i>And governments often do restrict other forms of gambling associated with more problematic losses.</i><p>That&#x27;s the whole point of the criticism that you&#x27;re missing. These restrictions are completely arbitrary and don&#x27;t follow any rules.<p>You can go to a casino and lose your life savings.<p>You can buy 1 million lottery tickets and lose your life savings.<p>You can buy one of thousands of penny stocks and lose your life savings.<p>The government won&#x27;t stop you. The brokers won&#x27;t stop you.<p>But suddenly, when a big hedge fund is caught with their pants down, people like you come out and pretend like what&#x27;s happening is a big problem, and we have to stop the trading &quot;because some people can lose money&quot;.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m not buying your narrative at all.')
