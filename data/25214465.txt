And sometimes just the excuse to get you gone.<p>Where I was about 99.9% of the COEs where just a lesson learned and new process to prevent it.  There was one that was basically used as a tool to remove a VERY good engineer, that didn&#x27;t mesh well with new leadership.<p>A sister org, one I worked a lot with, wouldn&#x27;t COE anything.  If you were the lead engineer on a product or service that had a COE you were going to get a PIP by year end review.  I wasn&#x27;t surprised when all the talent left that group.')
