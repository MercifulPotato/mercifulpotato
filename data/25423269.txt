I have a lake near me, a full lap around is 5.8 km, measured with multiple watches. I like Garmin watches for running, but this time I’ve managed to forget to charge my Garmin for multiple days in a row and considering I’ve just bought an Apple Watch 6, I’ve decided to test it. I’ve bought it because I like gadgets, not that I was needing it :)<p>Apple Watch showed 6+ km for the same distance. Maybe it seems a deviation that is so small that it is insignificant, but for me it is not. I’m fighting hard for each small performance increase, this equals to a few weeks of hard work which are ignored (I’m expecting this to be unreliable in both ways, up or down).<p>Other major 2020 new feature that I’ve tried is the blood oxygen measuring tool. I was getting different results with up to 4-5% variation between consecutive measures. You can say that it’s user error, but whatever, if it only works when planets align maybe this is a feature that is not ready. I did not get this from my cheap chinese monitor.<p>In the end I’ve decided to return it. It is an awesome smart watch, but a lousy sport watch for my very own needs. I’m sure other people have different experience with it, but mine wasn’t good.<p>edit: regarding music, I could already do that with my Garmin 645. It syncs with Spotify playlists.')
