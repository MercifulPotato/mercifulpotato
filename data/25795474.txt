Then it proved to be bad for their business model so they moved to something much closer to shared source.<p>Personally, I don’t think there’s anything immoral or shameful about selling proprietary software or shared source or whatever. However, SSPL and TSL and friends are just not open source licenses. They’re more restrictive than AGPL. They are designed to protect a business model, not your rights as an end user.<p>So it irks me that the only perspective I see reliably is that Amazon is screwing everyone and not how startups are willing to take advantage of the good will and marketing bonus and then switch it up when they realize it can’t be reconciled with their business model. Continuing to call it “open source” is just insult to injury, imo.')
