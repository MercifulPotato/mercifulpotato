Everything in systemd can be orchestrated with dbus. In fact that’s all systemctl really is — a dbus client. And the file format is ini. And shell style environment files if you want.<p>And systemd actually comes with two image launching systems systemd-nspawn and systemd-portable. And then with systemd-machined you can add software that needs virtualization too.<p>The interface to journald is more complicated than it should be but it’s also really powerful — docker logs doesn’t hold a candle to the kind of filtering it can do.<p>Overall systemd is a stupidly powerful and featureful supervisor compared to Docker. Just the dependency management alone should demonstrate that. Then you get mounts, swap, socket activation, more powerful restarting policy and the whole suite of isolation and security features.')
