It is not built with the capacity to handle covid on top of that.<p>Additionally, a pandemic and the measures to stop it is a temporary situation.  If we could end obesity, opiod abuse, or car crashes by making drastic societal changes that only lasted for a couple months, I&#x27;d argue that we should do that.  The equivalent actions to stop other high-mortality trends would be permanent changes to society.')
