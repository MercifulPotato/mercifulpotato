As I mentioned downthread, I was somewhat angry when I wrote this; Brian has stepped in to provide more detail from his side. I&#x27;m still a bit resentful, but I understand that displeased or not ranting on Hacker News is not something I should have done. I&#x27;m not ready to apologize to the people I included for the concerns I mentioned yet, but I am sorry (both to them and Hacker News itself) for commenting in this way. The blog post gave me a specific set of things to be mad at and I let that get the best of me.')
