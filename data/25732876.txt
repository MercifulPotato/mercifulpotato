So by looking at energy-out &#x2F; energy-in, you get a sense of your bang for your buck.<p>Looking at the latest figures on wikipedia <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_return_on_investment#Application_to_various_technologies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_return_on_investment#Ap...</a> :<p>- Conventional oil wells are 18-43:1 (I&#x27;ve heard saudi oil wells -- the easiest to drill -- are in the range of 60:1)<p>- Shale is 1.5:1 (say you what you will about the shale revolution, but from an energy output point of view, it&#x27;s literally scraping the bottom of the barrel)<p>- Oil sands are 5:1<p>- Wind is 20-30:1<p>- Solar is 9-34:1<p>As with any lifetime&#x2F;embedded cost analysis, there&#x27;s lots of variability dependent on your assumptions, manufacturing conditions, and operating conditions. There&#x27;s nuances in energy types, like wind turbines produce electricity but  require tons of diesel trucks and concrete to assemble.<p>But we can roughly say that in terms of energy requirements, solar is more efficient than shale or oil sands, but it tops out at the lower to mid range of conventional oil.')
