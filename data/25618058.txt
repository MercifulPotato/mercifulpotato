You always have to make judgement calls about what to prioritize over what, you can&#x27;t &quot;just fix it&quot; for literally everything unless you&#x27;re in a very fortunate position of working in a codebase with minimal tech debt, a mature scope, and sufficient developer-hours.<p>If you&#x27;re saying that the CVEs that amount to &quot;update dependency X&quot; or whatever should be &quot;just automatically fixed&quot; rather than have to be prioritized, I agree that should be true for a subset of em... But not every dependency update or CVE resolution is trivial, and even the supposedly trivial ones may still require a certain amount of testing or refactoring.')
