Item(by='TheRealDunkirk', descendants=None, kids=[24779898, 24779185], score=None, time=1602694987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777238, text='Yeah, at least the CIA claimed that &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; was yielding actionable intelligence.<p>I remember a story from years ago that some lab was working on a lens for a satellite for the NSA with a resolution that would be able to discern different coins on the ground from space. They were complaining that, after all their work, the job was cancelled, and they weren&#x27;t going to get paid. What it meant, of course, was that they had found a better alternative.<p>The fact that the NSA isn&#x27;t even bothering to lie about this is telling. The linked article says they won&#x27;t even be trying to get Congress to let them continue the process, and this is even more telling. But what it&#x27;s telling me ISN&#x27;T that it does not work, and it&#x27;s certainly not because they suddenly grew a conscience about the Constitution. It&#x27;s just that they don&#x27;t need this particular vector to get the sigint they&#x27;re looking for now.')
