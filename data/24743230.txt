Talking about some fun stories. He showed me a few &quot;near misses&quot; where the explosion was &quot;slightly&quot; larger than anticipated, and if you know where&#x2F;when to look, you see the SFX team running for their lives in footage that made it into the edit. None of the guys I&#x27;ve worked with come close to the Danny McBride character in Tropic Thunder though.')
