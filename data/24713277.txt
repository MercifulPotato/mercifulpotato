Item(by='m0zg', descendants=None, kids=[24719075], score=None, time=1602108069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710948, text='This is one of those genius ideas that are &quot;obvious in retrospect&quot; and you think &quot;how come nobody thought of this before&quot;. I bet spatialization of audio could massively improve intelligibility of video conferences with more than 2 participants. In retrospect it seems nuts that we&#x27;re not really using stereo imaging. All the tech for spatial audio has been available for about three decades now, and much of it is out of patent already. Newer stuff even takes the position of your head into account for added realism.<p>I hope Google&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;Zoom pay attention to this as well. And also Logitech, Bose, etc, so that we see headphones with accelerometers and gyros built in.')
