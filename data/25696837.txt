He was quick and happy after the &quot;capitol storm&quot; riot to finally say there will be a peaceful transition on the 20th. <i>Why?</i> Because he was asked to do it and he feels he is being helpful by complying.<p>Nevermind that he created the problem in the first place. He&#x27;s always felt, since a young age, that he didn&#x27;t get enough attention, and only received it when he acted out. Like, when you use your fork to eat food for the first time and dad doesn&#x27;t even look at you. Then you throw it on the floor and Dad is suddenly alert. Boom, that&#x27;s a life lesson. Repeat that scenario 1,000 times, give the child a billion dollars and you get someone like Trump.')
