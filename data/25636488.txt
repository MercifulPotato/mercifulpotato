I&#x27;m lucky enough to have a great room available for an office.<p>I curtained the doorway off, to remind the rest of the family (and myself) that when it is closed, I&#x27;m at work.

Was listening to Phish on the surround sound speakers connected to my receiver via bluetooth to my Mac Mini the other day, while working on my desktop I&#x27;d brought home attached to a nice big bright 4k monitor that I have at home, and connected via SD-WAN to the corporate network.
