You can also buy an edgerouter from Ubiquiti for maybe $50 for the gateway&#x2F;routing&#x2F;switching, and then spread a couple of the Unifi access points around your house for the WiFi. I did that since I balked a bit at the cost of the dream machine. This would be way more powerful (the edgerouter has a lot of advanced features) and reliable (access points in high use areas) than a high-end consumer WiFi router at the same cost. And the mobile apps + dashboard are super nice.')
