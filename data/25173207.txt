There are lots of practical options that could strengthen the process for the average registrant.<p>Half the battle is for registrars to quit accepting the equivalent of cold calls from registrants.  How hard is it to make a call back to the registrant when they&#x27;re asking for NS, MX, etc. changes?<p>If the registrant phone number hasn&#x27;t changed since registration, it&#x27;s pretty safe to call them back and trust them IMO.  If the registrant phone number was changed 5 days ago and someone is calling in asking for changes, that&#x27;s an easy red flag and could be coupled with a technical restriction that requires escalation for important domain changes.<p>Another option similar to yours but easier would be to set a pin during registration and to require it for making over the phone domain changes.  I guarantee those will get lost &#x2F; forgotten by the average registrant though.<p>You&#x27;d be shocked at the number of small businesses that don&#x27;t know where there domain is registered, who registered it, when it expires, etc..<p>If a domain is making money use a registry lock.  If it&#x27;s a high value domain making tons of money, pay MarkMonitor or similar to manage it.')
