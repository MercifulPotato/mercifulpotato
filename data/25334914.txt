An economic boom should not be a bad thing. And tech is not raising rents, it is raising housing demand which could easily be met with a corresponding rise in supply that would limit the price increases, but new housing has been being actively blocked for decades.<p>You also leave out an important factor, most of the city that is supporting the policies that enable petty crime here have no skin in the game. They live in nice neighborhoods where they&#x27;ve owned their houses for decades making them massively wealthy and don&#x27;t have to interact with the undesirables. It&#x27;s easy to look the other way and ignore the downtown problems of homelessness and street crime, and to be so woke that you don&#x27;t want any crime prosecuted, when it doesn&#x27;t affect you.')
