The main problem that I noticed from the dialogue was that the community felt (paraphrasing and summarizing) that &quot;If you support scp on your server, you should know to filter backticks.&quot; There was little interest in changing the behavior (understandable - this breaks backwards compatibility) nor in updating the man pages and other documentation to note this was an issue. I felt that the latter was where scp showed its legacy. Security should be built into products by default, not a series of &quot;gotchas&quot; that users manually configure against.<p>I love the idea of having a &#x27;secure with default settings&#x27; version of scp that functions with the same syntax. I think that would be great to get users to use by default and avoid the footguns that comes with default scp.')
