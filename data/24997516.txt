This takedown with complete lack of transparency from a French provider (OVH) really proves me wrong.</i><p>There is a huge difference between these two cases. Most hosting providers in the world are not going to challenge law enforcement in their jurisdiction and will just cooperate. That&#x27;s what OVH did, as everyone should have expected.<p>But at the same time most hosting providers in the world will oppose overreach of copyright trolls. That&#x27;s what Github didn&#x27;t do.<p>Still, if you need some minimal resilience it&#x27;s never enough to rely on a single hosting provider from a single jurisdiction. Multiple different providers in different countries for frontend servers with some primitive DNS failover can easily solve this and similar problems.')
