I asked why they didn&#x27;t go with a heat pump option, and they said the dealer told them that heat pump water heaters are basically a &quot;robbing Peter to pay Paul&quot; situation where you end up taking heat you would have added to your house and putting it in your water instead.<p>I guess in warm climates &#x2F; seasons that is probably a net benefit, but I&#x27;ve noticed our electric co-op also promotes highly-insulated electric water heaters instead of heat pump water heaters.<p>Not sure what I think of it all. We have an electric water heater and at first I was grumpy about the relative cost to run relative to natural gas, but I&#x27;ve come to terms with it. It&#x27;s about the simplest device possible, and that has some value I think.')
