Item(by='robotmay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610020865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668957, text='Ken Rockwell might be the most interesting reviewer I&#x27;ve come across in years. What he favours is well known (e.g. metal over plastic) but his opinions always feel honest and he&#x27;s pretty pragmatic on what he recommends. Unlike most reviewers (across all review subjects) he provides a lot of technical data to the point where it feels like it&#x27;s &quot;ok&quot; to form a different opinion from him, and that you don&#x27;t have to write off his whole review. He doesn&#x27;t tend to get stuck on one fault with a lens like many people do.<p>And his website is easy to read and navigate, which is rare for review sites.')
