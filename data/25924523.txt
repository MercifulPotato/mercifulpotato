If this were true, I suspect the best and easiest to understand functions would be thousands of lines long<p>Often you write functions that only get called from one place, just so you can give a name to a block of code and make it easier to understand.<p>Just today, for example, I wrote a big case&#x2F;switch statement to figure out the URL for a user on a system where the URL is different depending on where the user exists in a hierarchy (I didn’t write the server side of this - gotta work with what I have).  I extracted this all out into a “getUserUrl()” function. In the caller, it’s much easier to understand what is going on when you see “getUserUrl()” than it would have been if there was the giant switch statement there.<p>Cognitive burden would generally not be improved by inclining every function I call.')
