For some reason, never checked out gab.<p>have you been on all of this?<p>I sincerely can tell you that parler is no worse than twitter. 8chan - different story.<p>hence, unfair comparison - that it is hate speech (which even though 1A protects it, we can agree that there is a line that could be crossed - lets not argue about that line here)\nmy contention is that in parler (or a future app&#x27;s case) -- it may not be hate speech, but &#x27;speech we hate&#x27; -- since that definition is made by same entities.<p>I want to know if you are just following what you heard from media, or first-hand.')
