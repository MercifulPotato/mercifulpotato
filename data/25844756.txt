If you save enough that you don&#x27;t have to work for 25 years, then if you invest that in the stock market it may produce a real return of 4% each year- which on average covers your expenses.<p>Then maybe you have the rest of your life to look for more meaningful activities, and you also have the option of doing activities that don&#x27;t generate any cashflow.<p>It may be worthwhile to explore and learn what kind of work you enjoy doing, to pinpoint some more specific characteristics you are looking for than &#x27;meaningful&#x27;. Some ideas:<p>* you have autonomy vs being assigned goals from up the chain\n* you understand how your work contributes to a goal, and you care about the goal\n* the day to day work is enjoyable enough of the time\n* the physical work environment suits you\n* you get to see your work getting used &amp; get feedback from people who use it<p>(if I score my own job on these five points it gets a score of about 1.5 &#x2F; 5)')
