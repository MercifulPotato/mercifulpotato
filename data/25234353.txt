It&#x27;s not as good (if at all) at scientific citation management, but it&#x27;s a brilliant app for saving a database of information.<p>Devon supports PDFs, Markdown, images, bookmarks (which can be viewed in the app), and more. The PDF handling is superb. The search is excellent, and it has extensive support for tags and metadata. Sync is very good. I also like that it stores each collection as a separate database file that you can keep in different places.<p>Among other things, I use it to collect and categorize images, which works really well because you can view any collection&#x2F;folder as a &quot;gallery&quot;.<p>My only complaint is that the databases are local, and you only sync between devices. I can&#x27;t share notes with other people for real-time collaboration.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devontechnologies.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;devonthink" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devontechnologies.com&#x2F;apps&#x2F;devonthink</a>')
