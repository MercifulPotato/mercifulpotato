So I don&#x27;t think &quot;Western culture&quot; is in danger of dying out. Plus we export it everywhere thanks to the Internet and TV, film, and books.<p>White people as a race seem to have their days numbered, but I think an inevitable part of globalization is people are mixing to such an extent now that we&#x27;ll eventually all be some shade of tan. One less thing to divide us.')
