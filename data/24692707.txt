Because you got it 80% right.<p>I was 19 or 20 back then, and Windows was my main OS - though I did have some experience with Linux as well (running several distributions for desktop use, as well as working with Cygwin and SFU on Windows), and I was a relatively proficient C++ programmer, having spent ~6 years of pretty much all my after-school time coding game engines.<p>So it&#x27;s not that I couldn&#x27;t make it work - I eventually did. But it was so rough around the edges that I gave up in frustration twice.<p>And yeah, these days, Linux is my daily driver (well, technically Emacs - Linux distros are just various flavors of Emacs bootloaders for me).')
