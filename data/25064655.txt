They lose money in exchange for trying to capture a monopoly and when they&#x27;re confident in their customer lock-in, they begin to turn a profit.<p>This is what Amazon does by saying &#x27;hey, we&#x27;re not profitable, we are trying to murder all local businesses by operating at thin margin and once we crush competition and everyone&#x27;s dependent on us, then you&#x27;ll begin to see awesome returns&#x27;. They don&#x27;t <i>literally</i> say this but everyone knows that is in fact what they&#x27;ve been doing for years.<p>It&#x27;s not a secret that this is what people with money do - they trade it in for power and what better way to have power than to be needed and irreplaceable.<p>This isn&#x27;t a big tech problem, it&#x27;s a human problem and I have yet to hear a nuanced solution.')
