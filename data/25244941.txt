People make controversies on ludicrous grounds all the time, especially in the fake news era. If a local restaurant charges $5 for a milk shake which is very popular, grows to become a National chain and still charges $5 for their shakes, it is not reasonable to claim that they are only able to charge $5 due to their market power. I don’t care how many people disagree with me, I will continue to claim they are clearly full of it.<p>That doesn’t mean the now National chain isn’t doing other things that are anti-competitive, or that their other business practices must be ok, but clearly the market has decided the shake is worth $5.')
