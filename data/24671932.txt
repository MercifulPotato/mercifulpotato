Left wing political groups are usually coalitions of people without much institutional power.  But in order to bring together enough people to challenge institutional power you have to get different kinds of people who have different problems together under the same roof, so you wind up with white women protesting about black peoples rights, black people protesting about tenant rights, and so on- everyone has to take on the struggles of everyone else, so from the outside it looks like people are always complaining about problems that don’t affect them.<p>From the point of view of people with a lot of institutional power, they need to see the people beneath them as undeserving, to justify their own position.  So the explanation they will give for what they see is that leftists must just have some kind of inferiority complex about their own failings to be always so upset about things that don’t directly affect them.')
