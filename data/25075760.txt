It’s a bit hard to put into words, but as a concrete example, you try to step off a curb diagonally, and instead the inside edge of your shoe hits the top of the curb, twisting your ankle out from under you.<p>The correct reaction is to take all of the weight off that foot, otherwise once you hit the gutter you’re gonna have a bad time. A young person might solve this by hopping forward, to get your legs in front of your center of gravity. Another option is sinking down on the back leg while you draw the twisted ankle and your CG up and back until you can lift the leg and try to place it a second time.<p>Most of your time in the gym is either isolating a limb or putting symmetric loads on both. That teaches you nothing about not falling.<p>One failure mode for old people is having their “knee give out”. Having experienced this myself now, I think it has very little to do with strength and more to do with twitchy motor cortex (in my case, possibly due to a prescription medicine). Highly, highly unpleasant. That same weight shifting trick kept me physically safe if not entirely emotionally so.')
