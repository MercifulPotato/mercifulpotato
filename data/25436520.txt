Item(by='1-6', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608073203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435890, text='I had the mini for a week and returned it for an SE2. The screen is slightly smaller on the SE2 but in a good way because your thumbs can reach better. It also lacks the cutout at the top. I have average size hands but my thumb can really roam around everywhere on the SE2&#x2F;iPhone 8 screen size. I just wish the SE2 had OLED and a bigger battery. That would have made it a tank of a phone. I really have to agree again with Steve Job&#x27;s old reasoning for small phones. It really changes how you interact with the phone. I&#x27;m happy to be able to pull up the control center from the bottom again rather than from the top right corner. Source: I&#x27;m an iPhone X convert.')
