You need an ability to build highly specialised software <i>and</i> you need general frameworks that will not be optimised for {specialised thing} but can do most of the things that you need for a certain task without having to hand write everything. Without the latter, all that happens is constant yak shaving and reinventions of the wheel. Rails (for example) is highly suitable for many things, getting clever points for not using it is great, but it&#x27;s not very practical.')
