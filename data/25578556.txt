Julian Assange and Edward Snowden come to mind.<p>Neither of those seem to be examples of habeas corpus being thrown out. Neither were &quot;disappeared&quot; and the court systems were used against Assange and nothing has happened to Snowden as of yet except for the legal system being used to try to keep him from earning money from his book.')
