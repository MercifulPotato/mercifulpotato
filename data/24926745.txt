For what it&#x27;s worth, most state-sanctioned cyberattacks are _not_ profit oriented. They rather aim to disrupt the operations of an organization (see: American cyberattacks against ISIL), establish deterrence (see: the US allegedly planting digital &quot;bombs&quot; in Russia&#x27;s networks), collect intelligence (see: the OPM hack). The exception being North Korea, a state that conducts cyberattacks for the explicit purpose of making money.')
