We don&#x27;t expect that anywhere else in life.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s best if there was a simple automated solution that worked in all cases, but there is no such thing. Password managers are great, but they don&#x27;t counter disinformation from sites you don&#x27;t have a password with. Preventing access to malicious sites only works if it&#x27;s known to be malicious; new sites will always slip through (and attackers can keep creating new sites), false positives are a problem, and not everyone can afford them. Reputation systems can be gamed.<p>In many cases you try to make it so that an attacker has to pass multiple barriers, instead of pinning your hopes on a single perfect solution. Usually there isn&#x27;t one.<p>So yes, DO display the URL; use fonts, lowercased domains, colorize each character by Unicode region, or whatever you have to do to help users detect when there could be a problem. Then let users check. Some URLs will slip through, but I&#x27;ll note that a LOT of people picked up the &quot;googIe.com&quot; in the survey - it wasn&#x27;t randomly distributed.<p>DO use a password manager. That will dramatically help if you&#x27;ve previously logged into that site.<p>I&#x27;m less excited about filtering domains, especially because some implementations are privacy disasters. But if done in a privacy-respecting way, I can see some value. But only SOME value - they are NOT a panacea. And many will not use them.<p>The goal isn&#x27;t to find the one true answer; the goal is to make it unlikely for an exploit attempt to work. If you CAN come up with a perfect automated defense that&#x27;s affordable, great, do that. In most circumstances you need multiple defensive mechanisms so that the attacker has to overcome multiple very different barriers.')
