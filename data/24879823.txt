I’ve been largely relying on the book <i>Apocalypse Never</i> by Michael Shellenberger. It’s well worth reading.<p>The (decade old) source you provided for energy subsidies appears somewhat dishonest, as the date ranges appear cherry picked. Why is it that the source only looks at nuclear subsidies up until 1999, while subsidies to other energy sources are considered through 2009?<p>The choice of units in this source is also odd. What have the subsidies been in terms of energy output? At its peak, nuclear was producing some 16-20% of US power. I imagine normalizing on a $&#x2F;MWh basis could paint a different picture.<p>Looking at a more recent source [0], it appears that recent nuclear subsidies have been marginal and are far outpaced by renewable subsidies. If we consider prior subsidies a sunk cost, it doesn’t necessarily make sense to subsidize a new, less environmentally friendly, source of energy when our best in class is already excellent.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.ei.columbia.edu&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;energy-subsidies-renewables-fossil-fuels&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.ei.columbia.edu&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;energy-subsidies-re...</a>')
