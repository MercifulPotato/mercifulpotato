Issue is to get it clinical grade. Without clinical grade it&#x27;s very high probability you&#x27;ll get very sick or even kill yourself due to contaminants. Anything you inject instead of ingest has to have levels of purity that are very annoying to follow to say the leasr. Small batch \nclinicall grade formulations like these can cost hundreds of thousands PER dose, last I heard. But I might be outdated in that info.')
