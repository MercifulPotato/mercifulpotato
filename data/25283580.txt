Renewables (esp. solar and wind) are, yes, dropping in cost exponentially, and this means they are currently zooming past fossil fuels in terms of affordability.  There&#x27;s an issue in regards to batteries, but that also seems to be on a learning curve that makes it better every year, so that won&#x27;t buy fossil fuels much more time.<p>Now, instead of rooting for that change, we can think about the actual consequences.  It&#x27;s inevitable; fossil fuels are on the way out.  What does that mean, besides lower carbon?<p>It means that countries which rely on fossil fuels for their economy, are going to see the same kind of crushing economic decline that, say, the UK coal industry has.<p>What do you suppose happens when, for example, Saudi Arabia can no longer feed itself?  It just peacefully and gently starves to death?<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying we should somehow try to prevent fossil fuels exiting the scene.  The change in energy sources to lower-carbon ones is an old one, and there&#x27;s no way to stop it, nor should we try.  Wood gave way to coal and then oil and then natural gas, and the process will continue with zero-carbon sources like photovoltaics.  That&#x27;s a bullet that&#x27;s already been fired, and there&#x27;s no way to stuff it back inside the barrel of the gun.<p>But, do we really have a plan for the consequences, not only in Saudi Arabia but also every other nation that&#x27;s dependent on oil?  Hint: we do not.')
