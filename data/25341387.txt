Item(by='grawprog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607398095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25340923, text='&gt;FWIW, I strongly prefer square grids for tabletop games.<p>I agree mostly, though i prefer hex grids for war games and square grids for rpgs&#x2F;roguelikes.<p>Hex grids allow for more units in a given encounter, plus, i&#x27;m likely biased as the first tabletop war game i ever played was battle masters which used a huge hex grid map and a card draw system for movement with some &#x27;cool skull dice&#x27; for battles and big plastic figures on bases with flags for units. There was like 6-7 unique unit types for each side, including a special unique unit for each army with special abilities. You got to build an awesome plastic tower units could occupy, it was basically orcs vs humans like the first warcraft. My 8-9 year old self was pretty stoked.<p>Also, for some reason i remember there was an elven shortsword item card that had this description<p>&#x27;Light as a moonbeam, sharp as a tiger&#x27;s claw&#x27;<p>That&#x27;s really stuck in my head as the definitive description of elvish&#x2F;elfish(for you pedantic Tolkien fans) weapons.<p>Just seems fitting.')
