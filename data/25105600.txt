Lilium is claiming 300km range at 300km&#x2F;hour, and appears to transition nicely to horizontal flight. Maybe not a great glide ratio on those stubby little wings, but it looks safer than quadcopters. They don&#x27;t need all 36 ducted fans for normal flight, so eating a bird shouldn&#x27;t spell death.<p>Has anybody else shown off similar craft? Uber Air&#x27;s eVTOL looks about 50% CGI&#x2F;50% hype, but maybe I&#x27;ve missed something.')
