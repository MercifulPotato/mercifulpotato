Anything more expensive is your responsibility. To expect them to have insurance that covers more would be a waste of money to customers on a budget. Either get insurance that covers your expensive belongings (and accept that it will cost a lot because your belongings might not be securely locked up all the time) or securely lock up your expensive stuff.<p>It is unclear that the host secured the property to the standard required by airbnb and their insurance but that would be a matter between airbnb and the host not between the host and guest.')
