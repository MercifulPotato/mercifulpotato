Before they switched it off, you&#x27;d be able to see your boundary from outside its fencing. Some users report being able to see the boundary from a different room. So not only does the headset map your environment inside the boundary, it actually maps and parses the rest as well. It doesn&#x27;t have GPS so it wouldn&#x27;t know how otherwise to determine your position relative to the boundary. This means Oculus maps every space it is in, including the objects in it. Really, this tells FB far more about your life and general affluence than any type of browsing behavior ever could.<p>Same goes for fitness tracking. Inside actual fitness games but in other VR titles as well. Again, this generates a ton of very personal data that, combined with other databases, unlocks a ton of value for advertisers.<p>This is why FB is so adamant about using FB profiles, even banning users if they make a guest account: For all this data to be really valuable, you need to be able to have it down to an individual resolution (that is: You know all the data is generated by a single individual, so you can combine it).<p>All of this, combined with existing data-generation, is a whole new level of invasion of privacy.')
