As for the 5nm, we don&#x27;t have them yet even though they should release in a few months, but we have processors of the same architecture on a different process.<p>The M1 Mac Mini can only edit 8K video at a fairly low quality if you use the accelerated encode. If you&#x27;re actually going to be doing real editing, you&#x27;re going to only be using the 8K decode, and for that you can look at literally any Renoir APU system.<p>The cheapest system with a Renoir APU capable of accelerated 8K decode is 340$, so half of the cost of the Mac Mini.<p>As for this :<p>&gt;You are talking in circles. This same exact hardware is used to decode lower resolution video. Benefits reach down to 6k, 4k, 2k, 1080p, 720p, etc etc. Any encoding you do<p>It&#x27;s only talking in circles if you ignore the rest of the comment. Accelerated encode and decode with similar architectural efficiency is <i>already there</i>. The main advantage Apple has here is that, for a few months, they have a more power efficient process.<p>As for encode, literally no one has a solid use case for a laptop and hardware encoding over 1080p. For streaming video, anywhere over 1080p is useless on a laptop, and for actual video encoding, no one uses embedded accelerated encode because it&#x27;s inherently of lower quality.<p>But sure, if for some absurd reason you want to edit video directly in 8K and don&#x27;t care about the abysmal rendering times at high qualities, you can buy a 340$ Renoir SBC, enable Hardware Decode on your favorite video editing software, and be on your merry way with accelerated real-time decode of 8K - as long your video files are h264 or h265.')
