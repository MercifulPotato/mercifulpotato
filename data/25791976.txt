Especially mobile ones. There&#x27;s practically zero difference between Haswell and Whiskey Lake (5 years newer) core performance. Even Ice Lake was a minor improvement.<p>But the power consumption has dropped, heat generation has dropped (a lot of it because they abandoned FIVR), IGP performance has increased and they started supporting DDR4, so <i>overall</i> performance has increased.<p>I personally lament the death of the mobile socket. I hope AMD still has socketed mobile processors, but I doubt it. They&#x27;re only useful for people who want to upgrade or fix their laptops themselves, people who want to resell their old laptop&#x2F;parts, and the environment.')
