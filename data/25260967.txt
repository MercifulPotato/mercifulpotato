I just started listening a couple of weeks ago and find it fascinating and very informative. The episodes can be quite long. I usually listen while working out and it takes me 3-5 days to get through a single episode, but it&#x27;s as good as anything else out there. Also highly recommend the Plenary Session podcast with oncologist Vinay Prasad, who has had several COVID-focused episodes.')
