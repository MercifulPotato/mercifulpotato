How does it help you and do you refer back to it?<p>It can work different ways at different times in different circumstances.  I&#x27;ve kept a diary for 40 years since I was a teenager, and tried a number of ways.<p>When I&#x27;ve wanted to change my own behaviour, for example, to be less critical of others, or less socially awkward, I&#x27;d document episodes of my own thoughts and behaviour that I didn&#x27;t like, and read them back so I could see myself better, recognise patterns, and learn to avoid them.<p>That method works for some kinds of change better than others.  For something like changing my diet, for example, by eating less sugar, I found documentation and review useful.  I&#x27;d document episodes, then read them back, and write notes to myself about what to do next time.  It&#x27;s a good way to see the lead up to an unwanted behaviour e.g. didn&#x27;t pack a lunch for the football game or a road trip, so ended up buying junk food.<p>It&#x27;s important to record positive experiences.  e.g. &quot;ate a beautiful salad and loved the balsamic vinaigrette recipe from Tony.&quot;  Or, &quot;Alan said something unwise again, but I shut up this time and let it pass, which felt much better the next day.&quot;  These make a big difference when reading back compared to self-criticism.<p>At times, reading the diary back has sort of backfired by entrenching behaviour.  This for me was particularly true of social and romantic situations.  I&#x27;d document episodes too self-critically, which made it painful to re-read, and the more I&#x27;d re-read these writings, the more I&#x27;d dislike myself and assume a negative self-image.<p>I switched to just writing positive versions of my own history.  That was interesting.  Writing affirmatively enabled me to develop a new inner voice.  Once it was established, I could rely on it.  I think that&#x27;s a key thing about diaries - the opinions and meta observations become voices that you carry around in your head.  If you treat it like a lucid dream, I think you can use those voices constructively by deliberately writing them in a persona you like.<p>Eventually, like after decades, I stopped re-reading my diaries, except on rare occasions when I needed to find out a fact such as where I was on a particular date. I deliberately stopped reading my reflections on myself, to spare myself from meta-dislike.  That was a good move.  I still get the benefit of writing things down, which bring them to my attention, but that&#x27;s enough.  I don&#x27;t need to re-read what I&#x27;ve written to know what is in my diary.  I just concentrate on making new episodes that will be more pleasurable to have in future pages.<p>As for facts such as names, dates, places and things - diaries are great.  I still pause every now and then to just jot down key markers for each date in a text file, and store it away in a folder called journal.  Just the key facts are extremely useful for recall of all kinds of associations.')
