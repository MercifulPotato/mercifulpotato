Contrary to what you say, he didn&#x27;t took power through violent means. His party was elected to the Reishstag and he was then nominated chancelor. Of course, I don&#x27;t compare Trumpism to Nazism. We are not there yet. But your argument that giving context to Trumps blalant lies (I hope we agree on the lying part) like twitter do is leading to violence is an absolutist position that is very far from the liberal ideals of the founders.')
