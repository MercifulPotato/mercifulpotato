I&#x27;ve used emacs for 8 years and switched in July, and I can see myself using this for the next 10 years.<p>I tried Spacemacs, and the vim integration was so sloppy that the first time I tried to install a single package I was dumped in with unfamiliar emacs bindings, which I then had to look up to even get out of it.
