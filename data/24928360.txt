I&#x27;m still super interested in learning new things. Actually interested in entire knowledge domains I wasn&#x27;t before.<p>What seems to have changed is that I have less patience for, though, is learning ephemeral and arcane ways of doing something I already know how to do.<p>Learn to use microcontrollers? Sure! Never really dove in there, seems like an opportunity. Timeless mathematical knowledge? Totally game. Another front-end framework? Not really interested, maybe I&#x27;ll wait and see if it survives 5 years and I can actually find people who can talk intelligently about the problems it solves rather than bearing thought-smell terms like &quot;modern&quot; as a fashionable totem.<p>Reserve new learning for new capabilities.')
