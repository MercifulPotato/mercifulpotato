And you could buy your own freedom after three years. (on the other hand they can&#x27;t be sure if the average age of thirty for gladiators is correct)<p>Now you would have it much worse if you were a slave at a silver mine, that would have been the worst fate for a slave - it would be a certain death sentence.<p>Also slaves in a city were much better off in general than slaves working on farms.')
