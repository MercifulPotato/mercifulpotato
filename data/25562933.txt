It is fine as corporations&#x27; sole purpose is to give shareholders value, but don&#x27;t color it around HR bs to fool people. As least most companies are this way, the exceptions are few. People are not dumb once they realize they are disposable and start smelling the bs.<p>I think why most people complain about management is due to their false sense of leadership and character, pretending to be virtuous, while stabbing workers in the back (i.e. hypocrisy). There are not many good managers or employers- most lack real leadership or morals<p>If by &quot;culture&quot; you mean, a group of people with the same attitudes and goals- there is no denying that humans work better in groups. Just keep the &quot;do-good&quot; BS out please...unless you really meant it by embodying those ideals- living as example.')
