(The grandparent post would certainly not be enough.)<p>But you&#x27;ve been caught into a hole you (and grandparent poster) have dug for yourself, by trying to explain it fully. A better explanation for a five year old would be something like: satellites all fly high above us, and we are putting more and more satellites up there, and eventually they will crash into each other, and then into other satellites, and so on, until there is nothing but broken satellites flying up there.<p>If the kid is interested and has more questions about &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; (the favourite world exploration tools for every kid), only then it&#x27;s time to introduce him or her to gravity , the fact that Earth is round, and the basics of orbital mechanics.')
