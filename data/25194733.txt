It would be much more efficient to use the chromatic scale as a base instead.<p>Your approach is simply not feasible. Let me demonstrate.<p>Here are some options:<p>The newly chromatic keyboard is all white&#x2F;black&#x2F;white&#x2F;black alternated keys, WBWBWBWBWBWB for one octave.<p>How do you look at that and figure out where C is?<p>Likewise, a new keyboard can be all white keys. WWWWWWWWWWWW<p>How do you know where anything is?<p>We need <i>some</i> patterns in order for our brains to be oriented to the instrument. The pattern of WBWBWWBWBWBW (standard 12-note sequence on keyboards), is a well-understood one that makes it practical for keyboardists to make music.<p>If there exists a 3rd option which makes orientability and fast muscle memory easier than it is, it needs to be innovated.<p>You seem to think that making the keyboard more symmetrical, or more uniform, or different somehow, makes it easier to learn. It doesn&#x27;t work that way. However if you in fact have an improvement not obvious to those in the industry, many players would be thankful for your work. The field of music and music instrument technology is alive and well and waiting for your invention.<p>Now to address your mode concept..... Your presumption that everything is just Ionian mode transposed is absolutely incorrect. Each different mode (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian and Locrian (those are all modes of <i>just</i> the major scale)) has its own identity.  I&#x27;m surprised that you as a musician are unaware&#x2F;blind to this, or consider it &quot;needless complexity imposed by the vain professional musician community&quot;. Also, altered dominants and the various minor modes, in addition to the major scale modes I mentioned. Yes that adds up to probably 300 or 400 scales. Which takes a lot of work, regardless of whether you have a standard keyboard or a WWWWWWWWWWWW keyboard.')
