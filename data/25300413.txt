Packages that you installed a while ago may be using a different one, but it&#x27;s not like every package has massively divergent dependencies.<p>Because of the immutable store, you can do file level deduplication, so if you have multiple versions of the same packages, you can deduplicate the identical files.<p>I think the worries about disk usage are relevant, but only on systems with small amounts of storage. These are still relevant though, and it&#x27;s an important area to improve on. As for burning CPU time, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a perfect solution to avoid this, but I think Guix is pretty good. Guix provides substitutes, so you don&#x27;t have to build things locally on every machine (I&#x27;m looking at you Rubygems, pip and Python stuff is pretty bad also).')
