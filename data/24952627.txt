Cars can transfer owners just fine. If the car is wrecked and declared <i>salvage</i>, the software value is gone and only the parts can be used. If you rebuild the VIN you don’t magically get the software features back because in the Tesla DB it’s a salvaged car and they can’t (or won’t) be liable for it.')
