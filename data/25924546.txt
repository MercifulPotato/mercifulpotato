Was told the claims were very concerning, and that there was a quite clear problem that would be investigated. A few months later, I was informed the problem had been resolved, though on inspection, nothing had changed. I learned their investigation involved asking the person of interest if everything was legitimate, to which they said yes. Investigation closed. I am truly disappointed at what has become of the industry I used to appreciate so much.')
