Show me the code.<p>I mostly agree with you, but also don&#x27;t want to be too developer-centric. Sometimes the ideas come from people who aren&#x27;t primarily developers - production engineers, system architects, etc. Let&#x27;s say an idea from such a person is fundamentally good and will benefit the project but they lack the time or skill to do more than prototype it. What should happen?<p>(a) Drop it on the floor.<p>(b) Let their patch(es) languish and eventually get reaped. Same result in terms of functionality, plus contributes to an &quot;maintainers aren&#x27;t open to new ideas&quot; reputation which harms recruitment&#x2F;retention.<p>(c) Get a developer with more knowledge&#x2F;skill to finish it. In general, this is just going to be the maintainer, because nobody else will have a strong enough sense of ownership to sacrifice time toward their own goals for it.<p>Obviously this is going to be case by case, but I&#x27;d say that (c) is at least <i>sometimes</i> a valid answer. Depending on the makeup of people involved with the project, which in turn might depend on the nature of the project itself, it might even be quite often.')
