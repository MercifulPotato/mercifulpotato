If they have copied more than 14 sequential concepts, they are entering the legal grey area because they are clearly directly relying on having the source text sitting in front of them.<p>Kids learn in school that if you need to copy from a text that is sitting in front of you as you type, you need to cite it. Otherwise they are plagiarizing. Grown ups should be held to a similar standard and remember the value of human creativity that is unaugmented by copy and paste computing or AI spun word hash.')
