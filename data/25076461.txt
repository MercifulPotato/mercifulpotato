Surveillance, new taxes, repeal of tax breaks, new regulation, prohibition of assembly (in direct contradiction with 1a in the US, but only for certain groups) - think of the children, the ends justify the means! This very much reminds me of the legislative abuse that happened in the US after 9&#x2F;11, consequences of which were extremely far reaching, and are getting worse over time even today, nearly 20 years later.')
