If I sell my iPhone, I&#x27;m not selling the apps that I have installed on it.<p>A side effect of this approach is that you could get a new Tesla and log in to activate the features you already paid for. If you crash your Model 3 and insurance buys you a new one, should you have to pay for Autopilot again?<p>That said, that approach may piss off people as well. Imagine paying $50k for a Tesla, and only being able to get $30k when you sell it because you paid $20k for features that won&#x27;t transfer over to the new owner. Even worse if your new car isn&#x27;t a Tesla: that money would be lost.')
