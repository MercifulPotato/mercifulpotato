I can&#x27;t give away my teapot while also keeping it, but I can give away a copy of a book. In the same way I can&#x27;t really &quot;steal&quot; someone&#x27;s intellectual property because it&#x27;s hard to take away ideas, or every copy of a work, such that the original author no longer has access to them.')
