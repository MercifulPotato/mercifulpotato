It&#x27;s also compelled speech, and in some cases leaves violence as the only resort, as opposed to a conversation and de-conversion from extremist beliefs. We&#x27;ve seen abuse of it in several cases, if no one is offended, they&#x27;ll create a group or pay someone to be offended. There&#x27;s no burden of proof beyond someone&#x27;s emotional state upon hearing the words. You can say something to two people of a group, one might think its funny and laugh, another might report you and call the cops.<p>Also, turns out you can yell fire in a theater, especially if you at least believe it to be true, and that&#x27;s something courts can&#x27;t determine, lots of people say things that they believe to be true, that turn out to be false. Likewise, if speech is dangerous but true, its still should be protected.<p>In either case, best this be settled in courts and legislation, not corporate meeting rooms that are echo chambers of opinion.<p>&gt;If we&#x27;re talking about at the society level, because it threatens democracy, peace, individuals safety<p>We already have laws against that, its why hate speech laws are usually redundant and likely to be abused and scope creep into silencing valid criticism of an individual or group of individuals who can then be offended and have you arrested, at the very least putting you through months and years of legal trouble before you&#x27;re acquitted, and that&#x27;s only if you can afford proper defense.<p>You people need to look at history. It boggles me how uneducated people are today on the context of this issue.<p>Even the person that did the Parlor leak is a Meiklejohnian absolutist.')
