It loads the mind with (sometimes obviously) false data that must be rejected and the ability to pattern match on word usage or even guessing between answers that haven&#x27;t been eliminated means that the instructor never really knows if the person actually knew the answer and neither does the student.<p>When I used to participate in math contests I&#x27;d go out of my way not to read the answers before attempting to solve the problem because it&#x27;s much more gratifying that to reverse engineer the problem from the input. In the end, I&#x27;d resort to that or guessing if I couldn&#x27;t crack the problem on my own, but then at least I knew which problems I really solved and which ones I didn&#x27;t. And when I was invited to do more complex math contests than the ones that Waterloo was putting out I was astonished at how much harder just having to write in an exact answer was, since you missed out on the &quot;not one of the options&quot; feedback if you flubbed a number somewhere.<p>With these certification tests it&#x27;s impossible to really do the same thing. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like real thinking compared to writing software or prose. Also the pointless memorization of things like &quot;what classes of MITM attacks are there?&quot;[0] don&#x27;t really get a person to learn the stuff. It&#x27;s like memorizing the atomic weight of elements. That stuff never stuck for me until I was doing real chemistry and the basic act of looking up a weight each time slowly got me to memorize the elemental weight of the chemicals I was working on. Same goes for all those French words I was forced to learn in Canada. Once I started wanted to speak Russian I was amazed at my ability to actually be able to remember words.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these things should never be tested. I wouldn&#x27;t trust a structural engineer that didn&#x27;t know what lateral torsional buckling is[1] but the manner in which we test it should be as close the reality we would expect, and this is what we do in engineering school most of the time.<p>[0] Answer: Surveil, Fabricate, Modify, and Deny.<p>[1] Essentially the concept that a tall but thin beam can swing to the side, or &quot;torsionally buckle&quot; when loaded from the top (thus requiring bracing) unlike a beam rotated 90 degrees, which does not require bracing for this reason.')
