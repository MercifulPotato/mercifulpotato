Even then, some in the war council were still against surrender but they followed orders from the Emperor.<p>The people who believe nuclear weapons had nothing to do with the surrender always underestimate or ignore the opinion of the Emperor and simply put it as an &#x27;excuse&#x27; rather then his actual opinion. His decision to come out with a clear opinion, against tradition, was not because the Soviets rolled up some Japanese armies in a far away land but rather what was happening to his subjects. That makes way more sense.<p>If you want to call it an &#x27;excuse&#x27; then that fine also, but even so, a war its over then the other side admits its over. The war had been military decided for years, if it took nukes to give them an &#x27;excuse&#x27; and allowed the emperor to make a statement then that is still the effect of that weapon.')
