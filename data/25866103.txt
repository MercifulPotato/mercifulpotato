It was (and still is) glorious!<p>Having those experiences as a child was amazing, and I heartily recommend visiting museums to everyone.<p>I&#x27;ve been to the Rijksmuseum too, and it&#x27;s pretty amazing.  In Amsterdam, I do like the Van Gogh Museum more, but that&#x27;s more personal preference than anything else.
