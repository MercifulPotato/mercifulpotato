The T-Mobile call person kept asking me &quot;Are you <i>sure</i> you didn&#x27;t go into a store in Detroit and ask for your phone to be changed? They showed an ID!&quot; No, I didn&#x27;t do that.<p>Luckily I had 2-factor for everything, but I know some people who lost a lot. SMS is totally broken, use 2FA and hardware key if you can.<p>The craziest one was two people at another firm were sending each other a lot of money, and sent the address over Telegram. The hacker manipulated the address in the message - they checked after the (failed) transaction and the address sent was different than the address in the message received! I think the most likely cause was that the receiver&#x27;s computer was rooted and the application itself was manipulated on the device, rather than the message contents changed en-route. This is why I recommend both visual and audio confirmation when sending large amounts.')
