The 2,000 year old aqueducts were massively overbuilt, not because they wanted them to stay up forever but because they didn&#x27;t know how to make them stand up for 20 years without building in a factor of 100 safety margin.<p>Our aqueducts won&#x27;t last 2,000 years, but we built them for a fraction of the cost. They&#x27;ll fall down in 100 years, but we&#x27;ll rebuild them with something even stronger and even cheaper.')
