It&#x27;s similar to me with the situation we had where high-end automobiles used to put a lot of effort into their touchscreen &quot;entertainment&quot; systems: systems that always sucked and made an otherwise-luxury car feel like a PC Junior. Thankfully, most of them have switched over to Android Auto or Apple CarPlay, where I get a MUCH better UI that, importantly, I can update on a much more frequent basis than my entire car, from companies that know how to build digital UIs.<p>High end &quot;dumb TV&quot; plus Chromecast (or whatever competitor) is the best solution for me.')
