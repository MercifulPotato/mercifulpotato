Look at this bit in particular:<p>&gt; This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units<p>Notice how it uses &quot;parallel&quot; to mean that the concurrent units (to use the quoted terminology) are actually executing at the same time, exactly as my previous comment says. OK, it avoided talking about &quot;physical processors&quot; or &quot;cores&quot;, but that&#x27;s what this boils down to on practical digital computers. Maybe the wording in my last comment wasn&#x27;t 100% perfect, and there are some slight differences on details (e.g. the quoted Wikipedia text only seems concerned with processing-bound units of execution, not IO-bound waiting) but it&#x27;s clearly talking about the same two definitions.')
