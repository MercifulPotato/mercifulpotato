A large percentage of the cost is music licensing. I think the solution is the streaming services like Spotify either 1) comes up with more revenue streams 2) Raise prices on their core business, the subscription prices higher than $10 a month. If the second option is happening, I am sure we will get another HN discussion post, with some people complaining its too expensive. So we have to think, are we the consumer, by demanding that we want cheap &quot;all you can eat&quot; music subscription, we are hurting the musicians? If you think about it, $10 a month is two cups of Starbucks coffee. I drink more cups of coffee a month than that. And how much effort is it to make two cups of coffee and the coffee beans are industrially produced? Versus a musicians writing a song and perform the song? I claim the latter involves much more effort.<p>Also lets remember how we ended up with the $10&#x2F;month all you can eat subscription. Pirating, CD rips, online MP3 sharing, Youtube music videos, etc. The majority of the people don&#x27;t want to pay for music anymore. I feel people are more likely to value a physical good. For example: I feel somewhat balanced for paying $5 for that Starbucks coffee because I get a physical thing in the end. In the early 2000s, the computer and internet was the new thing, not everyone used it, and it was a bit complicated. So using it made me feel like I am &quot;smarter&quot;, more frontier chasing, more elite than others. And there were ideals like internet freedom, free access to information. And then when I discovered there is MP3s, copy and paste, BitTorrent and Napster, I felt like I have just been bestowed special powers. Through my &quot;hard&quot; work with computers, I gained the rights to listen to music for free. I actually felt I was righteous to download music from the Internet and listen to them. Had content locked behind a paywall, had to pay for that? It was against internet freedom, it was an outrage. Then I remember when Steven Jobs later came out with Itunes and every song is 99 cents. I felt, 99 cents? alright, it&#x27;s only a dollar and really not that much. That was the first time I started to actually pay for music. But the music industry and musicians were outraged because Steve Jobs is making their work worth only a dollar. Job&#x27;s point was that if you charge people more than 99 cents a song, people would just pirate. I agree with him. The later &quot;all you can streaming&quot; subscription came out with the competitive advantage being even cheaper than Itune&#x27;s a dollar a song purchase scheme.<p>But then everyone as the desire to seek for cheaper prices and better access. Maybe its just natural progression of things and we can&#x27;t fault for that. Stakeholders have to adapt for change in behavior and landscapes. I believe the advantages nowadays for a musician is that &quot;getting yourself known and advertise yourself&quot; is cheaper than ever. And there are so many people out there that you can easily reach that even a niche artist can find audiences. Its much easier now to create a fanbase and consistently communicate and maintain a fanbase. And when you have a fanbase, you just have to figure out how to monetize that. Concerts, fan items, album sales, even sponsorship and advertisement, a Youtube channel makes you a lot of money already. Look at the amount of fans a Youtuber and TikTok star has and how much they earn money from the fanbase and popularity, they make a lot. Justin Bieber became a star on Youtube and that jump started his career. Lindsey Stirling became a star because of Youtube. Without the internet and &quot;free access&quot; to content the internet is providing, I don&#x27;t think both will be as well known as they are now. Not sure if they would even stay as artists.')
