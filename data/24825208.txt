But are they the best suited to do it?<p>Our experience shows that because incentives differ in production and off-line labelling, the Domain Team might create biased (subjective) dataset in Human-In-The-Loop settings.<p>Adding an extra team that was trained by the Domain Team but can only influence end-to-end performance through the deployed model helped to keep the training dataset objective while improving the productionised pipeline and helping the Domain Team.<p>First time HN poster, please share your recommendations in the comments. We are working on a &quot;Machine Learning Product Manual&quot; ebook about best practices to productionise and operate ML from a product perspective.
