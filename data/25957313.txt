We can&#x27;t build every building on the water front, and the land requirements would be enormous if all apartment blocks where to have equally beautiful vistas from three side.<p>Something like the Barbican in London tries to provide it&#x27;s own views by having a courtyard. That only works on one side of the building, and your other views depends on what London have decided to built. Habitat 67 have some of this, by having multiple terraces and an interesting shape, but mostly gets its views from being on an peninsula.')
