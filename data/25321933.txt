If we had to farm like we did a few hundred years ago, civilization would collapse and billions would die.<p>For better or worse, we are committed to either becoming a multi planetary species able to make planets suit us, including Earth, and collapsing into something worse than the Stone Age given we have used up all the easily accessible mineral and fossil fuel deposits.<p>So, I think worrying about stuff that can happen centuries later is a waste of time. A few centuries ago people could not imagine we would be able to instantly communicate across the world, cross the Atlantic Ocean in less than a day, or walk on the moon. The best thing we can do is maximize human potential.')
