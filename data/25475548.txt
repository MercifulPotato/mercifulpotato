The reason older music is often seen as better is that time has filtered out the generic crap with no staying power. And so I second the recommendation to check out older music; it&#x27;s easier to find quality stuff. And, like watching a TV series after it finishes airing, when you find something you like, you don&#x27;t have to wait to check out the rest of it.')
