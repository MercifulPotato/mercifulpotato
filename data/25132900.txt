But the idea in the post is closer to a whitelist: the highest priority sites (tier 1) should be set manually, and anything after that should be weighted by how often it&#x27;s referenced by the tier 1 sites. For a lot of searches you&#x27;re going to have to pull <i>many</i> results to fill a page with stuff from a small handful of domains, and in fact you might not be able to get them at all. And that&#x27;s before you start dealing with the weighting issue, which would require quite a bit of metadata to be sent with each request.')
