There&#x27;ll always be differences in everyone&#x27;s moral fiber, but generally speaking, be professionial, be efficient, come up with a plan to build every project that comes your way, ybe willing to say &quot;No&quot; when everyone else wants you to say &quot;Yes&quot; when put in a position in opposition to the interests of the Public.<p>It&#x27;ll change from country to country, but the essence of it is universal to the field of endeavor, and legalism should have nothing to do with it.<p>Note discretion is nowhere included in that except maybe implied in professional. That&#x27;s intended; as Engineers, we all must be on guard for those building things harmful to the public, and be willing, if Fate deems it necessary to inform other Engineers of the danger, and educate the non-Engineer enough that they can come to a reasonable conclusion on the matter, even if they don&#x27;t end up swinging the way we think they should.<p>For ours is a postion of systemic guardianship and stewardship of the Will, made manifest through artifice, of humanity. Every nut and bolt fastened, every line of code written, compiled, interpreted, and executed; every transmission, transaction, every automated task, and task left unautomated is another fold in the delicate structure of the societies in whose service we ply our trade.')
