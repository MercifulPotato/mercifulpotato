(A tiny few might be from people trying to figure out which races are worth donating towards.)<p>So that puts 538 into this awkward position where their audience is demanding something that 538 is unable to provide, but if they get too in-your-face in saying, &quot;look, that&#x27;s not how this works&quot;, then they stand to lose a lot of ad revenue during peak season.<p>That leads them to do very silly things, like bury this:<p>&gt; <i>A 10 percent chance of winning, which is what our forecast gives Trump, is roughly the same as the odds that itâ€™s raining in downtown Los Angeles. And it does rain there.</i><p>...in the same page as this:<p>&gt; <i>We simulate the election 40,000 times to see who wins most often.</i><p>And that&#x27;s some bullshit.<p>Silver and the rest of his staff over the last few months have spent a CVS receipt&#x27;s worth of text on what went wrong with their predictions -- er, sorry, &quot;models&quot; -- in 2016, and why this year is different, and how uncertainty works, and why they&#x27;re offering no guarantees really, &quot;but please do keep coming back, and hey check out this cool new simulator thingy where you too can make guesses that are about as accurate as ours&quot;.<p>I almost really wouldn&#x27;t care, except for one kind of big problem with 538: It is a political observer-effect in action.<p>Journos, hacks, and other newspeople trying to get one more page impression or soundbite before the end of the day keep referencing 538. When 538 says a candidate is doing well according to their models, it can and almost certainly is changing people&#x27;s behavior. Likewise when 538 says a candidate is doing poorly. That&#x27;s hugely problematic and, annoyingly, the more accurate 538 becomes, the more pronounced and dangerous this effect will be.')
