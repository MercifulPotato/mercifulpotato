He created imaginary &quot;profits&quot; on paper and paid out &quot;returns&quot; to investors who wanted to cash out. The scheme worked as long as no one tried to withdraw enough returns to take his bank account balance below $0. The fear is that Tether is a similar scheme to inject fake money into the Bitcoin ecosystem, which can&#x27;t realistically be proved unless people try to withdraw more USDT than Tether has in their bank account, at which point the system implodes.')
