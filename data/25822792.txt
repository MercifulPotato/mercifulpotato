The way I handle bug reports is to say “Hey, look, I just can’t fix this right now because I’m working full time and don’t know when I’ll be able to get around to fixing this without getting paid for my work.”  E.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samboy&#x2F;MaraDNS&#x2F;issues&#x2F;84" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samboy&#x2F;MaraDNS&#x2F;issues&#x2F;84</a><p>I can see why a lot of people don’t do that: It’s a little rude, and there’s a small but significant chance it’ll become a flame war.  I have only once had someone get rude in a ticket when I told them “That’s not a bug report, but a support issue”; I ended up deleting the ticket.  GitHub also allows you to edit or delete other people’s comments in your tickets, as well as locking the conversation.')
