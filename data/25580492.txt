The arms race that is going to be necessary to secure your home and workplace against these is going to be very expensive and ugly, and many people are going to have to settle with every conversation and sexual encounter they have being in public, if only for the lulz.<p>Privacy, like the fight against piracy, isn&#x27;t going to be defeated because it&#x27;s desirable or not, but rather just because the technology and temptation is inevitable.')
