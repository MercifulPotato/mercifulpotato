I think this should be the default mode for stupid (counter-factual) opinions. I know it&#x27;s hard but you are not the richest companies for nothing. Figure it out.<p>I think letting platforms just delete whatever causes an outrage is delaying the moment when we will finally get these kinds of things presented with proper fact based context instead of surrounded by ads and links to similarly stupid speech.')
