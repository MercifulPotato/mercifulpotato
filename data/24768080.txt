I thought I would lean on the collective knowledge of the community.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a white-label software portal where clients can log-in to access reports, company news, and company research -- basically a portal with company news on the homepage, a section of PDF reports, and a section of PDF research notes.<p>You&#x27;d think this would be simple to find (!), but I just cannot find it... everything comes with collaborative features for document editing, voice calling facilities, and much else besides.<p>I just want to provide someone with a log-in, so they can access some files on a branded interface. Am I going mad, or doesn&#x27;t this exist?')
