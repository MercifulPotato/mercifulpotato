The hardware captures energy and sends out a signal which can be interpreted by a computer.<p>A key principle these groups leverage is backscatter (mentioned in the article). You send on a specific carrier wave frequency. The receiving device downshifts the frequency, storing the difference in frequency as energy. That harvested energy is used for computation, and a response is &quot;reflected&quot; back on a lower-frequency carrier wave frequency.<p>SATURN [1] is one of the best examples of how &quot;ubiquitous computing&quot; may create new paradigms in computing though clever hardware engineering.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmobile.org&#x2F;grav&#x2F;research-highlight&#x2F;saturn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmobile.org&#x2F;grav&#x2F;research-highlight&#x2F;saturn</a>')
