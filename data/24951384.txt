The phone is less than two years old, but I don&#x27;t know what recourse I have.<p>&gt;  Sure, some companies, like Samsung, try to offer some exclusive features. Just avoid them.<p>If your advice is to ignore the largest manufacturer and manufacturers of the most high end devices, that says a lot about the state of the ecosystem. Samsung and huawei have both had massive incompatiblies with other devices and android products -  work profiles, pay, fit being my examples.<p>&gt; Although there are a lot of cheap Android devices to choose from that can drag down the brand reputation, I would really push back against the suggestion Androids are exclusively &quot;cheap&quot; in the pejorative sense<p>I never claimed they were cheap. My experience is with flagship devices and premium manufacturers, who in many cases are the same price as apple - a galaxy s20 is £900, a oneplus 8 is £800.')
