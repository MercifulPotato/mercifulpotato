The idea is that at first, you can be fired as per usual like any employee. But, if there&#x27;s a significant change in control of the company (e.x. M&amp;A of &gt;50% of outstanding shares), then _one_ of the triggers has been met. At that point, if you&#x27;re fired without cause, that&#x27;s the second trigger and remaining unvested shares immediately become fully vested.<p>Of course, I&#x27;ve since learned that pretty much _anything_ can be re-worked in an M&amp;A agreement -- &quot;we&#x27;re not buying you without striking this clause&quot; -- so it&#x27;s no silver bullet.')
