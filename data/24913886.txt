Not for myself, but for the developers who are only on the Mac for iOS development. I don&#x27;t think it does anyone any good to force them to be in a place where they don&#x27;t want to be. I have no ill will against iOS developers, but I also don&#x27;t want them to transform the Mac into something non-Mac. Mac has always been a &quot;niche&quot; platform, and that&#x27;s fine! Let the users who are here voluntarily stay, and let the users who are here only &quot;by force&quot; go to a platform that suits their needs better, perhaps iPad. If Xcode for iPad can facilitate that, I&#x27;m all in favor.')
