In fact, in the limit that the layer becomes <i>infinitely</i> wide, you just end up with a Gaussian process.  In practice a width of ~100--1000 is sufficient to get behavior that is pretty close to a Gaussian process, so in general doubling the width of a layer doesn&#x27;t gain you all that much compared to using those parameters for an extra layer.  The real representational power seems to come from increasing depth.')
