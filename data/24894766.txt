This seems like an obvious addition to a suite like that. Have you considered the defensibility of your product if your one feature is incorporated into a tool that many potential users are already familiar with and use daily?<p>Your intention to be industry-agnostic does partially mitigate this. Also I imagine you&#x27;d build your own suite with additional features if you get a foothold with this one.<p>Disclosure: I work at Linkfire, so don&#x27;t reply with anything you wouldn&#x27;t want a potential competitor to know.<p>Edit: I just realized that this actually is just one feature of a larger offering. Looks great!')
