A few observations&#x2F;tips (that I gave myself):<p>* I&#x27;ve noticed many don&#x27;t appreciate the bitterness as the bitterness needs to align with their beliefs and people their beliefs are different. If it doesn&#x27;t align, then all they feel are unpleasant emotions.<p>* Being&#x2F;feeling bitter is destroying my soul. Don&#x27;t give into it, I know you have your justifications. I have mine, but ultimately it&#x27;s a one way ticket to depression land and it&#x27;s not a fun place.<p>* Get rich on aspects that people don&#x27;t pay attention to (aka how I also happen to win resource-based boardgames). Some examples are here [1].<p>* Keep networking<p>* Keep improving<p>* While showing bitterness is a risky thing, showing that you&#x27;re looking for work is a good thing. Showing side projects is a good thing. Anything that looks constructive and positive in the area of where your needs aren&#x27;t being met is a good thing. So focus on applying, focus on building stuff.<p>* I know it&#x27;s tiring, but what I&#x27;m experiencing is that now that I&#x27;m working at a company that the job is easy, because web dev is relatively easy compared to what I did at uni.<p>Good luck, I hope that one day you&#x27;ll be happy again.<p>[1] Examples of getting rich on aspects that people don&#x27;t pay attention to (e.g. when going for a job that has bad pay):<p>- Flexible working hours<p>- Ability to work 4 days per week<p>- Amazing opportunity to learn<p>- Flexibility to work from wherever<p>- The flexibility to not always work at 100%<p>Examples for if you aren&#x27;t working (and can&#x27;t find a job):<p>- Freedom to work on whatever<p>- Freedom to network with whomever<p>- The freedom to work at a nice pace')
