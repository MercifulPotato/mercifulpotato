Everyone on HN who owns a luxury car Tesla in SV or some major metro with their six figure plus salary gets all bent out of shape, and ask &quot;omg why can&#x27;t everyone do this!&quot; It&#x27;s tone deaf and out of touch.<p>EVs simply are not there yet. They&#x27;re ludicrously expensive, inconvenient to refuel, don&#x27;t offer utility like ICE trucks&#x2F;SUVs, can&#x27;t be charged effectively without huge infrastructure investment. I&#x27;m not saying we aren&#x27;t making strides, I&#x27;m saying there are loads of improvements that need to come before EVs take over ICE sales to ultimately help us fight global problems.<p>EVs have never been about rich people having a toy. We need cheap EVs now to help us fight global climate change and frankly they aren&#x27;t there yet. You need to make massive assumptions for the vast majority of Americans to make EVs work compared to ICE vehicles.')
