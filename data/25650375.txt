Nor does it have a nuclear program or keeps hostages or refuses to join anti-terrorist transparency treaties.<p>&gt;The rest of the story: Because South Korea is effectively stealing $7B worth of oil from Iran.<p>OK, lets have any country which has a financial dispute with some other country takes hostages. That would be a nice world, right? That&#x27;s the world we&#x27;ll be at if Iran keeps being rewarded for its behaviour.')
