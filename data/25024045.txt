Item(by='randomsearch', descendants=None, kids=[25025020], score=None, time=1604823148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023555, text='&gt; The only thing this time was the politician was incompetently bad at hiding it.<p>Whilst all politicians bend the truth and perhaps most do tell a small number of outright lies, that does not make them comparable to Trump.<p>Trump repeatedly lies, contradicting himself - even within minutes of saying one thing, he&#x27;ll say the opposite. He doesn&#x27;t even acknowledge the idea that being truthful is important. This has had deadly consequences, for example in his inability to acknowledge the reality of the pandemic.<p>It&#x27;s not just the lying. The narcism and clownish behaviour  has made it impossible to take him seriously, and that has damaged America&#x27;s reputation - this does matter, your reputation matters when negotiating and trying to get things done internationally.<p>He&#x27;s also been hateful and offensive towards many individuals and groups. This is bad for social cohesion, but moreover our leaders should try to set an example for us to follow, not debase our society.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not arguing for or against his policies here, and I can understand why some people voted for him.<p>My point is that it&#x27;s <i>really</i> important not to normalise his behaviour. That way lies tyranny.')
