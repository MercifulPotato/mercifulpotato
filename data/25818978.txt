The change in public reaction to funeral restrictions in lock down when people attending a funeral got sick (and I think one died?) was noticeable. Reported consequences make the policy much harder to ignore. And if there hasn&#x27;t been enforcement the way human memory works, if on Tuesday a human decides complying with a rule is good, they are now more likely to <i>remember</i> having complied with it on Monday, and retrospectively they will come to believe &quot;obviously&quot; they always obeyed that policy, it was the sensible thing to do.<p>That&#x27;s cheaper <i>and</i> more effective than policing. But it may cost a few lives to provide the example.')
