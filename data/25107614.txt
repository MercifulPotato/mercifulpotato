Though I’ve gone through periods of continuous activity, it’s safe to say I lead a somewhat sedentary life. Today, at 26, I have been free of major gout symptoms since my first attack 2 years ago. Though I occasionally get mild inflammation in my gout-prone foot if I stray too far from my diet, I’ve been effectively symptom free since immediately course-correcting my diet following my diagnosis. My new diet is mostly plant based, though some fish and occasionally chicken seems to be safe from causing any symptoms. I’ve even been able to pick up running again.<p>My long term outlook however remains uncertain, and I will likely be doing semi-annual hematology profiles for the foreseeable future (my rheumatologist wants to have long term data on uric acid levels.)<p>I hope this serves as some relief for anyone who has been recently diagnosed and is looking for positive reassurance about the changes they’re considering for themselves. YMMV.')
