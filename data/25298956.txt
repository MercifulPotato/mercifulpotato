Take china out of the equation and everything looks &quot;normal&quot;.<p>&gt; The fact that the US has had an outlier position in terms of Geopolitical influence for the last half century is not a guarantee of this being true in the future.<p>That&#x27;s true. But we will be calling the shots in the western hemisphere for a very very long time. Monroe Doctrine was established 200 years ago. It&#x27;s a safe bet that it&#x27;ll be going strong in 2120. Maybe our influence in east asia will wane as china rises, but definitely not in the western hemisphere and europe. China&#x27;s rise may even make our influence grow in europe, south america, etc. Who else do they have to turn to?')
