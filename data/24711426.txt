In any case, massive graphics cards like the GTX480 or those old AMD dual 4xxx&#x2F;5xxx cooled more than 350w with a much smaller heatsink (though in a larger case with better airflow -- though not all of that power goes just to the CPU&#x2F;GPU in the consoles).<p>Those suckers were deafening though.')
