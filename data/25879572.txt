I burnt out trying to balance work and family, and trying to give my 110% for both. I also started taking it easy (at the expense of career growth), started sleeping better and exercising. I am mentally and physically better now. But I am unable to bring myself to work hard as I used to do in the past. I am scared I will burn myself out again and wonâ€™t survive that.')
