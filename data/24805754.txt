Item(by='c2471', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602888488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24805505, text='This article is a low quality strawman. The owner of the laptop shop is one of the least credible witnesses I&#x27;ve ever seen - he never saw hunter biden drop off the laptop, and his story changes about 4 times in substanial ways during a single interview. He is an ardent trump supporter, and identifies it as hunters laptop because of a sticker from the beau biden foundation on the laptop. This is hardly a smoking gun.<p>Additionally, Hunter Biden is not up for president. Clearly its not cut and dry, but I&#x27;m not sure we should be hanging a father out to dry for the actions of his clearly struggling son, so there is lots here that&#x27;s of shaky relevance to Joe or public interest in general.<p>This article says &quot;we have no reason to believe the emails aren&#x27;t genuine&quot; which is the exact opposite stance to that a rational person should take. If there is substantiated evidence that these allegations are true, publish them, get them trending on twitter.\nBut this is the thing with misinformation. You simply cannot allow stuff to be widely shared until there is proof it is not true - the cost to making a false claim is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude as disputing it.<p>Conservatives are doing themselves a disservice here. This article stinks of vested interests, barely plausible narratives and incredibly poor witnesses. Is this what you want to attach your name to? Free speech has clearly not been violated - so the allegation is that this crackpot story wasn&#x27;t amplified by twitter and &quot;left leaning journalists&quot;. Come on, take a step back and think if this is really the hill you should be dying on.')
