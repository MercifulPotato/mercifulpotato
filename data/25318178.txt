And FYI I&#x27;m not attacking nor defending Islam here.<p>What is referred to as &quot;Islamic&quot; culture did not come from Arabia&#x2F;modern day gulf countries. It came from Iraq, the Levant, Egypt and North Africa. The Caliphates&#x27; capitals were based in Damascus, Baghdad, Egypt or south of Spain. These were diverse societies and &quot;Islamic&quot; progress was diverse by people from different religions and races.<p>Also, the Ottomans never occupied Arabia&#x2F;the Gulf. They stopped at the Levant. Because there was simply nothing to occupy in an empty desert.<p>You&#x27;re confusing Arabia, Levant, Iraq, Egypt and North Africa. Arabia has a very distinct culture and different languages &amp; history.<p>The Levant, Iraq, Egypt and North Africa are far far from &quot;still a desert with no social, architectural or technological progress&quot;. They don&#x27;t even have oil, apart from Iraq.')
