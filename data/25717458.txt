That said, I don&#x27;t understand the section on investment here. The framing is that the startup is bootstrapped, and they don&#x27;t mention taking any outside investment, and yet they&#x27;re offering advice on how to approach investors.<p>The product is also quite expensive ($400 and $700 monthly tiers). Nothing wrong with that either, but the sales experience will be quite different at that pricing level, and having fewer than ten clients limits the number of useful lessons you can draw at this point.<p>The meta-point is that trying this teaches you some useful lessons, but also exposes you to a lot of randomness (lucky and unlucky) and it&#x27;s easy to overanalyze that, particularly in early days.<p>I think the 2 year post will have much more meat on its bones, and wish the authors every success.')
