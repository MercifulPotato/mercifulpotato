When this was never happening, and to this day is not happening.<p>The complaint mentions a third party that paid to get XRP this year to use a Ripple Labs product. They bought the XRP from Ripple to the tune of $70mm and immediately sold it on the public markets.<p>I think the illusion is shattered with this complaint. But XRP should be able to retain its transfer usage, just back at 2013 price levels.')
