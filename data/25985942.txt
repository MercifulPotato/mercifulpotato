Our guide \n    places his eyes to the iris scanner (no lie) the doors \n    slide open, and what we see is downright startling. \n    \n    [...]\n    \n    There are two 12,000 cubic meter vaults, spliced by a \n    network of rails totaling 1.5 kilometers, transporting \n    over 2,800 trays of components per hour between the 60,000 \n    storage compartments and the workshops upstairs. \n    The view is straight out of Star Wars, minus the 1970s camp. \n    This is efficiency defined.\n</code></pre>\nNot your everyday company.<p>Even if you&#x27;re not particularly into watches, Rolex is a really neat example of a suuuuuper vertically integrated company. They even make their own steel! Necessary? Probably not; I&#x27;m not aware that they actually accomplish some sort of magic metallurgy. But, that&#x27;s no ordinary company.<p>In terms of things the average person can afford... if this kind of thing actually appeals to you but you can&#x27;t imagine spending Rolex money...<p>Seiko comes close and arguably exceeds even Rolex in terms of history, innovation, and vertical integration. It&#x27;s one reason why Seiko is a favorite of many in the hobby. Why does this matter? Well, for many, it&#x27;s simply <i>neat</i> to know that every single piece of the tiny little miracle machine on your wrist came from a single slightly secretive company.<p>Timekeeping in general, and mechanical watches in particular, are a fascinating and vital part of human history.<p>(And as wristwatches are something of a solved problem, they&#x27;re appealing to me on that level after fighting with the framework of the week at my day job.)')
