It gets more complicated because the size and the obligations vary depending on what is being discussed. Most people are fairly comfortable with the idea of some kind of responsibility (even just taxes) towards <i>national</i> defense. Not many people are comfortable with the idea that they have responsibility for fixing the little bridge that crosses the small river in a town 300 miles away.')
