For a long time, pharmaceuticals were create in a trial and error process. It took science a long time to be able to reliably predict the outcome of chemical reactions, if we are talking about complex organic chemistry. I was working a very little bit on that in the mid-90ies. One very naive program I implemented was trying to predict the toxidity of a random chemical by its formula. We have come far from that. But with the mRNA technology, they could design their vaccine on a computer, also the production of the mRNA is highly automatized, so no experimenting in how to create it.<p>Developing the mRNA technology was of course decades of research, but now it is ready to be used. It also helped, that the SARS-virus was very well researched, so like with software, it the vaccine wasn&#x27;t created &quot;from scratch&quot;. It used the knowledge already present about these viruses. This means, while you might not get a vaccine against a random virus in two days (no HIV vaccine available yet), adjusting the vaccine for slight variations of the SARS-cov-2 virus, should be a very quick process.')
