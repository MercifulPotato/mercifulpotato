I can understand with him having troubles with drugs that he could have accidentally taken the photo without realising what he was doing. Even without drugs he might not have realised the minor was in the background when he took the photo. But it&#x27;s kind of weird that he didn&#x27;t delete the photo once he would have realised the minor was in it.')
