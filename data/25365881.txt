Item(by='ragnese', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607551304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25365525, text='&gt; What doesn&#x27;t make sense to me are all the statistical anomalies everywhere. How did down ballot republicans outperform Trump everywhere, when Trump&#x27;s approval ratings among republicans were incredibly high?<p>The general polls were super, duper, off. Biden was supposedly leading by 3 points in Florida and then lost by 3 points, for a net of 6 point error.<p>I&#x27;m not shocked by polls being wrong.<p>I think, if you accept that polls can be wrong, it&#x27;s pretty easy to imagine the voters who were lifelong Republicans might have continued to vote R but left the top slot blank.<p>&gt; The fact that Trump out performed himself with all demographics except white men, he had historic republican support from black and hispanic voters, except in specific key counties.<p>He BARELY won in 2016 because of a few thousand votes in three states. The geographic distribution of votes matters. Just because he picked up a few percentage points on minority demographics (still far behind Biden, just more than he had against Clinton) doesn&#x27;t matter unless you tell me WHERE he picked up those margins. One of the places was south Florida and he won Florida. So there&#x27;s nothing here that surprises me or seems suspicious at all.<p>&gt; The fact that all of these counties all flipped the next morning was perplexing, especially since many of the flips came from ballot dumps that had statistically impossible ratios of votes for Biden. Or the massive number of ballots that were showing up for Biden, but had no downballot choices filled out at all.<p>No. We all knew for MONTHS that Trump would look better on election night than he would as the rest of the votes were tallied. We knew for MONTHS that Pennsylvania was not allowed to START counting mail in votes until AFTER polls closed on November 3rd. We knew it so well that they even coined a cutesy term for it: the &quot;red mirage&quot;. We were repeatedly warned that we would see the red mirage on election night. You should not have been perplexed. I&#x27;m sorry.<p>The only statistically impossible ratio of votes for Biden are those that are over 100%.<p>&gt; Couple all of this with the thousands of witnesses that swore on strange activity during counting, and the absolute lack of security around the Dominion machines. I&#x27;m surprised HN hasn&#x27;t been all over the Dominion machines, the HN of several years ago would have had several posts decrying the security of those machines.<p>What lack of security, specifically? What thousands of witnesses? What activities were &quot;strange&quot;? All I&#x27;ve seen or heard is a bunch of people who are very ignorant of the election process pointing to video clips from the live streams and saying &quot;OMG, this worker just filled out a ballot!&quot; when the person in question was clearing performing &quot;ballot curing&quot;.<p>Maybe HN wasn&#x27;t exploding because there isn&#x27;t anything to see here.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the election was perfect. No election is. I&#x27;m in Florida. We can&#x27;t do an election to save our lives down here. But a nationwide conspiracy that would require thousands of individuals to coordinate in key counties in key states (many of which are run by Republicans) is basically &quot;moon landing didn&#x27;t happen&quot; levels of conspiracy.<p>&gt; If the concerns are met with censorship and dismissal without real rebuttal, I don&#x27;t see an optimistic future for this country.<p>I&#x27;ve seen and read many real rebuttals against all kinds of claims. From &quot;poll workers were ejected&quot; to &quot;suitcases full of ballots&quot;. Similarly I saw something about a Dominion machine that supposedly flipped Trump votes to Biden votes that was summarily debunked.<p>There was nothing surprising about the results except that Georgia flipped blue. But I think that says more about Trump and Georgia&#x27;s demographics than it does about the election. Remember that 2016, when he eeked out his EC win, it was because he barely flipped the &quot;blue wall&quot; states. The fact that they went back blue this year is not at all surprising.')
