Just because I acquire a piece of private property does not necessarily give me the right to do anything I want with it.<p>However, you can evict me from the property and charge me with trespassing, which is closer to whats happening here..\nedit: Hell, you can even infringe my 2nd amendment rights and ban me from having a gun on your property!<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure &#x27;private&#x27; property can be a &#x27;public&#x27; square.  At least in New England, the town commons was public land ?')
