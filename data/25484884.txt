Managing servers or deploys just are not major problems for us.<p>Serverless is not a solution to deploy problems - mostly because they’re just not significant problems for us, if anything the dev deploy story is worse than renting VMs. It’s an interesting take on serving requests and I do believe some variant of it might be the future (a variant more like cloudflare workers IMO), but at present there are serious drawbacks and it is not clearly better, particularly when provided by a predatory company like Amazon.')
