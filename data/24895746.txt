If one country were to test <i>everyone</i>, including asymptomatic people, then their CFR would be lower than a country with more limited testing, simply because the denominator would include those large number of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic patients that would be missed in the other country.<p>Also, the CFR is likely intrinsic to the virus, modified slightly by patient population and type of medical care available (both of the latter are probably very similar between the two countries). So any differences in CFR between   the two countries mostly reflects the testing issue.<p>If you <i>do</i> want to compare the two countries, then compare the per capita death rate from covid (assuming everyone who dies in both countries actually gets a covid test - that might not be the case for old people who die at home, where even in developed countries, their primary doctor will just issue a death certificate saying “old age” or “heart attack” in the absence of any information to the contrary. )')
