Seems like GPUs are expensive only because you can&#x27;t rent a small portion of a GPU? But shouldn&#x27;t that be possible with GPU virtualisation?<p>Or is it the case that if you virtualised a GPU up into tiny pieces, the memory-to-flops ratio would be way off what&#x27;s needed for inference? Or the virtualisation overhead would be too big?<p>Those are all genuine questions, just to be clear - this is not my area of expertise.')
