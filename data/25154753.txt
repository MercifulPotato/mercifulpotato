In Apple&#x27;s open source release, a <i>majority</i> of the XNU kernel code lies in the &quot;bsd&quot; subdirectory -- Apple&#x27;s heavily patched 4.3BSD &#x2F; 4.4BSD &#x2F; FreeBSD hybrid.<p>Originally the idea was that having most of a BSD kernel running inside Mach would make it easy for researchers to run tools on their research kernel.<p>One suspects NeXT had a simpler motive: They just wanted to avoid paying money to AT&amp;T.  I&#x27;m not sure they had any particular interest in Mach itself.  (Although obviously Mach&#x27;s strange multi-architecture binary format paid off for them big time, some years later!)')
