He blamed Jews for their own persecution and claimed in the sermon that the Nazis had actually been lenient. Only a few synagogues were burned, he lied, adding: “German citizen Jews were not molested officially in the conduct of their business.” And communists, not Jews, were the real targets of the Nazi mobs, according to Coughlin.<p>Can you clarify, do you suspect this information is not accurate? Or you think it&#x27;s not sufficient to judge the effect of Coughlin&#x27;s broadcast and the matter needs to be &quot;pursued further&quot;? (How, what sort of pursuit, what would we be looking to find?) Or something else?<p>Coughlin wasn&#x27;t secretive about what he believed, and he was  banned from certain stations for exactly what he said on the radio, I think? I&#x27;m confused what sort of additional vetting you are suggesting should have happened, by whom.  I could respect better an argument that it&#x27;s worrisome when large corporations can ban people for their political views... but you are arguing that Coughlin&#x27;s political views were <i>misunderstood</i>?  Really? How so?<p>Or wait, from the first paragraph, that Coughlin wasn&#x27;t <i>really</i> banned for what he said on the radio, but for... critisizing the local government?  With what sort of critisism? You realize it wasn&#x27;t actually the government that banned him, it was a choice of individual broadcasters not to broadcast him?')
