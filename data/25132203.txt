Socialist  revolution  meshed well with the Hakka tradition  of militant dissent,  so that  their  3 per  cent  of the  mainland population  has been three times  more  likely than  other  Han  to hold  high  position.  Six of the nine  Soviet guerrilla bases were in Hakka territory, while the route of  the  Long  March  moved  from   Hakka  village  to  Hakka  village.(Compare Maps  1, 2, 3 and  4.)1 In  1984, half the Standing Committee of   the   Politburo   were   Hakka,   and   the   People&#x27;s   Republic   and Singapore  both  had  Hakka  leaders,  Deng  Xiaoping  and  Lee  Kwan Yew, joined  by Taiwan&#x27;s  President  Lee  Teng-Hui  in  1988.<p>&gt; Hakka  political  history  remains  almost  entirely  undiscussed,  and Chinese  sources  virtually  never  use  the  word  &quot;Hakka,&quot;  but  a  vital subset  of  political  alliances  appears  as  soon  as  Hakka  networks  are decoded.  Hakka  solidarity  also  illuminates  how  a  small  sub-ethnic group  can  gain  significance  when  it  meets  an  historic  opportunity. In  the  early  20th  century  Hakka  poverty  made  land  reform  worth fighting   for   at   precisely   the   moment   when   socialist   organizers desperately needed the traditional Hakka strengths: mobility,  military prowess,  strong  women  and  a  strategically-useful  common  language.')
