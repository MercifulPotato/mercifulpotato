You can then use that with whatever client or search system you like.<p>You could then use this maildir as the backend for a dovecot IMAP server and use any webmail client of your choosing to connect to this and search it etc.<p>I&#x27;d avoid POP3 - very old protocol and it removes your mail from the server (is this your goal?). You&#x27;re definitely better using IMAP. Even if you want to delete mail from the server, you&#x27;re probably safer to fetch it by IMAP, then delete it.')
