Yeah, someone can swap my SIM, but effectively nothing goes to the carrier number, just the GV number, which is much harder to socially engineer (even if some of that is because it&#x27;s impossible to get someone on the phone).<p>If you tightly lock down your GV account, it should be much more difficult to compromise than a random cell carrier. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a comparable service, but I&#x27;m dying to pay for one, if only to not have a single point of failure.')
