Instead, they &#x27;sympathized&#x27; with voters who &#x27;felt disenfranchised&#x27; - which is a kind of indirect lie, but not a &#x27;straight up lie&#x27;.<p>Even when facts are contentious we can still get the word out.<p>We absolutely need integrity in the system at all levels - which is why having a President that completely fabricates stories, it&#x27;s a problem.<p>The press has been bending reality more since the election of Trump, which is why his presence adds to the toxicity - it just creeps into everything. It&#x27;s why, despite however much some might agree with his policies, they come at an addition &#x27;hidden cost&#x27; of the erosion of integrity in some of these systems.<p>We all have to play our part and try to be as objective as we can I guess.')
