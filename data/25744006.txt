I’ve seen a few UDMP deployments with third party switches in place, which still have visibility into the clients connected through them. You can’t manage the switches obviously. If you’re trying to do client management functionality that would be handled at L2 (MAC whitelisting on a switch port, etc) UBNT’s management interface won’t abstract rando vendor’s functionality for you, but isn’t that expecting a bit much? Meraki deployments won’t do that either, if I understand what you’re after (and maybe I’m not).<p>As another comment said, your strategy about breaching the firewall is confusing but it sounds like a configuration issue. If your aim is to default deny outbound traffic, or traffic from or across the LANs except for approved devices, that’s an achievable aim regardless of what switches are in the mix. If you’re trying to do port level security, you’d need a managed switch, Ubiquiti or no.')
