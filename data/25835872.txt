My work computer is my gaming laptop (separate partitions). I use the same desk&#x2F;streaming station. Sometimes I work from bed. And I never feel the urge to &quot;work just one more hour&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve never had an issue flipping between work and play mode, and I&#x27;ve never struggled to compartmentalize the two fully and switch context when 5PM hits.<p>As for going out, sure, I miss it. But I&#x27;m also a bit of a homebody, so I&#x27;m not missing TOO much. My VR headset has helped me feel safe in being able to explore our world and other worlds. As for isolation, I typically have a Twitch stream open for background.')
