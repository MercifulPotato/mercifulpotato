OP clearly discussed &quot;the idea of meritocracy&quot;, not &quot;the exact threshold&quot; and the study just pinpointed a threshold while confirming the universality of the mechanism.<p>Whether it&#x27;s $500 in Bangladesh where Google tells me the &quot;typical&quot; salary is ~$150-$300, or $500k in SV where the typical pay might be $150k-$300k the principle is still very much the same.<p>Everyone claims meritocracy but in the end it&#x27;s proven it&#x27;s not individual merit we&#x27;re actually looking for. We&#x27;re looking to maintain barriers around our layer of society and allow some form of real meritocracy only within a layer.')
