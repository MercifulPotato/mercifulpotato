Using ffmpeg will not devoid you of that.<p>Also, even somewhere on the ffmpeg page, when I last read it, it will say something more in the lines of &quot;we&#x27;re not lawyers, so take this with a grain of salt&quot;.<p>&gt;  a number of programs will externally fetch FFmpeg and just interop with the libraries or FFmpeg app.<p>As far as I know unless they are actually free, they could end up being sued by MPEG LA. I remember at some point that&#x27;s what I wanted to do - just download and use ffmpeg as an exe. But if I read stuff correctly, I do think I&#x27;m not allowed to do that - in other words you (as an application) are allowed to open a web browser to the link, but it&#x27;s the user who needs to do the actual download and install.<p>----------<p>So all in all, after doing quite a bit of research, seeing how vague the licensing from MPEGLA is and all that, I started looking for alternatives. I found one (from Microsoft), and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using. At this point, it satisfies most of my needs (even though I had to do lot of optimizations on top of it) -- in case this won&#x27;t hold true in the future, I may revisit the whole ffmpeg mambo-jambo :D')
