The gist is that it&#x27;s a future where everyone wears vr goggles. As a result, the teens in the comic all have personalized visuals mapped to their bodies that you can see if you also have your goggle&#x27;s on when you look at them. The cooler kids even have full blown avatars that cover up their entire body and make them look like everything from aliens to elves.')
