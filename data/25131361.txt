Playbin should automatically select the HW decoder.<p>I used kmssink for testing:<p><pre><code>    gst-play-1.0 --use-playbin3 a.mkv --videosink=&quot;queue ! kmssink connector-id=52 palne-id=42 plane-properties=s,zpos=2&quot;\n</code></pre>\n(I had to patch the kernel too, because kmssink has trouble selecting a correct plane&#x2F;connector. But if you&#x27;ll not use kmssink, you should be fine.)<p>If you want to use it from within some compositor, you&#x27;ll need to select some other video sink. You&#x27;ll probably have less trouble if you use some wayland compositor that supports HW planes properly.<p>I don&#x27;t know many players that use gstreamer (is totem still alive?), so hard to tell what GUI to use.')
