That&#x27;s true :) It&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s this conscious&#x2F;unconscious bias against IDEs and &quot;all the cool kids use vim&#x2F;emacs&quot;. So people use those editors, but consciously&#x2F;unconsciously crave the quality-of-life improvements that many IDEs (or just many other editors) provide. Even the simplest ones like file lists. Or symbol look ups. And then, yeah, it&#x27;s down the rabbit hole of chasing the plugins, and configurations, and scripts.<p>I experienced all this myself with emacs (I never grokked vim beyond some basic commands).')
