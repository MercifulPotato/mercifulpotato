If I&#x27;m sharing space with someone, I ask that they don&#x27;t wake me up unless it&#x27;s urgent, and that they don&#x27;t talk to or engage me after I wake up, until I signal that I&#x27;m ready.<p>No, I don&#x27;t go into the office anymore. I live a pauper&#x27;s existence compared to the past, when I lived like royalty, &quot;earning&quot; enough to pay rent on my own nice apartment in Manhattan, buying new clothes and things regularly, as much as whatever food I wanted, and so on. Though compared to majority of humans and other animals, I&#x27;m still doing very well in terms of survival and comfort.<p>My finances are almost non-existence, and my sense of happiness and self-fulfillment is through the roof.')
