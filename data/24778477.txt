Got a good one? You can go farther.). I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if each promising iteration of the experiment is performed by loading the anvil all the way to failure.<p>They&#x27;re working in the dark -- nobody knows for sure how much pressure is enough to yield the next step forward in knowledge.<p>If the stars align, a single run of such an experiment is sufficient to yield a quantum leap (sorry) in condensed-matter physics. As an example, this particular iteration may prove career-defining for those involved.<p>That said, if they&#x27;re constrained on budget, I suspect they think really hard about the way to optimize discovery potential within their diamond-anvil supply constraints.')
