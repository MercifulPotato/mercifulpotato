Your opinion is also unfortunate, to equate adversarial nation-state &quot;meddling&quot; with domestic corporate campaigns, though the latter is also woeful.<p>That Trump was elected is a harbinger of American decline, that so many people think his persona, &quot;intellect&quot; and view on leadership are worthy of consideration as leader of this country. It&#x27;s an indictment of our electoral and voting systems, that any good faith Republicans felt they &quot;had&quot; to vote for such an awful leader in order to avoid the centrism of a Democratic administration.<p>But I don&#x27;t think <i>every</i> Trump voter is a racist nazi.
