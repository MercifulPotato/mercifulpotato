The na√Øve approach is to try to pull 500kW from the grid during the 20 minutes that you have five cars charging, then zero once they leave. This will at best be very expensive, but most likely impossible as the local grid won&#x27;t support it.<p>So a battery buffer needs to be built into the charging station in order to operate them cheaply, with a smoother load profile that the power company and grid operator will service without exorbitant costs.<p>Thankfully, at least one EV company has already realized this :-) Let&#x27;s see if more than one of them eventually starts producing enough batteries to support the strategy.')
