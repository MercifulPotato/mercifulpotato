Please read as you are able and I welcome a dialogue with this audience and commentariat.<p>I&#x27;m no fan of the circumstances that exist currently in US Higher Education, but I also will fight long and hard to keep that vitriol from being directed at those who are stuck in a Catch-22, the Professors, in spite of how it might <i>feel</i> to the current cohort of students. You pays your money, you takes your ticket, you get on the ride. Unless there is a literal gun to your head to go to a specific college or uni or take the Bar exam ASAP...well, then I think you have bigger problems than anti-cheating software.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m a bit crass, but I&#x27;ve done my fair share of shitting in the woods and learning to deal with mosquito bites over the years.
