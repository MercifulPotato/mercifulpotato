(I don&#x27;t know whether this has succeeded.) There&#x27;s also some hope of delivering a secure service to registered endpoints at independent shops that can be audited for client security practices. This is the correct next step. With the state of webapp security today, there is NO HOPE AT ALL of delivering a secure service to the general public.')
