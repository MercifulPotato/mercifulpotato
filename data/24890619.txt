We could have had data collected WITH consent only.<p>The privacy boat left the port long ago - personal privacy was intentionally eroded, and this is just one example.<p>Personally, on ethical grounds, I could never have designed a system like that, with so little regard for others, externalising private information so that a permanent record is kept.  Once private data is exteralised, who knows where it ends up, even if it is in the name of some good cause (eg an improvement in therapy).  Plenty of people warned of these sorts of outcomes.<p>At this point, if you care about your privacy, you really only have the option of not engaging with the system.  Or engaging as little as possible.')
