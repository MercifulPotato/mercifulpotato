(In fact, for new GitHub accounts, it even defaults to obscuring users&#x27; contact info, and it attributes all changes made through the web UI to an opaque @github.com email address.  You have to deliberately go into the settings to turn this off, without ever getting a notification that that&#x27;s what GitHub is doing.)')
