Market analysts sell them on the idea that the next big thing might be a huge competitive advantage and a disruptive technology, so the &quot;smart&quot; companies embrace it.<p>There&#x27;s also a lack of knowledge in present corporate management (at least in the US) generally speaking where the higher ups will reward apparent progress or activity without considering whether that activity is positive or negative long term.  All that matters is that managers appear to be doing something, and when the sales people hand them a full narrative explaining how the next big thing will benefit their company, they accept it because they literally don&#x27;t have to think or answer any of the hard questions to appear to be doing something useful&#x2F;positive for their company.<p>It&#x27;s sad, but I have hopes that as the old generation ages out of control of corporations that newer, smarter ones will form.')
