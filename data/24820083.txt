Shorewall has no GUI and is all text based configuration, but personally I prefer that.<p>If OpenWRT supports  wireless APs then sure that seems like great software to use. In my experience most Wireless APs have proprietary firmware and are not supported by most open source solutions. I block all egress on them.<p>Having a router&#x2F;AP combo that runs OpenWRT is great, the solution I proposed just expands your hardware options for non OpenWRT compatible hardware.')
