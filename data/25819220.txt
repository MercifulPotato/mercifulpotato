Even when things are going bad, it&#x27;s supporting me and telling me anything is possible.&quot;<p>Until that coworker had asked me, I didn&#x27;t even realize it, as it was just something I learned to do. When I was younger, and still trying to &quot;figure people out&quot;, the voice was somewhat negative and doubtful. I lived a life of confusion and fear. But since adulthood, the one person that I can always count on to keep me upbeat is that little ever present voice,  supporting me and pushing me forward each day.')
