But commonly one thinks of powerlifting movements:  bench press, squats, deadlifts.<p>Notice in none of the above did we talk about bicep curls, pulley exercises, leg curls, or any concentration exercises.  We didn&#x27;t even talk about leg press, because in the above two we only use barbells.<p>So the two big differentiators are:<p>1. rep range is high with bodybuilding because bodybuilding cares about volume<p>2. This is the big one.  The exercise range for bodybuilding includes many (perhaps mostly) single or few joint exercises.<p>So when you say that at the amateur level it doesn&#x27;t matter, that&#x27;s only true in that any amateur will get stronger.  That&#x27;s true.  But the similarity ends right there.<p>I speak from experience when I say, starting off as an amateur by copying what bodybuilders are doing (bicep curls and other mirror exercises, high rep ranges and doing many single joint movements instead of functional movements) is a recipe for bad habits and movement patterns that you need to spend years to re-learn later. Not to mention machines are garbage and cause injury since they make you do unnatural things (unless you really know what you are doing, which amateurs do not).')
