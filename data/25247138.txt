In general, it’s been an unhealthy one where—if left unchecked—I find myself distracted, and ultimately seeking out attention and validation from folks I love, and many more I don’t even know. In short, I become much more of a “people pleaser”.<p>Last year I left social media completely. I filled my new free time with some things I love: reading, convos with friends, side projects (I built two web apps!), and watching sci-fi movies. Yet, the draw of not having any social media and building my “social capital” began to creep into my conscience and bother me.<p>I read a bit more about social media and its effects. I know it’s not all bad—these platforms have brought a lot of new, interesting opportunities and connections for many folks. But seeing some of the negative impacts on me and others, I began to sort of despise social media.<p>Today, at my worst, I feel like social media is the new cigarette: we’re all using it, and the negative impact hasn’t been fully realized yet. At my best, I am able to say “I’m happy it works for some. But it doesn’t work for me.” I am frustrated by this confusing, complex relationship that I have with social media. I am both drawn to and pushed away from it.<p>I’m curious what your relationship with social media is like today? Is it healthy? Unhealthy? How did your relationship develop into what it is today?')
