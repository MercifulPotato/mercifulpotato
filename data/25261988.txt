But if you continue to do so once you are at good levels, it can do damage:<p>&quot;Hypercalcemia, in turn, can lead to nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, neuropsychiatric disturbances, pain, loss of appetite, dehydration, polyuria, excessive thirst, and kidney stones.&quot;<p>That paper&#x27;s recommendations are 600IU RDA, and that it is safe to take up to 4000IU without supervision of a doctor (i.e. regular blood tests to make sure you&#x27;re not overshooting recommended blood concentration).<p>This paper suggests up to 10000IU is safe:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;nutrition&#x2F;how-much-vitamin-d-is-too-much#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.healthline.com&#x2F;nutrition&#x2F;how-much-vitamin-d-is-t...</a><p>and that &quot;A daily intake ranging from 40,000–100,000 IU (1000–2500 micrograms), for one to several months, has been shown to cause toxicity in humans&quot; (with several case reports).<p>Apparently Dr. Fauci takes 6000IU per day.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitamindwiki.com&#x2F;Dr.+Fauci+takes+6%2C000+IU+of+Vitamin+D+daily+%E2%80%93+Sept+2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitamindwiki.com&#x2F;Dr.+Fauci+takes+6%2C000+IU+of+Vitam...</a><p>While these are different, 4000IU, 6000IU, and 10000IU are well within an order of magnitude as upper limits of what you can tolerate without side effects (&quot;upper limits&quot; being more than RDA, but won&#x27;t cause a separate medical problem)<p>I&#x27;ve seen some studies say that 5000IU or 10000IU is safe, differ a little bit about the normal RDA, but there&#x27;s a ton of similar ranges.')
