I&#x27;ll summarize them in my own words as:<p>1) a CA can issue an illegitimate certificate (gives four links where that&#x27;s happened), and &quot;cross your fingers and hope transparency and oversight works&quot; for CAA records<p>2) difficulties of determining a competent certificate authority.<p>3) size still gives clues about content (see also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14070130" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14070130</a> ), so you still have some information leakage, which means you have to worry about your threat model to figure out if something like padding frames is worthwhile<p>4) speaking of threat model, do you really think your phone, or the phones of your users, don&#x27;t include certs that lets the telco&#x2F;government&#x2F;etc. do #1?<p>FWIW,  found that link from comments after jwz&#x27;s recent posting about problems updating from letsencrypt using certbot on CentOS. - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210118183806&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jwz.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;wtf-certbot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20210118183806&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jwz.o...</a> .<p>FWIW, my web site has been around for 20 years, serving static files mostly containing a blurb about my services, my blog, and various writings and source code I&#x27;ve developed and released.<p>I still can&#x27;t figure out why I should care to switch to https. I can&#x27;t figure out any relevant threat model to justify the work or worry about possible failure cases.<p>Eg, &quot;Let&#x27;s Encrypt warns about a third of Android devices will from next year stumble over sites that use its certs&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;android_encryption_certs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;android_encryption_ce...</a> . (Updated earlier this month: Let&#x27;s Encrypt &quot;developed a new certificate chain that will prevent incompatibility with these devices to allow more time for them to age out of the market.&quot;)<p>FWIW, my phone is 10 years old.')
