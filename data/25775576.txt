You might be the best Java programmer in the world, but if you get hired to write some boring CRM system for internal use in a bank, then the value you created is limited by how much money said bank wants to burn on internal development efforts.<p>On the other hand, if you get hired by FAANG and work on the &quot;next big thing&quot;, like, say, new operating system for smartphones, then the amount of money that can be made from it is virtually unlimited.<p>The difference between the US and Europe is mostly that: cool, product-focused jobs are all in America, Europe only has the boring, low-risk, low-reward ones. Europe needs to innovate more, that&#x27;s it.')
