DMCA 1201 is really just that overbroad, and if GitHub hadn&#x27;t complied with the takedown anyone involved with that decision would literally be put in jail. Unlike normal copyright infringement (which is usually just a shitton of money damages) messing with DRM is a felony, punishable by up to five years in jail.<p>Unless you literally want Microsoft to start committing insurrection against the US government. I&#x27;d rather lose youtube-dl than live in a world where tech companies are corporate sovereigns.')
