Item(by='u801e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607785204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398393, text='&gt; This I say after a couple of recent days in which the GUD gdb interface was a great help in solving a few of the problems I was working on. Does VI has something similar built in? Or for any of the common workflows like these which work out of the box, without needing plugins or extra configuration<p>Not quite, but the help page does mention a plugin called termdebug[1] that can be used with vim&#x27;s new terminal feature.<p>&gt; 1. Remote file editing on other computers.<p>The netrw plugin which comes with the default vim installation allows for this<p>&gt; 2. Rectangular&#x2F;columnar text edits and manipulations.<p>You can select text in column mode and delete, replace, or insert text before or after the column (which can be wider than a single column).<p>3. Essentially infinite kill ring : This I find is very useful, one becomes accoustomed to building blocks of text by assembling things from the kill rings. Also plays nice with point 4, easy macro record&#x2F;replay<p>vim has registers that correspond to every ascii letter (I think emacs has this as well).  From what I recall, when you delete or yank text, it goes through registers 1 through 9 which each subsequent operation shifting the previous operation to the higher numbered register.  After register 9, the delete or yank is lost.<p>But, if you use the capital letter registers, you can append a subsequent deletion or yank to what&#x27;s already in the register, which I believe would effectively act as an infinite kill ring.  I&#x27;m not sure if emacs can do the same with its registers.<p>&gt; Easy macro record&#x2F;replay of even complicated edit sequences<p>Vim has this as well, and you can store one macro in each of the ascii letter and number registers as well.<p>&gt; 5.Inbuild calculator, with both rpn and algebraic modes.<p>There may be a plugin for that, but you could certainly pipe a line of text through dc or bc and get the result in vim.<p>&gt; 6. The Dired mode provides a very convenient file manager.<p>You can get this through the netrw plugin as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimhelp.org&#x2F;terminal.txt.html#terminal-debug" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimhelp.org&#x2F;terminal.txt.html#terminal-debug</a>')
