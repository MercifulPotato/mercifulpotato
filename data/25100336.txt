Having people go through hoops and click through warning messages would probably also push companies to better design their software.<p>In the end, I think the best way is for such features to be the default setup. But those OSs need to have an &quot;escape hatch&quot; for someone who actually wants those features disabled and actually understands the risks of disabling them. While macOS does (for the moment) have this hatch, it looks maybe &#x2F;too&#x2F; complex. But then I think the difficulty of the exercise is in setting the &quot;correct&quot; level of complexity for this operation.')
