I haven&#x27;t seen someone in my social&#x2F;professional circles ever hesitate before applying an apt-get update. Nobody I&#x27;ve known checks changelogs (except developers checking on direct dependencies), nobody reads the patches for the updates to verify nothing malicious slipped in. &quot;There&#x27;s an update, I&#x27;d better apply it, unless it smells like a breaking change.&quot;<p>So in practical terms, my experience is that vanishingly few people will behave differently than an auto-update system would behave, except in rare occasions like a malicious update making the headlines. We definitely need a solution for rejecting malicious updates, but I feel backing away from auto updates throws the baby out with the bathwater and would be a net-negative change for the industry and for users.')
