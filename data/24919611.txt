Let&#x27;s pretend I was using a &quot;normal&quot; browser with no extensions. Would I then face the moral dilemma of how long to look at the ads? Or how often to click on them?<p>The more I make use of the ads, the more I contribute financially (either directly or indirectly) to the bottom line of the content provider, the more I support them. So when I gloss over those ads without fully engaging with them, am I then committing theft as well?<p>Invoking a &quot;moral&quot; argument about theft here, begs the question, are ads themselves moral? When I read site X, I am not thinking &quot;and as a nice side bonus, it would be cool if they could throw in a side bar making me aware of a miracle drug that will cure my insecurity by the size of my penis.&quot; The whole point of ads is basically to trick&#x2F;deceive me into buying something I had no intention of purchasing originally. Is that not theft?<p>I know &quot;two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right&quot;, but since morality is relative these days anyway, when I enter a market place (which is what the ad driven economy is) where the whole point is a contest between will you trick me into buying this or not, I figure it&#x27;s survival of the trickiest.')
