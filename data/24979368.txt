I think the real truth is ignorance and an element of cognitive dissonance from policymakers.<p>Manipulating the cost of debt is the only instrument debt they really have so they just keep pushing that button. Asset bubbles are now so inflated that they can&#x27;t really unwind the monster they have created. I would observe central banks are now guided more by capital markets fluctuations that economic fundamentals.<p>Something I never see mentioned is the rise of China. I think Western countries would have the confidence to accept a reduction in growth (higher&#x2F;normal interest rates) if the US and European economies were still preeminent. A major recession in the US would require reductions in military expenditure which would change power dynamics in Asia and the pacific.')
