Item(by='thewebcount', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602298111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24734716, text='&gt; For such an old (and one would think, stuck in their old ways) institution, they keep up quite well technologically and consumer relations wise.<p>Unfortunately, I have to disagree. While I never had any major problems with them, my company&#x27;s 401k accounts used to be with them. At the time (this was about 5 years ago) you couldn&#x27;t have a password longer than 8 characters and they didn&#x27;t support 2 factor authentication. They had it, just not for your account. It was quite frustrating. Maybe they&#x27;ve finally wised up? But even so, that&#x27;s hardly keeping up well with tech.')
