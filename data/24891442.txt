I embarked on a project with a similar problem - can you identify locations in tweets from their messages during hrricanes? People mostly don&#x27;t geotag their tweets but just mention street names in non standard ways. My naive solution was to use full text search on the postgis openstreetmaps dump but if there&#x27;s a more elegant solution (that&#x27;s free and can scale to millions of tweets) I would love to know more!')
