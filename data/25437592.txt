The Democrats have a nearly insurmountable demographic advantage that has been steadily building for decades. If they could pass as even <i>semi-</i>competent, they would absolutely wipe the floor with the Republicans. Their failure is theirs alone.<p>To expand on what abernard1 said, Democrats have had uninterrupted control of some major cities for <i>60-80 years</i>. The fact that those cities have turned out so poorly can only be blamed on the Democratic politicians in those cities. They are corrupt in every way. As long as people excuse their failures with &quot;But Republicans!&quot;, they will continue to get away with their corruption.')
