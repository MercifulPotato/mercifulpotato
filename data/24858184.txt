Sometimes I&#x27;ll binge for 2 hours and get 4 different rising-action-falling-action cycles and 4 different cliffhangers trying to keep me on for the next episode, which I was planning on doing anyways.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;ll watch for 45 minutes, get halfway through a second episode but have to shut it off for one reason or another, and when I come back the next day I feel disoriented because the plot cycle is built to assume an uninterrupted segment.<p>I don&#x27;t think the solution here is 10 minute episodes per se, but I think the flow of storytelling in modern TV series is waiting for some innovation to bring it to the 21st century.<p>A great example of innovation in storytelling is the Witcher 3. Everytime I boot the game up, during the loading sequence I get a 15 second voiced over &quot;recap&quot; where Geralt informs me about where the main storyline is and what we need to do next, whereas in traditional TV segments I&#x27;m given a recap every 30 minutes of progress regardless of where in the show I start and stop watching.')
