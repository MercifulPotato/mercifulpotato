There were still many markets in the early 90s that were highly constrained by chip and system performance.<p>The guy who coded Alta Vista gave a talk at Stanford that I was able to sit in on. The most interesting story was when a person contacted him and begged him to remove something from the index because his boss was going to see it the next morning. He wrote a filter just to take care of this guy. It was fun stuff back then.')
