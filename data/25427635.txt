You would also expect the completely unrelated questions to be filtered.<p>But don&#x27;t underestimate the power of the experience, if you&#x27;ve got 100 support tickets asking where the &#x27;login&#x27; button is, maybe you&#x27;ll be motivated to label it clearly with the word &#x27;login&#x27; and not some icon that requires interpretation.<p>If you think about it, the power of agile development has really come from being more customer requirements focused, with quick rounds of feedback and review on deliverables and milestones. If you abstract the developers away from the feedback, how on earth can you expect them to make a decent end result?')
