Restricted classes of computer programs are totally fine, and in some sense that is exactly what a logical system is: a description of a restricted class of programs.<p>But this is also getting a bit confusing because there are many different interpretations of how to tie computability to a logical system. For example the proof system of first-order logic can be interpreted as a single Turing machine program, not a family of ones, for which it is very possible to make all sorts of judgments about its semantic consequences.')
