Item(by='ufmace', descendants=None, kids=[25316828], score=None, time=1607190511, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25314387, text='As a techie and a possible user, I agree that I&#x27;d like that feature.<p>As someone who has&#x2F;might work for companies building things like that, it sounds like a nightmare. It&#x27;s a ton of design, testing, translation, validation, etc work to build the UI for adjusting optional settings. And it has to be maintained and tested through all future versions, redesigns, refactorings, etc. It&#x27;s gonna be a tough sell to do it right considering:<p>For every 1 techie who legitimately uses it to set it to his custom server and can handle debugging when it goes wrong, 50 people will accidentally set it to something random, or have some distant relative set up some weird hack and then disappear when it breaks, and then call the support line and rage at somebody when it doesn&#x27;t work and they don&#x27;t understand why, and rage some more when they can&#x27;t get the instructions to reset it right.<p>Whatever feature somebody else is about to propose to fix that is yet another thing that will need design, validation, maintenance, etc forever. It&#x27;s pretty understandable why product designers would rather build simple dumb UIs with no options that mostly work automatically.')
