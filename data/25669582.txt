If they&#x27;re aggressive, demanding or angry in their emails or forum posts, I post short and definitive replies with no room for discussion or leeway (&quot;We&#x27;re won&#x27;t be building that&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s not a direction we&#x27;ll be taking the product,&quot; etc.)<p>I find it&#x27;s best not to explain, as when you try to do that they look for loopholes to prolong the discussion. If they&#x27;re demanding something you&#x27;re not prepared to give, say No clearly and briefly.<p>A more expensive product definitely attracts less demanding and less entitled customers. I find that the worst customers are users of a free tiered app, or B2C users of a cheap product.')
