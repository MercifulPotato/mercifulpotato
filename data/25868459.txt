But you are assuming the cost of battery technology will be the same for everyone. Currently it seems like Tesla is about 3-5 years ahead of everyone in terms of price &amp; performance. What happens if&#x2F; when[1] Tesla launches an EV at Corolla prices and Toyota is still waiting for battery prices to come down?<p>I think it&#x27;s far more likely at this point that Tesla will have a $25k EV in the next 5 years than Toyota.')
