When I use the cables for data transfer, it <i>just works</i> -- no muss or fuss like there were with some of the charge-only converter cables for charging micro-USB devices.<p>Now if I were using Thunderbolt 3, yeah, you need a higher-end cable and there are restrictions on cable length for speed purposes (or moving up to a more expensive active cable).  But I think that&#x27;s a fair trade-off for being able to use that same cable for everything else as well.<p>We cannot WAIT until our household says goodbye to the last couple devices with legacy ports and we can throw the last few converter dongles in a drawer. Looking at you, Apple and Amazon Kindle -- when are you going to get with the program and ditch your legacy Lightning and micro-USB ports respectively?')
