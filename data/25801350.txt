The 4800h was 1750 aud.<p>I found a video review showing a great screen, and the machine is overall pretty good. One strange shortcoming is the use of 2666 Mhz RAM instead of 3200, and for Ryzen of that generation the RAM speed is important to overall performance, and also the RAM is used for graphics memory for the iGPU. Very strange to use that slow RAM but benchmarks still seemed reasonable.<p>I looked at the matebook pro in jbhifi with the 3000x2000 screen, best screen of any laptop there. Unfortunately no AMD option for that one.')
