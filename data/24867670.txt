The only asset you really end up with is your name&#x2F;reputation. Publicly burning a customer would be incredibly expensive.<p><i>Adjusts tinfoil hat</i> \nI think the point about VPN providers acting as a honey-pot might have some legs though. Seems incredible to think that whilst NSA and the rest are determined to detect illegal activity online, VPN providers seemingly thrive without any interference&#x2F;intrusion. My view is that as long as you&#x27;re not doing anything too bad, you&#x27;re safe as the cost of your exposure isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>Of course if the government was having trouble infiltrating&#x2F;extracting information from the big VPNs due to the volume of traffic, pushing the &#x27;people who <i>really</i> want privacy&#x27; to self-identify even further, by creating their own service makes sense. \nAll the traffic emerging from it (even if encrypted, you know where it&#x27;s going) can be tied back to the single user.')
