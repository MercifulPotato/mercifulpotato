It&#x27;s certainly not fair, because it basically says you have to &quot;work twice as hard&quot; as they say. But the statement is factually correct. While it would certainly be preferable for society to be the one to change and such that your ageism problem goes away. In the meantime, merit matters, and usable advice for an individual to deal with this problem is by building up their skills.
