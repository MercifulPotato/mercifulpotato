Of course it is a myth that any normal houseplant is going to make a big difference, but I&#x27;m not so sure about a fan&#x2F;roots system enhanced version.<p>One other modification was to include activated carbon, which muddies the water a bit but the idea generally speaking is that the bacterial colonies that are managed&#x2F;symbiotes of the root system can assist with the uptake of VOCs. Activated carbon was supposed to be a temporary sink while that process takes place.<p>Now a fan enhanced plant that survives the airflow required is not trivial, and not what people think of when they think &quot;this plant will help my house&quot; but its not so simple as &quot;this whole idea is stupid&quot;. The original and follow-on research is more interesting to me than the &#x27;debunks&#x27; which are lazy in that they just take the easy case (add plants to clean your air!) and refute it.<p>The most amazing thing that some of the original research shows is that the bacterial colonies get _better_ at consuming household vocs, implication that the food source shapes those colonies specifics.<p>I&#x27;m not totally convinced, but I think its more interesting than the debunk articles allow for. I think it needs more study.')
