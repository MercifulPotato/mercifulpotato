Whenever speech calls for violence that upsets the current social-political order in the US, it is censored regardless of being &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right;&quot; one example being the very-left chapo trap house crowd on reddit. My understanding that there is less violent content coming from voices identified as &quot;progressives&quot; that tend to value other more acceptable* methods for social change.<p>* Acceptable meaning something different per platform, but if we are being honest seems to usually mean &quot;can sell mainstream ads space alongside them&quot;')
