Heavily edited clip of political candidate saying something.<p>2. News anchor provides a 10 min opinion of what happened.<p>3. An analyst is invited to give their opinion about what happened for 30 min..<p>News Station B:<p>1. Video of what happened.<p>2. News anchor describes when it happened and where. No accompanying opinion is provided.<p>What is more neutral? News Station B, for sure. The first format is the only one available in the US, in my country that format is considered yellow journalism and is unacceptable.')
