Item(by='eins1234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607037516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25296698, text='&gt; There is no &quot;always display images from this contact&quot; option if you don&#x27;t want to load images automatically. You have to click on &quot;show images&quot; every time you read an emai, even from a trusted contact.<p>Oh man, this is one feature that I&#x27;ve really missed from Gmail, which actually gives you the best of both worlds by proxying external images from their own servers so images can load automatically without compromising privacy.<p>Can&#x27;t blame a small-time email provider like Fastmail from not offering something like this given the resources it&#x27;d likely require, but I&#x27;m using Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;enterprise&quot; solution (Exchange Online) and they really have no excuses other than poor prioritization.<p>Anyone aware of other providers offering this feature?')
