I have plans to travel to abroad in Feb (I have a valid H1B visa). My understanding is that AP applications will be denied if it&#x27;s still pending during the travel.<p>Can the AP be re-filed in this case? Are there additional fee for refiling?<p>USCIS website states a 3-8 month adjudication period for AP and a much longer timeframe for EAD. What happens if you switch employers during this time? Do these applications have to be re-filed?')
