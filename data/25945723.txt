Like, are you saying they didn&#x27;t intend into storming the Capitol but were guided&#x2F;leaded there by the security staff?<p>Also I think you&#x27;re being unfair by ignoring the causes of both of the protests, as (IMO, feel free to disagree) one of them was directly supporting democratic and liberal interests and the other was directly against them. I don&#x27;t think you can discuss the protests without taking into account what they were protesting.')
