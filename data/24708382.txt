You lived that dream. To 37 year old David: Go do it again.<p>I really enjoyed that part. I forget sometimes that my career - what I woke up to do this morning, the reason I&#x27;m in this office right now - this was my dream.<p>I should remember that more often. This dream started almost 20 years ago (I&#x27;m about the same age as David) and it&#x27;s easy to forget... I thought this would be impossible once. Well, the odds looked pretty bad at first. I barely scraped by in school, would never enter post secondary school, and at the time was terrible with math and logic. I didn&#x27;t care about programming specifically though, I cared about what I could create with it. In retrospect, I&#x27;m glad I had the attitude and optimism that I did.<p>More on topic, I know of David through his website which, early on on my front end days, was an incredibly helpful resource. I vividly remember figuring out Mootools problems with the help of his articles. Ha, like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;davidwalsh.name&#x2F;namespace-mootools" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;davidwalsh.name&#x2F;namespace-mootools</a><p>So out of date now, but man, some of his stuff saved my ass when I was thrown into a Mootools-heavy project in 2011-2012 with very little experience with JS. Great memories.')
