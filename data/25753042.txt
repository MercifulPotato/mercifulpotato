The oldest keys are in the center, newest are along the edge. (I count about 5 rings: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;breckyunits.com&#x2F;how-old-are-these-keys.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;breckyunits.com&#x2F;how-old-are-these-keys.html</a>)<p>(Maybe someone could take this idea and make a nice tree ring visual of the keyboard?)')
