People uneducated about marginal tax rates are more likely to vote down tax increases, turn down raises because they&#x27;ll &quot;go up a tax bracket&quot;, and not try to change the difference between tax rates on earned and unearned income. People who don&#x27;t understand retirement savings are less likely to meet their 401k match, or ask awkward questions about why the 401k&#x2F;IRA&#x2F;Roth&#x2F;pension system is so confusing and convoluted, and so geared towards earning financial institutions fees. People who don&#x27;t understand monetary policy, deficits, and fractional reserve banking won&#x27;t make a fuss over QE or have an opinion on interest rates, and can easily be manipulated with cries of &quot;OMG deficits! Irresponsible government!&quot;. People who don&#x27;t understand debt and cash flow will make shortsighted decisions like financing expensive vehicles or taking out payday loans. All of this is beneficial to capital owners (yours truly included).<p>Using Hanlon&#x27;s razor though, it&#x27;s more likely that educators themselves don&#x27;t understand this stuff so don&#x27;t consider it important to teach. Most parents don&#x27;t understand either, so they don&#x27;t demand that it be taught. And those few parents who do understand its importance just teach their kids by themselves.')
