[1]<p>There is a difference to Zeno&#x27;s paradox, as a sibling comment suggests the impossibility. For a flying arrow we can assume that it&#x27;s motion is driven by Newton&#x27;s law, which is a second order differential equation for the position. Therefore you can&#x27;t use the position only for initial condition to solve the equation, ie. you can&#x27;t decide where the arrow travels from a snapshot of time.<p>However the Maxwell equations that describe classical electromagnetism are a system of first order partial differential equations in terms of electric and magnetic fields. So if you know <i>both</i> the electric and magnetic fields everywhere at a given time point then in theory you can predict it at every future time points.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electromagnetic_radiation#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Onde_electromagnetique.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electromagnetic_radiation#&#x2F;med...</a>')
