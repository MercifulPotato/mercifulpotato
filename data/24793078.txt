For large images (gigabyte or more, and I&#x27;ve got a handful of these), it&#x27;s very space-inefficient to have a copy in my docker and in a local registry _and_ in k3s&#x27;s containerd at the same time. How is this problem typically solved?<p>(I note the kubernetes included in Docker Desktop on macOS works in the same way: images built with `docker build` are available to kubernetes without going through a registry.)')
