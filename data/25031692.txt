Didn&#x27;t use it for sometime and when I went back to have a look at it, Facebook had disabled it and disabled my associated domain. I reached out to them to enable my account and they quoted the 180 day limit for appealing and said it would be better if I don&#x27;t appeal further. The associated domain was disabled for not following community standards. Again I reached out to FB via the sharing debugger contact form and have received no response. The only thing I can see online is people crying about similar apathy and reaching out to a certain Karlin John who apparently is solving these issues. (I haven&#x27;t reached out to this person, so could be a scam.)<p>What I have learnt is in a world run by monopolies&#x2F;oligopolies there is little room for mistakes and even if you don&#x27;t commit a mistake your livelihood can be at the mercy of corporations.')
