The &quot;ux designer&quot; has failed miserably here. There should always be a fallback option. These issues with the handles have been reported in various tesla fan forums even. Very sad story.\nJust seen the speeding mentioned, valid point , extremely irresponsible , however the topic is vehicle safety. When it comes to human life , every % to prevent death should count.')
