No thanks.<p>Then later in college, my friend said it would be fun if we both took the genetics class he needed to take for his pre-med reqs. I agreed, and then bombed the class exam after exam.<p>One day right before Thanksgiving, when all the students are checked out, the profs got up and demoed their research.<p>They got up and showed us BLAST, the 3 GB human genome, and software tools to search the genome. Most importantly, these 2 professors, masters of the genetics universe as they were, made lots of mistakes while demoing the software. They &quot;oops&quot;ed their way through this and that and said it was ok because the human genome had just recently been sequenced and it was all still new.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a UNIX system! I know this&quot; popped into my head, and I promptly declared myself a biotech entrepreneur. After class I went up to the teachers and told them I would build them better software tools for genetics. Then I wrote every department in school I could find who used digital genomes to build them better tools. Tools for understanding the most important language the universe had ever written.<p>14 years later, in the wake of that realization is the first hackerspace for biotech BioCurious [1], an open source DNA copy machine OpenPCR [2], and lots of great work with the iGEM [3] and DIYbio [4] communities.<p>These days the fun continues as I&#x27;m engineering the biggest living system out there [5], planet Earth.<p>[1] BioCurious <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;biocurious.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;biocurious.org</a><p>[2] OpenPCR <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openpcr.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openpcr.org</a><p>[3] iGEM <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;igem.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;igem.org</a><p>[4] Do-it-yourself Biology <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;diybio.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;diybio.org</a><p>[5] Mining carbon from the air, AirMiners <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;airminers.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;airminers.org</a> &amp; Negative <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gonegative.co" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gonegative.co</a>')
