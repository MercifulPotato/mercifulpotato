Overall I&#x27;m still happy with the checking&#x2F;savings account features, no maintenance fees etc. The mobile app&#x2F;website is pretty good. However the &quot;desktop&quot; website is annoying as it&#x27;s just a scaled up version of the mobile one, but it still gets the jobs done. Unfortunately they&#x27;ve removed the ability to easily add multiple savings accounts for budgeting, or at least I can&#x27;t find a way to do it. Luckily I still have the ones I created back in the ING days.')
