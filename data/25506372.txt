I have to deal with large, mature Java codebases for some of my work. The good thing is that the code does just about everything well and rarely breaks. The downside is that when something does break, and I have to debug the code. At some point in the Java world, best practice became building abstraction on top of abstraction on top of abstraction. And often these abstractions just call the next abstraction. Well that makes finding the offending line of code extremely difficult and time-consuming unless you are an expert of the codebase. Had the exact same code been written with less abstractions, debugging would be a lot easier.<p>I am not against abstractions, but I think they lead to hard to read&#x2F;debug code when overused. I think they need to be used wisely rather than the default.')
