It&#x27;s a broad enough label that it can include something a few 1-hr episodes long or 8 of them.  I guess at the longer end, they&#x27;re closer to a &quot;season&quot; of a typical show, but the idea is that it&#x27;s a complete story arc with a defined beginning and end.<p>I love how modern formats allow for stories to be told where they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t fit into a single film or work as a weekly recurring series.  I&#x27;ve always felt that a movie is like a short story:  you&#x27;re dropped into the plot and the background is exposed through the course of action.  Longer formats like the miniseries can tell a story more on the scale of a full novel.<p>When you get into stuff like &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; where it theoretically starts off like a novel but keeps renewing and keeps rehashing the same basic plot points for years, it&#x27;s like one of those novel series where they just keep cranking out new sequels as long as people are buying them, quality be damned.')
