Even worse, there seems to be a massive increase in &quot;articles&quot; coming from a particular part of the world that has churned out masses of sort-of-developers.<p>I&#x27;m even starting to wonder if part of their pedagogical process includes &quot;Every week you write an article&quot;.  Perhaps by sheer number of posts, an individual has been trained to believe they will be more likely to get hired.<p>So given that most content on the internet is garbage, I will never, ever pay for access to content before I can assess the value of it.  I will (and do) subscribe to some writers&#x2F;musicians on Patreon.<p>Medium might as well be the next Experts-Exchange... cluttering up search results with paywalled trash.')
