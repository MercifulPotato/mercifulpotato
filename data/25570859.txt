Wikipedia [1] states this about #P -complete problems:<p>&quot;A polynomial-time algorithm for solving a #P-complete problem, if it existed, would solve the P versus NP problem by implying that P and NP are equal.&quot;<p>So, would the statement of the article imply that P=NP? That would be quite a big deal, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>Now, the statement talks about #P-hard, wikipedia about #P-complete. Does this make a difference?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E2%99%AFP-complete" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E2%99%AFP-complete</a>')
