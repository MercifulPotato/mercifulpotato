Anything below is dangerous because of the propensity for humans to rely on what seems to be working the majority of the time and artificially trust it, especially with a population trained to need to check their phones. We saw this with the infamous Uber training driver crash in AZ, we saw this with the Apple employee in the Tesla, and we&#x27;ll continue to see this over and over again until we can finally remove the steering wheel so there&#x27;s no possible ill-informed release of control. Naming L2 systems &#x27;Autopilot&#x27; and a bunch of misleading marketing certainly doesn&#x27;t help either.')
