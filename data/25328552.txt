I think it&#x27;s only useful out of band, though, in these cases.<p>Because if you&#x27;re pissed off about Cyberpunk 2077, and think death threats are OK... seeing an article with more news about &#x27;2077 being late, and an aside of them saying &quot;these death threats are upsetting us&quot; A) reinforces your belief death threats for situations like this are normal, and B) provides you with some validation&#x2F;happies.<p>I&#x27;d wager that the kind of people who issue death threats over video game delays has a pretty big overlap with 4chan.  4chan peeps know their behavior is not normative, and having a bunch of outcry has never stopped their pursuit of the luls... and the kind of article mentioning the threats you&#x27;re talking about is pretty much winning from their standpoint.')
