Almost no weapons currently in use by major nation-states are pure fission devices.  Two-stage thermonuclear Teller-Ulam designs are more stable, easier to control the yield, capable of scaling up to 1000x the power, and cheaper to manufacture once you have the technology.  A major part of the cost of nuclear weapons is enriching uranium or producing plutonium; fusion weapons can use a much smaller amount of these expensive materials and get the bulk of their yield from deuterium, which is distilled from water.  Pure fission weapons were used in some artillery shells (where there isn&#x27;t enough room to get a second stage in) and by emerging nuclear powers that haven&#x27;t yet developed the technology for fusion weapons.<p>Non-colloquially, scientists would probably refer specifically to &quot;fission&quot; and &quot;fusion&quot; weapons, or to specific design used (eg. gun-type linear implosion, explosive lens, Teller-Ulam).')
