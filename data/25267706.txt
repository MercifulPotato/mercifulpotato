I like hearing about the range of experiences that highly technical people have with macOS.  I&#x27;m still trying to use it as my daily driver, even though it takes a few days of setup (compared to the old days of building a preconfigured image), because my alternate option (Linux, for me) <i>also</i> takes a similar amount of time.  You&#x27;re right about Windows being a trash fire.<p>PS: &quot;outside of the box&quot; is the end of the idiom referring to &quot;thinking outside of the box&quot; (thinking differently about a problem).  I think the one you meant to use in your article was &quot;out of the box&quot;, which means the first experience with a product when it&#x27;s opened or unwrapped (think: &quot;taken out of the box&quot;).  I hadn&#x27;t even noticed how similar these two are until today.')
