Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611297203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868512, text='&gt; Section 230 is a valuable grant of liability protection, and thus morally obligates platforms to act as a public forum.<p>That makes no sense, since the <i>entire, explicit purpose</i> of Section 230 was to <i>free</i> platforms from preexisting disincentives si that they could be free to “restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected” without incurring liability that would otherwise attend such editorial control.<p>You are literally suggesting that the price of Section 230 protection ought to be not doing the things to which Section 230 protection applies in the first place.<p>Also, I think it&#x27;s wrong, in any cases, to think of Section 230 as a special grant of liability protection, any more than the preexisting different liability of distributors from that of publishers is a special grant. It&#x27;s a recognition that online media enables models that would not be practical with the media for which the traditional liability roles for content developed, and that venues for content which wasn&#x27;t pre-screened in detail but over which largely reactive editorial control was exercised was all of technically and economically practical on the internet, inconsistent with the premises of the classic publisher vs. distributor liability analysis, and already, at the time the Act was considered, starting to be stifled by application of the traditional publisher vs. distributor rules. We don&#x27;t force bookstores to be neutral platforms to be free of publisher liability, because we recognize that bookstores aren&#x27;t naturally going to be pre-screening content at the detailed level print publishers will, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to stifle them by forcing them to. 230 is the same idea, just for a business activity that didn&#x27;t exist when the common law of liability was evolving.')
