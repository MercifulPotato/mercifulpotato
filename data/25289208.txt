To saturate one core on an Intel processor you need to run two threads, because that&#x27;s the way they are designed. So the single thread benchmarks that have been used so far have been using 50% of the capacity of an Intel CPU core and comparing it with 100% of the capacity of an M1 CPU core.<p>This article breaks it down fully: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wccftech.com&#x2F;why-apple-m1-single-core-comparisons-are-fundamentally-flawed-with-benchmarks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wccftech.com&#x2F;why-apple-m1-single-core-comparisons-ar...</a>')
