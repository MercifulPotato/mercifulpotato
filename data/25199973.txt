Their understanding of object orientation was superior. The developer tools were wonderful. The user experience was generally a delight. We could develop custom software in a fraction of the time of people using the tools of the day. NeXT had a true vision of the future.<p>However, what they didn&#x27;t have was much understanding of economics. The only reason that NeXT wasn&#x27;t a complete commercial failure was that Apple&#x27;s board wanted Steve Jobs back. If not, Apple might instead have bought out Be. And if Apple had succeeded in developing their own next-gen OS, both NeXT and Be might be minor footnotes these days. Even prior to the deus ex machina buyout, NeXT was on a slow and steady path to failure. They&#x27;d gone from an integrated hardware vendor to an OS-on-other-hardware vendor to a dev-tools-on-other-OSes vendor, and it&#x27;s not clear that would have worked either. Once the acquisition was announced, they promised to take care of the people who had stuck with them and then did jack.<p>I took a few lessons away from my time with NeXT. 1) Just because I thought something was technically superior didn&#x27;t mean it was commercially viable. 2) Being too far ahead of the market is worse than being behind it. 3) Never trust a &quot;visionary leader&quot; to look out for you, no matter what he says. He&#x27;s in it for himself and the vision; the little people are expendable.<p>But you&#x27;re definitely right that it made using other stuff painful. I stopped doing GUI development altogether rather than shift to Windows, which was incomparably awful by comparison.')
