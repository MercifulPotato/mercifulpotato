Increasing the capabilities of XML in the browser runs counter to that goal.<p>Bit of a weird comment from Chrome. &#x27;XML&#x27; doesn&#x27;t generate &#x27;security bugs&#x27; - sloppy development practices do.  If they want to generate less security bugs they should be more aggressive with their testing&#x2F;fuzzing in the parts of code that deal with XML.')
