For the context, we are real life friends, and even though we sometimes have heated arguments, as it was the case here, it never went that far.<p>After we calmed down, we talked to each other and realized that lag played a huge role. She thought I was constantly interrupting her and I thought she didn&#x27;t listen to me. In reality, it was just a network problem and latency was over a second, but we didn&#x27;t realize it as we were too busy arguing.<p>Virtual meetings are fine when people take turns speaking and no one is interrupting. But when you are debating, brainstorming, or working together on a problem, even a small amount of latency makes it terrible.')
