That we can&#x27;t sustainably lock down indefinitely until a vaccine, that we need to balance the desire to protect lives with the need to live and work.<p>Your statement about flatten the curve is exactly what I said.<p>I will say, though, I bet we disagree on this: The federal government should have minted off a few more trillion dollars to keep people home as needed without them losing their jobs or insurance. Our American political&#x2F;economic system is not built to keep people healthy or economically secure, and the government should take a more active role in fixing that.')
