In effect, it changed from a “what if the election were today?” Model to a “what will the outcome of the election on date ___ be?” Model just for this cycle.<p>False. Silver&#x27;s headline model has always been a “what will the outcome on election day” model. (Silver has a secondary “what of the election were held today model”, as well, which was published as an explicitly alternative model in previous cycles, with explicit notes about the difference in what it did from the main model, and is still run and occasionally referenced but not published.)')
