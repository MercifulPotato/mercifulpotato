How do you demonstrate impact avoiding SEVs when, if you&#x27;re successful, the SEV never happened? It&#x27;s very hard to count the number of things that don&#x27;t happen.<p>The problem is the &quot;bias&quot; runs in both directions.<p>If you pass a bunch of laws after 9&#x2F;11 and then another 9&#x2F;11 does not happen, does that mean you actually need all of those laws, or that it&#x27;s all overreach and bear-repelling rocks and all you really needed was to tell the passengers on planes to resist hijackers?<p>In other words, it&#x27;s not bias, it&#x27;s uncertainty.')
