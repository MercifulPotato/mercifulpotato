That&#x27;s under local jurisdiction, though: the state keeps trying to override local zoning requirements to build more housing and keeps getting shot down at the ballot box.<p>My sister lives in Houston (well, Sugarland technically), so I&#x27;m well acquainted with the metro area.  It&#x27;s a very different lifestyle.  The housing <i>stock</i> in the Bay Area is uniquely terrible - most of it is 3BR Eichlers that were mass-produced in the 60s.  But people don&#x27;t spend all that much time indoors.  Pre-COVID, my wife and I were out every weekend to museums, hiking, the beach, picnics, restaurants, etc.  There are 4 parks within walking distance of my home, 2 commercial downtowns, then the mountains are 5 minutes away, the beach 20, SF 30, SJC 30, the Bay 5, etc.  And the weather cooperates - it&#x27;s a consistent 70 and sunny for 8 months out of the year.  Meanwhile, my sister&#x27;s place is 50% larger for a quarter of the price - but it better be, because it&#x27;s 100 degrees with sweltering humidity for 8 months out of the year.

We could&#x27;ve purchased my sister&#x27;s house for cash at the time they bought it.  I floated the idea by my wife, and she was like &quot;But then we&#x27;d have to live in Houston!&quot;')
