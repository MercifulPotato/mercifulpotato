The former write some code that does what they tested it for, the latter designed code to account for every detail.  The former thinks it does the job the latter knows.  The former rushes through while the latter codes in ways that avoids redundant busy work to allow for the higher up front investment.  The former slows over time as they slog through the &quot;ball of mud&quot; they call inevitable while the latter increasingly gains and shares insight on the deeper problems being solved and the opportunities afoot.<p>TL;DR: I think the extent to which we are engineers is a choice we individually make.')
