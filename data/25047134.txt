Even if the absolute amount of $ isn&#x27;t that much HN is generally of a demographic that doesn&#x27;t want to feel trapped into overpaying for anything related to tech.<p>I can only speak for myself, but as someone who needed a printer for the first time in a while due to the pandemic, I bought a used brother laser printer (HL-2170W) for $20 from someone local. It&#x27;s not perfect, especially with network printing from a linux client over wifi, but I was able to get it all set up and refilled the toner with a very cheap generic from Amazon. It feels like a device I &quot;own&quot; rather than some black box I&#x27;m renting from HP.<p>I don&#x27;t know where the excitement around buying the new ones comes from. When I looked it was hard to find them in stock and they didn&#x27;t seem particularly inexpensive.')
