They don&#x27;t have to take back all their low quality products when they perform poorly or break, nor do they offer customer support.<p>I think you&#x27;re building a strawman here. This is a thread about Google having poor customer service, and you&#x27;re trying to frame it as if Google is refusing to refund defective products. Those are not the same. Google refunds or replaces defective products they sell.<p>Google has some customer support. It&#x27;s not very good. Google has several billion users and only about 100k employees total. That&#x27;s somewhere around 1 employee per 30k users.<p>Customer support quality is a continuum, not a binary thing. The comment you replied to was pointing out that a company that makes a small amount per user cannot afford the same level of customer service as a company that makes a lot per user.<p>No one in the thread said Google couldn&#x27;t hire more customer support. They said looking at customer support quality as an &quot;ad-hoc monopoly test&quot; is biased against companies with huge user bases and small margins per user.')
