They haven&#x27;t outright said this is due to binning, but it seems very likely. Will probably be similar for upper-end models, but more CPU variations as well.<p>They&#x27;re fabbing with TSMC, which has a really established history in high yields. Just think about the A13&#x2F;A14 CPUs, which are probably the most voluminous single CPU models every fabricated by a company, yet have never been subject to binning to other lower or higher end models. As the chips get more complicated naturally there will be more fabrication issues, so I expect we&#x27;ll see more binning, but it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s much cause for concern.')
