AFAIK it&#x27;s been open for months, but there&#x27;s an enormous backlog because the backlog + reduced capacity (need to do everything by appointment for social distancing and keep appointment slots large enough to ensure physical queues don&#x27;t form) + increased demand.<p>People are queuing for hours to get COVID tests, hospitals are reaching capacity, and people are rotting in prison because they can&#x27;t get an appointment in front of a judge. In normal times I would be more sympathetic. There are greater injustices than waiting a few months for your LTCF, and more important forms of justice (habeas corpus) being delayed.')
