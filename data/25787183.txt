I haven&#x27;t kept strict count, but I&#x27;ve chased at least four cryptofascists out of technical communities in the past couple years. My techniques are pretty simple; I introduce basic facts and some background empirical knowledge, and then use them to demonstrate that fascist rhetoric is usually disconnected from actual historical happenstance.<p>My calculus is this:<p>1. Are they being unmitigated pieces of shit? Are they failing basic norms of conversation and going off on irrelevant and hateful tangents?<p>2. Is their bullshit correctable? Are there simple and plain truths which, when added as historical context, reveal them to be hateful and insipid?<p>3. How much will the average person care about this nuance? Even if my points are right, will they actually convince onlookers or are they too technical or tiny?<p>If the answer to all three isn&#x27;t &quot;yes&quot;, then I don&#x27;t bother writing a reply.<p>I don&#x27;t know which part of the country you&#x27;re from. My senator is Wyden, so all I have to do in order to make a positive difference is just vote him back in. Anything beyond that is icing. It is as easy as that; electing antifascists and their sympathizers is not difficult.')
