Item(by='CapricornNoble', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605724140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139765, text='&gt;&gt;&gt;No if you tell me that the SK&#x27;s military command was seriously advising to restart the war then I would tell you that either this is BS or that some generals should have been sacked (and perhaps they were).<p>With the caveat that I wasn&#x27;t the one there, so this is second-hand: Yes, that&#x27;s how it was communicated to me. The Korean 4-stars were advising restarting the war, and the sole American 4-star to have any say in the matter was the only voice of sanity. I dunno how much of that conversation made it to the South Korean President, so I don&#x27;t know if he fired anyone afterwards. I&#x27;m not sure what the formal process is for the ROK-JCS, USFK, CFC, etc... to make a recommendation to the Korean President, as well as the US President, as well as the United Nations Command. All I know is that if left to their own devices in 2010, the ROK JCS would have invaded the North, knowing full-well what the consequences would be.<p>Things coming down to only one, single, yet influential person saying &quot;that&#x27;s a bad idea&quot; should highlight that maybe we don&#x27;t have sufficiently robust institutional controls in place to avoid a bloody conflict indefinitely.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The worst thing that could realistically happen in Korea is a collapse of North Korean regime.<p>I&#x27;ll absolutely agree with this though. There is a very poor understanding of the morale and motivations of most of the NK flag officers. We don&#x27;t know which ones will outright surrender. We don&#x27;t know which ones will say &quot;Fuck it, attack the Imperialists!&quot; We do have a reasonable understanding of the Kim regime&#x27;s priorities: regime survival. So the status quo is preferable to the almost-guaranteed chaos that will ensue should the NK commanders suddenly find themselves in a power vacuum, especially if caused by a hostile foreign actor.')
