If so, how do you meaningfully bring EKS to another cloud without bringing those services? Does EKS call over the public Internet into those other AWS services (and thus lower latency, paying for network usage, etc)? If so, what&#x27;s the advantage of running EKS anywhere other than on Amazon?<p>Presumably with EKS you can already run your worker nodes on prem or on GCP or wherever, so is this just moving the masters over as well? If you&#x27;re willing to run your other AWS services on AWS, what&#x27;s the big advantage of running EKS outside of Amazon as well?')
