Some of the courses he has done is Java 6, Data Structures, \ndiscrete math,  computer architecture, Calculus 2 and Calculus 3 honors. His overall GPA is around 3.5. In high school, he took AP computer\nscience and  AP Calculus and got 4. His language comprehension and communications skills are very low. We have been targeting his learning \nfrom an examination point of view where he would learn at home and spit it out in the tests. It took lot of written practice for him to learn anything and do \nwell in the tests. So, he may not be able to code or program given a spec.<p>Since the start of the pandemic he has been home. Now we see that his skills are deteriorating and have started teaching him HTML&#x2F;CSS and Python. Later on, thinking of introducing Selenium. \nMay be a long road, but the intention is to get him started on software testing. If practiced enough, he picks up on patterns.<p>Has always liked and built complex legos like architecture. We assume that is because of the clear instructions that comes with it.<p>Looking for suggestions on how we can help him. Any opportunities where he can be exposed to the work like environment and build his confidence.\nAny jobs that would involve math calculations but not much social interaction? We fear he may not have focus for a long time for work, although \nhe has taken exams that have been four hours long with breaks.<p>Would appreciate any suggestions or advice. Thank you.')
