It&#x27;s certainly been really hard for us. 4 year old going crazy, me at my desk all day most days. We try to cover for the other one while they get personal time, but it&#x27;s me with the full time job.<p>This past few weeks I&#x27;ve started work at 6am (it&#x27;s 6:07 right now) so that I can create some more space during the day and give her time.<p>I give my son some focused attention &#x2F; special time in the middle of the day and in the evening. It&#x27;s important that he gets a good intense dose of me and I&#x27;m not distracted when with him. Without that he&#x27;s feeling unwanted (why does papa work all the time?) and he acts out. He refuses to join us for dinner: &quot;I&#x27;m working&quot; he says.<p>I was burnt out. Right now I&#x27;m doing well.')
