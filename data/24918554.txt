Every app is so broken, hidpi isn&#x27;t there, font rendering is crap, touch on windows is essentially unusable, many apps didn&#x27;t even let me un-fullscreen without going back to desktop mode (this is a convertible).<p>I surmise that the &quot;upload your pdf and do the editing in the cloud&quot; market only exists because the user story on windows is <i>utter shit</i>. It is so much worse than on debian, running on the same hardware. This includes the touch screen and stylus handling, font rendering, UI, responsiveness, essentially everything that people always claim linux is so bad at.<p>I&#x27;m not comparing it to apples&#x27;s golden cage of course, they may have amazing pdf editing but I&#x27;m not interested.')
