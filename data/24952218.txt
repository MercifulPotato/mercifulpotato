But, unlike others, I don&#x27;t think this very surprising.<p>Many (not all) HN readers, being software engineers, have a high level of pretentiousness that comes from being good in one field, and then carry over that arrogance into areas where they have no clue.<p>Suddenly, you see software engineers pretending they know more than sociologists who have studied the topic for years and dismissing their evidence out of hand or merely responding to the title of the article, without engaging its substance.<p>We see it quite clearly whenever any topic from the social sciences is discussed, be it discrimination, social inequality, government regulation, taxes or the welfare state.')
