And it leads to some interesting perspectives.<p>SSC classic, <i>The Toxoplasma of Rage</i>[0], explores this a bit. One fragment that burned into my mind is the few paragraphs reinterpreting the War on Terror as a parasite with multi-stage life cycle (like toxoplasma). To quote a part:<p>&gt; <i>From the human point of view, jihad and the War on Terror are opposing forces. From the memetic point of view, theyâ€™re as complementary as caterpillars and butterflies. Instead of judging, we just note that somehow we accidentally created a replicator, and replicators are going to replicate until something makes them stop.</i><p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;the-toxoplasma-of-rage&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;17&#x2F;the-toxoplasma-of-rage...</a>')
