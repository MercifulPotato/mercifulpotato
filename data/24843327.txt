Perhaps that&#x27;s when you know that AI has truly become embedded in the fabric of a company: when it&#x27;s become just another tool that ordinary engineers are expected to know and use to solve problems.<p>Anyway, I think AI is a sustaining innovation, not a disruptive innovation.  It makes existing businesses work better, but it doesn&#x27;t create new markets where none previously existed like the Internet did.  Google makes <i>a ton</i> of money off AI; the core of the ads system is a massive machine-learning model that optimizes ad clicks like no human could.  But that only works because they already have the traffic and the data, which they got by positioning themselves as the center of the Internet when it was young.<p>I do agree that companies need to adjust their processes to take full advantage of AI rather than expecting it to be a magic bullet, but I don&#x27;t know if I really think &quot;birth trauma&quot; is the right metaphor.  More like adolescence; it&#x27;s a painful identity shift, and some people never successfully make the leap.  Those who can&#x27;t don&#x27;t die, though, they just become emotionally stunted adults that never reach their full potential.')
