Basically each object takes up an interval along each axis, so a necessary condition for collisions between two objects is that the intersection of the intervals along each axis are non-empty. (which means if there is no overlap of intervals along any axis, you can guarantee they are not colliding).<p>You compute the bounds along each axis in linear time. The sorting of these bounds can be done in linear time, then you take a pass over each axis looking at the marked intervals, which is also linear.')
