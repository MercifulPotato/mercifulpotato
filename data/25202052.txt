(The cultural preferences distort what ‘attractiveness’ is and influence your ranking, and for you this <i>also</i> dilutes the potential of interest in your profile, so of the people less likely to be looking for you only a few of them see you and reject, the others never saw you to consider.)<p>As you can distort this ranking (literally just act like you think a hot girl would act on a dating app, ignoring everyone that matches them for a few weeks, and also selectively swiping to try matching someone), you should redirect that energy towards the apps more so than the women.<p>Guys and unattractive women get frustrated and end up swiping <i>more</i> and entertaining what they can get - casting a larger net. This puts them all in the same bucket and why you see more of each other, and people looking specifically for your attributes, ie. same race. It is aiming to mirror the physical world but has flaws because it lacks inputs available in the physical world.')
