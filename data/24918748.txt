To be honest I am disappointed that people are misleading others, the Proton DB website will give Platinum badge to games that don&#x27;t just work\nSee Fallout NW <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.protondb.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;22380" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.protondb.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;22380</a>\nit is Platinum but check the comments for the issues reported and workarounds that might work (I had to give up for now) , For the Gold badge see example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.protondb.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;719040" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.protondb.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;719040</a>  , you need custom proton  versions and customization.<p>Can we please be honest and say that with some or a lot of work we can get many games running in Linux but is expected of you to know your way around Wine tech to configure and fix stuff.<p>Similar complaint about Arch&#x2F;wayland&#x2F;CoolShit2000 works great for me but the full truth is hidden that it kinda works if you use this DE, and this Video card, and not use that feature and you read the wiki before you do anything.<p>Any other Linux users that agrees with me and is tired of the misleading &quot;it works perfect now&quot;')
