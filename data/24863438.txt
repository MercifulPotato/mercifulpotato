Most of them are pretty much rote memorization of commercial products, so fairly low value, or &#x27;one trick ponies&#x27; where they know how to create a web app with one and only one tech stack (by copy-pasting templates!).<p>Really, I expect anyone with a good degree or previous experience to just be able to read git and GitHub&#x27;s manuals and get it.')
