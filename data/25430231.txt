Item(by='kuschku', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608040099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25428640, text='&gt; German ISPs do the same thing, by offering you the choice of a basic router or a Fritz!Box for a higher fee. In every instance I have seen, you&#x27;re better off selecting the cheapest device your ISP will provide, putting it into bridge mode, and using your own router&#x2F;AP via Ethernet.<p>That&#x27;s true, but pretty much everyone chooses the Fritz!Box, cause they&#x27;re just that great for the price. Easy to use, lots of functionality, and actually really great performance. For a home router, at least.')
