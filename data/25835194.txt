Getting it set up can be a bit frustrating if things don’t go right, and there is a small learning curve for using `@lift`, but it is an absolute joy to use once you ramp up.<p>I use it for my research by default. You can pan, zoom, etc. The subplot&#x2F;layout system is frankly a lot better than Matlab (and I enjoyed Matlab for plotting!). The best part is that I can insert sliders and drop downs into my plot easily, which means I don’t need to waste time figuring out the best static, 2D plot for my experiment. I just dump all the data into some custom logging struct and use sliders to index into the correct 2D plot (e.g. a heat map changing over time, I just save all the matrices and use the slider to get the heat map at time t).')
