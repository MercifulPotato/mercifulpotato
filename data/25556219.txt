You can break these rules and get curves that have fewer points, but they will be very tough to tweak.<p>Break these rules and you <i>will</i> pay for it in more time spent when you need to change things.<p>You can make an analogy to programming rules that tell you to eschew excessive cleverness - sure, it may be more succinct, but are you gonna be able to edit it later? What about the person who comes in once you&#x27;ve left and has to deal with it?<p>(These are also guidelines, I do not obsessively follow these precisely; to be quite honest I mostly avoid using Illustrator&#x27;s Pen tool for the organic shapes I mostly draw - but if I need to tweak a path, I&#x27;ll use these rules and a couple other tools to quickly modify where the points are along a path, and do it easily.)')
