You only get first impressions, and no opportunity to explain why your phone has nicks in it. (Think: business meetings.)<p>The people spend enough time around you to know that your phone, while looking a little beaten, is actually very reliable -- they don&#x27;t care what kind of phone you have.<p>I think the film Parasite portrays the nuances of this kind of status quite well. (Even though the film is slightly comedic, I don&#x27;t think the portrayal of status is exaggerated in the film.)')
