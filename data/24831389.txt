I favor the Apps more that websites because of what the web has become.<p>Being able to know in what I am getting in and tapping install is much, much better experience than tapping on a link to the unknown then trying to figure out how to reach the thing I am looking for when the website tries to track me, monetize me, make me sign up all at the same time.<p>A website would usually load about the same size data of a native app without a warning and would report me to facebook, google and others.<p>Thatâ€™s not something I am thrilled about.')
