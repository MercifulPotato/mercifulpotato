You can&#x27;t just &quot;make people better&quot;, just because they aren&#x27;t having the same priorities, desires and morals as you do? That&#x27;s the mistake the guys that did the mass-relocations of old did. ;)<p>In the long run, there is no silver bullet to fight climate change, pollution, over-population, decreased nativity, poverty, geopolitical power-play, consumerism, good old greed, and the other things that we humans use to screw up the planet. We need just as many different solutions as there are problems.<p>What we need is a cultural change that swings people from &quot;doing nothing&quot; to &quot;doing something&quot;. If we keep trying to look for ways to force others to do what we want then we&#x27;ll just keep fighting about it. I&#x27;ve planted 20 trees this week. With luck, I&#x27;ll do another 50 this weekend. The plan is to turn our second, unused, field into a forest. I encourage everyone to set a good example by doing their part rather than trying to find ways of forcing others to do things for them.')
