If a bike or pedestrian is moving in the uncontrolled direction, should we allow a car in the controlled direction to be able to block uncontrolled traffic - car, bike, pedestrian without by default being liable.<p>My answer would be no - the car coming from the controlled direction cannot impede the uncontrolled lanes of traffic when proceeding.  If something suddenly appeared, like an animal, then we should allow drivers some leeway to resolve that trolley problem.  However, I would add that there should be an expectation that things are proportionate - allowing a cat to survive should not force a biker or pedestrian to hit the car.<p>I think we can generalize this further by introducing right-of-way and other concepts that make fully controlled intersections more difficult, but I feel the results will be roughly similar.<p>To your initial questions, the body of the car moved into the bike lane when I had insufficient time or space to deviate my path to avoid the car.  I hit the hood of the car and flew over it.<p>I am in agreement that if I&#x27;m following someone through an intersection and rear-end them based on them double stopping, I think it is less so when we are dealing with orthogonal lanes of traffic.')
