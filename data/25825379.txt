Trading on how you think OTHERS will trade and systemizing it (ex vol and momentum) is powerful but clearly doesn’t scale when you become the market yourself<p>And a bonus one - despite being a math genius, he basically was failing till he brought on others. He hired the right people (ie those interested in math not finance), created the right environment, took care of logistics, and pushed on a key insight (model to trade). He couldn’t have done it by himself.')
