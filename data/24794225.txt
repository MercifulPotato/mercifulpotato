Even if in this case that certain thing is in the class of completely irrefutable facts, it doesn&#x27;t really matter because they&#x27;re just asserting their power to disagree. Like a toddler that gets in a mood where they just say &quot;no&quot; to everything. Trying to reason with that type of response is useless and it&#x27;s also beside the point, the point is that they just want to exercise their free will. And they also probably are enjoying that it is frustrating other people.<p>A mental illness framing is kind of interesting though, I&#x27;ve never really thought about it like that. It implies that it could be treatable, which I&#x27;m not really sure is true. Can you &quot;treat&quot; a troll?')
