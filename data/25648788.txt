I simply believed (and still believe) that the next popular social network will be built by someone who doesn&#x27;t know how to code. I&#x27;ve become a bit obsessed with trying to figure what a platform might look like that makes that possible.<p>For the curious, here&#x27;s a rough demo of what I&#x27;d built in April. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;MV7Eo_18KqA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;MV7Eo_18KqA</a> Normally I have a demo server online but it runs on a laptop in my living room and my power went out this morning.<p>I can only take this project so far on my own. I&#x27;m decent at writing code but decidedly terrible at product and design. Having someone to hash ideas out with would be incredible.<p>I&#x27;d love to spitball ideas if you&#x27;re up for a chat. General feedback is also always welcome. toby@koala.codes')
