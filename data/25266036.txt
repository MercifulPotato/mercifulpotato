ETC has been 51% attacked multiple times and it still exists. It&#x27;s very possible some people are going to mine btc on their personal hardware even in 2100.  \nThe only caveat is the difficulty adjustment algorithm, as it&#x27;s potentially possible for btc to become stuck at an extremely high difficulty.<p>For &#x27;kill&#x27; as in &#x27;stops being big and important&#x27; I think it&#x27;s going to happen relatively soon, mostly agreeing with your article. Bitcoin already lost its past domination in users and total fees paid to ethereum, the only missing part is for eth to actually monetize that by fully switching from PoW to PoS. When eth stakers start making even billions annually while btc buyers lose billions annually to mining, btc losing its first place is only a matter of time. After that, PoW is going to be widely discredited and viewed as obsolete.')
