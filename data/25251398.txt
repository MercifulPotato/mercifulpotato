You start off with a premise that&#x27;s widely agreeable like &quot;ICE cars are bad for the environment&quot; and slowly edge towards stuff like &quot;private vehicle ownership is a blight on society&quot;, which is far less agreeable and completely ignores what most people in society actually want. 20 years ago I used to vote for local green candidates in various elections, but their main platform now is radical socialist economic reform. I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re even bothered about the environment any more.')
