For example, at my daily job I often do:<p><pre><code>  $ smug start project # when I start my day\n  $ smug start project:chats-microservices # when I&#x27;m about to start working on chats-microservice\n</code></pre>\nThe last command just creates a window in current session with configuration you specified.\nAlso, smug is dependency-free. You don&#x27;t need ruby or python for it.')
