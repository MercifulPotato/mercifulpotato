What does it mean to enforce &#x27;memory safety&#x27; across the boundaries of two different applications&#x2F;libraries that may have entirely different ways of keeping track of memory allocations and deallocations? Again, FFI has to be agnostic to such implementation details in order to work, and it does so by forcing you to define interfaces in terms of the lowest possible level of abstraction common to all applications. That means explicitly specifying expected memory layout and calling convention on both the application and library sides, i.e. an ABI.')
