Programming languages have structure - you can&#x27;t just type random text, there is a specific syntax, with specific semantic rules based on what you type.<p>So all I&#x27;m saying is that you are working in a formal system, and you are creating formal logic. Every day.<p>That has nothing to do with correctness. In logic, there is a difference between validity and soundness. A valid argument is one that is in a proper form. You can make valid arguments that are completely untrue.<p>A sound argument is one that is valid and also happens to be true. It&#x27;s trivial to create a valid program - it either compiles or is executable by the interpreter. But that has nothing to do with soundness.<p>It&#x27;s quite ironic. The unwillingness to understand something, such as math and logic in this case, leads to criticizing it. You can&#x27;t evaluate what you don&#x27;t understand.')
