At least aside from at a very basic level.<p>If you want to build a bridge, I’d assume there’s a set of standards it has to comply with. If it doesn’t meet the spec you could explain in very objective terms why the quality isn’t sufficient. If you had to sit in front of the board and explain why you think a piece of software wasn’t built to a sufficient standard of quality, you’re going to really struggle to do that in objective terms. The best you could really hope to do is present a well articulated opinion. Anybody who disagrees with you could present their own opinion, and unless they have a high degree of technical competence, they’re not going to have any objective approach for making judgements about that.<p>Sure lots of companies prioritize feature velocity over code quality. But I doubt most of them a very well informed about what quality compromises they’re actually making.')
