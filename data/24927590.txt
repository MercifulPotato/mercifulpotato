I don&#x27;t know what people feel particularly strongly about, or have particularly bad experiences with. I don&#x27;t know how people want problems to be reported&#x2F;addressed. I don&#x27;t know whether to expect the community leaders&#x27; support when there are problems, or whether it&#x27;ll be blamed on me for having the wrong values. All of these distract from trying to get technical work done. Writing things down is useful.')
