You can use regular distilled water as long as you do it quickly, but unless it is deoxygenated it will be corroding so don&#x27;t leave it in water for long.<p>Alcohol is there mostly to dilute water so that it dries out very quickly. Without alcohol water could stay under components for a long time and kill or damage your board.<p>Alcohols can damage some plastic components, so don&#x27;t keep it in alcohol fo too long, either.')
