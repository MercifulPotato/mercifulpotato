My 16&quot; MBP has a bigger screen, 4 usb ports so I can charge, two-factor auth, external microphone and external webcam at the same time. The downside is that it&#x27;s much louder under load, but that is apparently worth it for me.<p>Also the 16&quot; was much more expensive, but and it has much shorter time on battery - but I already paid for it and I&#x27;m usually close to a power plug anyways.<p>Maybe I&#x27;d use the M1 more if zoom was less prevalent.')
