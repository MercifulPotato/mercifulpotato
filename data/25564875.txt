If you want that the representation &quot;0 seconds&quot; actually matches the instant when there are actually 0 seconds left (i.e., no more time left), you should label these millisecond ranges as follows:<p>* 5000 to 4001: &quot;5 seconds&quot;<p>* 4000 to 3001: &quot;4 seconds&quot;<p>* 3000 to 2001: &quot;3 seconds&quot;<p>* 2000 to 1001: &quot;2 seconds&quot;<p>* 1000 to 0001: &quot;1 second&quot;<p>* 0: &quot;0 seconds&quot; (which usually the user doesn&#x27;t read if the screen shows something else)<p>Simple enough?<p>The thing is, yes the iPhone timer does something in between, in order to show <i>both</i> the initial (5) and the final (0) numbers for a non-instantaneous amount of time, but (IMHO) that&#x27;s the most confusing choice.')
