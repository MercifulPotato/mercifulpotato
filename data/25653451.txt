Time to rethink my free will.<p>It’s interesting, that study was 10 years ago.  I haven’t heard of non-nicotine compounds becoming a part of the therapy since then.  But what also happened in those 10 years was nicotine vaporizers took off, and a lot of people traded smoking for those.  Wonder what the study would have found if it had nicotine puffs in addition to de-nic tobacco and sham puffs.')
