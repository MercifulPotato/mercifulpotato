And it talked about the grpc client, the vtgates, the routing in the vtgates, the vttablet and finally the MySQL database. That would make sense.<p>But for it to be titled life of a vitess cluster and talk only about setting up a vitess cluster. I donâ€™t really think it follows. For instance, I might expect how reparents happen to be included as well. Or what it takes to reshard a key space, etc.')
