Looking at Redmonk, Tiobe, other surveys...Perl isn&#x27;t at the top of the heap by any measure but it also stubbornly refuses to die. I write Perl every day and frankly don&#x27;t care if people think it is &quot;dead&quot;, and even I am surprised at how prominent it figures in language surveys, still.<p>Most of the key libraries I use are updated regularly.
