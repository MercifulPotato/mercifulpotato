There are some audiophiles using wireless these days, but always <i>lossless</i>. Apple has, to that market&#x27;s dismay, been using lossy bluetooth. The silence here suggests they still are.<p>It&#x27;s too expensive for the &#x27;anything that works&#x27; crowd but is definitely not an audiophile product. Noise cancellation? Crowded market. Not sure where else this could fit in.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the Apple watch. On the low end it really doesn&#x27;t have any competition. Other smart watches look awful in comparison and you get a lot for $400 or whatever they cost.<p>But the high end of their range? I know zero watch people who have swapped their mechanical watch for a <i>high end</i> Apple watch. They might wear a low end one occasionally, but an expensive watch that has to be plugged in daily -- well, that&#x27;s electronic at all -- is the antithesis of high end watches.<p>More succinctly: An audiophile AirPods is like an Hermes Apple Watch. Cringey, expensive, but will probably find an audience somewhere in the gap between low income and high taste.')
