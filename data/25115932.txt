But there&#x27;s no reason, so ads are used too, and are quite effective in that too. And it won&#x27;t be convenient for a buyer that doesn&#x27;t know certain offering exists. I.e. if I don&#x27;t know such thing as wireless headphones existed, I couldn&#x27;t effectively look it up and seek reviews for it - somebody should tell me first - dude, did you know you can get rid of those annoying wires and just buy wireless ones? Now, did I &quot;need&quot; them? Strictly speaking, no - I could very well have lived all my life with wired ones and be fine. But wireless are better for me, so why should I resent someone who tries to sell them to me? For me, it&#x27;s a win-win.')
