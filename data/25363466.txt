There&#x27;s no chance of pulling it off now, even though I&#x27;m in ultramarathon shape.<p>The point being, you run your pace. Congrats on starting and keeping up your running. It&#x27;s a really good form of exercise -- inexpensive, readily available, and low-overhead. There will always be faster people, and there will always be slower people. You&#x27;ll meet both at races (when races are a thing again), and mostly what you&#x27;ll feel is camaraderie that you&#x27;re all in it together regardless of your pace.')
