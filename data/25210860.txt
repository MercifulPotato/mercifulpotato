All public service. All of it, combined, and ever. Want to be a police office, and a senator, and president? You can, but all of those have to be limited to 12 (not necessarily consecutive) years.<p>An influx of new people will do the following:<p>- Reduce graft and nepotism and corruption as a whole.<p>- Constantly bring fresh eyes to old processes.<p>- Increase and improve knowledge sharing.<p>- Provide people with a safety net while bringing them working skills that can be applied outside of government.<p>- Give more people a chance to understand how and why the government works. It will make them more sympathetic for others when dealing with bureaucracy of government and make them feel like they are a stakeholder in the process.<p>The concept of professional politicians is a new one. It is a sign that we have all given up on our ability to understand and participate in the democratic process. We should all be engaged and feel like we can be part of the process, at any level in the process.')
