They make a good amount of their money via merch versus ads. Webtoons handles their signed artists but there are a ton of the unsigned ones that rely on patron and etsy for income.\nIs there a way to link through articles about the artist&#x2F;product to the sign up or have an embedded option on a third party&#x27;s page?')
