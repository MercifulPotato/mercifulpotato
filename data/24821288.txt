The track record of people, even really smart people who work in technology, being able to predict the &#x27;brand new things&#x27; that technology will be used for, is awful.  Plus, if you want to get the technology up and running, it needs to get used for something old (better) first.  If the early moviemakers hadn&#x27;t made play-like movies first, they might never have learned enough about film to make movies that weren&#x27;t like that.<p>Just because the early uses of a technology are doing old things better, but the later brand new things turn out to be a bigger deal, doesn&#x27;t mean the &#x27;old things better&#x27; phase was a mistake.  It is probably necessary.')
