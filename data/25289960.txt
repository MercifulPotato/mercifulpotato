So you gotta redefine the norm from norm = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) into norm = max(x, y).<p>From there, you get extension fields from real vs imaginary already. (Ex: you can form a new extension field from x + y*j, where x and y are complex numbers), which forms a new periodic cycle.<p>I mean, deriving it all is hard because group theory is hard. I&#x27;m not sure if its because the tools &quot;aren&#x27;t there&quot;. Some super-AI or super-human probably can derive it all from those given facts.')
