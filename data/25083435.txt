Item(by='avmich', descendants=None, kids=[25087579], score=None, time=1605282423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25083344, text='&gt; They are listed with numbers about payload to (quite low) LEO.<p>Then one should include the mass of Shuttle Orbiter. That the orbiter is used as a second stage... Saturn-V lists mass of third stage alright.<p>&gt; The Saturn V could have launched 140 tons to LEO, it just never did.<p>No, it <i>never could</i>. It&#x27;s a popular illusion. The only way to reach 140 was to count parts of Saturn V reaching orbit as payload. When you count payload only, that number falls. It&#x27;s like counting the mass of Sputnik 1 adding the weight of the second stage of R-7. Or, in other words, a satellite with mass 140 tons couldn&#x27;t be brought to LEO by Saturn V.<p>To get Saturn V realistic number for LEO in similar sense to Shuttle&#x27;s 27 tons (did Shuttle ever got 27 tons to orbit? Could it even be launched safely with 27 tons payload, given that it could only land with about 15 tons in the bay?), you should look at ~77 tons of Skylab. There is at least a hint that LEO payload is not all which gets to LEO.')
