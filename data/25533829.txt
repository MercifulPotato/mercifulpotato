So two years after it was filed, and a year after it was closed, another user figures out on a different bug that the Linux psuedo device initializes size to 0, 0? That is super odd.<p>What is more odd, is that the number of lines and columns are in both the termcap file and the terminfo database for the vt220, and in the bug the user said they had set TERM to be vt220, which if you do an infocmp after setting will show you it is a 24 line x 80 column terminal. And yet the user krader1961 has them going through a stty command to set the values to 24 x 80? That &quot;fix&quot; just raises more questions than it answers. Why doesn&#x27;t stty respect termcap&#x2F;terminfo? Why does fish see 0,0, and what is going on with terminal support in general?')
