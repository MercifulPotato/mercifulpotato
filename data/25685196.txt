It’s simply the result of optimizing for your own kids’ outcome.  The country dismantled mental health care facilities and the law doesn’t allow for involuntary committals.  The country’s drug policies and lack of economic opportunities created addicts who may not be able to be helped.  Overall, we don’t have the stomach for the necessary wealth transfer needed to fix broken families (providing poor parents with sufficient wages and time off and healthcare so they still have time to be at home with their kids).<p>As an individual, there isn’t much you can do to in the timeframe of raising your kids to solve these issues.  So you do the next best thing (if you can afford it).  You run away from the problem as much as you can.  Which also helps exacerbate the issues.  And it’s all part and parcel of the increasingly wide wealth&#x2F;income&#x2F;opportunity gaps.')
