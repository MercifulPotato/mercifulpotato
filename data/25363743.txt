I expect the conspiracy claims to be separated out from the genuine concerns if the Supreme Court chooses to hear that suit.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think that. I doubt any legally-minded individuals think there&#x27;s any merit to that lawsuit.<p>1. It&#x27;s dubious Texas even has standing. Texas has extremely limited influence, if any, over the manner in which other states manage their elections. If Pennsylvania wanted, they could divvy out their electoral votes via coin flip in future elections. As far as I&#x27;m aware (and I&#x27;m not a lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt), a state suing another state for the way it handles elections is entirely without precedent.<p>2. There&#x27;s the issue of laches. If mail-in voting is unconstitutional, the time to make that argument was months ago. Courts are already hesitant to change election procedure near election day for fear of confusing voters. They are far less willing to disenfranchise tens of millions of voters after ballots have already been cast.')
