So that&#x27;s another way to look at SPAs than just &quot;SPA = web app&quot; which you say is hard to make sense of.<p>Not quite sure what kind of examples you&#x27;re asking for.<p>The Discourse forum (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.discourse.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meta.discourse.org&#x2F;</a>, used as Blizzard&#x27;s official forums for example) is a large Ember Javascript app with a Rails server. Something noteworthy about it here is that instead of traditional pagination, it has a sort of scrubber in the topic view, and topics behave as an endless scroll with UI to tell you where you are in the topic.<p>So, deciding to build a forum as a SPA isn&#x27;t because &quot;forum = web app&quot; (most people here wouldn&#x27;t even make that connection) but rather they targeted a level of interactive UX for what they thought would make a compelling forum, and building most of the UI in Javascript was a sensible way to implement it.')
