Item(by='luord', descendants=None, kids=[25936168], score=None, time=1611791085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933121, text='&gt; It&#x27;s somewhat just the return of global variables.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. This is far from the only objection&#x2F;disagreement I have with the article, but I can take almost everything else as either opinions or convenient examples in support of those opinions.<p>That sentence, though, just stuck with me as particularly odd because, among other things, using classes doesn&#x27;t make you more likely to use global variables than using functions exclusively. And I&#x27;m not even talking about Python in specific.<p>Anyhow, it had been a while, I think, since a post pitting FP against OOP had reached the front page, and thus causing yet another iteration of that traditional flamewar in the comments. Guess it was due.')
