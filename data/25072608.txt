Then you&#x27;d commit both files to version control, but you would only ever modify your requirements.txt by hand. If a lock file is present that gets used during a pip install, otherwise it would use your requirements.txt file.<p>The above work flow is how Ruby, Elixir and Node&#x27;s package managers operate out of the box. It seems to work pretty well in practice for ensuring your top level deps are readable and your builds are deterministic.<p>Currently there&#x27;s no sane way to replicate that behavior using pip. That&#x27;s partly why other Python package managers have come into existence over the years.')
