(A good argument for decentralization, but leaves big gap in curation which many people consider critical)<p>Fun part is that this hasn’t been tested (or hadn’t since I was doing that stuff) but the fact that lawyers direct these decisions based on experience and companies choose to pay or not pay based on that, your fantasy of some kind of unambiguous first amendment that the US government or legal system doesn’t regulate sounds hilariously uninformed.')
