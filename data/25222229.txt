They did all of this in a familiar package that runs faster, quieter and last much longer without major impact on the customer&#x27;s experience.<p>A complete package that was executed well on the first try and for some, this is considered to be a game-changer. Especially as it is changing many people&#x27;s understanding of how a laptop should behave, specifically not having to worry about heat, battery life and having too low of memory as Apple&#x27;s UMA actually makes swapping to disk a non-issue, there&#x27;s no difference in the overall experience.<p>SPX isn&#x27;t a complete package either, it uses Microsoft customizations on top of Qualcomm&#x27;s Snapdragon 8cx CPU but solely Qualcomm&#x27;s GPU, Adreno. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything else that MS has customized for SPX.<p>&gt;  From what you&#x27;re saying the most important improvements have been the emulation and that it is better supported.<p>That&#x27;s just one part. The overall experience matters. You can invent a technology that changes the world but if no one can use it well, it wouldn&#x27;t matter much until someone take that technology and make it useful. Sadly, it&#x27;s the latter that matters the most.<p>It&#x27;s the same thing with iPhone being called one of the most important technological revolutions. iPhone was definitely not the first nor the second touch screen mobile device but it was a complete package that sold it, just like these Macs.')
