Dominion is under no obligation to prove the that the election was fair. Guiliani now have the opportunity through discovery to support his allegations, or at least the was in good faith. If he fails to do so he risk being on the hook for $1B+.<p>It <i>is</i> curious that of all his public allegations against Dominion, he <i>never</i> asserted those in court. He is a lawyer and is aware of the consequences of asserting false accusations or frivolous suits in court. No doubt he will point to Sidney Powell and claim <i>he</i> was in good faith.<p>Most of the claims he made were pretty outlandish, and IMO he (especially as a lawyer) should now better. This is going to be interesting.<p>He publicly claimed that the Dominion machines &quot;switched votes&quot; even after the hand-count in Georgia confirmed that the machine count had indeed been accurate.')
