The safety comes from pairing a newtype with an encapsulation mechanism and a carefully-designed trust boundary.<p>Without an encapsulation mechanism, I do not consider using newtypes to wrap real numbers with units of measure sufficient to be called “type safety”; in my experience it still requires significant discipline to use properly (because the points of wrapping&#x2F;unwrapping are usually fairly local and require delicate care).<p>Of course, this is a matter of both subjective definition and relative situation. One can theoretically imagine a codebase that conventionally uses units-of-measure wrappers so pervasively that the safety is genuine, since the places where values are wrapped&#x2F;unwrapped are so well-defined that any misuse would stick out as wrong. However, I have never in my life seen such a codebase, so anecdotally I can only consider such measures more like the lines painted on a road to delineate lanes than a bona fide safety mechanism.')
