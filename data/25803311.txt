I usually use 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8.<p>This tool shows you the path your traffic takes:<p><pre><code>    $ traceroute 1.1.1.1\n    traceroute to 1.1.1.1 (1.1.1.1), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\n    1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  1.286 ms  1.386 ms  1.963 ms\n    2  192.168.11.1 (192.168.11.1)  2.591 ms  4.342 ms  5.219 ms\n    ...snip...\n    16  0.ae19.GW8.CHI13.ALTER.NET (140.222.230.223)  42.888 ms  35.742 ms 0.ae20.GW8.CHI13.ALTER.NET (140.222.230.225)  41.060 ms\n    17  152.179.105.202 (152.179.105.202)  51.913 ms  50.681 ms  55.442 ms\n    18  one.one.one.one (1.1.1.1)  70.087 ms  65.130 ms  53.607 ms\n</code></pre>\nThe snippet above shows that I have two local devices (192.168.1.1, 192.168.11.1) my traffic passes through and 18 devices total before my traffic hits the public IP.<p>Run this command at 3:39.  Then run it again at 3:40.  Then again at 3:41.  Compare results and that should give you a good idea which device is malfunctioning at that time.<p>Some routers also have a ping command baked into them.  If you can make it constantly ping 8.8.8.8, while you run the test above, it may help you.  In the case where your traceroute stops at your own router, you can look at the ping from the router itself, and see if it also stopped:<p>A) If the traceroute stops at your router, but the router ping is not interrupted, then something in your router is flaking out.<p>B) If the router ping is also interrupted, then the problem is &quot;upstream&quot; from you.  Maybe the cable modem (or whatever device) that is upstream from your router.<p>If you decide the problem is upstream, contact your ISP.  If it&#x27;s local, investigate and&#x2F;or replace the flaky device.<p>HTH.')
