Flynn and others were charged with obstruction of justice.  You don&#x27;t obstruct justice because it&#x27;s fun and dandy.<p>The trump campaign and admin has made huge efforts to cover up crimes relating to it&#x27;s behavior with respects to Russia.  What exactly are they hiding?<p>I personally believe it isn&#x27;t as deep as it seems, but it is also very serious.  I don&#x27;t think Trump is given orders by Russia, or that there was deep cooperation.  However, even somewhat of coordination and discussions of sensitive information is criminal.<p>So yes, the Russian collusion narrative is entirely true.  The only reason Trump wasn&#x27;t charged with obstruction of justice is because of a memo saying they shouldn&#x27;t charge their boss, not because there isn&#x27;t enough evidence.<p>One of the big differences between what happened in Portland and DC is INTENT.  The insurrectionists yesterday intended on forcing the joint session to declare Trump the winner of the presidential election.  They were attempted to do by force what they failed to do at the ballot box, and at the court house.  The fact they were inept and failed does not excuse them at all.<p>That does not compare even slightly to what happened in Portland.  Protests that turns into riots aren&#x27;t good.  However, there was not an intent to overthrow the presidential election there at all.<p>This kind of whataboutism needs to stop.')
