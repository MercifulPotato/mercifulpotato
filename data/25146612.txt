It&#x27;s just CSS. You shouldn&#x27;t need to re-work your entire process around it.<p>The custom stuff in our config was mostly the need to create standard styles for components. Eg. button large, button small, etc. to correspond with our design system.<p>For example, here&#x27;s tailwind code required to create a button large: \n<i>bg-violet-100 text-violet-700 text-base font-semibold px-6 py-2 rounded-lg</i><p>How the hell does that help with consistency? You have to copy paste that mess every time you create a new button, and then guess what happens if the button you copied from needed special margin? Try debugging that if something looks wrong. Also try turning that into dark mode.<p>Now you&#x27;ve got to search through the spaghetti to find what&#x27;s custom about this button and fix it every time.<p>You know what&#x27;s easier? Creating a &quot;.btn-lg&quot; style to fit our design system, and just typing .btn-lg each time. It also has the bonus of making your code actually readable.<p>Maybe this is solved with the groups functionality in the latest tailwind, but this is just one of the frustrations I eventually developed.')
