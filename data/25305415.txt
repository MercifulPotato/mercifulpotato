We pay them for this as we have few enough applicants that we want to test that we can afford to.<p>We give them the requirement as if it came directly from the client. It&#x27;s incomplete and there&#x27;s a few assumptions they might make that would be incorrect.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to watch how people have approached this. We&#x27;ve only done two so far but the degree to which they ask the right questions vs leap in and try and code their way through it is revealing a lot.<p>Our initial setup instructions had a couple of errors in and this too has been really useful. Watching how they respond and how they resolve the problem.<p>It&#x27;s remarkably close to real world tasks - poorly worded requirements, problems with documentation, missed assumptions that it feels like we&#x27;re testing the things we really want to test.<p>The difficulty is that we can&#x27;t come right out and tell them this is what we&#x27;re doing and the artificial nature of the test might make them less likely to ask questions that they would ask in a live task. We&#x27;ve tried to drop hints to guide them into doing so however.')
