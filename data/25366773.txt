Their purpose is to profit, not inform. This applies both to red team and blue team news media. Comfortable lies are profitable while difficult truths are not.<p>Sunlight is the best disinfectant. Silencing voices we don&#x27;t like only give them credence and power, especially in the age of the internet and new media.')
