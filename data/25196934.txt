I&#x27;ll be building a new home soon and am somewhat inclined to run wires to <i>everywhere</i> that little sensors and activators and other devices will go.  Mainly for more peace of mind re security, reduced spectrum noise, reliability (and of course power).<p>I just wish there were more wired product options out there.  Love to hear recommendations.<p>Also, is Ubiquity generally considered more suitable now than OpenWRT&#x2F;Tomato&#x2F;Dd-WRT and the like?  At present I have a fleet of off-the-shelf routers deployed at various properties with custom bits added to the firmware (for improved monitoring, history, auditing, even periodically speed testing radio links and whatnot).<p>I read sometime back Ubiquity killed off some of the programmability features and that lent some wariness to my long term plans to switch over to their gear.')
