I’d guess experimenting with a different form could change how users interact.<p>Obviously we can’t change things like an individual’s attraction and that’s not the focus. App devs sould act on larger patterns, i.e. if the app devs receive a significant number of reports that their users are feeling excluded, they should go to work. Maybe change something small and see if it helps.')
