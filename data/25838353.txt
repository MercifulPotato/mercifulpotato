The limit of 435 Reps skews the numbers.<p>House of Representatives is suppose to be 1 Rep per a fixed number of people.  But Congress put a hard limit of 435, that means Small States have more people per Rep than Large States.<p>For example, Wyoming has 1 Rep for 480900 people.<p>California has 1 rep per 736000 people.  To be fair and agree with the original intent of the US Constitution, California should have about 82 Reps instead of 53.<p>Texas for that matter should really have 52 Reps instead of 36 as it as now.  The way it is now it has one rep per 700279 people.<p>Fixing that limit should solve a lot of problems')
