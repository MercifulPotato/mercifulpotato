That&#x27;s between the cats and the birds, and even the fact that some humans own or feed some of those cats is irrelevant.<p>Not only that, did everyone forget all the humans that have birdfeeders and the even more that simply litter and leave edible garbage everywhere? (or in garbage bins for that matter)<p>Most of the problems brought up about either dogs or cats sound to me like the most sane and correct reaction which does the most good for everyone, is to simply be more tolerant of other people&#x27;s pets as a fact of life, the same way we have to for their babies.<p>It&#x27;s like the annoyance of a baby crying in some place like a restaurant or a plane. I agree, that is super annoying, if you&#x27;ve somehow managed to live too much of your life shielded from that annoyance. But really the problem is not the baby or the fact that a parent took the baby into a public shared space, it&#x27;s that you are too much of a baby to tolerate it.<p>Intolerant selfish douchebags can sort of get away with making the argument that you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to go out to a restaurant with a baby, and can actually turn their intolerance into someone els&#x27;s inconsideration. You could choose to stay home where I don&#x27;t have to deal with your unsightly family, or just don&#x27;t have any kids like I didn&#x27;t, or just leave them with a babysitter etc etc.<p>But what about a plane? If you have a kid you simply can&#x27;t travel?<p>But even the restaurant example has that same essense of unreasonable discrimination as the plane example.<p>I say people are forgetting that life and being a human is a bit messy and inconvenient once in a while, and it&#x27;s fundamentally wrong to go <i>quite so</i> far towards trying to erase all the mild blemishes on your perfect clean unruffled existense when that requires telling other people they can&#x27;t exist eny other ways except exactly the same sterile predicatble compartmented existence you like.<p>Not only do I say dogs and cats should be more tolerated as simply a recognized reasonable ingredient in life, and that it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect to erase all trace of their messiness any more than it is to do so with human babies, I say it&#x27;s also depressing that the universe of animal companions has been reduced to cats and dogs. How neat and tidy and boxed a web form with a cat or dog radio button.<p>For all the obvious <i>obvious</i> arguments, it&#x27;s still just fundamentally not a good progression.<p>This all comes from someone who has neither pets nor kids. I am not arguing from the bias of having a kid or a pet myself that I want to be free to annoy everyone else with.')
