I&#x27;m delighted that it found its way onto Hacker News  :D  Anyway, I&#x27;d love to do all of this rendering on the GPU in future. I&#x27;m sure that would be more cost-efficient. When I looked into this topic last year, I remember finding out that GPU rendering with V-Ray is not as flexible in terms of generating all of the different ground truth layers that we want. The ground truth layers that we ship in our public release are a subset of all the layers we generate. Have a look at our public source code for more details. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to generate all of those layers on the GPU. But I&#x27;d love to be wrong about this!')
