I wanted to scale up only the laptop&#x27;s screen so that I can read the text on it, but then my external monitor got scaled too large.<p>After using it for months like that I solved this by simply setting the resolution on the laptop to 1920x1080, and scaling to 1. I felt really stupid after that I did not do this sooner.')
