Maybe I&#x27;m missing something.<p>The worst I&#x27;ve seen is maybe a paternalistic attitude of &quot;some inexperienced day traders are now at risk of being taken for greater fools,&quot; which I find hard to disagree with, to be honest. Or else they&#x27;re slightly sniffily pointing out that short selling is not inherently immoral, and that many Wall Street firms are actually delighted with the windfall in fees from all this extra market activity.')
