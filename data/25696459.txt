Item(by='kypro', descendants=None, kids=[25696801, 25708671, 25696630], score=None, time=1610163545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695853, text='Remember when people said &quot;it&#x27;s only extremists like Alex Jones&quot; and &quot;white nationalists&quot;, yeah well now Twitter has banned the president of the United States.<p>I&#x27;m not a supporter of Trump, but I&#x27;m yet to hear him explicitly incite violence. I know he encouraged the protest at the Capitol but I&#x27;ve yet to see evidence that he was hoping for it to turn violent? And if he did want that why did he speak out against it? He&#x27;s also repeatedly said there will be a peaceful transfer of power.<p>Am I missing something here? I&#x27;ve been told I can be quite a naive person so perhaps I&#x27;m taking him at face value too much. Either way, I&#x27;d appreciate if someone could help me put my thinking right on this.<p>Also, does this mean we can expect Biden to be removed from Twitter if tweets anything in support of BLM? I&#x27;m not comparing events here but both protest groups have had pockets of violence. I suspect he wouldn&#x27;t be and that points to a bigger problem here. If you think the wrong things like the election was conducted unfairly or you disagree with lockdowns, too bad, big tech will silence you online. If you believe conspiracy theories about Russian election interference or write a book called &quot;in defence of looting&quot; you&#x27;re fine, you might even find you&#x27;ll get praise from people in the media.')
