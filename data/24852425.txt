The Church argues that they inherit their teaching authority as theirs is the seat of St Peter&#x27;s which is something the Eastern Orthodox Church contests.  Anyways, the Church teaches that God who is the creator of everything, has slowly revealed himself to man.  It is man who misinterprets what God has revealed.  Even the Catechism which is the summary document that contains Church doctrine may be re-written in the distant future.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vatican.va&#x2F;archive&#x2F;ccc_css&#x2F;archive&#x2F;catechism&#x2F;p1s1c2a3.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vatican.va&#x2F;archive&#x2F;ccc_css&#x2F;archive&#x2F;catechism&#x2F;p1s...</a>\n<i>110 In order to discover the sacred authors&#x27; intention, the reader must take into account the conditions of their time and culture, the literary genres in use at that time, and the modes of feeling, speaking and narrating then current. &quot;For the fact is that truth is differently presented and expressed in the various types of historical writing, in prophetical and poetical texts, and in other forms of literary expression.&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catholic-resources.org&#x2F;ChurchDocs&#x2F;PBC_Interp-FullText.htm#Sec1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catholic-resources.org&#x2F;ChurchDocs&#x2F;PBC_Interp-FullTex...</a>\n<i>The fundamentalist approach is dangerous, for it is attractive to people who look to the Bible for ready answers to the problems of life. It can deceive these people, offering them interpretations that are pious but illusory, instead of telling them that the Bible does not necessarily contain an immediate answer to each and every problem. Without saying as much in so many words, fundamentalism actually invites people to a kind of intellectual suicide. It injects into life a false certitude, for it unwittingly confuses the divine substance of the biblical message with what are in fact its human limitations.</i>')
