The privatization is the problem, not the content. What is happening is that the form of free public speech has become, over the past 15 years, something that we now have to pay rent to use. FB, Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Parler are private forms of communication that we now all have to pay rent to in order to communicate. There needs to be a free public commons of communication. If that existed this problem would not exist. It is, as most here have asserted, a dissonance and problem with allowing unelected billionaires to decide on free speech. This is because it attacks the form of free public speech only because of the content and our economic order. The solution is to create an international public commons that protects communication, health, etc.')
