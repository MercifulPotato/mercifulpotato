We keep talking Nazi&#x27;s but there are people from all walks of life and races that would like to eliminate races unlike them.  If they never put those thought into action they are harmless and those that advocate free speech are believers in intellect and rationalism as the winner of the day over ignorant thinking such as this, as it cannot be eliminated, and to completely eliminated it would necessitate genocide, the logic has a circularity to it.
