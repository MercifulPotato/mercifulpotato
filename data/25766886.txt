This is recognized in the first amendment to the US constitution, where it specifies that as a human right the government cannot regulate it. As the &quot;public square&quot; moves from physical locations to virtual ones, the responsibility to defend those natural rights moves from one host(US Government) to another(large online media companies). While the US government is not officially delegating the defense of these rights, defense of these rights must be maintained and it is the responsibility of the host platform to do so.')
