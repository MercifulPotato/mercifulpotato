It reminds me of Murakami&#x27;s <i>Wind-Up Bird Chronicles</i> we experience the same things and lead similar lives yet our senses can be so different to a point where something fatally painful can be so pleasurable to others.<p>[1] My skin is hypersensitive to pain, to the point sometimes it&#x27;s very painful to put on clothes. Usually it&#x27;s manageable with wearing large clothes, but it&#x27;s worse if I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep or some allergies (or salty food etc) are causing inflammation.')
