The other problem is that if you have a Mediatek, Broadcom, Ralink, Hisilicon vulnerability (all have their own kernel forks and driver forks) then every device downstream using that kernel or driver is vulnerable, and not all devices will get fixed. Even if the vendor or upstream fixes it, who upgrades their router firmware?')
