Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609609426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25611788, text='If you had last practiced software development between 100 and 50 years ago, and spent the last 50 years doing business leadership, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d necessarily have as much value in a software development meeting as someone who just finished 20 years of software development. Even more frighteningly, you would likely be very convinced of your knowledge in software development, and would have the gravitas to silence any opposition to your ideas.<p>Note: just to be clear, since text sometimes misses tone, I&#x27;m using a rhetorical &#x27;you&#x27;, not trying in any way to accuse you personally of the attitude described above!')
