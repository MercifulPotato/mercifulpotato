Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606202335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185283, text='&gt;&gt;&gt; Running from 0 to -6 is 7 iterations.<p>&gt;&gt; I view an iteration as including the iteration expression (i-- in this case) at the end.<p>&gt;Then you should agree that running from 0 to -6 (inclusive) is 7 iterations.<p>I agree with that statement, as long as you remove the word &quot;then&quot;. When you specifically say inclusive, you&#x27;re saying the values that the body takes. tomsmeding didn&#x27;t say the word inclusive, so it was less clear.<p>I don&#x27;t really agree with the word &quot;then&quot; because I don&#x27;t see how your statement follows from my previous statement.<p>The article actually seemed to indicate the opposite, to be not about the values of the body, but the values of i after the iteration is done. You&#x27;re talking about &quot;during&quot;, while the article is talking about &quot;after&quot;. I&#x27;ve modified your example to more closely align with the article&#x27;s wording which says &quot;after |INT_MIN| + 1 iterations&quot;.<p><pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n    int main()\n    {\n        int i;\n        for (i = 0; i &gt;= -6; i--, printf(&quot;iterated, now i = %d\\n&quot;, i)) {\n          printf(&quot;in the body, i = %d\\n&quot;, i);\n        }\n        printf(&quot;after 7 iterations, i = %d\\n&quot;, i);\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    in the body, i = 0\n    iterated, now i = -1\n    in the body, i = -1\n    iterated, now i = -2\n    in the body, i = -2\n    iterated, now i = -3\n    in the body, i = -3\n    iterated, now i = -4\n    in the body, i = -4\n    iterated, now i = -5\n    in the body, i = -5\n    iterated, now i = -6\n    in the body, i = -6\n    iterated, now i = -7\n    after 7 iterations, i = -7\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s consider it step by step:<p>After 0 iterations, the value of i is 0. (I consider the initialization statement to run before the first iteration.)<p>After 1 iteration, the value of i is -1.<p>After 2 iterations, the value of i is -2.<p>...')
