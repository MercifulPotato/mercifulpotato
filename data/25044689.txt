I used to be a CLI only user, but now you can pry magit from my cold, dead hands. It&#x27;s very close to the command line in what it does, it&#x27;s very easy to see what <i>exactly</i> it does, and where it abstracts from git commands, it does so while following Git&#x27;s mental model very well.<p>It has great discoverability while at the same time being an amazingly streamlined power user tool.<p>In other words, there can be great git front ends. It&#x27;s just that most of them suck, usually because of a desire to dumb down the git UI. If you don&#x27;t do that, and accept Git&#x27;s complexity it can work out great.')
