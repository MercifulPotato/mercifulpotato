(disclaimer, I&#x27;ve never used traefik. Feels like too much magic for me).<p>If you&#x27;re using the auto-mapping stuff, then honestly it sounds like getting traefik to work for the SSH port is probably your best bet. Do you need it to dynamically set up new ports, or is it the type of thing you have a static set of tunnels you always want available?')
