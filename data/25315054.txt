I&#x27;m not going to pretend that it&#x27;s doing the homeless any favors. However, the alternative of letting them poison themselves with drugs, and I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s any more humane.<p>I think the real reason America fails the homeless is not a lack of empathy, but a &quot;it&#x27;s your fault because you touched it last&quot; mentality. Housing first requires people who work with social workers. These people already draw a lot of ire when they fail or deemed as too harsh.')
