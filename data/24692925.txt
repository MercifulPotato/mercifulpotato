Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601938205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24692751, text='&gt; Conversely to the paperâ€™s implication, too many lawyers can also be seen as evidence of a society based on the rule of the law, with strong legal institutions, processes, separation of powers and other patterns of integrity, and lack of rule by decree in any form<p>Well, it means strong legal institutions.  But...<p>Take criminal law, for example.  Lots of lawyers mean that each criminal gets their day in court.  That&#x27;s good.  But a law-abiding society would be better.<p>Or take contract law.  Lots of lawyers mean that, if the other party violates the contract, you can sue them.  But wouldn&#x27;t it be better to have a society where more people just did what the contract said, instead of trying to find ways to weasel out of it?<p>Even with respect to the government, yes, when they overstep their bounds, we can take them to court, and we can even win and make them stop doing whatever they&#x27;re not supposed to.  But really, it would be better if they just stayed within the constitutional parameters of what they&#x27;re allowed to do.<p>In all these cases, it&#x27;s good (really!) that we can have our day in court, in a system that is at least relatively fair.  The lawyers are the sign of a healthy legal system.  But they&#x27;re also the sign of an <i>un</i>healthy society, that is restrained by court cases rather than by doing the right thing.')
