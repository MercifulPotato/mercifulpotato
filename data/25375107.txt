I don&#x27;t there&#x27;s any automated invalidation of the previous ballot if you request multiple ballots (e.g., if some1 took your first one).<p>Maybe there are more rigerous systems in place than I realize, but I haven&#x27;t read about it, if so.<p>Re nursing homes, the point there is you can be pretty sure if you take those ballots, you won&#x27;t risk a double-vote.')
