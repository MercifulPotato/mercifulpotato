Without telling me. In the middle of a pandemic. When I discovered this last week, I attempted to buy health insurance directly from insurers and was informed that I could not get coverage until January 1st of 2021 as I was &quot;outside the eligibility window&quot;. They literally won&#x27;t sell active coverage to me at any price. Apparently you only have two months after losing your insurance to be able to buy new insurance before having to wait until specific times in the year. I can buy home insurance, liability insurance, car insurance, and any other type of insurance whenever I want but god forbid I try to buy health insurance 61 days after an arbitrary point in the year. I effectively cannot go outside until January 1st as if I get covid and have to go to the hospital I&#x27;m screwed.')
