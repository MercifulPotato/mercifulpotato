The idea is that the network will be self-sustaining by this point. Transaction fees are expected to compensate node operators since mining will no longer yield coins.<p>It is possible miners may flee the Bitcoin network for more lucrative currencies. This would harm the network and make the dreaded 51% attack more possible. It is also possible the Bitcoin protocol will be changed to allow for more than 21 million coins.<p>This IS possible. Code can be changed. One wonders what might happen to BTC value was this to happen suddenly and without warning. Insiders would make a killing shorting the coin if they knew ahead of time. However, this type of speculation is for another essay.&quot;')
