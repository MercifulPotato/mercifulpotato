Only found about it 2 years ago. Mostly, I was acting on insufficient information, and a bit of intuition. I identified the kind of error I made, noted what I had to do to avoid a repeat â€”which never happened since. I fixed then admitted the mistake, a couple days after finding it. It&#x27;s standard procedure. I could have swept it under the rug, though I never considered it.<p>There wasn&#x27;t much drama then. Just some mockery I wasn&#x27;t even aware of (I didn&#x27;t follow Twitter).  I learned of it one year later, when some institution &quot;awarded&quot; the worst mistakes (they wrote pretty funny piece).<p>&gt; <i>Yes, there may be some drama, in the short term.</i><p>It was the only mistake of any consequence I&#x27;ve made in over 4 years working in this domain. Yet some people still use that one error to publicly question my competence and my ethics. As if they didn&#x27;t realise the perverse incentives that results from punishing honest disclosure.')
