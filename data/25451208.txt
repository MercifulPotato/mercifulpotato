So many university seminars and professional conferences are online now, I practically drown in them. Plus there is so much data online too, and tsunamis of data as the new super telescopes come online. My PhD training in another branch of physics allows me to understand the math and data analysis. What is lacking is a PhD level understanding of the research frontier, i.e. what constitutes a unit of research that is significant and achievable in a publication cycle. That you obtain by apprenticing yourself as a grad student&#x2F;postdoc in a quality research group.')
