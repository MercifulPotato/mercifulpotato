But the fact that banks knew that there was a limit on how much gold they could create was in itself a good way to prevent the money supply from growing out of control. There will always be some banks who don&#x27;t play by the rules.<p>&gt;&gt; In a ponzi scheme you pay interest on old money with new money, that is very different from the goal of a monetary system.<p>That is literally what they do. Why do you think a dollar is worth a bit less every year?<p>When regular banks make loans to people, the loan money is new money that they just typed into your account out of nowhere (only limited by reserve ratios which coincidentally have been lowered to 0%), then for example, when you buy a house from someone else using that new loan money and you allow them to pay off their debt, you&#x27;re just paying the person who was there first.<p>New generations take out new loans to pay for the loans of old generations collectively.')
