We know what it’s good for, and we can easily imagine what it could be good for, if only Apple would set it free.</i><p>I&#x27;m so utterly baffled by this sentiment. What is not already cohesive and compelling about the iPad? What does Apple need to &quot;set free&quot;? This sounds like it&#x27;s supposed to be huge and inspiring, but then the author&#x27;s wishlist is mundane stuff like &quot;another port&quot;, &quot;landscape first&quot;, &quot;position widgets anywhere&quot;. <i>Huh?</i><p>The iPad is <i>already</i> an amazing, cohesive, compelling machine. I use it daily for things like researching and annotating PDF&#x27;s, playing games, recording professional-quality video, watching movies, doing shopping, videoconferencing, taking notes, etc.<p>&gt; <i>It’s simple: people love their iPads. They love them so much they wish they could do even more with them... it’s time for the iPad to reassert itself—to remind us once again who it’s for, and what makes it special.</i><p>Huh? The iPad doesn&#x27;t need to &quot;reaassert itself&quot;, it&#x27;s doing <i>fine</i>. I guess the author mainly wants to run Final Cut on their iPad...? Which makes no sense to me because the screen honestly isn&#x27;t <i>large</i> enough for an effective video editing interface.<p>Weird article.')
