Nonetheless I would choose it over getting knocked out.<p>This may sound like a strange sentiment, but years ago I broke a bone on a weekend and they put my arm in a sling at the emergency room.  I got to see a doctor on monday and he said - you have to move your arm.  &quot;Move it every day, otherwise you will lose your range of motion.  Let pain be your guide&quot;.<p>Completely different advice than I expected (I expected to keep it immobilized as much as possible until fully healed)<p>So I wonder if I was knocked out - would they damage something while they&#x27;re looking around without my hints?')
