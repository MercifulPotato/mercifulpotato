But it is worth tagging surface values to catch `surface=sett`&#x2F;`surface=unhewn_cobblestone`&#x2F;`surface=dirt`<p>And yes, in some areas all roads are asphalt ones. But it is basically impossible to guess which places and where is border of &quot;everything is asphalt here&quot; area.<p>So this quest is asked everywhere - it is not easy to distinguish &quot;obviously asphalt&quot; from &quot;unsurveyed&quot;. And tagging at least some surface values in given area makes easier to be certain about what is obvious in a given location.')
