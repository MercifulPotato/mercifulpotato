I&#x27;m suggesting that we do the opposite, that we restrict and regulate the richest monopolies (Google) to preserve freedoms for the poor.<p>We&#x27;re very much at risk of being a world in which people either have to be rich or not participate in society to avoid privacy invasion by companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. If you&#x27;re poor, you can have a free email address, but that comes at a cost of allowing Google to read your email (and pass it to their ad customers) so they can serve you ads. The answer to this hegemony is not &quot;Well, Google provides free email addresses, better let them keep doing what they&#x27;re doing so we don&#x27;t discriminate against the poor&quot;, it&#x27;s to regulate them so they&#x27;re not allowed to read your emails, or otherwise provide some alternative service that can provide email addresses for cost plus a small profit margin.<p>And yes, I know that in this particular example there are other free or inexpensive email providers, but they&#x27;re not world-dominating products; the market is distorted because the few willing to pay are signalling something pretty strong by rejecting the free, high-quality option offered by Google.')
