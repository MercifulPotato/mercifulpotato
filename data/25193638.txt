Nothing entitled about it.<p>On the other hand, I find your baseless, unfounded accusation rather insulting.<p><i>&quot;If you really are that worried why not create a virtual machine for browsing untrusted things.&quot;</i><p>Because my old, slow laptop is too weak to run a VM.<p>Not everyone is so fortunate to have a powerful enough computer to run a VM whenever they need to browse an untrusted website.<p>That&#x27;s not to mention that there are ways to break out of a VM, so it&#x27;s not the best solution as far as security goes anyway.<p>In any case, if you think running a VM is a valid response, I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d be so aghast at asking for a much simpler, much less resource-intensive way of viewing the content:  by using a simple downloadable video.<p>Of course the receiver of the request is under no obligation to comply.  In fact, they usually don&#x27;t because people like me who care enough about their security to want to avoid javascript are in the tiny minority, and can be safely ignored.  I&#x27;m well aware of this, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to ask, does it?')
