The best option here seems to be to use the KubernetesOperator to version your steps, and if you&#x27;re using k8s to execute, why not use it for the rest?<p>* the Airflow UI is pretty confusing to use, maybe this gets easier once you know your way around it.<p>* my team has k8s expertise and we don&#x27;t know Airflow well yet; seems like less to learn running Argo Workflows, assuming you&#x27;re already fluent in k8s.<p>* if you&#x27;re already running k8s, it seems like you have to add fewer components to get Argo running; more duplication with Airflow-on-k8s.<p>On the other hand, being able to unit test &#x2F; locally run your DAGs on your dev machine is a big plus for Airflow, where Argo Workflows seem to have a less strong testing story. And writing YAML is not preferable to writing Python DAG files.')
