Item(by='Alupis', descendants=None, kids=[25995971, 25995742], score=None, time=1612214969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994111, text='We could be splitting hairs here - but Oracle has indeed stepped back from being the &quot;official&quot; offering.<p>Each new LTS JDK release gets a &quot;caretaker&quot; which provides the &quot;official&quot; OpenJDK build for that release. Azul gets a turn, Oracle gets a turn, etc. This is a stark contrast to pre-JDK9 where Oracle was the only &quot;official&quot; build.<p>Starting with JDK9, the licensing for an Oracle-provided JDK got a lot more murky, which seems to have been on purpose (to push Oracle into a support position instead of leader position). It cleared the way for Oracle to be &quot;just another vendor offering paid support&quot; along with IBM, Red Hat, AdoptOpenJDK, Azul, Amazon, etc.<p>This transition was started around OpenJDK7, where Oracle made a lot of effort to make OpenJDK the &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;reference&quot; implementation for all other JDK&#x27;s and the language specification.<p>While many OpenJDK contributors are on the payroll of Oracle, it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to say they are steering the entire ship at this point, nor does anyone require a license agreement to offer OpenJDK binaries - with the exception of actually calling it &quot;OpenJDK&quot; (see agreement above for &quot;sharing&quot; LTS releases) - hence &quot;AdoptOpenJDK&quot; and &quot;Zulu JDK&quot;, etc... all OpenJDK builds that don&#x27;t call themselves OpenJDK.<p>It was one of the more surprising things Oracle has done in years... and many applauded the changes.')
