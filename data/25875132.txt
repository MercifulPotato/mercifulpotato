Burnout is psychologically different from fatigue in important ways, just like depression is different from feeling sad and PTSD is different from feeling worried.<p><i>&gt; Some people are healthier, happier and thrive through the feeling of productivity - whether it be work, a hobby, or a side project. I&#x27;d say depression is more common with people who don&#x27;t have anything to do.</i><p>Yup. People thrive when they feel they are using their strengths towards meaningful ends.')
