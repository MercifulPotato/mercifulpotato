For equivalent burns, the later along the trajectory the burn, the smaller its net effect on final position.  So it&#x27;s a series of increasingly better approximations.<p>Try it in ksp.  It&#x27;s quite illuminating to plan your burns and see their effect graphically and build an intuition for celestial mechanics and astrogation.')
