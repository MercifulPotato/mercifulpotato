I hate reachability with a passion, for the simple fact that when I got my first iPhone I had never heard of the feature, and it&#x27;s literally taken me 1 year to understand why sometimes my screen would look weird. No amount of Googling or searching the settings helped, until someone mentioned the magic keyword &quot;Reachability&quot;. Which then was easy to disable.<p>So it might be a cool feature, but if you don&#x27;t know about it you&#x27;ll go mad trying to understand what is wrong with your phone. And it&#x27;s not like Apple is good at teaching users about power user gestures. I still feel I&#x27;m not using my iPhone at its full capacity yet.')
