Even if that was remotely true, everything bears consequence. It might have &quot;worked&quot;, but the downsides of this toxic work ethic are bound to present themselves, in the present or future.<p>Never mind working such hours does not guarantee success. Hell, it only about guarantees poor relations and health with any chance of success a very distant second.<p>So at best you&#x27;re successful with shit relationships or fail with the same prospects? Dunno &#x27;bout you, but I don&#x27;t play no game I can&#x27;t win!')
