When creators say &quot;content&quot;, they in a way degrade the quality of their own work (they should sell it as the equivalent of good food or fine dining, not as &quot;grub&quot;); when those that watch just call it &quot;content&quot; they probably don&#x27;t have a very deep connection to it: So much better when the viewers come away from something and think of it as a story, and experience, a show, rather than &quot;content&quot;.')
