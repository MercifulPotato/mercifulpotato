I was really ready to blow it off when I realized -- the author is putting her money where her mouth is. She&#x27;s built a very useful platform that helps connect real people with real job opportunities.<p>Okay. In that case, I can forgive the &quot;cardinal sin&quot; of bad writing. Here&#x27;s the problem with hiring: organizations. Hiring practices reflect organizational ladders and career progressions. Where you see flaws in the latter, of course it will backpropagate into the former. The problem with a &quot;platonic ideal&quot; for how engineering hiring should work is that it requires a &quot;platonic ideal&quot; for how a company should work. And what is that?<p>How do you avoid politics as you scale up a company? Sure, engineering skills are fungibly valuable, that much is evidenced by the market. But engineering career output, and promotional success -- that part is very circumstantial and specific to the company. And I would argue hiring is part of that process -- hiring is getting promoted from candidate to employee. Every company does it differently. And the dynamics are not platonic but tribal. There&#x27;s no way around that but to find the tribe you want to be a part of and accept it&#x27;s a little irrational.<p>I remember wishing and hoping when I was younger for a platonic ideal for engineering hiring and engineering organizations that never came. I grew to understand that the warfield of political economy that the business existed inside of (including and especially non-technical and executive personnel) had so much of a major impact on what engineering even means that to conceive of its retraction or engineering in isolation was a little naive and unrealistic.  Is it cynical for me to say that? Is it bad for me to say that?')
