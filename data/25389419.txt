It seems there is an additional 20% payment from Medicare when covid-19 is involved (though it seems this must also be much smaller than the &quot;extra $13,000&quot; or &quot;extra $39,000&quot; claims I&#x27;ve seen. I think it may be an extra 20% of those base numbers, not sure).  [1]<p>The step many irresponsible people take to suggesting that doctors, hospitals, or insurers are fraudulently marking deaths as covid-19 deaths is whacked, though, in my opinion.  The penalties for Medicare fraud are large, including criminal punishment (individuals can go to prison), and I highly doubt anyone is doing it.  (Maybe, like voter fraud, there are isolated instances by bad actors, but to believe there is widespread misreporting of covid-19 deaths that substantially affects the overall numbers is crazy.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;hospital-payments-and-the-covid-19-death-count&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;hospital-payments-and-the-...</a>')
