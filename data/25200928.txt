I&#x27;d like to see that. For instance the two repeaters near the end of the 4th trace from bottom in the example image []: obviously they have just been placed at element boundaries to ensure signal propagation, but each one induces a 1-tick delay in that propagation. And you don&#x27;t need 2 of them so close together, as it seems there&#x27;s another repeater less than 16 blocks away from the first one. IMO the real art of making gates in MC is twisting them back on themselves so you get as few ticks of delay as possible.<p>[] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;itsFrank&#x2F;MinecraftHDL&#x2F;master&#x2F;screenshots&#x2F;mux4_short.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;itsFrank&#x2F;MinecraftHDL&#x2F;mast...</a>')
