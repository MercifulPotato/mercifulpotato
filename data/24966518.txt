But you find the same pattern for violin or guitar -- &quot;right-handed&quot; playing has the right hand holding the bow or strumming, while the left hand does the fingerings.  The fingering is absolutely more difficult; but I think (from my own experience) the main thing is which hand is <i>in control</i>:   The bow and the strumming causes the sound to come out, so that&#x27;s what the right hand wants to do.  That&#x27;s how I feel about using a chisel too.')
