Item(by='jmhobbs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605306705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25086993, text='I ran cornish cross meat birds twice, 20 birds each time, and by butchering at ~8 weeks the roos didn&#x27;t get around real well anymore, given the weight to leg ratio.<p>Those were pasture raised, with restricted supplemental feed, and just the ordinary breeds you can get at Tractor Supply.  I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if you let a &quot;real&quot; production hybrid go past butchering age and feed them grains the whole time, you&#x27;d probably get some birds unable to move under their own weight.<p>After two rounds, I gave up on them and now run less aggressive weight gainers that forage better, like freedom rangers.<p>Obviously just anecdotal, but don&#x27;t dismiss it outright.')
