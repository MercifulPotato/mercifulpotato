Even the friends who are very privacy and security leaning in nature who might embrace what Matrix offers in this realm. I generally steer them towards the Element clients (web&#x2F;phone) which are easy to use.<p>A few have created accounts, logged on, a chat or two then walked away, never really came back. The federated non-tech channels I&#x27;m in are pretty dead as well (hobbies and the like). Couple hundred people... maybe a post or two a month. Point being, it&#x27;s not getting adopted outside of software&#x2F;tech circles (almost every happening room&#x2F;channel is based around some sort of software or tech solution) from what I can tell, so I end up having no use for it other than communicating with random folks ala IRC general chat.')
