It is the powerful men brought down by the &quot;sluts and whores&quot;.  Hence the shaming.<p>I have a argument for that:  In my country until recently it was a crime to offer sex for money but not pay money for sex.  If the underlying cause was &quot;relative cost&quot; not misogyny then that difference would not exist')
