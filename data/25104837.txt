Good, but this ignores OP&#x27;s question. Most voting machines, even if they have paper trails, have some software in them. Just saying &quot;paper ballots&quot; doesn&#x27;t address the issue.<p>To answer OP&#x27;s question, I personally have no idea but think it should be. Much of our scientific work is open sourced (e.g. codes from national labs, NASA, etc). But I think a lot of people don&#x27;t understand what open source is or means. They think you can&#x27;t have open sourced software and still privately own it. We still honestly haven&#x27;t figured out how to deal with this adequately in the law (there&#x27;s a post on the front page about FB taking their OS project, and these posts happen at least once a month). People don&#x27;t demand it because frankly people aren&#x27;t very tech literate.')
