If this is allowed, then big tech companies become the defacto gateway for information flow. What our government is not allowed to do -- undermine free speech -- is now accomplished by another entity and the free market place of ideas becomes a monoculture. No different than censorship that China does, except is is accomplished by large monopolistic companies.<p>Making a blanket statement that everyone on a platform is propagating hate is akin to saying everyone of a certain ethnic background is a thief. These gross generalizations are the very heart of stereotyping and racism.')
