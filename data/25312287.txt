A few places with a history of discrimination may have trouble firing the few people of color they might hire. That&#x27;s about it. In the real world, incompetent people get fired and often competent people as well. A few people may make a career of playing the race card but that&#x27;s a limited number of people.<p>Both racism and opportunists &quot;playing the race card&quot; can be real at the same time.')
