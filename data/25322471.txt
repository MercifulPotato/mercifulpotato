Even if the insurance pays the lawyers fees, I still have to setup an apointment, explain the situation again, give the documents, etc.<p>It&#x27;s always &quot;small&quot; amounts like 50-500$, i.e. amounts that it sucks throwing out the window but that aren&#x27;t big enough to justify sinking even more time in chasing.<p>I also don&#x27;t believe this can be the only way. Most people don&#x27;t have legal insurance and wouldn&#x27;t pay a lawyer the equivalent of 1000$ for a dispute like that.<p>I&#x27;m talking every day stuff: a cellphone bill with an error on it (in the company&#x27;s favour, always), or an Ikea piece of furniture that was delivered broken (but the package looked fine), or a voucher you were promised if you signed up for a particular health insurance plan and when it&#x27;s time to get the voucher you&#x27;re not eligible anymore... That kind of stuff.')
