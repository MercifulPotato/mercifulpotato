Item(by='tiew9Vii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605830691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148485, text='I think it has lots of (reasonable amount)<p>- Low end web stuff, i.e typical design agency work. HTML, CSS, Javascript, React. React is big, every frontend job wants React.<p>- Python. Mostly with big data doing stuff I don&#x27;t want to do as shady, or the other big Python jobs are is deveops.<p>- Devops stuff, mostly Kubernetes. Almost every Kubernetes job I&#x27;ve done they hadn&#x27;t needed Kubernetes and it&#x27;s lead to massively over complicated infrastructure because everyone is doing Kubernetes not because Kubernetes was appropriate.<p>- Some Java but mainly knocking out Spring Boot apps for the big four (banks) or other tier one organizations. The type of large organizations that are so large they are dysfunctional.<p>I worked at Atlassian before the IPO and briefly after. Before the IPO it was pretty good, after IPO and they got a new CTO, my experience then changed as was on a great team that deliberately got broke up as even though we where labelled high performance the CTO banned the tech (language) we where using to standardize on Spring Boot as the CTO used Spring Boot previously at Gumtree. The glass doors posts at the time where telling. Pay was mediocre and they utilized a lot of 438 visas and I feel took advantage of overseas employees not being familiar with AU pay. Pay wasn&#x27;t bad but was definatley on the lower end of Sydney rates and the CTO stood on stage saying they are quite pleased they will never pay as much as Google or other companies and still have people wanting to work for them as they are Atlassian.<p>Like I say, when you compare the job ads to somewhere like London, the type and variety of work is significantly different.<p>Right now I&#x27;d take a pay cut not to do big data, javascript or devops minus kubernetes unless they have a fleet of thousands of hosts working on a meaningful product.')
