The rejection makes them all angry, cult leader and followers.<p>Trump and Trump supporters have been more caustic by far to Republicans who don&#x27;t toe the line. They seek retribution and engage in threatening behavior, including death threats.<p>This morning Trump expressed his displeasure at the Vice President&#x27;s unwillingness to engage in illegal activity, and then Trump sent a mob to the capitol where Pence was doing his job.<p>Four people are dead on a day of performative action, merely to count votes, with an outcome that was guaranteed on December 8.<p>Following this violence and death, most Republicans in the House supported and voted for this cynical, delusional lie of their cult leader. And had very little to say about the mob that was send toward them, by him. They had more lies to tell.<p>Trump spent five years of the previous presidency trying to delegitimize that president too, just like he&#x27;s trying to delegitimize the next one.<p>Don&#x27;t lecture people on how they should become milquetoast.')
