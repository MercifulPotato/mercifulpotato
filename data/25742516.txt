I don&#x27;t think it is equivalent to leaking plaintext. It can&#x27;t be used to guess passwords on other websites.<p>You&#x27;re reinventing password hashing and salting. Further, there&#x27;s no guarantee that the has cannot be used to guess passwords on other sites. For what benefit, exactly? Your hash is now the password, and basically as dangerous as it was in a more conventional arrangement.<p>Pass-the-hash is a real kind of vulnerability that has been used to exploit real systems. We might be better off sticking with design approaches that don&#x27;t have this problem instead of trying to fix out way out of the problem.<p>&gt; If your SSL layer is compromised, you can&#x27;t trust the client-side encryption. The attacker can send arbitrary javascript.<p>Are you sure this is what it&#x27;s guarding against? A sophisticated application architecture might involve a load balancer decrypting and doing the initial routing, several sets of data handoffs, and then the application that needs it handling the password. Any one of them could mishandle or leak the password, but only the one at the end actually needs it in the clear.')
