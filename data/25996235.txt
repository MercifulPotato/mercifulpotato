In the middle of your article it says:<p>&gt; The students also showed an improvement in their alertness and their ability to focus, the researchers found.<p>The idea that only ADHD people see improved focus from stimulants is purely false, as indicated by the article you provided. It&#x27;s a dangerous misconception, as many people use this misunderstanding to self-diagnose as ADHD when they take their friends&#x27; stimulant medication and experience improved focus. We need to be clear that non-ADHD patients still feel increased focus from stimulants as well.<p>You are correct that over-medicating with stimulant medications can harm certain types of cognitive function, in both ADHD and non-ADHD people. Dopamine has a well-known inverted U shaped response curve for certain cognitive processes. Going too far past the optimal point can worsen, not increase the focus changes.<p>The study also used a strangely high dose of Adderall. 30mg of instant release Adderall (equivalent to 60mg of Adderall XR) is actually beyond the recommend prescribing guidelines for ADHD. That&#x27;s the type of dose that would typically only be prescribed to patients with severe narcolepsy or severe, intractable ADHD. I&#x27;m not sure why they thought it was a good idea to give it to medication-naive study subjects.')
