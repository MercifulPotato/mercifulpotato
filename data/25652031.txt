I&#x27;m going to respect the opinions of serious scientists, doctors, journalists, lawyers, etc on topics of their expertise.<p>No, this is just wrong. If a homeless person tells you that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, this is just as true as if a Stanford physics professor says it, despite the latter having much more credibility than the former. The truth of a statement is independent of the speaker.<p>In fact, your causality is exactly backwards. Credibility depends (in part) on someone stating the truth repeatedly.')
