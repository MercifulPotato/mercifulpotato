If that&#x27;s what you refer to, then I just mean to generalize that cycle to a new average. E.g. if we cycled between 19°C and 21°C every 11 years due to the solar cycle, then that would be shifted to 21-23°C instead. (I&#x27;m making these numbers up, they&#x27;re just examples of what kind of effect I mean.)<p>Beyond those thousands of years, even if we&#x27;re considering the sustainability of our climate even if we had never discovered the use of fire in the first place, yeah there is no &quot;eventually settle&quot; of course. It will change depending on things like the sun burning out, asteroids hitting, other geological shifts, changes in who inhabits the world, etc. That seems beyond the scope of the discussion, we can&#x27;t simply change that by changing our habits.')
