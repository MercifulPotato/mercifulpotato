They are talking about engineering management and senior responsibilities:<p>&gt; You&#x27;d like to have time to code, but nobody else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone&#x27;s going roughly in the same direction... If this describes you, congratulations: you&#x27;re the glue.<p>Edit: Looks like the title was changed to &quot;Being Glue&quot; which is probably a better title.')
