It leads to the conclusion that X (Facebook) should wage an antitrust lawsuit against Y (Apple) in order to achieve an outcome that would help tame the growth of Z&#x27;s (Amazon) market position.<p>If the United States feels that Amazon is an anticompetitive company, then that position should be litigated in and of itself.<p>It&#x27;s understandable that Facebook feels righteous in filing a proxy lawsuit for its advertisers.
