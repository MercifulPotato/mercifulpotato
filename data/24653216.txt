Almost all CS Ed research presently focuses on the problem-solving skill of CS rather than the technical literacy. There is almost no interest from educators to train this literacy despite work from myself [1] and others [2] saying that explicitly training these skills improves student performance.<p>The issue, in my opinion, is that notation and technical literacy are skills that students are &quot;expected&quot; to pick up through proxy. They do problem-solving problems, so they are getting experience coding. But the issue with this is that since novices are struggling with notation&#x2F;syntax, they are juggling problem-solving issues (logic errors) and technical issues (syntax errors).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3373165.3373177" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3373165.3373177</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.usu.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=8995&amp;context=etd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.usu.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=8...</a>')
