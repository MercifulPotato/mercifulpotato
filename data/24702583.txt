Item(by='jrockway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602020231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701084, text='I have made a few custom keyboards with the stm32f103 (&quot;bluepill&quot;).  You can get a 5 pack for $10.  You get more IO pins and you don&#x27;t need to suffer through anything Arduino-related.  The starter kits often include an ST-LINK clone that makes flashing much easier than dealing with bootloaders and USB serial connections.  (I use a j-link, but both are fine.)  It is, of course, supported by QMK.<p>If you want to go even cheaper for a 4x4 macro pad, you can just hand-wire the thing and not buy a circuit board.  I hand-wired a full keyboard and while it was not the quickest task in the world, it also wasn&#x27;t that bad.  Kind of relaxing.  You also don&#x27;t need to go overboard with mechanical supports for the keyswitches; I just 3D-printed a platform that the keyswitches slot into.<p>Basically, if you happen to have some magnet wire, a microcontroller, and some Cherry clones sitting around... you can make yourself a keyboard.  (Diodes are nice, but you probably don&#x27;t need n-key rollover on a macro pad.)')
