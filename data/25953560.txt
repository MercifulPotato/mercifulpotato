GitHub is more of a community than a platform, and building a community is way harder than building a platform.<p>So it&#x27;s more than just the founding.<p>Also, sure, you can setup your own website and post contents there, but nobody is going to read it before somebody discovers it. And discovery is really hard.<p>What those &quot;Big platforms&quot; really got right, is that they&#x27;ve found a way to efficiently deliver the contents created on the platform to their users, and allow the user to give timely feedback about the content. This feedback loop itself is more valuable than the tech behind it.<p>If decentralization movement want to be successful, it must also create this feedback loop. Otherwise people will just get bored and disconnect.')
