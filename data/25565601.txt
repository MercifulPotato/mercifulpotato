The chances of the only two civilisations in the entire galaxy happening to be neighbours, among 400bn stars, absolutely stretches the bounds of rationality.”<p>This is a fallacy. If there&#x27;s life all over the galaxy, then we&#x27;d be the most likely to detect radio signals first from our closest neighbors. Interstellar distances are, well, astronomical. Proxima Centauri is 1700 times farther from us than Voyager 1 (which was mentioned in the article). Because of the quadratic decay, a Voyager-type source in Proxima Centauri would send to us a signal more than 3 million times weaker. A star that is 10 times farther still will get a dimming of the signal of a factor of 100 on top of this. So, if there are aliens habitating the planets of all the stars around us, probabilistically we&#x27;d expect to first detect the signals originating with the closer among them.')
