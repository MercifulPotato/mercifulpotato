Between youtube ads, ad reads, sponsors, patreon plugs and merch ads, it is either going to wind up looking like cable tv or it is going to die and make way for some paid service.<p>I saw a video with a sponsor, a separate THREE MINUTE ad read for some stupid mobile game AND 2 youtube ads. The video was 10 minutes.<p>I understand video creators need to make money but at this point iâ€™d rather just have some patreon service where I can subscribe to channels individually for a dollar or two a month.<p>It seems like the fate of all streaming services is to end up like cable.')
