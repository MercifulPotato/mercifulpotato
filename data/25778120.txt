They clearly aren&#x27;t.<p>Some people have claimed that it would be legal to buy these if you applied for a license to manufacture a suppressor, but good luck arguing that in federal court, especially since these are manufactured in China. Both the import of these goods, and buying without the correct federal license are felonies....<p>And yet they are all over Facebook. And people are buying them.<p>Here is the crazy thing. I enjoy shooting as a hobby, and could understand if FB chose to show me adds for legitimate firearm accessory companies.<p>I am <i>not</i> a car guy.<p>Either FB add targeting is terrible, or they can connect the dots between these obviously illegal &quot;solvent traps&quot; and people who are interested in firearms.<p>This isn&#x27;t a post made by a random FB user, it&#x27;s an ad on their ad network on their platform. At what point does FB facebook become culpable?')
