This is referring to <i>sequential</i> read speeds, generally measured with 128kB or larger IO sizes. When SSD performance is stated in terms of IOPS, that&#x27;s usually referring to small block sizes (4kB) and random IO rather than sequential.<p>(Strictly speaking, the access pattern that matters most for games will probably be something like 128kB random reads, so the attained throughput when a game is streaming in chunks of partially-resident textures on the fly is likely to be somewhat lower than purely sequential reads.)')
