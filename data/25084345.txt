But this isn&#x27;t even close to how things work in the US. In the US, you tip so that the restaurant can advertise lower prices on their menu. That&#x27;s it.  They tell you a burger costs $12, when in reality it costs $15.  And if you decide to only pay $12 instead of $15 the restaurant just makes the waiter eat the cost.')
