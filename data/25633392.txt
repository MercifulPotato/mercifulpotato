It&#x27;s distribution right now.<p>We can see states with good resources are vaccinating as quickly as the doses come in (a few days of lag time, but otherwise doing good).<p>But many states are stuck in logistics hell. These vaccines need -80C or -20C storage to remain unspoiled. And the administrators are overworked nurses who haven&#x27;t had rest for months, due to the pandemic.<p>Once a dose leaves the -80C or -20C storage center, you only have a few days before the dose is ruined. So you need careful planning, maybe even allow a bit of waste for easier distribution.<p>The military &#x2F; national guard can help with distribution, but once again the nursing shortage is biting America in the ass. I&#x27;m not really sure how to solve that issue. (Well... I dunno how to solve it this year. Ultimately we just need more immigrants and&#x2F;or students)')
