A small performance overhead for <i>guaranteed</i> security properties shouldn&#x27;t be seen as a tradeoff.<p>&gt;send it to a separate execution environment, and then marshal it right back[...]<p>Current runtimes of all kinds always need new instances of something to sandbox things, which incurs a big overhead everytime. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. The KeyKOS kernel was of fixed size, I built my <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esolangs.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RarVM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esolangs.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;RarVM</a> to be so, too, it is stateless. No need for several instances of the interpreter itself, and minimal overhead in the process snapshots.<p>&gt;policy decision about whether to grant privileges [...] people would choose not to use it<p>The advantage of capability systems (that start with all rights given in every call by default) is that even if people do not initially use it, they can restrict rights later - &quot;hollow out the attack surface&quot;, when this makes economical sense - when a library becomes popular, laws or contracts require it etc.<p>While users may not interact with it directly or choose not to use it, such systems grant developers at least the ability to secure their software internally, something that is not even possible now.<p>&gt; [...] it&#x27;s just a safety measure [...] purely-computational libraries can still be dangerous<p>But this argument doesn&#x27;t attack the central point. Yes, this is true, but has nothing to do with the security properties offered by POLA architectures like capability security. It&#x27;s an orthogonal problem, which has to be mitigated by other mechanisms, possibly social.')
