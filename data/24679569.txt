Maybe 3-8 drinks in it is definitely closer to &quot;the true self&quot;.<p>But in large amounts it definitely creates an over-emotional person. In it&#x27;s own way it creates emotional reaction spirals that could cause suicide, or lashing out at people, irrational love or hatred of self, etc.<p>Like i said, biggest fallacy.')
