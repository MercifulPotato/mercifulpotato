Most of the people that I worked with at those companies didn&#x27;t seem interested in the prestige of the role at all. They were  passionate about growing as engineers and continuing to master their craft. When they left they often left to take on larger roles at much smaller companies. You could argue that they worked at X company to get it on their resume, but working with these people, it really didn&#x27;t feel that way. It seemed more like they were learning how things were done at established &quot;premium&quot; companies, to then go take on similar work at a foundational level at a smaller company.<p>You could argue that by valuing prestige, you end up devaluing perfectly good candidates, but at the end of the day you need to have _some_ heuristic to help filter the amount of resumes&#x2F;candidates you consider. Companies like triplebyte, interviewing.io, etc are trying to change this by trying to determine your actual skills vs your resume, but currently I haven&#x27;t heard of many better alternatives.')
