Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=[25436776, 25436576], score=None, time=1608072267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435681, text='&gt; &gt; No, dear white flight homeowner, we will not build you a tunnel just to avoid taking a few houses through eminent domain.<p>&gt; What makes someone so callous about using the power of the state to expropriate people from their homes?<p>First:  &quot;Expropriate&quot; is both emotionally loaded and inaccurate.  It looks like you&#x27;re trying to be manipulative here rather than present a sound argument.<p>Second:  If we&#x27;re going to build a road or a rail line, we&#x27;re either going to spend some money and buy peoples&#x27; homes, or we&#x27;re going to spend more money and create a tunnel.  But money doesn&#x27;t grow on trees for local governments; if they spend it, they have to take it.  So either we&#x27;re going to take money from people to buy houses from people, or we&#x27;re going to take <i>more</i> money from people to create a tunnel.  Why should they take <i>more</i> money from people to save peoples&#x27; houses?  Why should <i>my</i> taxes go up to save <i>your</i> house?<p>Note that this is a completely separate discussion from whether eminent domain actually pays people market prices for their homes.')
