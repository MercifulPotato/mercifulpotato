For that I needed text 2 speech with ?euphony? The available tools were horrid.  There was some library MaryTTS (?) that had a poor python wrapper to talk to it.  All the web based systems were super stingy in their demo resources and their use cases seemed geared more for TTS phrases that you’d have on a phone menu or something, not a paragraph of prose. I used Watson’s tool for a while before they became very annoying and I abandoned it.<p>Is there any better TTS Tool people could recommend?')
