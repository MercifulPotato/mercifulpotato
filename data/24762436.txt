Stuckey shows that the origin of quantum entanglement is none other than Einstein&#x27;s own Principle of Relativity (No Preferred Frame of Reference).<p>Einstein&#x27;s famous 1905 paper on Relativity applied this principle to Translational Frames, showing it requires the Universal constant c (speed of light) to be the same in all such frames.  Were it not, the frame in which c was highest would be the only frame at rest.<p>But the same principle must require there to be no Preferred Orientation.  This leads to the requirement that Planck&#x27;s constant h be the same in all frames.  If the Stern-Gerlach experiment could give results between +h and -h, then the orientation producing the maximum value would be a preferred frame.<p>And because of that, when Alice and Bob measure entangled quantum particles, their combined results must violate Bell&#x27;s inequality.<p>But to my mind, the biggest take-away is that Einstein&#x27;s Principle of Relativity absolutely requires that conservation can only be on average.<p>All right, that&#x27;s a ridiculously condensed summary.  Enough to make your head spin :-)<p>The title paper is for general audiences, and references the original paper at \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-72817-7.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-72817-7.pdf</a>')
