I was looking for the sites like GitHub, Go Docs, Cloudflare, Hashicorp, and others what splashed a &quot;#BlackLivesMatter&quot; header on across all their sites. I remember a lot of places slapping banners or changing their headers black in support of the movement, and now I can&#x27;t find any examples of that happening. They all seem to have been removed by this point.<p>So- what was accomplished? I don&#x27;t remember which companies supported &quot;the cause.&quot; All I know is that the companies that I thought I did no longer do- or at least don&#x27;t show support any more. Which stands out to me more then their support.<p>Tells me that two things happened.<p>1. The companies wasted time figuring out how they should show their support, implementing those features, and all the associated work with making major changes to frontends. Spend hours figuring it out, most likely had meetings to discuses how to do it and what they should say.<p>2. The stopped showing supporting it after a point in time, which tells me they don&#x27;t actually care. They just want to show they do.<p>I&#x27;m guessing they showed support for two reasons. First is some sort of genuine support for the cause, but the 2nd is a fear of internal backlash for not showing support.<p>Good on Coinbase for removing the elements inside their company that would get pissed if their company didn&#x27;t take an active stand on flavor of the month political issues. When I go to work, I&#x27;m there to do my job and get paid. I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with people fighting over what political stand the company should take a position on this month. I don&#x27;t care that my programming language&#x27;s maintainers voiced support or not. I don&#x27;t care that program X or Y slapped a banner on their products for the month.<p>The fact that there was visible support for for Black Lives Matter that was removed a month later is a lot more telling then their support. You want to be apart of the movement without actually doing anything to fix the issues.<p>If you want to be political as a company, quietly donate money to the causes you support. Provide resources such as technical help or free&#x2F;discounted services to the causes you support. That&#x27;s infinitely more productive and helpful then letting your employees fight over what token gesture they want the company to show.')
