A cabin on a few acres of woods somewhere nearby you (20-30) minute drive. It&#x27;s small maybe 6x10 cabin with electricity and fiber internet. There&#x27;s a covered common area with a firepit, tables, and chairs that&#x27;s shared between you and the 4-7 other cabins at your &quot;camp site&quot;. There&#x27;s a few camp sites around the property. Groomed trails meander through the forests that you can see from the large window in your cabin.<p>If you were a remote employee, or even a hybrid remote, would you rent a space like this? How much would you want to pay?')
