Survive to tomorrow, where you have more resources and can pivot to doing things in a cleaner way.<p>So it&#x27;s not completely stupid to pretend A &amp; B are true.  You can pick up velocity now, in exchange for future problems.  And as long as the interest payments aren&#x27;t <i>too</i> high it&#x27;s well worth it.')
