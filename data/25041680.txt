Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604968556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023172, text='&gt; <i>Why did they include the play store + app model instead of embracing a true PWA experience?</i><p>I can think of a few possible reasons:<p>1. Chrome (as in the browser) came out after the first iPhone was released (2007), and around the same time of Android&#x27;s first release (2008).  Chrome OS didn&#x27;t come out until 2011.  Android&#x27;s app ecosystem started developing before Google had all that much influence on web standards, and likely before they realized that it would be a good idea to have that influence, or even knew that Chrome (the browser) would become as popular as it ended up being.  I&#x27;ll also note that Chrome OS wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as successful as Google hoped it would be; while that doesn&#x27;t invalidate Chrome OS&#x27;s app model, it doesn&#x27;t validate it either.<p>2. Android has done a decent amount of copying of iOS features (I say this without judgment or malice; I&#x27;ve been a generally happy Android user continuously since 2010 and have no axe to grind).  Not having native app development on Android could have been seen as a possible market disadvantage when compared against Apple.<p>3.  Google may have actually desired more Apple-like control over what runs on Android, or at least wanted to allow for the possibility that they&#x27;d want it in the future.  That&#x27;s harder when you base your app platform on web standards.')
