Needed to add an additional card as a primary network interface to solve desktop latency problems.\n  - One of my systems was unable to boot any OS installed on the non-GRUB drive. GRUB was unable to fire anything on that disk (regardless of OS brand, model and make)\n  - My latest system&#x27;s on board Wi-Fi and BT adapter was unusable for 2 years.\n</code></pre>\nI possibly had many more small problems and I either worked around that or a BIOS update came to remedy that to my luck. 18 years is a long time. :)')
