We spin up an instrumented browser inside a virtual machine and screenshare that with you within our web app. It records your actions and translates those actions into a repeatable test automatically.<p>- Since we have complete control of the test environment, we can do cool things like make recording file uploads really easy or present a nice workflow for getting coverage of visual regressions via screenshot testing.<p>- Our recorder is more accurate :)<p>- For every test you run within Reflect, you get a video synced up to the steps in your test, along with console and network logs from the test run.<p>- Instead of emitting Selenium code that you then maintain like a normal code-based testing tool, we are completely no-code meaning that even updating a test is completely codeless.  So for example if you need to make bigger changes to an existing test, we expose a way to re-record only the portions of the test you want to change, and keep the rest as-is.')
