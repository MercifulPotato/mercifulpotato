In fact becomes even more complicated when there&#x27;s more than 2 political parties in an election system.<p>&gt;If (as is, in fact, the case) the underlying facts changed away from Democrats preferences over the studied time on those issues, Democrats with constant preferences would appear to move left (and, conversely, an apparently stationary position on those issues# would represent a rightward shift in preferences.)<p>For sure, we can&#x27;t really deny the political divide. You can&#x27;t deny when it started to happen.<p>&gt;Conversely, see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;graphic-detail&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;the-repu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;graphic-detail&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;the-repu</a>...<p>That is certainly a measurement. I don&#x27;t believe that is the only factor in play. If that link wasn&#x27;t paywalled and I could go into the depth of the evaluation. I would best that this has far more to do with negative rights and positive rights.<p>Trump I would suspect is a classical liberal. The problem is that &#x27;liberalism&#x27; has been usurped by the positive rights crowd and now illiberalism is where classical liberals are fighting against positive rights.<p>Meanwhile on the Democrat far left, folks like AOC are pushing for extreme positive rights.<p>Overall though I feel like we are side skirting the actual concern. If the identity politics of Obama created the political schism we are seeing. The road to fixing the schism will have to come from the democrats. Obama misplayed his 2 terms in office and increased the divide greatly.<p>The perception of election fraud is only going to force the republicans to the right. Increasing divide.')
