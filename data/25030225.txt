The funny thing is that it all started after one criminal (Marian Kocner) was arrested and his iPhone had the app Threema installed - an E2E encrypted chat. Fortunately for the investigators he had backups enabled and they could access the chat history in plain text. He was in direct contact with government officials including politicians, judges, and so on. And this helped to uncover an even bigger organized group. The whole communication leaked and everyone can read it. You can find passages where he asks to pull specific information from police database. I think maybe 30+ high ranked people are now waiting behind bars for the trial.')
