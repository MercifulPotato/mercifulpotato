In this current political climate, one must be very careful before saying your employer is <i>both</i> a massive polluter adding to global warming, <i>and</i> has an implicitly racist bias in their primary product.<p>Gebru was not careful at all, then demanded to know who in Google could possible dare object to her unveiling such truths (as if those truths were obvious and indisputable). Surely, if she got that information she wouldn&#x27;t do something irresponsible like naming and shaming them on Twitter as naive at best and racists at worst (like she did to LeGuin in the week before she was fired).')
