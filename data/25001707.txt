The problem is with add-ons, they still run under OpenGL (because that&#x27;s what the SDK provides and by now there is an insane amount of plugins relying on it), so X-Plane exports some of its render surfaces to OpenGL and let&#x27;s plugins run normal GL code on it, while under the hood synchronizing the two worlds.<p>The problem is that the AMD driver has a bug with scheduling mixed workloads. Sometimes the GL side gets to execute first, sometimes follow up Vulkan work executes first. This leads to incorrectly composited rendering and really annoying flickering. And despite trying to have this fixed for over a year and many many emails with AMD engineers, we are nowhere near close to a fix for this. We are at the point where we are even considering integrating Zink just so we can ship an enjoyable add on experience to users.<p>Not every user has that problem, it depends on the hardware and software that runs (ie a very classic race condition). But I can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend AMD over Nvidia here. And I hate that, because the Big Navi cards look amazing.')
