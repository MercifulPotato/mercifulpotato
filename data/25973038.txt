Cory Doctorow even addresses this at the beginning of this article. He mentions that the GPL came out around the same time software copyright was first implemented. He distinguishes between copyleft (the &quot;icing&quot;) and interoperability (the &quot;cake&quot;) to point out how the new software copyrights took away interoperability. By the end of the article, he suggests we have no more cake and the icing may vanish soon.')
