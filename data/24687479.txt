Basically `createAuthorData` is a data structure constructor. There are some advantages by using _.pick or something in JS land, but these don&#x27;t work for other more strictly typed languages.<p>Also, I would be careful with using it so much as his example:<p>```\nfunction createAuthorData(firstName, lastName, books) {\n  return {firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName, books: books};\n}<p>function fullName(data) {\n  return data.firstName + &quot; &quot; + data.lastName;\n}<p>function createArtistData(firstName, lastName, genre) {\n  return {firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName, genre: genre};\n}\n```<p>you can also do `fullName({firstName: &#x27;Elmond&#x27;, not:&#x27;really&#x27;})` and have an hard to catch bug (where an actual typesystem would catch it).<p>You can either use a Protocol for this (PersonName) or a base class (though those are going out of fashion nowadays)')
