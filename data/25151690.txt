Urban America is taking this threat seriously and locking down for the winter while rural America thinks it&#x27;s a hoax. In Virginia, our cities are keeping the curve flattened, while the virus is surging off the charts in our rural communities.<p>Nothing convinces them. When a loved one dies of asphyxiation, they shrug it off and say that person died of obesity, old age, or a lack of vitamins. We have nurses telling stories of patients struggling to breath, but who still refuse to believe this virus is real and only cease gasping about the &quot;fake news&quot; when they are intubated.<p>Complicating this is our HIPAA regulations. The media can&#x27;t show you what&#x27;s happening inside our hospitals right now. They can only show the refrigeration trucks for bodies and roads closed for oxygen trucks outside the hospitals. So the conspiracy theorists claim these are for show and that the hospitals are actually empty.<p>With the complete abdication of leadership at the federal level--where some of our officials are openly urging citizens to fight against policies slowing the spread of the virus, we can do nothing but stay inside and hope to ride this out.')
