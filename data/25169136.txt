At work there are very basic adjustable chairs and they use some slippery fabric.<p>- At home I have an ergonomic mechanical keyboard vs. a cheap rubber dome keyboard that kept running out of batteries at work.<p>- An ergonomic mouse, vs. a tiny mouse that doesn&#x27;t even have a back button.<p>- Two 27&quot; 4k monitors, vs. a single 24&quot; monitor.<p>- Always a nice room temperature, vs. often being too hot or too cold.<p>- Bathroom always available, vs. sometimes having to wait to use the bathroom.<p>- No interruptions, vs. occasional interruptions.<p>- Working in silence, vs. having to use noise cancelling headphone and listening to music when I don&#x27;t want to.<p>To me the only drawbacks are that Zoom meetings are worse than in-person and not being able to have hallway discussions, but the many gains in quality of life easily make up for that. But the situation could easily reverse for someone who only has a tiny laptop and no room for a home office.')
