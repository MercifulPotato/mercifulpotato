The lack of imagination is astounding.<p>Solution 3, the most common solution available and that has a 100% track record:  the market changes.  People build new things, people buy different things.   They don’t necessarily stop buying iPhones, but it becomes less important.<p>Case in point, Microsoft retains a PC monopoly with Windows.  People still buy PCs.    But no one really cares that much.<p>The smartphone App Store market is barely a decade old and we are ready to treat it like a utility to be enshrined for 50 years.   It took <i>decades</i> to regulate electrical generation vs distribution.  It also didn’t really “open things up”, it just enshrined the existing players as the standards.<p>The only pipe dream here is that the government will somehow force Apple to run other people’s App Store software on their devices, and remove any curation ability.  Considering that curation and integration is what Customers actually want, I don’t see how any government enacts this in the consumer interests.  It’s only in the interests of other vendors.<p>At best it would be an independent App Store approval process regulated by the government.')
