Item(by='specialist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610469093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743307, text='&gt; <i>drags behind them a retinue of trusted aides ... shitting on the remnants of whatever came before them</i><p>My first exposure to that idea was the process of re-mything after a regime change, as described in The Chalice and the Blade (Riane Eisler). Yesterday&#x27;s godhead, deity, creation myth, ledger of debts was obviously deeply wrong. Appropriate, subvert, coopt, as able, all the narratives and levers of power. Utterly obliterate the rest.<p>Then there&#x27;s The Prince, of course. Sage advice that usurpers should immediately behead any potential challengers, lest they organize and rebel, covertly or overtly, at some future date.<p>Same as it ever was. I&#x27;m only ever surprised, nay disappointed, when someone doesn&#x27;t clean the slate. They&#x27;re either not very good, non-serious, or worse.')
