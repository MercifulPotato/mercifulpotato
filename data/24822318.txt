The Arch Wiki pages are far longer and more off-putting than running whatever you want post-boot in PAM or even ad hoc or from systemd&#x2F;.profile if it isn&#x27;t home dir.<p>And what&#x27;s the difference in what you&#x27;re protecting that affects the average user? Why stop at FDE - they should be worried about cold-boot attacks too right!?')
