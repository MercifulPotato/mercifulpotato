It has already turned out.<p>There is no alternative to Qt. It is the best in its class.<p>But you don&#x27;t need it. You don&#x27;t need Electron either. Just build a .NET application for Windows, a SwiftUI one for Mac, and a ncurses one for Linux. They can all share the same business logic code (if it has any), either via C ABI, IPC, or RPC. Your application will always be at the bleeding edge with the latest security patches and accessibility this way, as opposed to waiting for the next Qt&#x2F;Electron release which is guaranteed to be later than the OS bugfix. Imagine if desktop OSes release, in addition to dark mode, a pink mode. Do you want your application to stand out as the ugly duckling?')
