I write proprietary software for embedded systems and I am thankful for people with more permissive licenses.<p>If I find useful copyleft code I would copy the code to a degree because I read it and cannot forget about it. I do try not to make a simple copy and in most cases it is just a tiny subset of the original, but a case could be made that it is still the same in abstract.<p>I do think that copyleft should have its place though, it doesn&#x27;t have to be either&#x2F;or. Especially in todays world where systems get more and more restrictive, it is a good license to have for some projects and ensures that ideas continue to be shared.')
