Co-founder&#x2F;CTO of Tara here.<p>We take privacy around your data very seriously. We&#x27;re thinking about the ML training model as a &quot;walled garden&quot;, ie recommendations are based on your past sprint activity, effort load, tasks completed during a sprint, etc.  and are exclusive to your organization.<p>In the future, if we decided to do benchmarking (for eg quick recommendations on how companies in your industry are running sprints), we would have a double opt-in. This would mean anonymizing the data, and providing the recommendations an opt-in. Basically, very similar to how google&#x27;s autocomplete email recommendations work.')
