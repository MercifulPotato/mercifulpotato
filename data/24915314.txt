I will remain a law abiding citizen of the United States, but I will follow your leadership, and your example. I will work to execute your policies. I will follow the regulations you suggest. You may even tax me. Send me a venmo request. I will do what you ask, so long as you do not ask me to commit an act of violence, but I do not think you will. Please, Kanye, rescue us from oppression, save us from the evil octopus of the New York Times and Trump, Biden, and Nancy Pelosi, the serpentine robots that feed it. Teach us to pray again.
