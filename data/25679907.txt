I wish people would stop putting geohot up on a pedestal. His entire career has been about self-promotion (something which he is <i>very</i> good at), but he got his start taking credit for other people&#x27;s work (that SIM lock stuff was largely just implementing stuff other people told him about). He even took credit from my&#x2F;our (fail0verflow&#x27;s) work when he did the thing that got him sued (published some PS3 private keys), which was just him implementing the ECDSA attack we had detailed in a presentation a week prior, without a single mention until I emailed him to ask him to do so.<p>Alyssa&#x27;s Panfrost work is leaps and bounds ahead of anything geohot has ever personally done.<p>Pretty much everyone of our profile gets started at around that age (I was porting Linux to a weirdo ISP router at 14 and working on Wii hardware and homebrew, the first &quot;well known&quot; thing I did, starting at 16-17), but somehow geohot has marketed himself to be some kind of genius when he&#x27;s one of the more mediocre hackers I&#x27;ve known. He&#x27;s not <i>bad</i> these days, but he has always represented his skills as being way better than they actually are, and taken solo credit for work that involved other people, his entire career.')
