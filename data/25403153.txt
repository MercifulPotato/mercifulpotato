The next two most dominant rivals in the area of streaming are literally the two you call out later in your post, Facebook and Google. You&#x27;re not going to make money by trying to get people to get people to switch to your niche streaming service that no one has heard of and will close up shop in a year.<p>Individual action, <i>especially</i> consumer action, has never been a driving force in effecting change. If it were, companies like Nestle, which you hear about the despicable practices of almost weekly on commenting sites like reddit, wouldn&#x27;t still be market leaders. Legislation, litigation, and most importantly, <i>collective action</i> are the only ways to change things like this. Don&#x27;t tell people to boycott a service, get them to unionize their de facto employees.')
