Even in times without covid, I&#x27;m sure it would reduce a lot of infectious disease transmission (flu, cold, etc). We can further optimize and reduce death counts by making all gatherings permanently remote. If people can&#x27;t gather, they can&#x27;t spread disease. We can also further optimize by advocating people have less kids. The smaller the population, the fewer people will die. You can&#x27;t get sick if you were never born.<p>Had we been doing all these things for the past century, we would have saved many millions of lives by now (well, they all died eventually, but I mean we could have extended lives by millions, maybe even billions of man-years).')
