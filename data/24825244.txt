Basically exactly where the keys are stored is up to the implementation, but one reasonable implementation is for the memory controller to put them in the top part of the system DRAM (which is then not made available as &#x27;normal&#x27; RAM). Architecturally the allocation tag space is entirely separate from system memory, though, and the only way to get at it is with the provided instructions for reading&#x2F;writing tags, so any particular implementation can put any kind of storage it likes underneath. (A software model, for instance, might just allocate a separate lump of host RAM for storing the tags. QEMU&#x27;s MTE emulation does that.)')
