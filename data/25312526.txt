Item(by='0xB31B1B', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607152345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303409, text='The world of urban centers is a world of a fixed amount of lane-miles of road. Cars are an extremely inefficient use of road space, they have some of the worst throughout in terms of people per lane-mile per hour relative to other transit modes. What cities like Paris are doing is reallocating lane-miles of road from cars to alternate mere efficient transit modes, which increases there throughout and decreases their commute times. In a world of limited resources (lane miles of road) how much of a penalty should bus riders pay (in terms of minutes wasted sitting in car traffic) to increase the freedom of a much smaller in number group of drivers. I don’t have the numbers offhand, but let’s say there are 5 unique passenger trips in a bus for every unique passenger trip in a car in Paris. It’s calculable, by saying “preserve car drivers freedom” you are also saying “increase commute times by 30% for a group of people that is 5x as big as those having their freedom preserved.')
