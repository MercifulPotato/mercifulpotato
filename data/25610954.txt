A descending rocket is essentially an inverted pendulum [1] with two-axis control via gimbals in the engines, which is a pretty well-studied and solved problem in robotics (just search for &quot;inverted pendulum robot&quot;).  Hover-slam timing is probably empirically derived and then computed based on velocity, position, and mass (again classically).  High-accuracy rocket positioning systems date back to the cold war (or maybe earlier) and are definitely not ML, either.  As for why it wasn&#x27;t done before, the answer is mostly lack of incentive&#x2F;competition.  There really wasn&#x27;t any reason for the launch companies to make reusable rockets when the government and commercial customers were willing to pay for non-reusable and no one else in the market showed any interest at all in developing their own.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inverted_pendulum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inverted_pendulum</a>')
