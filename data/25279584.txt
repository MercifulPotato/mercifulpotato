Yeah I mean there are some really esoteric programming topics, like actually implementing compression algorithms, which I will probably never invest the time to learn.  But in terms of &quot;general programming&quot;, I feel like at some point over the past ten years, I developed a pretty clear mental model for how a line of high-level code maps to how the CPU&#x2F;GPU is manipulating memory.  I feel like once you start thinking in terms of hardware, the pace of revelations slows way down, and different programming topics mostly seem like different ways of doing the same thing.')
