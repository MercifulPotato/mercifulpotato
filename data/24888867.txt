Disclaimer: these are opinions.<p>We allow mainstream press, owned by allies of a politician, to make outlandish claims unverified in the weeks leading up to an election. This has always been &quot;correctable&quot; in the past, in a world where articles could be retracted or condemned, particularly by even more mainstream outlets (because there is a spectrum from tabloid journalism to &quot;respectable&quot;). With social media, the genie is out the bottle with that initial statement, and there&#x27;s no way to set the record straight anymore, let alone in two weeks before an election.<p>I realize that I used a ton of loaded terms here. That reflects a couple of opinions that I hold: that there is value in institutions, that truth is a social construct, that maintaining order in people&#x27;s lives has intrinsic value. Folks are free to disagree, but please be clear about whether it&#x27;s with the premise or the conclusion.')
