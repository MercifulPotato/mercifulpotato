Paying per SMS was a thing in the US when texting was novel ($0.10&#x2F;SMS or so, IIRC?) but the US seemed to move to unlimited texting sooner than most places. However, today in the European country I live in it&#x27;s almost impossible to find plans that don&#x27;t include unlimited SMS, but it perhaps happened &quot;too late&quot; to take over messaging now that online platforms offer effectively free international messaging and calling as well.')
