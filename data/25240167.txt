Bottom bracket &quot;standards&quot; have proliferated over the last 20 years (all 8 of the bikes in my garage use a different system).  Hub spacing is non-standard too (100mm&#x2F;130mm QR, 100&#x2F;135 QR, 100&#x2F;135 TA, 100&#x2F;142 TA, 110&#x2F;148 TA, Superboost, DH, and a few other niche standards).  Even within a brand, there&#x27;s no guarantee shifters and detailers are compatible.<p>Basically, the industry has &quot;standards&quot; but only keeps them long enough to develop the next.  Gotta keep us buying $5000+ bicycles somehow.')
