The category of people who work in industries like software is much larger than the category of people who are hired by Google right out of college.<p>If you are hired by Google right out of college, first of all, you are willingly participating in an evil organization. No excuses. But yes, if you are hired by Google right out of college you should have no problem doing FI&#x2F;RE.<p>Most of the software industry is writing CRUD apps for banks, insurance companies, and other similar large established corporations. You can still do FI&#x2F;RE, but cut all the numbers in your examples by half, probably more.')
