Item(by='fuoqi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605684651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133958, text='&gt;Neither Russia nor the US would escalate an invasion of the Baltic&#x27;s, Neither China nor the US would escalate an invasion of Taiwan.<p>I highly doubt it. Baltic states are part of NATO, assuming Russia blitzkriegs them (it&#x27;s a really HUGE assumption since they have relatively little geopolitical or economical value for Russia, the Suwalki corridor would be nice to have, but not considering the associated risks), leaving occupation unanswered will mean that US leadership position in the world (together with NATO) will be effectively dead. So further escalation will be practically imminent.<p>I think China&#x27;s invasion of Taiwan will not be left unanswered as well, in addition to the huge reputation hit similar to the scenario with Baltic states, Taiwan has a big geopolitical (cornerstone of the first island chain) and economical value (not only TSMC) for the US. Further escalation is highly probable as well. A contained clash could&#x27;ve happened in the South China sea, but since China got entrenched there, the US Navy got quite careful to not overstep itself in this region. And this balance will continue to tilt only further to China&#x27;s favor.<p>A limited conflict could in theory happen with a limited invasion of Russia, since its current nuclear doctrine is quite defensive (esp. compared to the US&#x27;), but the &quot;threatens the existence of the state&quot; condition is a bit vague, so assuming that Russia will use all its available military to defend itself, it will either drive invading forces out using conventional means (which would include counter-attacks on &quot;decision centers&quot;), or in the end will use nuclear weapons.')
