But only for those which jobs allow it. Also: The rate of <i>„investments in physical and human capital enabling WFH“</i> will be highly aligned with HEIs and will be much lower per worker the lower you get in the income scale (worse connection, worse hardware, worse software, more requirements to keep minuscule track of working hours).<p>So<p>a) these „investements“ are either done or will compound for HIEs<p>b) income disparities are being increased massively<p>c) the low-income end of WFH will suck significantly more than the high-income end. And maybe even worse in terms of pay and conditions than the offline version of same job (more ability for bosses to micro-manage, commoditize and near-shore you).<p><i>„Third, many workers report being more productive at home“</i><p>d) again, this will highly concentrate around HIEs, because HIEs will be more likely to bring the most important <i>„investment in WFH“</i> with them: Office Space at home.')
