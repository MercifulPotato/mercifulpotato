That&#x27;s 2 to 4 times energy saved! (depending on model)<p>But overall efficiency needs to take into account the weight too. A Tesla Model X is 2.5t. If your car is 2 times the weight of your old car, say good bye to your efficiency gains.<p>That&#x27;s where a CitroÃ«n AMI has potential, IMO. A really light-weight, really efficient electric car that does the job. Hope they start advertising it like that.')
