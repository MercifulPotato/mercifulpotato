Privacy isn&#x27;t about having something to hide, it&#x27;s about having the same rights you have with your day-to-day thoughts; you aren&#x27;t forced to shout every single thought that pops into your mind, you are able to pick and choose what you would like to express and share. Privacy and encryption aim towards that goal.')
