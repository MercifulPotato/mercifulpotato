Certainly, they could have been doing more lot earlier. However there are lot worse players and the focus has been a lot more on Pornhub rather than industry in general.<p>Self regulation by Pornhub is good step forward, but a model which enables only change from one player after pressure from the payment providers is not reliable model. There has to be regulatory change to really protect the victims.')
