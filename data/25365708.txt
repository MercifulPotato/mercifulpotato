Youtube just happens to be more flexible than the government, but don&#x27;t think for a second they&#x27;re all going to draw the line if the government passes a law prohibiting saying those things. Legally enforced censorship is what many of them ultimately want.<p>On the other side of the coin, the anti-censorship people also want the government to prohit Youtube&#x2F;FB&#x2F;etc. from censoring their ideas. That&#x27;s just as anti-freedom.')
