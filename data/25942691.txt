In the event of a crash where the car is submerged in water, the outside pressure might not allow you to open doors and window breaking or equalising pressure, is your only way out.<p>Having said that, GP made a rather disgusting comment where he is blaming a dead person for not having a non-mandatory emergency window breaker in a car compartment.<p>From the article description the handles don&#x27;t appear to be fault-tolerant and should certainly be investigated.')
