There is a lot of mythos about how Simons hired computer scientists, mathematicians, signal processing and NLP experts, etc. When Mercer came over from IBM, he definitely contributed a significant amount of analytical expertise that was probably nonexistent in financial trading at the time (with the possible exception of the Ed Thorp diaspora). The astrophysicists RenTech hires every year bring new insights in ways to model and understand vast amounts of data with absurd dimensionality.<p>But all of this has to be utilized in the context of the data. The reality is that you&#x27;re not going to develop a sophisticated options trading strategy without a strong understanding of what an option (and more generally, a derivative) <i>is</i>. You can&#x27;t develop a viable statistical arbitrage strategy just by treating market microstructure as a blackbox signal to be solved with e.g. Fourier analysis. You can certainly find an edge in using fundamentally superior methods of analysis, but you still need to know what that data represents in the context of the market.<p>Don&#x27;t be fooled: people working at firms like RenTech have a strong understanding of the underlying finance. It&#x27;s just that they learned it on the job, because the ethos at these firms is that learning fundamental theory in math and statistics is harder than learning fundamental theory in finance. You don&#x27;t have to take my word for it though. Read about one of the few strategies of RenTech&#x27;s which has been publicized: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2014-07-22&#x2F;senate-literary-critics-don-t-like-fictional-derivatives" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2014-07-22&#x2F;senate...</a>. Deutsche and RenTech didn&#x27;t team up on this strategy (to fantastic success) by treating basket options as some kind of blackbox abstraction devoid of delta, gamma, theta and vega.')
