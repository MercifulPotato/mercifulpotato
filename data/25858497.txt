Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=[25858635], score=None, time=1611235126, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25857012, text='&gt; The thing about this &quot;self-correction&quot; is that nobody, but nobody has a mechanism to explain this force.<p>I have a hypothesis: it&#x27;s about stability. First, let us discard the notion of time &quot;happening&quot; from a perspective of the universe as a whole. Now, let us posit that only universes with stable structures can exist the same way that quantum superpositions can only collapse into certain states based on conditions [0].<p>In a stable time loop, the 4-dimensional-string model of the universe contains a section that loops back on itself. Irrespective of how any 3 dimensional beings in the string might experience it, this never &quot;happened&quot;, it is just a part of the string&#x27;s structure, which is stable.<p>This seems strange from the perspective of a 3d observer within that universe because they believe they have free will [1], but it is simply how physics works. A universe where the time travel causes instability isn&#x27;t <i>destroyed</i> or anything like that, it simply can&#x27;t come into existence at all according to the laws of physics.<p>However, I will further posit that, from the perspective of the time-travelling observer, it is possible to change history <i>even in a stable universe</i>! Consider the following scenario: You travel back in time to kill your own grandfather and succeed. Somewhat surprisingly you realize you still exist, evade the authorities, invent a new identity, and raise a family. Later, one of your own grandchildren decides to enact the same experiment you did in the &quot;previous&quot; [2] timeline and travels back in time to kill his own grandfather (that&#x27;s you, in case that wasn&#x27;t clear), and does so before you have a chance to kill <i>your</i> grandfather. Unbeknownst to yourself, this is part of the &quot;original&quot; timeline which now proceeds as normal with you travelling back in time to conduct an experiment in which you kill your own grandfather. This knotted structure is also stable, as are indefinitely complex variations [3].<p>Of course, the much simpler solution is that no universes can exist wherein this kind of time travel is even a possibility in the first place, but where&#x27;s the fun in that?<p>[0] consider the double-slit experiment, wherein a wave-like pattern is formed even if only one electron occupies the experiment at a time. The electron states destined to land in the gap regions can&#x27;t exist in the first place.<p>[1] and they do, from their perspective. Philosophically this is an interesting argument, but it is irrelevant here.<p>[2] it might be more accurate to say &quot;meta-concurrent&quot;?<p>[3] this form of time travel is rare in fiction, but I have at least seen a knot-stable time loop represented in Dark.')
