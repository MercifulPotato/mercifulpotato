For journal publications, we (in the EU) almost always have to pay. However, MDPI is particularly aggressive in its editorial practices and marketing tactics. In my community, we sometimes publish &quot;smaller&quot; works there: when early-career researchers get to guest edit a special issue in an MDPI journal and we want to support them; i.e., we sometimes fall for MDPI&#x27;s marketing tactics ;-)<p>It&#x27;s best to have journals that are owned by the community, but these take time to grow into venues that administrators respect: we can publish some work there, but it&#x27;s not enough for building a competitive academic CV.<p>Considering this article: it&#x27;s just a comment, and to me it looks like something an expert can easily tear apart. A well-established researcher wouldn&#x27;t publish such a comment in an MDPI journal (as one of the other comments suggests).')
