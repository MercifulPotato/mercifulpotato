I took &quot;extremely regular&quot; to mean conforming to an equidistant grid structure, while you seem to have been talking about the consistency in repetition that makes it a groove.<p>Regardless, the context of this discussion was determining whether MIDI data can hold &quot;extra information&quot; that the score does not, and I can&#x27;t agree with most of your statements about that.<p>&gt; technically, that would be a case of the MIDI data having noise in it, not extra information.<p>&gt; and yet ... in almost all the musical forms where this happens, it isn&#x27;t notated.<p>There&#x27;s a term for this type of thinking, and it&#x27;s called &quot;notational centricity.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot;musicological methods tend to foreground those musical parameters which can be easily notated&quot; such as pitch relationships or the relationship between words and music. On the other hand, historical musicology tends to &quot;neglect or have difficulty with parameters which are not easily notated&quot;, such as tone colour or non-Western rhythms.<p>So any given parameter not being notated with ease or in detail doesn&#x27;t prove anything about its role as an intentional, stylistic element of the music. That is, not being notated doesn&#x27;t make a parameter any more likely to be &quot;noise,&quot; because what does get notated is not a &quot;core representation&quot; of the musical text. In fact, the distinction between the two mostly comes down to historical coincidence or other non-musical factors.<p>MIDI or other more granulous performance capture standards have plenty of &quot;extra information&quot; to offer that is not noise, and I&#x27;d even say it&#x27;s mostly the case that you&#x27;ll see a robust SNR there.')
