Item(by='oisdk', descendants=None, kids=[24922643], score=None, time=1603888084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914564, text='&gt; Not all branches of pure mathematics are equally worthy of study.<p>Ok? What does this have to do with the point I was making?<p>My point was, pretty simply, that &quot;usefulness&quot; is not the only thing we consider when deciding whether something is worthy of study. (If it was we wouldn&#x27;t have touched most of modern pure mathematics.) As a result, your notion that studying HoTT would be a waste of time because it&#x27;s not &quot;useful&quot; is nonsense.<p>&gt; How should one figure out how well-regarded a subfield of mathematics is if not by asking members of the mathematical community?<p>Oh come on, you really don&#x27;t understand the point I&#x27;m making?<p>When talking about consensus it&#x27;s not good enough to say &quot;I&#x27;ve talked to a few people and they agree with me&quot;. Work on HoTT, measured by any kind of actual metric rather than &quot;people I&#x27;ve spoken to (who I can&#x27;t name by the way) say it&#x27;s bad&quot;, is broadly well-regarded and seen as important. In terms of research funding, citation&#x2F;publication metrics, or the opinion of <i>most</i> mathematicians.<p>&gt; His comments support the point I intended them to support<p>No they do not. My objection is to you saying:<p>* That HoTT is a waste of time.<p>* That HoTT doesn&#x27;t have much content.<p>* That HoTT is not broadly regarded by mathematicians as important or exciting.<p>Please do not move the goalposts.<p>&gt; You made a remark about well-regarded mathematicians, and I gave you comments from a well-regarded mathematician.<p>What? I &quot;made a remark&quot; about well-regarded mathematicians? I said, specifically, &quot;there are loads of well-regarded and prominent mathematicians who hold the opposite view to yours&quot;.<p>I also tried to stress that:<p>&gt; if you&#x27;re arguing about consensus you can&#x27;t just point to one or two individuals<p>Please bear that in mind.')
