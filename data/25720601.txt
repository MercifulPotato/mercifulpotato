I suppose they&#x27;re right, because we do use different definitions of equality for different needs, both within math and in other fields, and of course without a good definition all sides agree to, people can find themselves talking past one another.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the definition of equality I like best is the one based on symbolic manipulation - two symbols a and b are equal iff substituting a by b in ANY statement does not modify the statement&#x27;s truth value.')
