For example, you can combine some topics together. A math class can teach math but instead of arbitrary equations with no practical application, you can connect the subject with a finance topic or economics topic. This gives you a mechanism to ensure students intuitively understand a concept as opposed to simply regurgitating memorized equations that they’ll forget after the exam.')
