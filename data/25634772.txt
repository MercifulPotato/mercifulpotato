It took about a month in lockdown for me to realize I hated it.<p>Turns out, my mental health is much better when I have an office to go to. 1h20 in commute (round-trip), no privacy, tons of distractions, and still I&#x27;m happier when I get to leave the house to go to work.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s mostly just a matter of getting out of the house. Those 4 walls get pretty oppressive after a while.<p>I, too, found myself working from bed. It was not an improvement, and ended up being the last step towards a crippling depression that wouldn&#x27;t let me get out of bed in the first place.<p>So, for me at least, working from bed is awful. Ergonomically, emotionally, spiritually just f---ing draining.')
