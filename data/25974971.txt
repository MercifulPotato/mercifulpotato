It&#x27;s true that media is controlled by Government now. It wasn&#x27;t the case before this government came into action.<p>2. It&#x27;s also true that existing power nexus like these farmer brokers who are spearheading the protest. You may ask where they get their money from go continue the protest? Basically from the existing network of exporters of fruits, vegetables, grains etc... These farmering group head ask for bribes and favours and then sell government subsidized produce to select companies who rendered those favours.<p>But they make it as if this movement is to save the interest of the poor farmers, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s to save their own interest, they&#x27;ll lose their power to ask for bribes like gst commissioners, custom officers have lost in last few months thanks to the government&#x27;s faceless medium of interaction with the average citizen, no officer can put influence on a person now and convince them to offer bribes.<p>3. It&#x27;s true that the government has brought reforms and removed medieval practises like triple talaq and polygamy for the Muslims but at the same time played hypocrite by banning beaf in multiple states. This doesn&#x27;t look good at all.<p>Is it going in good or bad direction? Well if I compare to the governments round the globe, this government isn&#x27;t really that bad. It&#x27;s very hard to govern a country as large and diverse as India where multiple groups of different ethnicities and religion are trying to step on each others head to undermine others interest and fight for their own.<p>Many things have improved in infrastructure since this government came.<p>4. While they brought GST with goal to remove multiple taxation on good and services at every step of value addition. They&#x27;ve brought taxes on fuel to high, which if you look closely is also a &quot;multiple taxation&quot; at every step of production. So what gives? It means government simply failed to fund itself without this excessive taxation in production.')
