The approach I took is to store data in flat documents (relational style) and only de-normalize when necessary for performance. The relational model was invented for a reason -- it is flexible and it is easy to update data in one place and so on. The downside of relational is that joins will kill you when you have very large tables. To avoid joins, I use lookups when possible, and de-normalize only to the extend needed. I get the best of both worlds.')
