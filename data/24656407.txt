True but like... you also can have way lower expenses for housing... and if you move to a state with no income tax, you might not even lose almost any net income.<p>But - uh - I think a lot of people would be happy to keep 90% of their really high silicon valley TC if they moved to another region and they got a one-time $20K relocation bonus to top it off. I&#x27;m sure many people in SV would move if they thought they could keep 90% of their TC in another area. That said - it only stays true if they stick with Stripe. As soon as Stripe doesn&#x27;t employ them - they&#x27;re gonna be competing for remote-only workers wages (or whatever is local too I guess) unless they move back.<p>I see these options as really good offers for those who really want to temporarily move somewhere else, like the company&#x2F;manager&#x2F;whatever they currently work for, and want to come back to the tech hub in 2-3 years (new parents? young&#x2F;childless married couples? someone who misses their friends &quot;back home&quot;? Idk). For everyone else, I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d move away unless you were already planning on it anyway. Your savings will be short term gained and you will lose all your friendships locally. You won&#x27;t likely get to keep that $400K+ TC by sticking with permanently remote jobs or by not living in a tech hub city unless you never lose your job. (Uncommon) For people who hated living in NYC or SF Bay Area then maybe this is the winning ticket to help them kickstart their jump into another region.<p>If Stripe IPOs - they could use that stock they earned for 2 years while working remotely to buy a house almost anywhere besides NY&#x2F;SF. (Effectively meaning they don&#x27;t need SF&#x2F;NY income anymore because they have paid the most expensive part of housing off)')
