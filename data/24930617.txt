Now that GitHub is owned by Microsoft, it would be a good way for Google to combat the ongoing centralization of open source.<p>Fundamentally, the Gerrit changes model is superior than the pull-request model. I also really like how Gerrit stores all its information in git repos, comments, settings and everything else.<p>The issue is everything that surrounds it. Talking from somebody who maintains an instance for a customer. The UI has all sorts of UX problems and takes a while to get into. The notification system is super noisy by default, we had to build a system on top and it&#x27;s still not as good as GitHub&#x27;s (which is also bad in its own respect).')
