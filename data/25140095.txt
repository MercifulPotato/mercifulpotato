I don&#x27;t know that I have very many things that I have genuinely accomplished, which I think gets at the heart of the issue. When I do mimic accomplishing various things, this mostly comes from taking various portions of online example code, reformulating it, and doing some basic data plumbing to make it work the way I want it to. Almost everything that I have &quot;written&quot; looks like modified example code glued together with stackoverflow-plumbing. I have in fact built tons of projects and worked on large codebases, but I&#x27;m not certain that makes me an engineer or that any of this is a genuine accomplishment. It isn&#x27;t.<p>At the same time, I feel stupid trying to learn how to program properly at my age. I should already know all this at this point in my career so it feels really demeaning, depressing, and embarrassing to do programming exercises. I can&#x27;t get out of this middling-tier programming skillset, and I have to keep up appearances that I am not middling.<p>Every time I do go back and try to fix my understanding I&#x27;m caught in a loop. I get bored&#x2F;upset by shuffling through the same basic intro-type work that I already know if I go back too far into intro material I already know by heart. At the same time, when I try to pick out less introductory projects&#x2F;exercises I just end up spending the whole time googling for stackoverflow questions every few minutes. Getting me back into the &quot;this project is just a string of answers I looked up&quot; head space. The project never feels like a true accomplishment.')
