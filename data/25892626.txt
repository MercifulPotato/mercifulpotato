Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611500958, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890657, text='&gt; Not attending class doesn&#x27;t mean you have no human interaction, there are tons of other options for human interaction like sport clubs.<p>Sure, but the key is like-minded individuals, and it&#x27;s <i>fun</i> (at least for many people) to be thrown together with hundreds or thousands of other people who are at the same life stage as you.<p>Sports clubs, and many similar clubs and societies, amongst university students only really work when those students are substantially located in roughly the same geographical location.<p>You&#x27;re conflating being in a lecture hall with attending university. Being in lectures is a small part of the whole experience. Much of the rest of that experience relies heavily on being mostly colocated for the academic year.<p>A really small example: Cambridge University <i>will not be able to continue fielding</i> a top quality rowing squad unless the squad members are all able to train together as a team. It <i>will not be able to</i> recruit new members to its rowing teams to build that top quality squad unless it can bring all those people together.<p>On the teaching front it&#x27;s pretty difficult to do a substantial proportion of, e.g., practical physics, chemistry, and biology labs from home or your hall of residence. It&#x27;s also going to be impossible to meaningfully participate in practical engineering labs, or many of the activities that medical students need to do in order to qualify as doctors.<p>Even the more practical aspects of the arts and music present serious challenges, and nobody can make me believe that a remote experience in these disciplines will be anything more than second rate.<p>For some people I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine (Open University and its associated remote learning have after all been available in the UK for decades) but for most people remote university is going to be an <i>extremely</i> impoverished experience. If I were university age now I&#x27;d seriously consider deferring until the pandemic is in the past.')
