There is overlap, of course, but the cars&#x27; basically have their own groups individually for specific tuning&#x2F;troubleshooting&#x2F;telemetrics.<p>If you think Valteri is getting the best and fastest crew to work on his car, the question turns into &quot;Why would Mercedes use their best and brightest on their second in points?&quot;<p>The point is : there isn&#x27;t a <i>handicapped car</i> per se, but one of the two teams that gravitate around the drivers&#x27; is better at it&#x27;s job -- thus, one of the cars has an edge.<p>It&#x27;s a simple concept, but it has to be true. Mercedes can&#x27;t simply clone their driver-centric teams over and stamp them to both sides -- so they have to prioritize their better driver having the faster team with more skill and better communication.<p>Sucks for Valteri, but as we&#x27;ve seen race after race -- he gets by just fine.')
