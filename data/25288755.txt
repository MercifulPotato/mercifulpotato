Since the site has a lot of moving parts, there are many components that get hydrated depending on the page. For instance, this page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gurlic.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gurlic.com</a>) is generated by Go, but the actions such as like&#x2F;dislike&#x2F;share&#x2F;respond are hydrated by their respective Svelte components. If you scroll all the way down, new posts are fetched and rendered with Svelte components too, and the great bit is that I can use the same action (like&#x2F;dislike&#x2F;etc) components there too.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to do it, but I like writing smaller components that can replace initial server-rendered HTML, and can then be imported into larger components too.')
