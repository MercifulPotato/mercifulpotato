It&#x27;s fairly easy to write a script with current technology even for an average &quot;hacker&quot; to solve them. But on the other hand it&#x27;s extremely hard, nearly impossible for a person with special needs to complete them. Even for average person solving some of CAPTCHAs is a hassle.<p>Most of the popular CAPTCHAs services are &quot;robot-friendly&quot; and providers don&#x27;t care who solves them, they just need data, they don&#x27;t need to prove you&#x27;re human.')
