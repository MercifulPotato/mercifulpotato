I mean the customer as boss in the abstract sense — not as if they are making literal management decisions. Customer as metonym.<p>When you seek product-market fit, or decide which features to prioritize for development, you are in effect seeking to satisfy this boss. When you make pricing decisions, you’re likewise being guided by the constraints of your target customer base. The customer can ultimately shut you down, firing everyone, to stretch the metaphor. Can you fire the customer? Sure. But you always need a customer of some kind, and as a going concern you ultimately serve at the pleasure of that (aggregate) customer, and not the reverse.')
