You played it perhaps (I did not) and thought that the game forces you to identify with characters mocking something or someone. I haven&#x27;t played many games that didn&#x27;t depict such mockery in a negative light if the player has no influence on it anyway.<p>Some games allow you to have a choice in it, but doing so is not synonymous with holding that view.<p>&gt; trappings that have been appropriated by neo-nazis.<p>Don&#x27;t make the mistake in handing such symbols to neo-nazis.
