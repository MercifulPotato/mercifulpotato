It’s rare, but if the returned object fits more than one type (say, a superclass vs concrete class instance) the incorrect one could be selected and the code still compile. Is this even a valid concern?<p>The only time I see manual type annotation cause problems consistently is with React.FC&lt;Props&gt;: (props: T). People don’t always remember to provide their props interface as the generic, and instead directly annotate the props argument of the function. This is a subtle issue that breaks the “magic” props added by React (like children), leading to people adding their own children definitions to their props interfaces d’oh')
