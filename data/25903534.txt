Making it criminal to be poor is against human rights.<p>-----<p>ECHR 021 (2021)<p>19.01.2021<p>(Judgment Lacatus v. Switzerland)<p>The penalty imposed on the applicant for begging in public breached the Convention<p>In today’s Chamber judgment 1 in the case of Lăcătuşv.  Switzerland  (application  no. 14065&#x2F;15)  the European Court of Human Rights held, unanimously, that there had been:<p>a   violation of Article 8   (right to respect for private and family life)of the European Convention on Human Rights.<p>The case concerned an order for the applicant to pay a   fine of 500 Swiss francs (CHF) (approximately 464 euros (EUR)) for begging in public in Geneva, and her detention in a   remand prison for five days for failure to pay the fine.<p>The Court observed that the applicant, who was illiterate and came from an extremely poor family, had no work and was not in receipt of social benefits. Begging constituted a means of survival for her. Being in a   clearly vulnerable situation, the applicant had had the right, inherent in human dignity, to be able to convey her plight and attempt to meet her basic needs by begging.<p>The Court considered that the penalty imposed on the applicant had not been proportionate either to the aim of combating organised crime or to the aim of protecting the rights of passers-by, residents and shopkeepers.<p>The  Court did  not subscribe to the Federal Court’s argument that less restrictive measures would not have achieved a   comparable result.In the Court’s view, the penalty imposed had infringed the applicant’s human dignity and impaired the very essence of  the  rights  protected  by Article 8 of the  Convention,  and the State had thus overstepped its margin of appreciation in the present case.')
