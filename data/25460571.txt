If something&#x27;s not working, I have exactly only one OS to worry about fixing.<p>Now, not only is my configuration and maintenance simpler but everything runs faster because all my operating systems are running on dedicated hardware.<p>And before anyone says &quot;it&#x27;s too expensive&quot;, it&#x27;s really not terribly expensive because I get refurbed machines like this [0]. If I want a laptop I get something like this [1] and it runs Linux (or Windows of course) just fine.<p>The only expensive machine I ever buy is a Macbook, but even those I&#x27;ll buy refurbished. The last Macbook Pro I bought is from mid-2015 and I got it for only $1049 (in 2017) with 6 months of AppleCare+ still attached to it, which got me a new battery for free from Apple.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;HP-EliteDesk-i7-4770-3-40Ghz-Renewed&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07TZKYXW6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;HP-EliteDesk-i7-4770-3-40Ghz-Renewed&#x2F;...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Acer-A515-55G-57H8-Display-i5-1035G1-Keyboard&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B087RSXFSG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Acer-A515-55G-57H8-Display-i5-1035G1-...</a>')
