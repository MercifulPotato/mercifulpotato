VS is only 32 bit, There&#x27;s only so much process space it gets (2GB or 3GB, can&#x27;t recall offhand) at which point it&#x27;s gotta swap whether it wants to or not. Rider is 64 bit, so it will be less afraid to allocate if it makes sense on the hardware (and the JVM tuning deities.)<p>- You can load multiple solutions in Rider with much less penalty than you&#x27;d expect. Rider normally runs as a single Main process with Resharper&#x2F;.Net&#x2F;etc hosts for each open solution. This seems to give me lower memory usage than Visual Studio.<p>- With Akka.NET (53 projects, C# and F#) and Akka.Persistence.Linq2Db (6 projects) open, Rider sits at 1598MB nominally, goes between 1.2GB and 2GB, the Resharper subprocesses (already included in those totals) sit between 300-800MB and 60-200MB.<p>- Visual Studio 2019 with Resharper and Intellicode -DISABLED- shows up as 1363MB for Akka.Net, 653MB for Akka.Persistence.Linq2db, for a total of 2016MB.<p>Side note, Rider has been open for days with me doing all sorts of nasty things like switching between branches without unloading (Oh yeah, come for the lower memory usage, stay for the hot-reloading.) Those VS numbers were right after I opened, by comparison.')
