Someone must be incentivised to clear that living room between his lounging and the business meetings.\n- Who decides what stuff you get to use? Oh there&#x27;s no shopping huh. Great. Everything you rent is just perfect for you? Well who makes sure of that? The AI? So your will is what? A calculation?\n- The fallacious idea of &quot;Privacy is not a necessary cause I&#x27;m not doing anything wrong&quot; except that everyone is, all the time. No system of rules has ever had enough gray areas, and most of the victims of invaded privacy are normal people not doing anything extreme.<p>I realise this is an article meant as a talking point start. I just find this style of typical communist&#x2F;rousseau utopia very tiresome. It&#x27;s so incredibly dehumanised and boring.<p>Sorry for the rant.')
