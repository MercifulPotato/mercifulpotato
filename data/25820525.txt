LZ77 is quite primitive and not very efficient. However, nearly everyone today uses an algorithm that is descended from LZ77, so &quot;LZ77&quot; is just a sort of shorthand for &quot;any algorithm descended from LZ77&quot;. LZMA and Zip&#x27;s deflate are both examples of LZ77 descendants.<p>(To be even more pedantic, all modern algorithms are descendants of LZSS, which was one of the first improvements on LZ77.)<p>Out of the ones you listed, only .Z and .bz2 are not LZ77-LZSS descendants.<p>.Z is an implementation of LZW, which is a descendant of LZ78, which is a significantly different (but still related) algorithm to LZ77. It never really caught on beyond a few implementations of LZW, though.<p>.bz2 is the only one completely unrelated to Ziv&#x27;s work. It uses the Burrows-Wheeler transform, instead.')
