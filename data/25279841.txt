Give money to isolate them if they don&#x27;t live in their own homes. Provide grocery delivery services. Let them make the choice. There are some old people who are 70 and say &quot;I want to live my life&quot; and so let them go out and do whatever and assume the risk themselves.<p>We can provide support specifically to those at risk, while also respecting the liberty and freedom of everyone else. Someone with an autoimmune disease or who is 65 can choose not to go to a pub and simply not interact with the rest of the world using technology. At the same time, the pub owner should be allowed to make a damn living.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why this is so complicated.')
