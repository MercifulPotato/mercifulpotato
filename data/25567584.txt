But are we really trying as hard as we should be? Companies have influenced the public and even health research to be in favor of sugar. I&#x27;m pretty sure the rate of diabetes is going up and that doesn&#x27;t help. Companies contributing to global warming have influenced policies and discredited science they knew would harm their businesses.<p>There are plenty of smart people doing what they think is best for us, but then there is also greed that hinders us. Sure some of us are trying, but not even close to as much as we should be. The money just isn&#x27;t there.')
