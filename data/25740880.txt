The courts get involved and decide whether that&#x27;s allowed. If the Federal government doesn&#x27;t like what the courts say, they can use more strongly worded laws so the courts have to agree. We make the last bit difficult so that we don&#x27;t do it frivolously. It cuts down on overreach, but it also means bad actors tend to get to play a bit longer at the expense of everybody else.<p>If individuals or corporations are the last word in reasonable political discourse, we will have failed. Not so spectacularly as if we never do anything until Congress says so, but failed nonetheless.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying this should be the end of this. But someone has to get the wheels of government rolling, and this is fairly typical, if not ideal.')
