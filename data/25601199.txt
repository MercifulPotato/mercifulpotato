I spun up a free-tier account and created an empty issue. This is the best-case scenario for performance: A tiny amount of data, no complex permissions, a commonly used form, high-performance client link, same region as the Atlassian PaaS server, etc...<p>At least here, most of the traffic is coming from a CDN that enables compression, IPv6, HTTP&#x2F;2, AES-GCM, and TLS 1.3. That&#x27;s the basics taken care of.<p>Despite this, reloading the page with a <i>warm cache</i> took a whopping 5.5 seconds. There&#x27;s an animated <i>progress bar</i> for the empty form!<p>This required 1.2MB of uncacheable content to be transferred.<p>With the cache off, a total of 27.5 MB across 151 files taking 33 seconds is required!<p>The total text displayed on the screen is less than 1 KB.<p>The page took 4.35 seconds of CPU time on a gaming desktop PC with a 3.80 GHz CPU and a gigabit fibre Internet connection.<p>A developer on an ultraportable laptop running on battery over a WiFi link with a bad corporate proxy server in a different geo-region would likely get a <i>much</i> worse experience. Typically they might get as little as 1.5 GHz and 20 Mbps effective bandwidth, so I can see why people are complaining that Jira page loads are taking 10+ seconds!<p>Is no one responsible for performance at Atlassian?')
