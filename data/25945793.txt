Mostly nowadays a similar effect is created via variable assist. Human interface-wise, nonlinear controls are REALLY not a great idea without specific training.<p>If you look at airplanes, where pilots are type rated, you have a lot more controls mixing with electronic flight controls and various regimes. The yoke&#x2F;stick might control pitch at one point, angle of attack at another, altitude in another, and control surface deflection in another...or more realistically a mix of all of the above. Multiply by 6 dimensions of control.<p>I think about my mother. Recently we rented a Subaru Outback. I was comfortable with the minor force&#x2F;lane centering control actions it took while on cruise control. She on the other hand couldn&#x27;t handle it - it became a negative feedback loop. It woudl correct her into the cetner of the lane, and she responded to it as &#x27;the car pulling&#x27; and would over react and put us in the next lane. The car correcting itself was disconcerting and provoked a corresponding reaction that was programmed in her brain as &#x27;correct&#x27; because the heuristic was &#x27;force through the wheel = something wrong&#x27;.<p>The issue here isn&#x27;t whether the car does something good or bad, it is whether it does something that the average driver reacts to in a safe an appropriate way. That comes from meeting their preconceptions as to how steering behaves, unless Tesla wants to argue for type-certing their owners.')
