Item(by='georgewsinger', descendants=None, kids=[25409435, 25408818], score=None, time=1607882596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406541, text='I recently discovered a Linux debugger &amp; tool which allowed me to solve problems 10x faster than gdb: pernos.co (which is layered over Mozilla&#x27;s rr time-tracking debugger).<p>Pernosco&#x27;s tool is described pretty well on their website (which is full of minimal fluff and marketing -- another good sign).  But basically it allows you to view a program inside and out, forwards &#x2F;and&#x2F; backwards, with <i>zero replay lag</i>. Everything from stack traces to variable displays (at any point in time in your code execution) is extremely easy to view and understand.  The best part is the lightning fast search functionality (again: zero lag).<p>On top of this: extraordinary customer service if anything breaks (in my experience, they fix bugs within 24 hours and are highly communicative).<p>I&#x27;m not a paid Pernosco shill.  I&#x27;m just so blown away by this product that I wanted to word-of-mouth spread it around because it&#x27;s saved so much time for me.')
