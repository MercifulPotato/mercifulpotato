They could just maintain the software the way they&#x27;ve always done before.<p>Consider what the advantages to Flatpak really are.<p>1. Anyone can publish them (low standard of inclusion, which I hope isn&#x27;t Ubuntu&#x27;s goal)<p>2. You can easily distribute closed-source software with the exact dependencies they were compiled for (which Ubuntu can&#x27;t change unless they have access to the source code and its maintainers are willing to provide that charity to closed source software shops)<p>3. You can easily install the software on any system with a recent enough kernel (Ubuntu being the sole provider wouldn&#x27;t change that)')
