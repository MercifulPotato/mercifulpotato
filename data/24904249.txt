This data is easily accessible.<p>&gt; And if $400k is too much for a house, how do you make Seattle work?<p>If I’m going to have to spend this much to make Kalamazoo work I’m going to be seriously second guessing why I moved there in the first place. If I lose my remote job at the startup I worked at and suddenly am looking at making 60k a year as a windows Sysadmin at western Michigan university or Pfizer (if I’m lucky!) that house isn’t going to seem very cheap- even if my house is only 200k a year. In fact it’s going to start to seem really fucking expensive once you consider the tax implications.<p>And yes there are cheaper neighborhoods to live in Kalamazoo. They don’t really inspire you much to want to stay there- that is unless you like guns and meth.<p>I can afford more than 400k in Kalamazoo but that’s not the point. The point is that if I’m going to chose to spend every waking hour living somewhere; I’m going to choose a place that doesnt make me miserable.')
