The issue is that we have just started developing an understanding of the field, so our usual understanding of those concepts have to be developed from scratch. As you mentioned, the forces become large enough, and some variables can&#x27;t just be ignored. But in my experience (working with microscale perfusion reactor arrays), they actually deliver much more and reliably compared to a conventional system.')
