Had test of about 250 (one of the labs I done in search of getting motivation back). Doc put me on trt. In 4 month we dialed it to about 900-1000 stable. Had no noticable improvements in any areas (except morning wood like I am teenager again). Later there were some side effects and I discontinued it. Again, no noticable differences.<p>For what it is worth, it appears that my body seems to need just that much of test.')
