In production, when you have a registry etc, it won&#x27;t matter, but for people doing local development with k3s or minikube or such, there are some cases it could break things.<p>The main difference is that if you &#x27;docker build&#x27; or &#x27;docker load&#x27; an image on a node, with docker as a runtime a pod could be started using that image, but if containerd is the runtime it would have had to be &#x27;ctr image import&#x27;ed instead.<p>I know that minikube, at some point, suggested people use &#x27;DOCKER_HOST=..&#x27; + &#x27;docker build&#x27; to make images available to that minikube node, which this would cause to not work.<p>It would be nice if k8s had its own container image store so you could &#x27;kubectl image load&#x27; in a runtime agnostic way, but unfortunately managing the fetching of container images has ended up as something the runtime does, and k8s has no awareness of above the runtime.')
