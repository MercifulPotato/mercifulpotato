He was there with the bunch of old C (not C++) code which was already written according to different rules, and was to develop a new language for which he was to write the rules (with other such developers). Additionally, he was involved not only in developing that C code, but in initial development of very C language! Under all these circumstances, he apparently couldn&#x27;t check in the code, for not passing some &quot;test.&quot;<p>Your failure to even recognize all that (instead mentioning  &quot;C++&quot; and &quot;certification&quot; which is not the same) and to address the fact that these circumstances completely differ from your own much more narrow experience with established practices when checking in C++ code for which the bureaucratic rules already existed simply doesn&#x27;t tell me that you can be believed regarding organization&#x27;s capability to not react bureaucratically. Which is what Thompson apparently said and I still find, as I explain, very believable.<p>That is how I searched in the responses for any claim which would directly support your opinion, and still haven&#x27;t found it.<p>I have no problem to admit I was wrong, but I&#x27;d really like to see some direct proof. Like somebody investigating what actually happened there and getting some first hand account. Not the talk about &quot;C++&quot; and existing rules for that (for which there is up to now a confirmation of strong enforcement, not tolerance).')
