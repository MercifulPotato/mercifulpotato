I&#x27;m looking to start using Rust in FW development but hit a couple pain points.<p>* First, bit field descriptors is a huge pain - where, in C, you would define an enum for the task, there isn&#x27;t a real equal in vanilla Rust, other than a litany of constant variables. \n* Second, the over-reliance on nightly is a tough sell for - having inline asm gated makes it very hard. \n* Third, while format is great, it&#x27;s also very heavyweight. Not having (AFAIK) variadic arguments is hard, and there isn&#x27;t really an equal to printf.<p>I would love to be proven wrong, because I have an OS to write, and would love to use Rust.')
