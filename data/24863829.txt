But what I really use the most nowadays is markdown for making notes during meetings etc, using a minimalist editor (Typora). I just wish it weren&#x27;t so complicated&#x2F;ugly to copy&#x2F;paste markdown to&#x2F;from other tools, like Outlook or Confluence.<p>I use only the basic and common syntactic elements (lists, headings, italics, links). IMHO the beauty of markdown is its simplicity, and trying to do complicated stuff like diagrams and tables is best left to other tools. (Another problem with the more ambitious uses is that they tend to not be standardized across markdown implementations.)')
