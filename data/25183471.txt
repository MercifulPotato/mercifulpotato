If the tip share is not enough to bring their wage up to minimum ($7.25&#x2F;hr in most cases), the employer must pay the difference.  Tip share is almost never enough to make up the difference, so they earn minimum wage regardless of whether they&#x27;re part of the &quot;tip share&quot;.  The waitstaff earns <i>less</i> with a &quot;tip share&quot; because their tips get deducted from in order to pay the other employees&#x27; minimum wages.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: say you have a restaurant with 2 waiters, 2 cooks, and 1 host.  &quot;Tip wage&quot; is $4&#x2F;hr and minimum wage is $7.25&#x2F;hr.  The waiters each bring in $7.50&#x2F;hr in tips ($15&#x2F;hr combined).<p>Without tip share, waiters get $11.50&#x2F;hr ($4&#x2F;hr wage + $7.50&#x2F;hr tips) while the cooks and host get $7.25&#x2F;hr.<p>With tip share, everyone gets $7.25&#x2F;hr ($4&#x2F;hr tip wage + $3&#x2F;hr tips + $0.25&#x2F;hr difference from the employer).<p>It&#x27;s just a scheme to fund wages for cooks and hosts using tips from the waitstaff.')
