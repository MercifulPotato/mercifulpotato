How much do they get to lose? If they don&#x27;t get accepted to the YC, they lose very little and it&#x27;s just a short detour in their lives, certainly not the most boring or frustrating one, something to remember. If they get accepted to the YC, they clearly win vs the average folk because they get to know so many influential people and see how the world-class stuff gets done.<p>For example, i&#x27;ve been doing custom development for more than 20 years, made several million in the process, built over 130 project and i still don&#x27;t have a slightest idea of how it&#x27;s done - because every single of my client&#x27;s projects failed - and i would be more than delighted to see how projects succeed first-hand even if the project wasn&#x27;t mine.')
