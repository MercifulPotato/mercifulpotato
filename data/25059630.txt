I just realized that I do subscribe to the local independent business news journal (it&#x27;s about $90&#x2F;yr). What is interesting is that it contains little in the way of click-bait and &quot;made ya look&quot; content compared to the local newspaper and TV station sites. They do cover &quot;real&quot; non-business news, and when they do cover the same news as the other local news outlets, the quality of coverage is better (and feels less editorialized). Still no cure for reader comments, though.')
