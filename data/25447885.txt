Gold is rare <i>and</i> has physical applications which is why it&#x27;s valuable.  We can&#x27;t magically create more gold.<p>Now you are going to say bitcoin is fixed as well.  Fine, but it has basically no use case.  Also, it can be replicated a billion times over with any other cryptocurrency. So I would even say it&#x27;s debatable to call it &#x27;rare&#x27; or &#x27;fixed&#x27;, even though I know what you mean.<p>The amount of gold which has been mined in the entire human history is about a 20m cube.  That&#x27;s it.  Gold is used in very useful in many industries around the world and is visually appealing.  THAT is why it has value.<p>If Gold was &quot;rare&quot; but looked like garbage and had no physical application then it would NOT be valuable.  I don&#x27;t get how you are trying to make this argument.')
