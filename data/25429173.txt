Item(by='chriswarbo', descendants=None, kids=[25434066], score=None, time=1608030764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25428724, text='&gt; This is what happens when you get incompetent non technical people to regulate on things.<p>I think GDPR, and the so-called &quot;cookie law&quot; before it, was done pretty competently. The principles are pretty clear: data policies&#x2F;controllers&#x2F;etc. have to be explicit and limited; personal data collection requires consent of the people involved; opting into a service implies consent for data required by that service (e.g. cookies for shopping carts, local storage for highscores, etc.); if consent isn&#x27;t implied, it must be requested explicitly.<p>Explicit consent is a last resort, and only required when collecting personal data which (a) isn&#x27;t directly required to provide a service or (b) comes from people who aren&#x27;t users of your service (i.e. who haven&#x27;t opted in). Advertising is a good example, since the &quot;users&quot; of an ad network (those opting to use it) are the people buying and selling ad space; people <i>viewing</i> those ads aren&#x27;t users (they haven&#x27;t opted in); and advertising isn&#x27;t required to provide a service (e.g. a news site; it might be <i>indirectly</i> required, for raising revenue, but the site would work just the same with any revenue source).<p>The fact you&#x27;re tired of popups shows that GDPR <i>is working</i>; the extent of data collection, surveillance, etc. has been brought to the surface. Your anger is misdirected though: it&#x27;s not GDPR&#x27;s fault that so many surveillance organisations are trying to track and target you; quite the opposite!<p>&gt; make it easy to accept everything in one click<p>&gt; Is this freedom?<p>Do you think it would be &quot;freedom&quot; to waive all of your waivable rights, to anyone and everyone who asks, <i>without even knowing they asked</i>? That&#x27;s what an automated banner-clicker would be doing, since consent popups are not restricted to talking about cookies (just like GDPR isn&#x27;t about cookies); they can ask for pretty much anything. In fact, I imagine many of them ask for more than they&#x27;re legally allowed (this happens all the time, e.g. many privacy policies do this, many &quot;warranty void if removed&quot; stickers are not legally enforcable, etc.).<p>If you&#x27;d instead rather tell your browser to accept certain pre-selected terms which you&#x27;re comfortable with, then you&#x27;re in luck! There&#x27;s a standard for that called P3P <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;P3P" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;P3P</a> It&#x27;s not supported by Chrome, but you can enable it in Firefox, as long as you&#x27;re using version 2 (it was removed in Firefox 3). Then you just need to convince every Web site you visit to implement it. Good luck!')
