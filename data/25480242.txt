But there is a degree of incompleteness or artifice I am comfortable with if there are other elements that work. Same goes with actual role playing games. When I play this game I have to wonder what is artifice? what is incomplete? and what is a concession for performance that has gone awry? In 2077 I feel all of these each session, which is unusual.<p>But with me: Immersion breaking issues such as cars on tracks, don&#x27;t bother me. Following the narrative (though far from perfect) was a source of &quot;fun&quot; and being &quot;acceptable&quot; for me. I would be wishing all of these elements were strengthened, over the massive effort put into of an open world that doesn&#x27;t really provide. I&#x27;m going to be won over by these arcs, and core gameplay and not point to point hijinks and antics. I don&#x27;t feel 2077 ever lied in there, or at least the experience I wanted.<p>For a while in games they don&#x27;t have to be real cars, but I want them to &quot;feel&quot; like real cars. So we get a complete games in a year where the AI to work beyond the paths, and now what is involved? It will be more immersive for sure, but how much longer till it is complete? For some playing the game, squinting at the 3D models now rendered as car sprites in the distance is enough.')
