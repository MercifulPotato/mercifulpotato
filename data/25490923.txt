Just removing unused &quot;return&quot; statements gave me 3x speed increase. Apparently Borland C&#x2F;C++ wasn&#x27;t very smart back then.<p>A fun project I did after that was writing a AI frame language to do goal-stack problem solving, specifically with path finding. I connected it to the ray tracer and made movies of spheres having wars. (I used an unlicensed DivX encoder to stitch together thousands of GIFs.)')
