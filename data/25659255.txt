Not everybody finds sitting on leetcode 3 hours a day a fun task. I&#x27;m one of those people. It&#x27;s absolutely mind numbing.<p>A few hundred coding challenges is months and months of preparation if you&#x27;re actually trying to internalize everything very well. Kudos to those who can do it and have the willpower to, but I can&#x27;t seem to get past 3 weeks tops before my body starts physically rejecting these problems.<p>It also seems to skew towards recent grads and single people that can spend all of that time on these problems.')
