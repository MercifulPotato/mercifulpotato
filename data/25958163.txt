I want online platforms to have the power to moderate.  However, Facebook in particular has an awful moderation process.  Their knee-jerk reactions are a consequence of a platform with a ton of power and no incentive to wield it responsibly.<p>The rest of this is copy-paste from a previous post I made, explaining why I don&#x27;t want full freedom of speech on social media:<p>Take a look at HN. HN mods do a brilliant job of moderating. We don&#x27;t have 100% free speech here and the platform is better for it. The discussions here tend to be much higher quality than on similar platforms like Reddit. That&#x27;s probably a big reason why you&#x27;re here reading this comment thread.<p>However... I&#x27;ve noticed a difference between HN and the likes of Facebook or Twitter. As far as I can tell, HN mods focus more on how you say something rather than what you say. If you&#x27;re civil, respectful, and on-topic you&#x27;re seemingly allowed to present just about any idea.<p>Meanwhile, most other social media platforms seem content to let other people be complete pricks to each other as long as they don&#x27;t present any ideas which the platform have decided are wrong or &quot;dangerous&quot;.<p>I think the HN moderation strategy makes for a much better platform. I&#x27;d rather talk with a respectful person who I disagree with than a jerk with whom I agree.')
