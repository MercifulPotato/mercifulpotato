Using a different CPU architecture is always exciting. :)<p>Using Mac is like driving an Audi S8. Comfortable, smooth, powerful. However, it&#x27;s not your hand tuned Impreza which can read your mind while going above 200Km&#x2F;h.<p>Even an Intel MacBook pro can go a long time on battery (I have a personal Mid2014, configured all-out). I&#x27;ve developed some system-abusing scientific code on it and, it really delivers.<p>The trick for me is, I can make a Mac dev machine without modifying it with homebrew, et. al. I install a Linux VM to VMWare, give it a static IP, install all required tools, servers and services on it. On the macOS side, I use Eclipse for IDE and use clang&#x2F;llvm for compiling (since I also aim to code which behaves same on both gcc and llvm).<p>I develop on macOS and interface it with Linux VM via network if it&#x27;s absolutely necessary. Linux VM also hosts some heavy tooling like LaTeX which cannot be installed&#x2F;updated on macOS very cleanly (I know macTeX. It doesn&#x27;t play nice with newer macOS, due to Apple&#x27;s locks on the OS).<p>Then everything becomes transparent for me. Pull -&gt; Develop -&gt; Push in either direction. Eclipse already syncs itself via oomph and cloud. Code is portable, environment is same. It also ensures code compatibility, allows me to see compiler effects and run tests on many platforms.<p>As aforementioned, it also inspires me to write better software. My code carries Apple&#x27;s sensible defaults  and it-works mentality with Linux&#x27;s flexibility options. This approach allowed me to create a series of utilities for a project in limbo. These small no-setup utilities saved a lot of labor and ultimately saved the project. So yes, apple is a walled garden and it&#x27;s not optimal but, they do a lot of right things. We can selectively carry them to more open platforms to make them better. Similarly, open platforms&#x27; flexibility can be carried to some macOS applications so, the environment better accommodates power users out of the box.<p>Homebrew and other tools are nice but, I don&#x27;t like to shoehorn stuff which doesn&#x27;t fit natively into an ecosystem.')
