The growth of EV means that will continue. Peaker plants are already being replaced with batteries.<p><i>&gt; Pumped storage is a dead-end solution because we have simply run out of places for effective hydro</i><p>Nope. There is large pumped storage being built in Scotland right now and there are hundreds more glens where it would be feasible.<p><i>&gt;There is no level of investment that can magic away the storage problems of current renewables</i><p>Just as one example that may well magic away these problems, grid attached storage in the form of electric cars and home storage is growing massively right now. It may be we rethink entirely our centralised approach to production and storage.<p>Fission is expensive, centralised and carries heavy decommissioning costs and extreme tail risks. Fusion may someday give renewables a worthy rival but till then the falling prices mean nuclear has had its day.')
