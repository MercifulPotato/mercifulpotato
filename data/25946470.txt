Usually it&#x27;s years later in the unwinding of some shady hedge fund or corrupt sovereign wealth fund or pump&amp;dump operation.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s not a boiler room in New Jersey or a Malaysian government insider manipulating the market, it&#x27;s a bunch of different people on twitter and reddit. It seems perfectly reasonable that the brokerage firms who are complicit in this have legitimate fears that the SEC will come after them later, and so are trying to limit the risk that they&#x27;re deemed culpable.')
