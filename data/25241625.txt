Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606607450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25241394, text='TCP packets contain sequence numbers that must correspond to the ones sent by the other side. This is an issue if you&#x27;re spoofing packets because you don&#x27;t receive packets (containing the sequence numbers) from the other side (they will go to the spoofed address, rather than yours). Without the other side&#x27;s sequence numbers, your replies will be considered invalid, which means you can&#x27;t complete the handshake[1] to establish a connection. However, if you can successfully guess the sequence numbers, you can complete the handshake and also write arbitrary data to the stream. You still won&#x27;t be able to receive data, but for simple protocols like irc, it can still be useful eg. connecting to a server and then sending spam to an user&#x2F;channel.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Transmission_Control_Protocol#...</a>')
