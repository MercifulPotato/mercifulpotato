Item(by='csomar', descendants=None, kids=[25346272, 25346931], score=None, time=1607440560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344762, text='My AirPods died recently. At $159 and 2 years of aggressive usage (probably 3-4 hours every average day), I think they paid nicely for their price. That should average for around $0.06&#x2F;hour. If these have the same lifespan, they should average to $0.2&#x2F;hour. A bit steep for me to &quot;just buy it&quot; or not consider other brands. But I&#x27;ll wait for the reviews, it might be a good deal.<p>Interestingly, I can&#x27;t find any information on how much the batteries could last. This is basically the lifetime of your AirPods Max since (I guess) you won&#x27;t be able to change the batteries.<p>+: also, these doesn&#x27;t replace the AirPods but complement them. So it&#x27;s more like $250+550 now.')
