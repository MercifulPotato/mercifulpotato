Having said that, I have dipped my toe into things by tackling things I can fully control and maintain.  I also make sure it is simple to bypass as not everyone who lives with me is interested in learning or troubleshooting issues with something like a light fixture or thermostat.<p>Cloud is absolutely out for privacy reasons and for the simple fact that no device should be dependent on my ISP functioning.  So I keep the smart stuff to things like lamps or shades.  All things that are easy to maintain and are not required to function to enjoy the home.  Shades are on Z-Wave Plus and I have just 4 shades that are motorized and it&#x27;s not easy to maintain.  The only other thing I use is Tasmota on some cheap plugs for lamps and holiday lights.  All of these devices are controlled by a web panel built on a NAS that has an easy to remember local lan address.  Control via cellphone is easy so long as you are on the lan.<p>I just haven&#x27;t been totally sold on the idea that the convenience offered by IoT devices that are locked in or require cloud services outweighs the maintenance and hassle over the long haul.')
