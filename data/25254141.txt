I could sell my equity and &quot;semi-retire&quot; 30+ years early, working when&#x2F;if I feel like it and not eat really into my savings<p>It wasn&#x27;t some grand plan to join a company that would do well during a pandemic, but I <i>did</i> intentionally choose a public company since saying in the tech sector has exploded would be an understatement, and I wanted equity in that.<p>I&#x27;m guessing a lot of people who joined FAANG companies in the last few years are all probably sitting on enough to start thinking about that.<p>There are those who feel this is a bubble and not sustainable... maybe? But the way I see it is, even if this is the bubble before the next dot com era-style bust, it&#x27;s better to have a position in it provided by my work and cashing out along the way, than not and end up losing my job anyways.')
