Its use cases include debug builds of Rust code, JIT-ing WebAssembly (which is pre-optimized), etc.<p>So I would expect it to have very little overlap with deep learning. No high-level optimizations to do with matrices or dataflow or scheduling; currently no GPU backends; no integration with MLIR (though that one seems completely doable if someone put in the effort).')
