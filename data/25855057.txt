We have a system that is a mix of a structurally HDB-like provincial system, municipal housing systems, private construction, private&#x2F;public cooperation, and rent control.<p>If your issue is that public housing is run by racist people, the solution is to have it run by non-racist people. This tends to be easier when people that live in public housing are more diverse and have a larger electoral impact.<p>The way that we handle the downsides of rent control is by allowing landlords to break the rent-control cycle by doing major renovations, and by making rental contracts basically all end at the same date which allows for a much lower friction in moving.<p>While the author may very well want it, unless they make it their #1 priority, they won&#x27;t actually implement it as there is much more resistance against public housing than to anything else. The end result will be that the &quot;compromise&quot; will be no new public housing and simply zoning relaxations at most, with continued increase in rents.')
