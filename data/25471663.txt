However when &quot;scaling&quot; means building global logistics infrastructure, including factories for batteries and factories for cars, it&#x27;s a lot harder to get the drop on the incumbents.<p>I think the GP&#x27;s comment is spot on though, if Tesla fails to win this race, they will still have been the driving force in bringing EV adoption forward by 5-10 years (perhaps more), which is an incredible achievement.')
