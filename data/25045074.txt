We are there to:<p>1. Undermine the &quot;Shia crescent&quot;. The US doesn&#x27;t want the Iranians to have an unrestricted land corridor that extends from Tehran to Beirut. It is considered a security threat to Israel and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the key to OPEC, and OPEC supports US Petrodollar dominance.<p>2. Restrict Chinese OBOR expansion. The lack of stability makes the region unviable for Chinese infrastructure building. This degrades China&#x27;s ability to pivot away from their Sea Lines of Communication, which are currently a major economic weakness.')
