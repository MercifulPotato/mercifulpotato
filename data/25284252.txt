They essentially slapped new engines on it and made tiny adjustments. Boom, fuel savings.<p>Boeing wanted to do the same. Their design didn&#x27;t accommodate the bigger, more efficient engines they wanted. So they created a workaround.<p>Redesigning essentially means creating an entirely new aircraft, even if it looks similar. Requires a new type certification, which is a very lengthy process in itself. Requires pilot training for the new type rating. Possibly new simulators, and simulator time. Not all airlines even own simulators.<p>Airlines like Southwest use all 737s exactly because that makes pilots interchangeable(simplifies logistics and maintenance too, but mostly it&#x27;s about pilots).<p>If I&#x27;m an airline and now you tell me my pilots need training, including expensive simulators, it&#x27;s no longer the same aircraft(as in, not the same type rating). If it is not the same aircraft, that means I could choose any other aircraft. Such as these new Airbus models I&#x27;ve been hearing about...<p>See the problem? MCAS wasn&#x27;t such a bad solution on paper, it&#x27;s just that the implementation sucked. It should have required some minimal training (which is much better than a new type rating) but Boeing didn&#x27;t even want that.')
