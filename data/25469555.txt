In fact our ridiculous anti-drug stance has no doubt delayed or prevented the development of these things.  I would imagine we would have some pretty good options if a legitimate pharmaceutical company could do this.  Recreational, non addictive (or minimally addictive) options would be available.<p>Instead our harsh prohibition and penalties means the R&amp;D are from drug cartels who want the most addictive&#x2F;powerful product possible.  I read a book called &quot;Narconomics&quot; which discusses how bad the Heroin has gotten because of this.')
