I&#x27;d happy give it away for free and pay the associated increase in web service costs just so others can enjoy it.  But the thought of paying $100&#x2F;year (and having to deal with App Store review) is a bit much for a hobby app...<p>I&#x27;m surprised Apple put this barrier up since it certainly would have scared me away from iOS development as a poorer&#x2F;newer developer.  I guess Apple&#x27;s happy with amateurs building but doesn&#x27;t want to deal with their apps in the store.  Maybe a compromise would be letting people self-distribute free apps without paying the $100?')
