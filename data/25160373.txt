However the real issue is that any blocks written while dedup was enabled will demand this dedup overhead, even if the dedup option is turned off. That is, it&#x27;s a &quot;sticky feature&quot;.<p>So if you use dedup, notice performance tanks because dedup tables are too big, well you&#x27;re screwed because turning it off won&#x27;t give you back the performance. Only way to recover is to send&#x2F;receive the whole shebang to a separate pool.<p>In addition, they don&#x27;t actually bring that much space saving on common workloads. Most people don&#x27;t have a lot of truly identical blocks of data.')
