If anything, it&#x27;s the opposite. For example, David Pakman, Youtube political pundit and liberal grifter, joined Parler (I think just because Parler&#x27;s CEO offered $20k to the first progressive with &gt;50k twitter followers to signup) and he received very kind comments from people who largely dislike his politics.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parler.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;dpakman&#x2F;posts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parler.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;dpakman&#x2F;posts</a><p>Naturally, despite the warm welcome, Pakman never used the site. Because like most leftists, he&#x27;s not interested in freedom of speech or reaching out to new audiences. He knows who his audience is, which are fringe leftists who hate anything like Parler, so he knows he has nothing to gain by using it.')
