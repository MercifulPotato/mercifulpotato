Item(by='shakna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611478188, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884047, text='&gt; The court documents said that those items and the explosive-filled mason jars &quot;in close proximity to one another constitute a combination of parts&quot; that could be used as a &quot;destructive device.&quot;<p>I used &quot;explosive&quot; because that was how it appeared in the court filings. Without knowing the precise mixture, it could result as either something to cause a conflagration, or a detonation.<p>Calling it misinformation is somewhat disingenuous when not all the information is publicly available.')
