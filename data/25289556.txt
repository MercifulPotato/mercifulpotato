Luckily, I did not need to make it compatible with other base64 encoders&#x2F;decoders because, as the article points out...<p>&gt; Base64 has eleven encoding variations that lead to confusion among developers on which variety of Base64 to use.<p>Each variation has its own niche (URL safe characters, filename safe characters, checksum support, etc).  I see Base58 as basically just another variation of Base64 with its own niche (human friendly characters).<p>There&#x27;s no need for existing apps to &quot;convert&quot;.  If their current Base64 implementation is good enough, they&#x27;ll stick with it.  Base58 is just another variation to consider when developing something new.')
