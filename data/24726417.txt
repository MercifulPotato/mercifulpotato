Older map systems used to make some very questionable assumptions that made them quite inaccurate (one example; assume all highway miles are equal; some were 55MPH and  have traffic lights, railroad crossings and stop-signs others were 65 with no at-grade intersections -- today even higher speed limits are seen as the lingering effects of the national speed-limit have worn off).')
