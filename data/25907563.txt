My biggest concern is that it tends to take 4-6 weeks to get comfortable with posture and just sitting on the machine for extended periods (the unfortunate challenge of the machine engaging so many muscles). For novices, this valley of death is where so many give up. For example, coming back in the fall always started with awkwardly slow pieces to get the “feel” again. Figure out how to make this fun, and I am a believer you can spread the sport!')
