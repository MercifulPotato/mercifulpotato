Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=[25023330], score=None, time=1604811882, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25022486, text='Thank you for admitting that you are vilifying Trump supporters online in a thread about nuance for beliefs you have ascribed to them without talking to one of them.<p>&gt; Anyhow, thanks for the answer. Got it; ‘murder’ of unborn theoretical children is worse than separating and losing track of actual real objectively alive, conscious, and suffering children.<p>The intent here was to provide an example of a thought process; not to speak for all, or even the average, Trump supporter.<p>&gt; (Only as long as they’re brown, presumably? You don’t actually say that, but I assume that’s the intent?)<p>Why would this be my intent or even &#x27;the&#x27; intent? In this case it doesn&#x27;t even make sense. Non-whites have, by far, more abortions in the United States than whites. So ending abortion would &#x27;save&#x27; a lot more non-white babies than white babies.<p>People are also allowed to be against both these things, but they aren&#x27;t allowed to vote that way (at least if they believe voting for a third party throws their vote away). To play devil&#x27;s advocate, there are far more abortions than there are immigrant children separated from parents; so a voter against both of these might reasonably conclude they&#x27;re doing more good voting for Trump than for a pro-choice Democrat.<p>&gt; And also, simply voting for a Democrat is worse, too. Got it.<p>Democrats are overwhelmingly pro-choice, so yes, if someone is pro-life and motivated by the single issue of abortion voting for a Democrat may very well be worse. You seem to be incorrectly ascribing this particular belief to <i>me</i> when all I have said is there <i>are people</i> who hold this belief.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to keep those worse things in mind and not be at all insulted that you think I have a lot in common with that worldview.<p>What your worldview has in common with theirs is that it is a hard (read: non-nuanced) stance on a single issue. Just like you might think someone who could vote for Trump is vile because of the separation issue, a pro-lifer might think you are vile for thinking a pro-choice candidate is worthy of your (hypothetical) vote.')
