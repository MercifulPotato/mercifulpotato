They&#x27;d be shooting themselves in the other foot. But they would respond the way all superpowers do when direct, public intervention is not on the table. With subversion. If the NSA leaks have shown anything it&#x27;s that even allies were thoroughly compromised and one button press away from a series of &quot;unfortunate&quot; events.<p>What&#x27;s been recently dubbed &quot;asymmetric warfare&quot; has existed for decades. It&#x27;s simply deniable attacks, economic or actual warfare via proxies, etc. Covertly supporting certain political candidates while subverting others in order to destabilize a country is in any superpower&#x27;s playbook.<p>This is what the EU fears more than that it will suddenly have to face a Russian invasion without US support. For now it&#x27;s a deal out of which the US gets far more than the rest. They get to cement their superpower status by having the most important and credible allies, and in exchange offer some protection and the promise of not shooting said allies in the foot... maybe just whack them over the shin once in a while.<p>It&#x27;s also cheaper to let the US do its military thing and be a bodyguard, and that means the EU can focus on more important social issues. Maybe it&#x27;s a small price to pay, maybe not. Some future generation will have to answer that.')
