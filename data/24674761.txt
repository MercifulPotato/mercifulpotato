And you want it to rock, to be perfect, and you can’t sleep at night if there is a fucking heisenbug.</i><p>Not necessarily. For paid contributors (often among the most important ones in &quot;open source&quot; projects with corporate involvement) it can be just another job. And for casual open source creators, it can be just a small hobby, not some obsession with it being perfect. Heck, a big number of open source codebases are left to rot as soon as the dev moves to something more shiny...<p>So when he says &quot;if a user of your software is addressing you because some part of your code sucks, and is willing to work with you to do something about it, and is very demanding, don’t think they are abusing you because they are not paying you. It’s not about money. You can ignore bugs if you want, and ignore their complains, you can do that since you don’t have a contract to do otherwise, but they are helping you, they care about the same thing you care: your software quality, grandiosity, perfection.&quot; that might be true for Redis, or Sqlite etc, but not for all FOSS projects, including many otherwise succesful ones...')
