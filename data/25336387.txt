Power just isn&#x27;t that reliable, especially in a big, freezing winter storm. In California, add their notoriously unreliable grid to the calculation.<p>Also, for my house a winter&#x27;s worth of electrical heat costs about $1,700. Propane heating costs about $1,400. If I use my woodstove and buy the wood it costs about $600. If I cut my own wood it costs about $150 for fuel and maintenance. So forcing electrical heat also amounts to a large implicit tax.')
