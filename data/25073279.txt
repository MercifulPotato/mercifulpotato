What is this based on?<p>What to you is a fair comparison?<p>Presumably unsafe code is not allowed for C# and Go assembly not allowed for Go. Are there any other restrictions?  We could do a naive port of one of the Go benchmarks to C# and see how it goes, which one do you think is a good candidate?')
