Very easy to lock myself out permanently.<p>Yesterday I tried to help someone to login to Samsung Android tablet. There is Android Q feature that requires previous Gmail account and password, even after factory reset. Tried 3 gmail accounts of tablet owner. Login works on laptop, but not on tablet. Reply from Samsung was, there are no workarounds. So it&#x27;s not possible to login to tablet, and not possible to install any alternative operating system. So that tablet is expensive paperweight.')
