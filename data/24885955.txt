It just makes the RIAA&#x27;s case that much easier, makes YouTube-DL look bad. (A) and (B) above however are broader than that.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that the technological measure is <i>primarily</i> about restricting access to protected works. It only matters that it effectively does restrict that access.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t even matter if Youtub-DL is only used to access public domain videos, because their primary mode of operation would still be to circumvent the technological measure (assuming that measure restrict access to <i>all</i> works, not just the protected ones).<p>A &quot;new&quot; tool branded as a way to download public domain videos hosted on various web sites such as YouTube, (let&#x27;s call it &quot;Public Domain Tubes Archiver&quot;), would still infringe on (A) and (B) if downloading those public domain videos primarily involved going around a technological measure that happens to restrict access to (unrelated) protected works.')
