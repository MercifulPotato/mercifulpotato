But, even so, I&#x27;m not a very good typist. I don&#x27;t use all of my fingers. I use mostly my index and middle with a little of my ring finger, but never my little fingers. I wonder, if I want to improve my typing skills, should I force myself to slow down and develop proper technique using all of my fingers first?')
