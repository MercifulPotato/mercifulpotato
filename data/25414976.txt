In Apple&#x27;s case, it paid a significant amount of money for a prototype iPhone that it absolutely knew was stolen. In Thiel&#x27;s case, it outed a gay man that didn&#x27;t want to come out. The earlier act was illegal; both acts are immoral.<p>I have real problem with Apple&#x27;s cooperation with China, the total lack of documentation for developers, the faulty keyboards, the locking down of the App Store and total ban on sideloaded apps. I also have a big problem with the security stuff it builds in that can be (and most likely <i>is</i>) used for domestic spying. I want to run Linux on the M1 MacBook Pro. I think Scott Forstall should be brought back into the CEO role to replace Tim Cook. So don&#x27;t get me wrong, my position is not reflexively pro-Apple or pro-Cook here.<p>I&#x27;m just saying that Gawker is just about the <i>worst</i> possible example to use. Does their point even stand at all without Gawker?')
