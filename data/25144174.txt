We are in a CVOID19 world, which makes that a little more problematic.<p>Still,e the fact that unemployment is dropping and people have found new ways to make money, despite old jobs potentially disappearing forever, is actually a strength of capitalism.<p>Socialism say, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry we&#x27;ll take care of you. Here&#x27;s some welfare,&quot; and people become dependent on the State, and the State might give you some new job options to pick from.<p>FDR&#x27;s new deal gave people jobs that weren&#x27;t even necessary (Got into a building in TVA and look at the rows and floors of empty cubes; they had a secretary for each floor) and even though people knew that, there was still a sense of pride that at least they were working and trying to contribute. That aided more creatively, and more recovery.<p>COVID is the ultimate test of Capitalism for people to rise up within the new rules of this horrible system, a one where leaders are saying &quot;You literally cannot run your small store, but we&#x27;re going to let this massive chain keep working&quot; .. where they are literally removing your Capitalists freedoms, and the ones who will survive are the ones who say &quot;Fuck this .. I&#x27;m going to find a way to keep afloat .. time to get creative..&quot; and suddenly your store is selling masks and creating more fabric waste to fill our oceans more than ever!')
