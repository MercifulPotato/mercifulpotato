The thing with prison mentality is that people forget that most crimes don&#x27;t carry life sentences and that ex-cons eventually go back to the streets.<p>So the question becomes how do you reconcile the secretly dark desire to wipe undesirables off the face of the earth forever vs a legal system that says that people do have the right to live normal lives after they&#x27;ve paid their debts to society. There isn&#x27;t really a viable middle ground here. The current status quo is to just spend ungodly amounts of tax dollars deferring the dilemma to X years in the future. But when the time is up, either you wait for a relapse and go through the whole thing again, or you just accept that society wants undesirables banished and just kill them all all the time to free resources, or you come up with some reasonable reintegration strategy where people are ok living near ex-cons. Most people would probably balk at the idea of unconditional life&#x2F;death sentences, under some tautological idea of justice. You can see small scale cases where reformed murderers claim to have found god and built families, and whatever. The challenge is that there&#x27;s a lot of very strong stigma as soon as you leave tight social circles and that&#x27;s where the relapses often come from.')
