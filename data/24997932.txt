Item(by='DaiPlusPlus', descendants=None, kids=[24997964], score=None, time=1604582080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24997790, text='&gt; Give me raw Win32 over Xlib&#x2F;Athena&#x2F;Motif any day of the week.<p>I share your sentimental attitude, but looking at the past 10+ years of &quot;post-native&quot; desktop UI development being done in Electron, at al, it really does look like the days of platform-specific proprietary UI frameworks and toolkits are coming to an end. Modern HTML+CSS is a far more expressive medium for <i>usable</i> application UI layouts. Trying to build a &quot;responsive&quot; UI in VB6 is essentially impossible, for example. Even from a user&#x27;s perspective I&#x27;m glad that fixed-size, DPI-unaware dialogs are done-away with.<p>I can&#x27;t complain that much though - I don&#x27;t miss writing low-level Win32 message-pumps - nor being limited by GDI&#x27;s horribly outdated nature (fun-fact: it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> to build applications that support 10-bit color with GDI despite GDI&#x27;s built-in support for different bpp values, because GDI assumed 24bpp &#x2F; 8bpc was enough for anyone forever).<p>There&#x27;s now only a few things missing from HTML+CSS that would enable true native-like applications: borderless sub-windows (think: for context-menus that can extend beyond the parent web-browser&#x27;s client area on your desktop) and native macOS main-menu support (which feels like an anachronism given the large mouse-movements needed with today&#x27;s humongous desktop display sizes).')
