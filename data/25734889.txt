From a secured message in June 2017:<p>&gt;&gt;A transaction has posted to your account involving CoinBase.com (Bitcoin)[2].  Please be advised that in an effort to protect your credit union and all our members, A+FCU does not allow transactions involving CoinBase or any virtual currency.  If you attempt to conduct any future transactions involving virtual currency, your account may be subject to closure.<p>&gt;&gt;Some of the reasons A+FCU has chosen to refuse virtual currency transactions are:\n- Virtual currencies have a higher risk for fraud.\n-Virtual currencies have no consumer protections.\n-Virtual currencies are not backed by a government or central bank.\n-Virtual currencies are targets for hackers, who have been able to breach sophisticated security   systems in order to steal funds.\n-Virtual currencies can cost you more to use than credit cards or even regular cash once you take exchange rate issues into consideration.<p>&gt;&gt;For more information regarding virtual currency, please refer to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) website at cfpb.gov or the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) website at ncua.gov.<p>&gt;&gt;If you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact us.<p>[1] A+ Federal Credit Union, yes, their official name has a plus symbol in it<p>[2] I never ended up using Coinbase, for unrelated reasons.')
