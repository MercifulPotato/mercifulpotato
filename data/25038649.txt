It comes down to two things:<p><pre><code>  1. I never have to move my hands from home row. Pretty much anything I need to do, I can do in Emacs (including file browsing, PDF viewing, web browsing, music playing, git, shell stuff, etc), and faster, because I can rebind keys at will. Emacs is just too darn flexible.\n  2. Anything good from other editors will eventually make it into emacs. The first thing that comes to my mind is snippets which I think came from TextMate. Again, emacs is just too darn adaptable and flexible.\n</code></pre>\nThat said, I <i>don&#x27;t</i> recommend non-programmers or even new programmers learn emacs. It&#x27;s a steep learning curve, it&#x27;s just I&#x27;ve already climbed it, and now I delve even deeper to learn more about it whenever I can. I just don&#x27;t have the technical investment in any other editor, and it&#x27;s highly unlikely that any other editor, IDE, etc will ever have enough advantage to switch.<p>Edit: Ooh, I just remembered this one: I&#x27;m not a big user of TRAMP, even though it&#x27;s awesome, but it&#x27;s even more awesome than I realized. A couple of weeks back, I was test-compiling and running our codebase on a new version of the OS, using a remote machine via ssh (forgot the -Y). I quickly found myself missing the M-g n and M-g p for moving through compile warnings and errors, so I loaded a remote edit session on my local emacs and without even thinking just ran a compile. To my wonder, it just Did What I Meant, and ran the compile on the remote machine, no special setup required! I mean, it was utterly seamless. It&#x27;s this sort of thing that keeps me learning emacs and just marveling at how awesome it is!')
