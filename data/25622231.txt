It would make sense if the card company were responsible for paying a fee to Mastercard on each purpose. That way they could increase that fee and take the difference.<p>But the way this is worded (and I suppose it must be how it works) it means that Mastercard charges a fee and you have an agreement to take some of that fee from Mastercard on each transaction. Just seems a little backwards.')
