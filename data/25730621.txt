It&#x27;s misuse of a common resource.</i><p>Why can&#x27;t free markets result in the misuse of common resources? I feel like some are trying to square a circle here. Free markets aren&#x27;t axiomatically the definition of good, and it&#x27;s okay for something good to not be a result of them. There are these things known as &quot;market failures,&quot; where unattended economic activity will lead to people&#x27;s goals not being achieved. Overfishing and carbon emissions are market failures; far from being the opposite of a free market, they are well-recognized consequences.')
