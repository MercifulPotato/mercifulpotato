One is that there&#x27;s often simple configuration changes where a few hours of engineering effort could save $30k+ each year, and those changes can still be worth looking into. I set up AWS a few years ago at a startup I worked at. I didn&#x27;t really understand the difference between spot instances and reserved instances on EC2, and I didn&#x27;t bother to learn (we were all very busy!). We didn&#x27;t notice for 18 months or something, and the amount of money we wasted with that single mistake would have paid my salary for several months.<p>Its also easy to accidentally lock yourself in to bad infrastructure decisions early, that become extremely expensive to fix later. Mongodb might seem like a good place to start your project, but trust me - moving away from it down the road will be a nightmare.<p>Too much up front design will kill your velocity. And not enough up front design will cost you too. If there&#x27;s a good rule of thumb here, I haven&#x27;t found it yet.')
