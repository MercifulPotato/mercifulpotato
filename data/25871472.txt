In this case, money buys quality, at least when measured by durability. (...) The more expensive sneakers, the 150 euro Diesels, perform remarkably worse than the two aforementioned. (...) In this case, money does not seem to buy quality, at least not durability.</i><p>This is the part that it&#x27;s infuriating to me: I would willingly pay more if I knew which items are of good quality, but quite often there is no way to tell. One would assume that price is a proxy for quality, but (as seen here) this is rarely so: yes, the quality item is probably more expensive, but you can also easily buy items that are both expensive and bad.')
