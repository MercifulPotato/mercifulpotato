Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24709093], score=None, time=1602081862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24708422, text='&gt; when it&#x27;s Google&#x27;s intention that will decide this case.<p>Why do you presuppose to know the legal rule that the Supreme Court will articulate in its decision? I mean, you seem to presuppose that the Court will uphold the Federal Circuit on all contested questions of law and only reconsider whether the decision on the facts is reasonable, which is...mighty presumptuous.<p>It&#x27;s quite conceivable that Google could win on a more fundamental ground, since the question of whether the API is even protected by copyright or unprotected as a functional element (which also does not turn on Googleâ€™s intent) is a love issue in the appeal. They win on that, and the Court doesn&#x27;t have to touch anything else.<p>Even if they do need to address the fair use question because Google loses on copyright ability, the Court a lot will turn on the standard of review and the Seventh Amendment as to whether the Court is really probing Google&#x27;s intent (<i>de novo</i> review) or merely probing whether <i>any reasonable jury could have concluded that the use was fair, as the actual trial jury did here</i>, preserving the right to jury trial. I would expect the latter, the Federal Circuit seems to have gone completely off the rails invoking <i>de novo</i> review to overturn the jury verdict.')
