How pass√©.<p>Essentially programmers want the ability to write concurrent code, without specifying the actual constructs (like threading), and the ouija board of programming community have spoken that explicit syntax is ideal.  Promises were cool for a hot second, but then everyone coalesced on async&#x2F;await.  I thought other approaches like Python&#x27;s gevent were really clever way of handling semantics, but I guess the majority didn&#x27;t agree, people like explicit.  But I will say, this syntax in this Rust library does look odd to me, but I agree 100% that the library made the right choice making it explicitly async.  I really wish Selenium in Python used asyncio.<p>You&#x27;re literally bike shedding on someone&#x27;s amazing effort.')
