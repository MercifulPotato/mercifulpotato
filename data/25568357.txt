Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=[25574258], score=None, time=1609236084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566958, text='Actually, I&#x27;m a developer from the second camp:<p><pre><code>  I am a hacker. I make hardware dance to my tune.\n</code></pre>\nWhy? First of all I enjoy doing things. Understanding the computer, the compiler, how to make use of it more, how to extract more performance from my code while being absolutely correct is making me extremely happy. I feel accomplished. I also apply this knowledge in some scientific applications so, they&#x27;re not all lost.<p>OTOH, I don&#x27;t throw eggs to other so-called <i>tribes</i> or <i>the mercenaries</i>, because We&#x27;re humans and we&#x27;re different. We have different reasons. I live in this stuff since C64. Not everyone has to. Some likes poetry, others don&#x27;t. Some listen to classical, others listen to death metal, rap, whatever. I don&#x27;t expect everyone to like, understand or endorse what I do. The correct baseline is <i>we&#x27;re expressing ourselves</i> here, including <i>the mercenaries</i>.<p>So, as long as you don&#x27;t throw eggs at me, we&#x27;re friends. I&#x27;d gladly help you with my knowledge and more importantly, I want to learn from you to broaden my horizon and augment my ideas with yours to try, see and do new things.<p>Tribalism is not inherently bad, the <i>quiet war</i> and fetishization of these tribes are the toxic parts of it. Similarly, being passionate about programming sans the zealotism is not harmful IMHO.<p>These camps provide a nice foundation and philosophy when used correctly. OTOH, I agree that this is a double edged sword and very sharp one indeed.<p>Why not discuss further?')
