It&#x27;s written to be fun, to be light and enjoyable, in a way that most other movies weren&#x27;t, and aren&#x27;t. I find too many current cartoon movies try too hard to hit the right cultural note, to make the right pop-culture references, and catch the moment, and it all falls flat. This was more like the Animaniacs, that feels timelessly, daftly hilarious.')
