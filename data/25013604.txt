Moving them away will require energy.\nSo e.g. you put two charged particles in this expanding space, the ongoing expansion will cause some energy which can be harvested? Can we build our &quot;Zero point modul&quot; which generates energy out of &quot;nothing&quot;.<p>We dont even need particles for this effect since this is based on virtuell particles which ghostly appear and disappear (the Casimir effect)?\nOr maybe a proper medium would suit better (more particles more energy from expansion) e.g. the densest object like a black hole in this expanding space machine?')
