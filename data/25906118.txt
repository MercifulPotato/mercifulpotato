Actually you could do that even with normal planes as Chief Scientist at NASA H. Bowers has discovered.<p>Look at the next generation Tesla battery pack. The batteries are literally what is holding together the car and the resulting weight is not much larger then the structure you would have needed without the battery.<p>We are not there yet, it takes a complex vertically integrated approach  to build such a plane, but it is not impossible. Just like with EV you need to re-engineer and rethink every aspect of the plane.<p>Your range might still not be as good, but hell of a lot better then 5% and also far, far cheaper to operate.')
