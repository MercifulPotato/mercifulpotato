If enough people take an interest in fixing their local youtube-dl individually when things change and it stops working, even just for themselves, means that the video scraping knowledge is more widespread.  Maybe that is a bit of a pipe dream, but it is something people can do if they really care about it, there is certainly the motivation now.  Yeah, it&#x27;s going to be a lot more difficult now that there is no longer a centralised community for it.')
