The article&#x27;s final suggestion is interesting -- that a Green New Deal must embrace a form of Fordism to achieve its aims. It seems counter-intuitive that an industrial ideology which got us into these climate-shifting levels of mass production and over-consumption in the first place, could be the same one to get us out.
