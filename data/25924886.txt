Before the Fairness Doctrine news was all over the place, during it was sane and rational, after .. well we&#x27;re all living it.<p>When it comes to checks and balances, the news can be under regulated which allows for lies and corruption like we&#x27;re seeing right now, it can be regulated in an unfair or bias way, or it can be regulated in a balanced way that doesn&#x27;t restrict speech, it enhances it.<p>The US has already solved this problem for previous platforms.
