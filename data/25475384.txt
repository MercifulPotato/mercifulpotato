Download VLC on your phone (or any alternative that is ad-free), upload a CD or two you like to it, find some headphones (any headphones will do), start your CD and walk out the door. Walk as long as you feel like, stop for a soda pop if you feel like it and pause your CD while you are disturbed. If you arrive back before the CD finishes, thatâ€™s fine, try again for a longer walk (or a shorter CD) next time. If the CD finishes before your walk is over, great! You successfully listened to music. Start your second CD and walk home.')
