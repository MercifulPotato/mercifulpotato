What facts am I wrong on? What inconsistency is there if I believe that Obama&#x27;s DOJ genuinely never intended to charge Assange with anything?<p>&gt; The Obama administration prosecuted Manning, and would have had an equal amount of reason to prosecute Assange<p>No, because Manning and Assange did different things. A key claim in Assange&#x27;s defense in this case is that Manning did all the illegal things!<p>&gt; The only possible situation for me to believe that they were not prospecting Assange would have been if Obama simply pardoned Assange, which did not happen.<p>Obama repeatedly stated he would not pardon anyone not convicted of a crime (e.g. in the context of Snowden) and as far as I know held true to this for all 1927 of his pardons.[0] So why would he pardon Assange, who was not even accused of a crime?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;pardon&#x2F;obama-pardons" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;pardon&#x2F;obama-pardons</a>')
