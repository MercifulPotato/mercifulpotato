In it the government plays a secondary role. People and companies make most of the decisions, and own most of the property. Goods are usually made by companies and sold for profit. The means of production are largely or entirely privately owned (by individuals or companies) and operated for profit.[1][2]<p>Most property, for example, is owned by people or companies, not by the government or by the workers. Capitalism has a more or less free market economy, which means that prices move up or down according to the availability of the products. People buy and sell things according to their own judgment. In most countries there is some regulation (trade laws) and some planning done by the government. They are sometimes called &quot;mixed economies&quot; to indicate this. Some people disagree on whether capitalism is a good idea, or how much of capitalism is a good idea.&quot;<p>According to this I guess it is fair to say that this is anti-capitalistic. In a true capitalistic society government should not be involved in transactions or take important decisions about this. I don&#x27;t think such a society would work but people can have different opinions on this.')
