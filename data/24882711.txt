On the other hand  you could encode whatever you like in some field of a fake PGP key and upload that to key servers.. and at the same time post it here in HN in a comment and tweet it, and that&#x27;s really good enough to satisfy almost everyone as it is. There&#x27;s just so many ways to get arbitrary data written into logs that can be used as evidence later. We&#x27;re already drowning in distributed systems that log our every move.<p>For anything that involves timestamping some assertion that many parties care about on an ongoing basis it&#x27;s much cheaper to have a distributed system of watchers. See certificate transparency. There&#x27;s a lot of commercial inventive to want to falsify that, but is anyone able to in practice? There&#x27;s no blockchain there.')
