Some fresh air. Not sitting. Its a complimentary reason to get a dog (I don&#x27;t like dogs, do like walking, so don&#x27;t opt for one). Also, you can combine it with an audiobook, podcast, meditation (I got taught a mindfulness technique focussed on walking), music, or just the sounds of nature or the city. Or combine it with public transport, or an errand. My daughter is almost 3, she loves walking outside.')
