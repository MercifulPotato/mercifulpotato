You can specify which _fields_ of the relations below the User you also want.<p>If `User` had `groups` and `groups` had `permissions`, then I can do:<p><pre><code>    let results = await fetch(&#x27;&#x2F;rest&#x2F;Users&#x2F;?fields=&#x27; + JSON.stringify(\n      {\n        id: true,\n        first_name: true,\n        groups: {\n          name: true,\n          permissions: {\n            name: true\n          }\n        }\n      });\n</code></pre>\nMy system has its limitations however.  It can&#x27;t do relational constraints like GraphQL or renaming of fields, but it is likely the 20% that gets you 80% of the way.')
