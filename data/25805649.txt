Sure, the more the logical schema is enforced, the more you are forced to do up-front when the logical schema changes, but that work prevents you from:<p>(1) apply a data migration that fails to result in a state that complies with the logical schema, or<p>(2) producing a state inconsistent with the logical schema because your application code doesn&#x27;t correctly observe the schema, as defective code will fail for violating constraints instead.')
