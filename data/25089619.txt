Stickier in a positive sense in social equity space too.  Less able to effectively support personal equity (justice). Reliability is probably a wash.  Probably less efficient by a percent or less, but that inefficiency is already baked into the (today’s successful) system.<p>Today’s system isn’t broken.  The new system can be more easily broken in a big bad way in the short&#x2F;middle-term.
