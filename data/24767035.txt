Does consciousness split at the moment the patterns diverge?  Is it shared?<p>The analogy to sleep really doesn&#x27;t connect at all, at least not for me.  Consciousness isn&#x27;t fully interrupted by sleep.  Your brain is still working and processing, even when you&#x27;re not dreaming.  Your physical self is continuous, it&#x27;s not the same as it being disassembled and reassembled immediately out of different material.<p>And sure, even if the substance of your is being changed over, it happens as a gradual refactoring, not an instance decomposition and recomposition miles from the original point.  The electrical patterns that make up your brain are never interrupted - not by sleep nor the gradual replacement of your body.  They would be by (star trek style) teleportation.  They would be ended and a (presumably) identical pattern started up at a different location.<p>Can you tell I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time thinking about this?')
