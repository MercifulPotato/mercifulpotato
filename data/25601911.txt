Most digital audio stuff used analog AA filters back then. Also, the Juno was polyphonic, so handling 6 sawtooths at the same time plus antialiasing would be too hard on the poor chip!<p>And aliasing does happens in digital oscillators when you&#x27;re using a fixed clock and sample rate: If you have flexible clock (per-voice) you can just increment the output value in equal steps (and then set it to zero at the end of the &quot;sawtooth&quot;) and you won&#x27;t get aliasing. But if you have a fixed clock, you have to use a (very simple) equation to calculate the position of the soundwave at a given sample number. So you get aliasing when you approach Nyquist frequency, and you need the anti-aliasing filter to fix it.<p>And since it was 1982 the sampling rate of the chip was probably not that high, so you would get aliasing much earlier than at ~22kHz.')
