I definitely have too much of a US-centric view on this as I&#x27;m not very familiar with the project and was assuming at least a few of the major people involved are living in the US or a country friendly enough with the US that the RIAA has major reach. Russia is a member of a few major international copyright agreements, but I have no idea how that will play out practically speaking. I&#x27;m not sure to what extent various member countries actually cooperate. Maybe the RIAA will just give up after they get GitHub and GitLab and any other major platforms with a US presence to stop hosting it if the main people are in a country that&#x27;s enough of a speed bump for them.')
