Because despite the obvious business advantage they have, any would-be competitor would need IPs at a similar scale. That will either cost a ton more than Amazon has, or they simply won’t be available.<p>I own 2048 IPv4’s myself and their value is ever increasing. Like digital real estate, without the fluctuation of crypto. But I would prefer it if IPv6 would take over IPv4, and fast, because it will become a problem that will stifle competitors at some point. If most IPv4’s are owned by big corporations, that’s essentially.. them owning the current internet.<p>IPv6 is practically free.<p>I would love to see a breakdown of IPv4 FAANG ownership!')
