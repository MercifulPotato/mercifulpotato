I would absolutely expect to find a positive correlation between &quot;experience with doing technical interviews&quot; and &quot;likelihood of passing a technical interview.&quot; Plausible, easily verified with concrete, objective information.<p>The first half seems iffy to me, though. It sounds like you&#x27;re performing a technical interview, then calling the result of that a measure of &quot;skill,&quot; then using that to judge how well skill aligns with FAANG technical interviews. But what I think you&#x27;re really measuring is the correlation between your own interview process and the FAANG interview process, which seems like a very different measurement.')
