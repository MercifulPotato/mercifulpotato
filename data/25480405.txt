People have been reporting crashes as frequently as every half hour to every two hours.<p>This opens up liability to Sony, who have a high risk of many sales being converted to refunds, which both hurts their brand and is not great financially.<p>People can still buy the game in physical forms, but that at least absolves Sony from the sales side of things.<p>One suggestion elsewhere has been on Xbox where it may make sense to move the game to early access instead.<p>And again, regardless, the console version runs terribly right now. It should not be for sale on console hardware that can&#x27;t support it, if the case is that the game requires better hardware. There&#x27;s a reason minimum required specs exist on PC versions for example.')
