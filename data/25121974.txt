I&#x27;ve been waiting for HTTPS to be the default for a while now. From a security standpoint it&#x27;s annoying that bar something like HSTS it&#x27;s trivial for a man in the middle to force a downgrade to non-secure HTTP. The fix is to force yourself as a user to look for the lock symbol in the address bar, but that&#x27;s terrible from a usability perspective.<p>However, I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;d be best to make this the mode the default for everyone. I imagine regular users would be quite scared&#x2F;confused when encountering such a message, and that might lead to lots of valuable (mostly older) websites still running plain HTTP to be effectively cut off.')
