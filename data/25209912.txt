That downward pressure minimizes the likelihood of future competition. It&#x27;s a long game that only the (ultra) wealthy can afford to play.<p>Also, leverage is an important consideration. It&#x27;s easier for a billionaire to leverage 1 billion dollars compared to 1 billion people leveraging 1 dollar. There would be measurable consequences either way, but that billionaire is in a much different position by having singular command of that wealth.')
