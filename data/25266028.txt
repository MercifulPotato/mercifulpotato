I didn&#x27;t even know it had a name.<p>The piece seems to imply it&#x27;s a wrong choice, because it would be better to just go to sleep. Maybe in many cases it is. For me, that&#x27;s not the case, because if I don&#x27;t get some &quot;me time&quot;, I just can&#x27;t sleep well. I&#x27;d rather go to bed at 1:30 and sleep well than go at 12 and spend two hours rolling in the bed because I&#x27;m still thinking about work and haven&#x27;t had time to &quot;unwind&quot; my mind. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad decision, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like &quot;revenge&quot; either, just some needed personal upkeep time (like sleeping itself).<p>Of course, I know it would be best to remove the stress, so as to have time both for myself and sleep and not have to choose the lesser of two evils... easier said than done, though.')
