Only a few packages have significant Gentooisms maintained out of there (like the gentoo-sources kernel patchset, which as far as kernel patchsets go is still very light, and you can opt not to use it).<p>In 15+ years of using Gentoo I only recall two times their patches broke something for me. One, some obsolete crud in gentoo-sources broke booting without an initramfs on HP CCISS RAID controllers (because that&#x27;s the only(!) block device driver that puts its kernel device names in a subdirectory). Two, a KDE Plasma patch to pull the right system Python version from the Gentoo infrastructure that manages that forked off a subprocess, but got fork() backwards, causing the &quot;main&quot; process PID to change and subtly breaking D-Bus policykit stuff due to security checks on the PID (aka: you can&#x27;t mount devices from the system tray when the PulseAudio volume widget was loaded, how&#x27;s that for a fun one to debug).<p>I don&#x27;t recall Gentoo ever introducing a security issue, other than perhaps typical packaging mistakes (nothing comes to mind but I assume bad permissions have happened at some point, there&#x27;s always some of those).<p>Not a bad track record for being my main workstation OS for a decade and a half.')
