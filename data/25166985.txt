If it is a trivial change, why not do it? 100Kg is 100Kg. That&#x27;s like seeing a dollar bill sitting on the ground and not picking it up. No effort. But it is something everyone can do as well.<p>As a parallel let&#x27;s look at diets[0] (independent gives higher numbers[1]). Lots of people reduce their meat intake to reduce their personal carbon footprint. But the average diet is about 2000 kgCO2eq&#x2F;yr (3000 via Independent). A vegetarian diet is about 1200kg and a vegan is around 250kg (potentially dubious claim but it is for sure less than a mean and less than a vegetarian diet). 10 websites changing to local fonts is like a single person changing to a vegetarian diet.<p>The logic here is that you could $20-$30&#x2F;yr and completely eliminate your dietary footprint, which is much easier than changing diets. So are what these people doing useless? No. It helps because the aggregate. It helps because it makes people conscious of the problem and how their choices affect the world. But yeah, big corporations should be doing more, but without them doing something that doesn&#x27;t mean you should give up and do nothing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;graphic-detail&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;15&#x2F;how-much-would-giving-up-meat-help-the-environment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;graphic-detail&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;15&#x2F;how-much...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;voices&#x2F;climate-change-carbon-emissions-family-household-flights-vegan-a9203096.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;voices&#x2F;climate-change-carbon-e...</a>')
