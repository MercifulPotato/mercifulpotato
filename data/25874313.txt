Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611339104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873003, text='Given that at least two people found my comment disagreeable or &quot;gotcha&quot;, I have to accept that it landed that way and apologize for that. It wasn&#x27;t <i>intended</i> that way, but given that it landed that way, that&#x27;s on me because I typed it.<p>What I <i>intended</i> was: Hey, John DeLorean started a car company with his name on the door, which is super-cool. If I wanted to go get started on creating Sokoloff Motors, what&#x27;s the background I should seek to maximize my chance of succeeding? I wonder how John DeLorean got his start... In that regard, becoming a division head at GM is probably overwhelmingly the most relevant experience.<p>I&#x27;ll drop the topic here with a final apology for any unfairness or &quot;gotcha&quot; feeling that I caused.')
