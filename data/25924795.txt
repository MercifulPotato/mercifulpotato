But what is the value of having an exactly equal partition?<p>On second thought, the algorithm you describe processes people in a particular order, and it is much more likely to put two people who both occur near the end of the list into the same bucket than to put them in different buckets. So if that processing order is constant, the algorithm cannot produce every equal partition with equal probability.')
