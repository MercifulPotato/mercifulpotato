This includes no vehicle that is not street legal; and no making exceptions to grant them legality does not count. As for automatic weapons, they should require a court order to unseal usage of if not by a committee which must be alerted to any request to use them.<p>If there is an excuse for heavy weapons or such, call in the national guard or local military to assist. The police still do not need this hardware.<p>Oh, the video is cringe heaven<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.muckrock.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2014&#x2F;sep&#x2F;30&#x2F;help-crowdfund-release-infamous-doraville-swat-tan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.muckrock.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2014&#x2F;sep&#x2F;30&#x2F;help-crow...</a>')
