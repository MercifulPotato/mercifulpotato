If that were the case, it is unlikely the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would recommend resuming the trial.<p>There&#x27;s also no evidence to prove that it wasn&#x27;t. Furthermore, the AstraZeneca vaccine was halted for a case of transverse myelitis, a very common (and serious) adverse reaction seen in DNA&#x2F;adenovirus based vaccines like ChAdOx1 [0].
