Item(by='jdeibele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607016230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25289289, text='My daughters attended a local public program where students had to achieve at least 99% on certain tests.  The program started out relatively central, then was moved further out.  The year after my younger daughter left, the program was split into two, with elementary students as far east as it was possible to go and still be in the district and the middle schoolers as far south.<p>The district would clearly like to kill the program.  It used to be possible to get high school credit for the science classes and the district did away with that.<p>The one opportunity that students have in some other local schools to advance is to do Compacted Math, where they do 7th and 8th Grade mathematics plus algebra in 2 years instead of the usual 3.<p>Nowhere in the district is there an opportunity to go faster in English or anything else.<p>What I would have liked for my daughters is to be able to go to local schools and still have some advanced classes.  Their local middle school has 3 classes from one school, 4 from another, and another 4 from a 3rd school.  There&#x27;s 275 kids in a grade.  Surely there could be 1 or 2 classes for the fast learners and extra help for some others?<p>No way, that&#x27;s tracking and the district refuses to do it.')
