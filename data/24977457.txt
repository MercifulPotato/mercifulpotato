Are you claiming that you can push a commit to userA&#x2F;project and then view it under the Github web interface for userB&#x2F;project (assuming one repo is forked from the other)?<p>Very close to that, yes. There&#x27;s actually just one more step you need to take: you have to also open a pull request from userA&#x2F;project to userB&#x2F;project. As a convenience feature, GitHub automatically makes PR commits available under a special namespace. You can try it yourself with any pull request that comes from another repo--just `git fetch origin pulls&#x2F;&lt;PR #&gt;&#x2F;head.<p>Since the foreign commit is there in this special &#x27;pulls&#x27; namespace, it can be viewed in the web UI by its commit ID. That&#x27;s how people are adding youtube-dl to github&#x27;s DMCA notice repo; they&#x27;re just opening a PR containing youtube-dl&#x27;s commit history.')
