Are all drugs that have been approve effective and safe? Including Viox?<p>We have had bad vaccines before (The 1960s Swing Flu) that lead to serious complications.<p>I got most of my shots (MMR, Polio, Meningitis, Hep B, Tetanus booster, etc.), but I would NOT take this one. It&#x27;s been rushed through the process, and vaccine safety takes years. This is a brand new type of vaccine (mRNA), a type that has never been successfully deployed before, for a virus family that&#x27;s never had a successful vaccine before.<p>Stop dismissing legitimate concerns as &quot;antivax&quot;. Each vaccine is very different.<p>I&#x27;m not at high risk (&lt;40) and I&#x27;m also a software engineer who has watched millions in losses from badly designed, badly implemented, rushed software. Skipping the 8 ~ 10 year set of standard tests for this vaccine does not increase my confidence.<p>I&#x27;ll wait until I turn 48~49 and watch what happens with all the volunteers first before making my assessment based on all the available data.')
