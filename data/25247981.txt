Then adding &quot;Fix&quot; to another channel will automatically pull in the &quot;dependent change&quot; &quot;pre_Foo&quot; as well, if applicable? Or is a separate &quot;new_Fix&quot; created?<p>Can a link between two changes be created manually, even though the delta does not require it? E.g. to attach an empty commit, if these are even possible in Pijul (compare git&#x27;s &quot;--allow-empty&quot;). Or, more reasonably, to record logical dependencies which do not show up in the code, such a separate changes for testing vs. the code itself.')
