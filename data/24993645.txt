The &quot;kids raise each other&quot; complain is very modern, precisely because we expect more from childraising.</i><p>Not really. If you go back a century or two, that might be true. Parents went off to the office, and the kids were left to their own devices. Often, herded together with tens&#x2F;hundreds of other kids, with less adult supervision than today.<p>But if you go back many thousands of years to tribal societies, it&#x27;s the opposite. Caveman kids spent most of their life around adults, and a handful of other kids. It&#x27;s the equivalent of going to the neighborhood bbq, where there&#x27;s a wide variety of adults and youths hanging out. Packing hundreds of kids into a confined place with 1 adult for every 30 kids... that is a very modern phenomenon.')
