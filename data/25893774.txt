Item(by='datavirtue', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611509100, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25887385, text='I recently bought a tube of anti-oxident for high voltage electrical connections from my local big-box hardware store. It enhances conductivity and eliminates oxidation between different metals, as one would expect, to make electrical connections inside junction boxes safer. I got it home and nipped the top of the tube, squeezing a bit out to take a look. I noticed it was super crystal clear and it immediately reminded me of PCBs. I examined the writing on the tube and found a dire warning about how it can damage aquatic life and remain in the environment. I was surprised that we still sell this garbage,especially over the counter to untrained individuals. So now I have this tube of toxic waste sitting in my garage that I will not be using. I can&#x27;t throw it away. Instead I have to contact the local &quot;authorities&quot; and find a way to dispose of this stuff in a way that I know it will not make its way into our water.')
