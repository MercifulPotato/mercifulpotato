Even Biden is center-right from our point of view.<p>Everyone they could put up would just get smeared and mercilessly attacked by the <i>entire</i> political and media right wing, from the far right Tea Party&#x2F;QAnon&#x2F;MAGA&#x2F;Breitbart&#x2F;Fox following of the Republicans to the fringes of the Democrats, as &quot;socialist&quot;, &quot;communist&quot; or whatever. Even Joe fucking Biden who doesn&#x27;t support something as basic as M4A gets called an &quot;anarchist ally&quot;, it&#x27;s madness.<p>I am not sure how the US is ever supposed to fix this, given literal <i>decades</i> of red scare brainwashing. I&#x27;m afraid that the only real way out of the current mess, assuming that either Trump &quot;wins&quot; (or wins for real) or Biden gets locked by a R-majority Senate under &quot;Moscow Mitch&quot; McConnell may&#x2F;will be some sort of revolution - when there are millions upon millions of people who are out of a job and homeless, who have nothing to lose any more.')
