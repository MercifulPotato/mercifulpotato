Item(by='ByteJockey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604628554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995867, text='&gt; There is at least some regulation of what churches preach. Hate speech and incitements to violence can and has brought the attention of the FBI on various churches and sects.<p>I&#x27;m a bit confused here. I think we&#x27;re using the word regulation differently.<p>I don&#x27;t tend to think of regulation as paying attention to people who do legal things that happen to correlate with doing illegal things.  I don&#x27;t particularly like this practice, but out of the many labels I could think of to apply to it, regulation isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>I tend to think of regulation as making a specific behavior (or perhaps a specific way of doing something) illegal, especially if there are financial penalties applied to preforming said behavior.<p>Would you mind elaborating on what definition you were using here? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever run into this particular use of the word before.')
