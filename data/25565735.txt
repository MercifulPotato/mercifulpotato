It&#x27;s also not clear to me the Japanese system works that well. People point to live expectancy but don&#x27;t factor for culture, life style, diet, and genes.<p>There are tons of quack doctors in Japan. Apparently to be a doctor here is much easier than some other places. I love (I think) that it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive (via price controls) and that their is government medical insurance so it&#x27;s relatively easy to get covered. I&#x27;m not so sure I like that if you want a skilled surgeon you need to bribe them.')
