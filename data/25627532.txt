You can give a campaign its own website or URL if you want to test something like the effect of a specific billboard or radio ad.<p>Or you can do the equivalent of an excess mortality study but for client acquisition or product sales. You take something like the month of January and you say &quot;this is what we expect for web traffic given our standard traffic for that month, and extrapolate it with your average web activity growth&quot;.
