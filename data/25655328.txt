It&#x27;s an app that lets users donate money to charities while shopping online at no extra cost. The idea is similar to a cashback or a loyalty program. We have 1000+ partner stores including aliexpress, etsy, booking, ebay. The supported charities have been thoroughly review by independent evaluators (GiveWell, Animal Charity Evaluators) to make sure that they make as much positive impact for a dollar as possible. This is a not-for-profit project.<p>Source code is open and available at github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;altruisto&#x2F;altruisto" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;altruisto&#x2F;altruisto</a><p>The main challange right now is growth.<p>Looking for someone with great marketing &amp; non-tech executive skills.<p>Contact via danielwyrzykowski@hey.com')
