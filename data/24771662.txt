Item(by='zajio1am', descendants=None, kids=[24771918], score=None, time=1602632879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767793, text='&gt; Put this way: a device that requires proprietary firmware loaded by an open driver from &#x2F;lib&#x2F;firmware is, by any reasonable metric, strictly more free than a device with the same firmware burned into ROM<p>I would disagree. AFAIK you do not need to agree to a separate licence in order to use firmware embedded in hardware, your right to use it is implied from legal ownership of the item.<p>But if the firmware is distributed independently (like as a part of a Linux distribution), then there are legal complications. The firmware licence must allow redistribution - some do not and then OS contains just script to download it from vendor webpage, which is super awkward, has privacy issues and may force you to accept some vendor conditions. Even if it allows redistribution, it may have some conditions that precludes it from being part of Linux distribution for practical reasons (e.g. advertising clause). And it forces the third party to accept such non-free licence in order to have the right to redistribute it (as a part of Linux distribution).<p>So it creates plenty of logistical and legal issues for users and third parties just to spare some cents on flash.<p>Note that having embedded flash with firmware does not preclude having ability to load newer firmware from &#x2F;lib&#x2F;firmware during boot.')
