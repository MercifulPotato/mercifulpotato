Someone has small children at home, someone cannot concentrate and does not start work due to a relaxed atmosphere, someone is completely too lazy to work and chooses to lie on the couch rather than do something useful. Productivity levels are declining and many people don&#x27;t know how to deal with it.\nSometimes it is difficult to understand a person when you are sitting through a wall from each other, and here often also communication is only in text mode. Many companies have lost and continue to lose their customers and cannot always find an answer and track why this happened.
