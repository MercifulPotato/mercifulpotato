But it also makes no sense for the vast majority of internet users to sacrifice any and all privacy protection to facilitate this. Remember, though, that Gemini does not aim to replace Gopher, so the retro-compatible internet is not directly endangered by it. In fact, people serving content via Gopher right now are strongly encouraged to start also serving that same content via Gemini simultaneously. Retrocomputing fans can continue to access the content via Gopher, while modern computer users who wish to can switch to Gemini and reap some benefits.<p>The blog post also says:<p>&gt; This requirement seems poorly thought out, especially considering the Gemini protocol doesn’t even support forms (other than a single text box on a search form) so there’s no chance of users submitting private data, and there’s no mechanism for client-server sessions so clients can’t be authenticated, meaning everything served pretty much has to be public anyway.<p>While it&#x27;s true that Gemini doesn&#x27;t do uploading, simple text input (using query strings) can still easily hold private data.<p>More importantly, this completely ignores that TLS protects browsing history, and the integrity of pages. When I browse Gemini I don&#x27;t have to worry about anyone watching what pages I visit, or changing them on the fly. TLS is the reason for that.<p>Finally, the claim that &quot;client&#x27;s can&#x27;t be authenticated&quot; is false. Gemini uses client certificates to allow users to log in to services such as private directories, message boards, and virtual plant growing games[3].<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html</a><p>3: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;michael-lazar&#x2F;astrobotany" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;michael-lazar&#x2F;astrobotany</a> or gemini:&#x2F;&#x2F;astrobotany.mozz.us')
