I don&#x27;t disagree that the &quot;far right&quot; types may indeed pose greater risk (but to be clear: whether that is actually true, <i>is unknown</i>, and a body count perspective strongly suggests otherwise [1]), but to speak as if they are the only risk worth worrying about is itself contesting reality.<p>Reality is infinitely complex, but the conscious mind does not perceive it this way.  Even worse, it (the mind, which is in ultimate control of each comment posted on forums like this) seems to <i>refuse to even consider</i> (almost without exception) that it is infinitely complex.  I believe that this may be much more dangerous than it may appear (to the mind...which may happen to be <i>just a little</i> biased on the subject).<p>[1] Here I refer to war, in general, which is not the fault of &quot;the far right&quot;, who seem to very conveniently get all the media attention.')
