So it’s curious why none of these men have shown any interest in addressing the massive and lucrative sex work industry that overwhelmingly serves, well, men; until you consider who pays the real costs of that industry’s brokenness: women.<p>It&#x27;s such a primitive and toxic line of thinking. The real explanation is that SV doesn&#x27;t care about the plight of porn actresses not because they&#x27;re women, but because people in general mostly care about themselves and their closest ones only. Just see that the SV also doesn&#x27;t care about the plight of rare earth miners (which SV needs for their electronics), even though they&#x27;re mostly men. I.e. the gender is not a factor here, and yet article authors try very hard to make it look like it is.')
