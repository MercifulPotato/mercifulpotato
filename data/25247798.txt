I remember their WWDC overview saying they were only going to have either iPhone-style latest-version-only or any-version options, and them later saying they&#x27;d only be supporting virtualization. If they have an owner override for the secure boot on M1, then that&#x27;s absolutely fantastic, and I suppose puts more support around Apple&#x27;s assertions that Microsoft needs to license Windows on ARM for M1 before we can have Boot Camp back.')
