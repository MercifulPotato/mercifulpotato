The difference being the momentum - a LOT more people have heard of Ethereum now than back then. I think you might be underestimating the network effect that Ethereum has in the space. All the tooling, beginner-friendly tutorials&#x2F;books&#x2F;blogs, institutions and funds flowing into the projects, the sheer number of people working on projects is super impressive.<p>For anything else to catch up with Ethereum, it&#x27;s going to take a lot more than &quot;being better technologically&quot;. Ethereum currently does have major scaling issues but the community is converging on the &quot;rollups&quot; Layer-2 solutions [1] as a temporary option until it gets added into Eth2. So I suspect the next few months will be a little rough but things like Matic.network or Optimism will start maturing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethereum-magicians.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap&#x2F;4698" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethereum-magicians.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;a-rollup-centric-ethereum-r...</a>')
