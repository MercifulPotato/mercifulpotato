Item(by='liuliu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609876664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649566, text='I have an unconventional setup of Jupyterlab, Python dependencies, Swift (through PythonKit package) with Bazel. Surprisingly, the new `rules_python` and `pip_install` support works great at installing packages through pip. This ensures on any machine, I will have a consistent Python runtime (either downloaded or build from the source), as well as the pinned python dependencies when the repo checked out. It also helps because I have a Swift kernel that packaged inside the repo as well.<p>One thing I haven&#x27;t figured out is about Jupyterlab&#x27;s extension system, which previously requires node.js for delivery. It seems 3.0 removed that requirement, so I am hopeful with some tuning I can deliver the plugins in consistent way as well.')
