The simplest model of chess with the fewest assumptions is that it is just a random number generator with no dependence on any factors, but this is a bad model, and the &quot;fringe&quot; alien who assumes there is some deeper, hidden structure to the game is correct to do so.<p>If it helps, consider the alien&#x27;s sport of glorfball. We&#x27;ve never seen a game played, but we know that approximately 50% of the time the Aberdorfs win, and approximately 50% of the time the Gloophbahorps win. Based on this data, is it reasonable to conclude that glorfball is nothing but a game of chance?')
