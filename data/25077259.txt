Makes me want to read the book.<p>Perhaps its addressed in the book but: Highways keep moving when even birds are forced to land because of weather. the &quot;Flying&quot; part of a flying car would only be useful in mild weather, and I think many people would prefer to remain able to disregard all but the worst storms in their travel plans.<p>That said, people still fly ultralights, so its not a strong counter-argument. All those points that the author makes and the review highlights are worth considering.')
