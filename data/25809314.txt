Lot of editorialising about why this is &quot;chilling&quot; and allusions to Twitter&#x27;s CEO revealing &quot;his true intentions on social media&quot;, but barely any actual details.<p>For all we know, given they say they allow hate speech in their FAQs, the warning could have been about incredibly illegal discussions happening. Would be good for some actual reporting to happen here.')
