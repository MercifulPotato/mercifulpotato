Reacting to antagonizing - even if the victim knew how to do it, would likely yield more blowback - and more likely, the victim would have no idea how to assert themselves.<p>The situation is not like &#x27;physical assault&#x27; where you have nothing to lose from fighting back.<p>Inability to pushback is not a function of decision or character, it&#x27;s a function of the crazy power dynamic.<p>If the victim had US citizenship, it would have been much easier to hold ground, for example.')
