In other words, IPv4 <i>is</i> a subset of IPv6.<p>If I&#x27;m on an ipv6-only host and blast UDP at ::ffff:1.2.3.4, they should get delivered to 1.2.3.4, no?<p>The actual, real-world problem with 4 being a subrange of 6 is that 4-only hosts are blissfully unaware that the super-range exists, so have no mechanism to send packets there. This is of course where you&#x27;re right about NAT64 and the state requirements.')
