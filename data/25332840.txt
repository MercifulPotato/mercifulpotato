Your home insurance won&#x27;t pay out if you leave an open fire inside the house and then go for a walk either - that&#x27;s negligence. Or if your burning house causes damage to someone else, they will pay them to make them whole, and then try to recover money from you. That&#x27;s just standard procedure.<p>I&#x27;m just saying that while in the US having to decide your liability limit is a worry of most motorists, I don&#x27;t know or even heard of anyone ever worrying about this in any EU country I&#x27;ve ever lived in - the minimum limits set by law are very very high already, and most insurers offer even higher ones as standard.')
