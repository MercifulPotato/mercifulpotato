The challenge is the ones in development are strung out along a pretty long timeline, so if we&#x27;re lucky, one of the earliest ones works and we don&#x27;t have to wait until late 2021 for something worthwhile.<p>And not only that, but people should expect something promising to be approved and then likely pulled off the market 6-9 months post-approval.  It&#x27;s just the nature of trying to accelerate a vaccine and then once approved, dosing tens of millions of people with it.')
