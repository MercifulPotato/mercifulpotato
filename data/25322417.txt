I tried to use a friend&#x27;s TV that cost several thousands. It had an &quot;air mouse&quot; remote. But the thing was more laggy than the first time I tried a full GNOME desktop on my Pentium 2 back in the day. Barely usable. I have a Raspberry Pi 2 that&#x27;s been running for years now hooked up to a projector that wipes the floor with that piece of junk. But he&#x27;s now stuck with that interface for years.')
