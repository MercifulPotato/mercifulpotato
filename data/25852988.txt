I use that to avoid hosting images from particular servers that specialize in stuff with a high &quot;ick factor&quot;. If a use really wants to follow users on those servers, they can, but then <i>that</i> server is the one serving images to my user, not me. I like that setup.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Section_230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Section_230</a>')
