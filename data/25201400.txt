I&#x27;m making an assertion about how I think <i>Apple</i> sees the difference between the iPad and the Mac. :)<p>I know it runs counter to what a lot of folks seem to think (and definitely what a lot of folks want). But it&#x27;s genuinely the way I read the tea leaves. The iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard arguably is an &quot;almost laptop solution&quot; already -- what I&#x27;m saying is that I don&#x27;t think Apple has any desire to give the iPad a Unix shell, a fully open file system, the ability to sideload apps, and so on. If you want to run Microsoft Office or Photoshop on your iPad, they think that&#x27;s great, because there are iPadOS versions of it that fit within their vision of What iPads Are. If you want to run a Docker container with a local web server and Visual Studio Code on your iPad, though, I don&#x27;t see that fitting in that vision.')
