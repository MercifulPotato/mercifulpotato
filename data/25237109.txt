I didn&#x27;t know at the time, but the median survival rate was 9 months -- and the rate hadn&#x27;t changed since the 70s.<p>So, he had a little less than a year to get his things in order -- and then passed swiftly from complete liver failure. I look back and feel very blessed -- he had a really beautiful passing, which i didn&#x27;t even know was possible.')
