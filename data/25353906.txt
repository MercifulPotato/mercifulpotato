I believe they&#x27;ll do it for iPads (including Pro) for $100, and in fact they give you a completely new (refurb, honestly) unit. So you also get a brand new screen with no scratches, which is nice. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll do replacement units for headphones, but wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.')
