Perhaps you&#x27;re not, but guess what, most racist people think the same too. I&#x27;ve seen explicitly racist things told to me with the same statement prefixed to it. How do you absolutely know you&#x27;re not racist? Perhaps we all are at least slightly racist and should strive every day to just reduce that part of us?<p>This is similar to &#x27;I know I am not a bad person&#x27; - the majority of the people subscribe to this hypothesis and I believe that is the root cause for many ills in society. I subscribe to an alternate hypothesis - &quot;most of us are kinda bad people&quot; - I mean most people here have burned tons of CO2 on plane trips for personal pleasure, or bought fancy cars or thought we deserve luxury when many in the world continue to suffer - all of this is bad in some definition anyway so even if we all don&#x27;t promise to be saints let&#x27;s at least acknowledge that we all ain&#x27;t angels as a first step?')
