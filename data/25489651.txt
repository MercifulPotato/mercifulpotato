So it is 13 percentage points out of 66 percentage points — about 20% of the population with 34% of the seats in the house.<p>Senators have to be 30 so the over 65 crowd would be an even greater share there.<p>Given that experience probably gives you _something_, it’s still out of whack but not crazy.<p>All of that said, personally I believe it’s far too skewed and we should have an age cap in Congress.')
