It seems great to us when we can write down everything in the task tracker and skip the short meetings. It&#x27;s always helpful when digging things up later on, identifying issue history and communicating with other people who are directly working on the issue with you.<p>But there are a lot of other people who have other full time jobs to do and they will not have time to dig through all of those meticulous notes, no matter how productive you&#x27;re being. If you don&#x27;t take the opportunities to communicate regularly, you become invisible to those same people.<p>When they make an assumption and a decision that you aren&#x27;t working as hard because you&#x27;re not reporting in, even if you have the documentation showing everything that you&#x27;ve been doing...at that point it&#x27;s now become a confrontation. To convince those same people who&#x27;s good graces matter that you are correct, you have to point out to them that they were wrong. That becomes a no win situation for you.<p>Excessive meetings are clearly bad, but meetings that are intentionally short are often done so out of respect for everyone&#x27;s time. Attend them. Communicate. Brag on yourself. Talk about the interesting problems that you&#x27;re solving. Communication reassures people of progress even if your natural inclination is to go into a hole and come out the other side with a finished product.<p>There&#x27;s an old expression that summarizes all of that pretty cleanly.<p>&quot;Out of sight, out of mind.&quot;<p>Been seen.')
