It&#x27;s winter here so I&#x27;d say many households would empty it in less than two days easily. Equally in winter here 4kw of solar panels output about 4kwh&#x27;s a day. So about two weeks to charge the battery and nothing else...  Of course it&#x27;s summer in Australia so much more solar output but you would be better putting it straight into your AC rather than storing it? Apart from running AC at night? $35000. That said if they can really get it to chug away for 30 years mainantance free unattended I can certainly see useful niches.')
