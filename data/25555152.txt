Can I also say that I thought your first comment was beautifully written (I&#x27;m being honest here).<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t have time right now right now to provide evidence. So that does weaken my case. I looked into this stuff years ago.\nI also am aware that my position might be hurtful to Chinese. That is not my intention either (but it may have happened - and I&#x27;m sorry if that did occur). I could try and provide some links Tomo.<p>Just to repeat I know the Japan invasion of china was horrific. Their treatment of British Soldiers was awful too.<p>But how this event has been portrayed by the Chinese, relative to other awful historical events and the impact that has had on them is something I feel needs consideration. Anyway I&#x27;m just repeating myself.')
