I used it every day for about 6 months. I saw loads of misinformation about the election, there were gruesome videos of people feeding live animals to their pet snakes and other animals. And then just loads of sexualized content. I wouldn&#x27;t allow my kids to use this app in a million years. Also, I tried reporting a bunch of these videos, but they were never taken down.')
