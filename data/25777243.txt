But if you repeat the experiment N times, even if you do it spaced by many miles and many days, and collect the data you&#x27;ll notice that the measurements cluster in ways that are compatible with interference bands.<p>If an actual physicist can tell me whether that I wrote above is fundamentally wrong, I&#x27;d be happy and have more questions')
