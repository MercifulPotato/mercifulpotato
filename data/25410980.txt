Again, not that I agree on those claims. On the other hand Kaliningrad was never part of Russia. It belonged to Poland and then to Germany. It was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1945.<p>I guess the reason Kaliningrad exists is that Poland and the Baltiks were in no means to fight for territory and Germany doesn&#x27;t care.')
