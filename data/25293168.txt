The implicit understanding of being a researcher in a company like Google is that, while papers are subject to review prior to submission&#x2F;publication, that the company will not wholesale reject it and instead will work with you to make modifications and changes. Clearly something different happened here that should be of concern to people considering working at Google Brain.')
