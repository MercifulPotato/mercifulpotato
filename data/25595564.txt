HN is where I genuinely feel safe and happy! Is there anything programming related that resembles the HN community?<p>So with &quot;HN-like&quot; I mean: with the HN community guidelines enforced. Also, it should be friendly and welcoming like HN.<p>I know I am getting annoying, but I am really desperate in this matter. I really need a community like this for programming discussions and help.<p>Topics of interest: C, C++, graphics programming.<p>I know it is utopia, but I also hope for a HN-esque YouTube, Amazon, Google etc. I am rehashing this yet again, but you can see&#x2F;sense that I really, really want this to happen!<p>Or let me rephrase this to: do you know any other community like HN?<p>Also: sorry for the annoyance (of rehashing myself constantly).<p>Have a nice and happy New Year! :)')
