I also regularly use vi when logged in as &#x27;root&#x27;, as it&#x27;s an established sysadmin best practice not to run third-party software as super user.<p>Sublime is more beautiful but I trust Emacs more (Sublime still has the odd bug) and I master Emacs commands fairly well by now (used since 1993).')
