At first I felt kind of cheated, &quot;how can you help me if you didn&#x27;t have to go through this yourself?&quot;  But in a manner of speaking the professor still had to go through it themself and hone their skills, and their breadth of knowledge was much wider than their own personal experience in music training.  This professor had helped countless students master pitch, and they could see much further across the landscape of music study than I could.')
