I stand corrected if so, I didn&#x27;t realise that was the case.<p>I also like the idea of having an easy homogeneous setup, each Pi having one disk, vs. my alternative (old PC parts) being something like &#x27;4 SATA ports on this one, and 6 on that one, but one&#x27;s broken, less one on each for the boot disk&#x27; - I quite like the idea of having a bunch of Pis, and one image that I apply to all of them, which can include details like &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda being its only data disk. That&#x27;s not really a functional advantage, just appealing for keeping it simple to come back to and remember&#x2F;understand how I set it up when I need to tweak something (and really easy to add another one increasing available cpu&#x2F;ram&#x2F;disk).')
