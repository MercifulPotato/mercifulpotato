Secessions all happened between Lincoln&#x27;s election and his inauguration, and the declarations of causes almost all cited Lincoln&#x27;s election as proof of Northern anti-slavery intent.<p>Similarly, the refusal to accept Trump&#x27;s loss is rooted in deep gulfs on identity and to a lesser extent on issues. I don&#x27;t think you can separate the end-of-the-world paranoia from attitudes on BLM, for example.')
