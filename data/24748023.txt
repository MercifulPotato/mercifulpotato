In my testing, even something popular like jQuery or Bootstrap has enough different versions and CDN hosts that it wouldn’t be cached ~50% of the time.<p>Perhaps what’s really needed is some kind of browser based package versioning and management system? Where your CDNs jQuery 1.10 is seen as a mirror of mine, with perhaps even some signing and authority of libraries not directly hosted on the host server? (I’m probably talking about something that already exists or has been discussed I’m sure...)')
