Not only do some folks have pretty deep expertise with RabbitMQ, but by the time we started to hit significant limitations with it, we had devised pretty good (manual and automated) ways around those limitations, like the multi-broker approach. I can&#x27;t predict what would have happened had we jumped to a totally different messaging technology when we ran up against those things, but I&#x27;m reasonably happy with where we ended up.')
