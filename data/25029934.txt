The protagonist experiences a hallucinatory battle with his arch nemesis, then learns that it was somehow projected in the sky:<p><i>&quot;In the sky?&quot; Rand said in wonder.<p>&quot;Both of you,&quot; Moiraine said. &quot;Your battle took place across the sky, in full\nview of every soul in Falme. Perhaps in other towns on Toman Head, too, if half what\nI hear is to be believed.&quot;</i><p>This then ruins his plans of keeping a low profile. Those books had some fun ideas.')
