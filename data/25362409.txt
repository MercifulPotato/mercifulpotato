I don&#x27;t really remember all the details, it&#x27;s been a while since I looked into .deb packages.<p>I think the main problem is that Debian is not a commercial project and it shows sometimes. The tooling is kind of &quot;hidden&quot; (you have to poke around the distribution, mailing lists, etc. to figure things out) and the processes are kind of the same thing. The docs on the site are ok in some regards but they&#x27;re far from complete and up-to-date.<p>Meanwhile the Dockerfile format is reasonably well documented and the tooling is also quite straightforward. You can see that a company made it for a while its raison d&#x27;être and wanted to make it easy to use.')
