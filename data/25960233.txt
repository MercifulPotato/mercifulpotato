We would get annual &quot;FDA training&quot; on how to report, document, etc. my particular employer always stressed on being accurate and doing what was right for the patient. But &quot;over-reporting&quot; was discouraged... I always related it to a police investigation. Don&#x27;t give them any more information than asked, you never know what rabbit hole they will go down, risking rejection.')
