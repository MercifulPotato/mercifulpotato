Emulation of an architecture for the Intel -&gt; ARM switch can&#x27;t rely on some big gains to cover for emulation.<p>I&#x27;d have been more excited if they had provisions for some hardware acceleration of Intel instructions. I&#x27;m guessing they can&#x27;t do direction instruction --&gt; microops translation in the ARM silicon, there&#x27;s probably a thousand patents blocking that.')
