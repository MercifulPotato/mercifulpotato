Gaming consoles and PCs have not had an &quot;iphone moment&quot; after decades because their market is and always will be limited.<p>I don&#x27;t see why people are so obsessed with instant and explosive growth. Almost no recreational product has seen this kind of growth and they have all continued to exist just fine.<p>VR is ready today if its something you want. Its fun, cheap enough and has loads of games. If you hold out for something better you will always be waiting because there will always be something much better in 5 years.')
