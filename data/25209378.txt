There are still a lot of brilliant people working in publishing, even traditional publishing. See the New York Times digital teams, after all.<p>But there is a gaping void of high-functioning software for digital publishing that is extensible, and that is easily integrated with existing workflows (InDesign&#x2F;InCopy as either an endpoint or an entry point—or better yet, two-way) and capable of multichannel publishing out of the box.<p>And not just in the creative and digital ends. There is a sore lack of labour-reducing software in the print world as well. Flyer creation—tens of thousands of hours a year are burned just moving data from a spreadsheet into templates. (I have similar critiques of Excel here: use it for the data entry, tabling, what have you. But don&#x27;t try and make your mock-up layout in there and expect that to 1:1 translate to InDesign without any labour. And for the love of god do not promote it as such)<p>The impasses I&#x27;ve seen are as such: a lot of tech assumes publishing and printing are &quot;dead&quot;, people in industries that have tradition baked into workflows are not open to learning a new tool every year to do the same task so it needs to be a substantial improvement&#x2F;change, and publishing doesn&#x27;t have the same piles of VC&#x2F;investor cash behind it that it had in the 90&#x27;s (much like &quot;tech&quot; does now).<p>But I digress...')
