What&#x27;s taken for granted is 1. Skia is better&#x2F;more&#x2F;performant&#x2F;nicer than javaland status quo, and 2. Jetbrains has the resources&#x2F;experience to &quot;hand-craft&quot; a nice Java API over it. And then on to all the other steps.<p>&gt; So to understand the value of this new library you very much need to be able to do an in depth comparison of Skia vs Java2D vs the JavaFX Graphics subsystem. Very, very few people have the expertise to do this and the blog post doesn&#x27;t really try.<p>This is the main point, which I can only assume JB have answered internally. They are probably the biggest Java GUI shop in terms of users and revenue (at least that I know of), so I&#x27;m not too too skeptical when one of their developers with some clout says &quot;AWT, Swing, and JavaFX came with a lot of quality and performance drawbacks&quot;')
