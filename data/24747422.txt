The S&amp;P 500 is &quot;the market&quot;, but there are lots of other valuable indexes in popular use.<p>For example, VTSMX, the mutual fund version of VTI, forms the backbone of all of Vanguard&#x27;s FoFs â€” Target Date Retirement, LifeStrategy, etc.<p>When I discuss index funds with fellow investors, I&#x27;m absolutely referring to VTI, as well as funds like VT, BND, etc.')
