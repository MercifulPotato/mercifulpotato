There are societies with lesser regard for rationality doing just fine too. Several countries not in &quot;the path of the storm&quot; can claim credit for anything they did and didn&#x27;t do as having stopped covid to the point of superstition. Id credit Germans&#x27; preference of beer just as much as their February&#x2F;March response or their penchant for rationality. It&#x27;s a form of collective survivorship bias. There are several cases of countries next to each other with no particular great early response having vastly different outcomes. Rational, educated populace doesnt explain away the difference between Italy vs Austria, Belgium &amp; Netherlands vs Germany, the US vs Canada, etc. It&#x27;s too early to gloat and take digs at the US. Were all countries at equal risk of exposure, or were the US, Italy, and other more severely affected countries already major travel hubs for people coming from early affected regions? Some countries have turned &quot;flatten the curve&quot; into &quot;nobody should ever get a fever again&quot; and have gone to great lengths to make that happen but I doubt the temporary security is worth the &quot;emergency powers&quot; theyve given their leaders.')
