With a modern SPA, I can have the user download the app once and cache it in a service worker. All further requests can be made as minimal as possible using JSON or GraphQL requests. This matters, a lot, to users connecting over slow cell connections in metered bandwidth. I care a _lot_ more about making my sites accessible to users in developing countries than I do about y&#x27;all HN folks that refuse to run JavaScript on principle. Figure it out.<p>Sites with JavaScript are somewhat more difficult to archive, sure. We&#x27;ve done a pretty good job though. I&#x27;d be curious to see if anyone here can actually present a site that doesn&#x27;t archive in the Wayback Machine or archive.today. We&#x27;ve thankfully developed better tools for this sort of thing than curl, that are entirely capable of archiving script tags (yes, even from CDNs!) and pertinent async HTTP requests.<p>Finally, server-side rendering obviates this problem entirely. Write your same React app, but also have the server return some coherent HTML content for `curl`. Next.js and others do this automatically. Turns out the solution was more JavaScript the whole time.')
