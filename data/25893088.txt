No amount of fiddling with dd, unetbootin or Etcher resulted in a bootable USB. Despite being principled about it, I had to admit defeat and just pulled an old &lt;4GB Windows 10 iso and flashed that to the stick.<p>I know I could have installed Linux through a virtual machine and got it done that way, but that seemed horrible overkill. Oh well.')
