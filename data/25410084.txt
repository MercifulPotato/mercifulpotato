I&#x27;m talking about &quot;unlimited&quot; plans being sold today, that have rather low limits.  You are grand standing that everything is limited.<p>Which, yes.  Yes it is.  Should we allow folks to sell unlimited gigabit connections, but only have a connector in their data center?  That you can only use for limited time?<p>Now, do I agree with unlimited promotionals that will eventually go away?  Yes.  Do I like loss leaders that are basically made to gas light and destroy competition with the obvious goal of just out lasting how long the competition can manage?  No.  I find that rather reprehensible.')
