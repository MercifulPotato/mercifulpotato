From the next sentence it sounds like you consider humanity spacefaring life. We barelly poked our toes out from our planet. We have less than a hundred individuals who visited a different gravity well and they each only spent a relatively short amount of time there. The physical signatures of our “spacefaring-ness” is practicaly undetectable from interstellar distances. How do you know that there arent like tons of us out there?')
