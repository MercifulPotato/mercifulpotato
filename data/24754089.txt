The out of box experience with Linux has been very good. Note that some of the aftermarket cards are actually bad and the instability might not be software related. Before 5600 XT, I used R9 290, and while it did require some tweaks to enable all features (due to being older card), it still ran relatively stable and in general was better experience than any nvidia card I had used in past.')
