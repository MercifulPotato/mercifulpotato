It could be another fund&#x2F;investor, but it&#x27;s WSB this time.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lesson here for people making massive short bets, and for hedge funds and anybody making a bet instead of an investment: that someone else might take the other side and have more power than you might think. This is all just betting at this point, with WSB still betting they can trigger even more of a short squeeze. If this has somehow crossed the line from &quot;bet&quot; to &quot;investment&quot; that starts affecting the rest of the economy, then the consequences should be interesting to watch. Trading on exchanges shouldn&#x27;t be able to be restricted by someone like Robinhood, though they have other problems too.')
