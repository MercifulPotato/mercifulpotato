It&#x27;s mature and complete, does not introduce breaking changes every day, super-easy to start prototyping without tooling yet can work well with build system. I use it with TypeScript and only things I am missing are hot reloading and typed templates. The performance is not top but usually not limiting. Namespace clash is not really a problem if you qualify your component names. Forget all the $scope, controllers and services are just plain JS classes.<p>Every time I see React had got shiny new pattern that breaks everything you have done so far or Angular is 4 major versions ahead of when I last checked and still not solving the architecture inconsistencies I&#x27;m glad I stayed with AngularJS.')
