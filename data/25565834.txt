My mother has been doing essentially the same thing for nearly 25 years.<p>It’s better than most nursing homes.  My siblings and I grew up with the residents and were quite attached to them when we were younger. It’s a hard job though and the systems aren’t set up to support you. Full commercial fire systems are required for what is otherwise residential housing. Of course to my mother it’s more of a mission than anything else.')
