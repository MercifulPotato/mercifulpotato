I did learn a lot (especially about myself in recent months), but this all came with a very real cost.<p>If I did consultancy or went back working full time as an employee, I&#x27;d have a ton more money in the bank. It does impact my family. It is money lost, no matter how you decide to look at it :)<p>I&#x27;m not saying that I regret doing what I did. What I regret (but am not going to cry all day about) is the bad decisions that I&#x27;ve made during that part of the journey.')
