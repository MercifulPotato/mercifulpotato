Now, I&#x27;m not an expert on this topic, but I&#x27;d wager that the billionaire entrepreneurs have more power than the US senators being paid a measly $200K&#x2F;year. Suppose they have a little side-hustle and make 1M&#x2F;year; that&#x27;s still peanuts.<p>Thats true but they are part of a powerful decision making body. The people who tell them what to do are a more exclusive group. And some senators somehow end up worth $100mm, that money comes from somewhere and they don&#x27;t make it by accident.')
