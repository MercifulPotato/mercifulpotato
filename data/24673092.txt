I&#x27;ve worked primarily in freelance over the years and have a high amount of flexibility and adaptability in what sort of tasks I can do (ranging from web development, light coding, design work, editing, teaching, administrative tasks, customer service, etc).<p>I&#x27;m interested primarily in remote work but would be willing to consider relocation for the right company&#x2F;country. While my working experience isn&#x27;t in IT, I would enjoy entry-level IT work as an opportunity to grow my experience in that field. I would enjoy PT or FT work and can work any schedule, but prefer either late at night or early in the morning.')
