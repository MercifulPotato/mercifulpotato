There are some UX papercuts in their web&#x2F;mobile apps, but they&#x27;re more than sufficient for day-to-day use. That&#x27;s the big draw for me; I&#x27;m not happy with any of the desktop IMAP clients, so &lt;whoever&gt;+Thunderbird is off the table for me. Fastmail does a good enough job of offering what I liked from Gmail that I&#x27;m happy to use them.')
