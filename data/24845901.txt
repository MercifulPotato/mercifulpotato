The proof is trivial. Have you ever made a mistake? Congrats, thatâ€™s your proof.<p>The problem with your comment (and this paper) is that it misrepresents what economists mean when they talk about the EMH. A more widely accepted interpretation of the EMH is just that it&#x27;s impossible to reliably predict asset prices, or colloquially &quot;beat the market&quot;, and it has a lot of evidence going for it (e.g. the poor track record of professional traders and fund managers over long periods of time).')
