He articulated his point extremely well, he doesn&#x27;t need your help with convoluted interpretations. You twisted his words sideways and upside down, then built irrelevant conclusions on top of your own nonsense, and diverted the discussion from the PROBLEM the original article was written about to your own misguided statement which bears no resemblance to Matt&#x27;s argument.<p>&gt; HN is no longer on board critical thinking<p>Indeed, otherwise your comment wouldn&#x27;t be on top.')
