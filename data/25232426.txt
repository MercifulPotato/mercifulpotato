The author of the comment to which you replied does seem to understand the trends in bike designs these days and feels that these trends do not fit well into the market segment of e-bikes. I agree.<p>&gt; itâ€™s not only the weight that carbon frame bike owners are after - the material gives much better ride quality than aluminium.<p>The affect the frame has on the ride quality is significantly smaller than other components of the ride like the tires and seat post[0]. Carbon often has a very small weight improvement over a well made steel or aluminum bikes, so if you&#x27;re buying an e-bike because you want pedal assist, I don&#x27;t understand the need to shave 1 or 2 pounds off the bike.<p>&gt; Deep rims are nothing spectacular either, their weight penalty is nicely offset by aero gain.<p>This appears to be true. Most of the aero penalty of the bike comes from the wheels and having deeper wheels does reduce the drag a lot.<p>&gt; One chainring is all the rage in bikes now<p>It is all the rage, but it&#x27;s not clear yet whether it&#x27;s justified or just a ploy by the manufacturers to save costs on their end. The gear ratio of this bike goes from 1.0 on the low end to only 3.64. 1.0 is pretty good for going up hills, especially with the motor assist, but 3.64 is really low, especially for a bike trying to tout itself as really fast! I don&#x27;t understand this choice. Most road bikes have a top end ratio of around 4.54.<p>&gt; Mudguards and simple handlebars make this bike utilitarian and well-suited to commuting<p>The mudguards are nice, but I don&#x27;t understand the choice of handlebars. Why do you want a super aero light-weight bike but then put flat handlebars on it so you can&#x27;t get in an aero position like you can with drop handlebars. This doesn&#x27;t make sense. Furthermore, the bike doesn&#x27;t have mounting points for a front or rear rack, which is a huge downside for commuting, if not a dealbreaker.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyclingabout.com&#x2F;why-impossible-steel-frames-more-comfortable-than-aluminium&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cyclingabout.com&#x2F;why-impossible-steel-frames-mor...</a><p>[edit] you&#x27;re right that trends do matter when affecting people&#x27;s purchasing decision since most people aren&#x27;t very informed about the actual pros&#x2F;cons of the tech they&#x27;re buying, but this doesn&#x27;t undermine the original commenter&#x27;s opinion that this bike doesn&#x27;t make sense from a technical standpoint.')
