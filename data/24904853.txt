The modern villages were named after the medieval ones, but aren’t necessarily in the same location.<p>This research combined sources to find locations with above-average levels of bricks, pottery, and animal bones to locate likely locations of the villages (thought to be impossible thus far as the sea has dispersed all remains and ship wrecks add noise), and combined that with literature search to put names on each of them.')
