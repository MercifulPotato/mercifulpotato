Tesla is on record as having driven driven a total of 12.2 autonomous miles, vs 1.45 million for Waymo[1]. If they were actually serious about building a self driving car in the near future they would be taking steps now to get regulatory approval, and to the best of my knowledge they have not. Meanwhile Waymo has taxis on the road without human drivers and Cruise has a pilot program.<p>The only pro Tesla argument that I hear is that they are gathering more data. This is entirely fallacious because there are no meaningful milestones for data gathered, and it&#x27;s not true. Google has orders of magnitude more of driving data from Android, Maps, and Waze.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;tesla-self-driving&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;tesla-s...</a>')
