Since then I&#x27;ve had success telling them that I have home owners or renters insurance, both of which normally cover household items in storage.<p>Your explanation of the state law they referenced was interesting, they way it was brought up to imply that you were mandated to pay this fee, and that the law did not say anything of the sort, and they were not following what was in the law!<p>I&#x27;d be happy never having to deal with Public Storage again.')
