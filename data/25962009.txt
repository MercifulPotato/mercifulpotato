So randos buying N95s and wearing them will frequently not work.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true.  No box of 3M N95 masks I&#x27;ve ever bought has said anywhere &quot;failure to fit test this mask renders it ineffective.&quot;  3M Aura masks have an instruction video on how to maximize the fit, but thats just a bit on how best to adjust the little metal bit that clamps around the nose.<p>An ill-fit N95 that might not be perfectly adjusted to conform is still way better than a cloth mask which isn&#x27;t intended to seal at all.')
