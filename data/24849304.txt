IE - having to find a different way of building software if I couldn&#x27;t use a keyboard and mouse due to medical condition.<p>The solution I always imagine is paying someone or having my employer pay someone to strong style pair program with me. Perhaps a student, junior developer or even someone unfamiliar with software development entirely.<p>For those unfamiliar with strong style, this rule sums it up: &quot;For an idea to go from your head into the computer it MUST go through someone else&#x27;s hands&quot;. Like the standard driver &#x2F; navigator pair programming technique but with the navigator never touching the keyboard.<p>In the case of someone completely unfamiliar with software development I imagine that there would initially be a dramatic high &#x2F; low skill gradient between us, with the person essentially transcribing. However given the intensity of the practise I think this gradient would level out quite quickly.')
