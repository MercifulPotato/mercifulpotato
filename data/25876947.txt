The emphasis is on &quot;neutralize,&quot; because the underlying strategy is based on the premise that there is no truth, only power, and for an opponent to be neutral, or do nothing, means there is no resistance to your agenda.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble fitting this in with what I currently see in the world. it doesn&#x27;t seem like either &quot;side&quot; would be content with my neutrality&#x2F;silence. they seem to want nothing less than full and vocal alignment on every issue.')
