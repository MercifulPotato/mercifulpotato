Last I heard (from Dr. Birx on TV), many states count anyone with a positive test as a “COVID death”, regardless of what the coroner’s report says.<p>If we counted deaths for any cold the same way, it would be a shocking (perhaps not as big, but still shocking) number.<p>&gt; be the good scientist you want to see in this world!<p>Unfortunately there is no place for a good scientist in most fields, you either play the political game or you get frozen out.
