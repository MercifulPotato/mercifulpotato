Those app stores are the property of their respective creators (this is a flaw of the app store paradigm in general, at least for those who want full control over their software).<p>Both Apple and Google are fully within their rights to charge whatever they want within their app store and enforce whatever capricious whims they like on apps that they distribute. It&#x27;s the same as traditional book publishers writing their contracts with authors they publish. Which is why open platforms and device jailbreaking remain valuable for those of us who believe in personal ownership of our software.')
