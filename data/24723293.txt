Instead, you&#x27;re filling the results with searches for &quot;ultimate&quot; (as a close misspelling?) and making it appear that they both speak about this equally.<p>Are there really lots of misspellings in these speech transcripts? Why not just turn off this misspelling feature if has a potential to mislead?
