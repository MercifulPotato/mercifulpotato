I did not have depression, but rather my own cocktail of problems as a student, and a lot of it (at least for me) stemmed from clear dissonance between your current situation and an inability to anticipate a future self that is acceptable to your current self.<p>With depression, the situation is similar and more importantly, you become more and more subjective and people outside your situation are needed, as probably is medication, to bring you back to personal assonance with what you want in life.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t say what the reasons were, so Wang may have had different reasons.')
