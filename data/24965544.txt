The Travis platform means being able to have relatively portable CI that almost never needs to change because of the CI platform. Bring a Makefile and use it locally and in the build pipeline.<p>Moving off Travis to something like GitHub Actions will cost a significant amount of time and the opportunity cost is ridiculous.<p>This along with the Docker Hub limits makes a very strong case for GitHub&#x27;s strategy.')
