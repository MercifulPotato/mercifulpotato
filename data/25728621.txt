The problem is that BAs and product people aren&#x27;t generally making a ton of money, so the great ones will move on to more lucrative positions, and great developers get bored quickly if they&#x27;re just given a list of JIRA tickets. So pretty soon, one of the three things breaks down then all hell breaks loose. The product folks don&#x27;t have a clear business vision. The analysts are soft technically and don&#x27;t know what questions to ask. The developers are either building a space shuttle when they need a bike, or they don&#x27;t know how to build the bike in the first place.')
