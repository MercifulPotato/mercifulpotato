Using ffmpeg&#x27;s -ts flag I have set V4L2 use &#x27;abs&#x27;, the same as ALSA.<p>I haven&#x27;t done any extended length captures yet so I&#x27;m not positive I won&#x27;t have drift, but on the shorter length clips it has worked flawlessly.<p>Anyway, thanks again for the link. His advice led me down a path that finally seems to have made the capture aspect of this project work!')
