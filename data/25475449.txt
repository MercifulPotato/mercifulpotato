It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I pretty much do everything myself.  What wealth I&#x27;ve accumulated has gone into tools, equipment, and leasing shop space.  In the last decade I&#x27;ve found less than 5 people whom I would rely on to do what they&#x27;ve told me they&#x27;re going to do, whether I&#x27;m paying them or not.<p>It&#x27;s gotten to the point now where I&#x27;ve learned carpentry to make my own custom furniture because I can&#x27;t find anyone who will do the job decently locally. I do most of my home repairs DIY, because finding a competent contractor that shows up on time, won&#x27;t cut corners, lie to me, and actually finishes the job is basically impossible.  I did all of the work building my race car and I do all my basic car maintenance myself.  Even for a job as simple as an oil change, I can&#x27;t trust common chain stores.<p>If anything, the &quot;gig economy&quot; has made this situation worse, not better.  There&#x27;s so many people who will put up a Facebook page and advertise themselves as doing some service, and really they&#x27;re just half-assing it for a what is effectively a fat paycheck for their level of effort and care.  There&#x27;s SO MUCH apathy in the world, so many people that just don&#x27;t give a shit about the quality of their work in anything they do in life.  Finding other people that actually care about doing it &#x2F;right&#x2F;, is nearly impossible.  Mostly because when I do find those people, they&#x27;re usually also wealthy and in a different line of work.  Turns out, being focused on doing things correctly the first time is valued enough to be a path to wealth, in and of itself.')
