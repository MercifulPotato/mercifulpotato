Even though it will likely often trickle up to the landlords, it will enable a lot more freedom and economic output, and it does not have to be a fixed value for everyone, it could adjust based on income, a Guaranteed Progressive Income [0].  But what does that have to do with a wealth tax?  I don&#x27;t think the two are as connected as people would like to believe.<p>To use a naturalist&#x27;s metaphor, wealth comes from having seeds and trees, with orchards bearing fruit.  There are people with some trees and plenty of seeds to keep sowing, and there are some people with no seeds and simply waiting on the receipt of fruit.  There is likely enough creative output thanks to the endeavors of prior generations to create enough orchards for us that handing out decent fruit rations would be great with little negative consequence, but wealth comes from planting and nurturing new seeds to grow new trees to create new fruit.  In short, if we could empower people to start their own endeavors that could blossom fruitfully, that would be a better strike at the heart of inequality than simply shaking bear some trees at the more fecund and productive orchards.  Picketty is not wrong, but that sounds more like oak trees and their ability to propagate thanks to squirrels running off with the nuts and burying them far and wide than some sort of ontological argument about society.<p>While a GPI (Guaranteed Progessive Income) will help, we need to focus on creating the causes for our own orchards, our own wealth.  If someone else&#x27;s presence of wealth prevents one&#x27;s success, then maybe it is time for intervention, such as in the new era of logical and necessary Anti-Trust suits, but if the only obstacle is not having enough resources to start with (education, capital, knowhow, access to resources) it is difficult to see how shaking apples off another&#x27;s tree will increase or improve those things directly.  What&#x27;s the ideal world?  What&#x27;s the ideal result?  Perhaps we can work backwards from the Utopia we want to have, rather than incrementally towards a swamp of disincentives that counteract original aims.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satisologie.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;guaranteed-progressive-income" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;satisologie.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;guaranteed-progressive-in...</a>')
