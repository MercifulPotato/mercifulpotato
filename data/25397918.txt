Simply the utility of the code refactoring tools completely blows any <i>text</i> editor out of the water. For example when I want to do a simple refactoring such as rename a function or a class I can do this trivially in seconds. I could never find anything like this for any of the editors I tried before. OK, I mean there&#x27;s some clang based plugin for vscode for example but the the functions it has (such as code completion) basically almost never works and it has very little to offer in terms of refactoring.<p>That being said I adopted emacs style key bindings which I use continuously for the most common editing things. I find this is really the best bang for the buck and best of &quot;both&quot; worlds!')
