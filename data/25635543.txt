For me the 2 major problems with unions are:<p>1) there is an us vs them mentality. You are in or you are out. If you are out, it’s harder to get in. This also leads to dead weight staying around and people doing the bare minimum. This might be good for those already in the union, but terrible for anyone not.<p>2) a lot of politics &#x2F; corruption &#x2F; nepotism. Hired are made based on relationships, promotions are either tenure based or based on relationships.<p>Not saying these things don’t happen at non unions places, but from what I’ve seen they happen a lot more at unions. Some times the stereotypes are based in reality.')
