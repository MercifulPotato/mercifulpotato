Excel is everywhere and allows for &quot;no-code&quot; automation.  No-code has been around forever and for some reason incremental improvements to something utterly pervasive is a revolution that will be embraced by the next generation.<p>All I can think of is how Windows used to be administered almost entirely through the GUI but eventually PowerShell was invented and its popularity grows year over year.  How is that even possible when the &quot;no-code&quot; way to administer Windows must clearly be better and more accessible and user friendly and coding is old fashioned and borderline obsolete?  Every company with their heads on straight would fire anybody who uses PowerShell and replace all their admins with unskilled high school graduates.  There is not enough room in town for both no-code and code solutions, so I expect Microsoft to remove PowerShell in it&#x27;s next update.')
