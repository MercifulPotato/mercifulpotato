Knowing (for example) that the parameter is a string will be zero help in knowing what is being done with that string. It also won&#x27;t help know what edge cases the code was handling.<p>Also, types give a false sense of security. A new project was integrated into an old website (one with legacy dependencies, but doing millions in transactions every day, so unchangeable).\n It broke and they couldn&#x27;t figure out why. They had the TS types for functions, but an old framework (prototype or moo iirc) overrode js built-ins with incompatible versions. Later they got bitten again when that code changed the object types. If they&#x27;d been writing js, they would have written dynamic checks from the start, but it&#x27;s easy to forget that once you compile, it&#x27;s just js.')
