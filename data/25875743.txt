Libraries fall in and out of favor.<p>Is that true? Can you give me an example of what you&#x27;re thinking of? I&#x27;ve used React since pretty much the beginning and the only &quot;completely different&quot; looks I can recall is class-based components -&gt; functional components + hooks. And even that evolution was pretty comfortable and backwards-compatible.')
