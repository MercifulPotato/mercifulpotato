NixOS.<p>I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not more widely used (and I only started using linux full-time earlier this year). It confines the entire (non-user) filetree into the read-only &#x2F;nix directory, and manages every single component of the OS through Nix, the package manager - and I guess nix-daemon in the case of NixOS specifically - 100% declaratively. You define the entire thing through a single configuration.nix file.<p>You can even do crazy stuff like erasing the root upon each reboot, leaving only &#x2F;nix and &#x2F;home if you wanted, and I think I remember in the article I was reading about it that it can mount everything on a tmpfs or something like that, so you have a perfectly &quot;clean&quot; root tree every time you restart the computer (as &#x2F;nix is stateless, it&#x27;s guaranteed not to change except when rebuilding the system configuration).<p>The point of nixos is really the declarative aspect, with &quot;splitting&quot; the OS being more of a secondary benefit, but for your case, you might like the whole declarative builds thing in general to accomplish that.')
