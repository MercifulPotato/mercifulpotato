Visual Studio Code has gotten really popular lately, but I think very few people realize that many parts of it are closed source. And you can’t take extensions from the Microsoft store and use them in your own editor…this just seems <i>designed</i> to get people to use your editor, give them enough source so you can claim it’s hackable, but prevent any other editor from reusing it. That doesn’t sound very open at all.<p>Actually, in this specific case, it <i>really</i> hurts, because Microsoft had been the one pushing for LSP to enable reusability and interoperability. You can’t take M*N to M+N if every editor refuses to let their implementation be used by anyone else. Honestly, Microsoft, what are you getting from taking a bunch of open source code and making the good bits proprietary, and then sabotaging your own messaging around standards that you want adopted? Because I can’t see any reason why you have to do this :&#x2F;')
