I think we&#x27;ve all heard here and there than npm sometimes unilaterally removes packages from its registry, but I can&#x27;t find any examples on internet after left-pad, or that weren&#x27;t due to known vulnerabilities being discovered in those packages.<p>I&#x27;d like to know if anyone has example and can provide proof (emails, screenshot, etc) that happened in the last 3 years or so.')
