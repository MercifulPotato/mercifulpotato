We&#x27;re trying to avoid the latter here because it destroys what HN is supposed to be for: curious, thoughtful conversation about interesting things.<p>When accounts build up a track record of flamewar, snark, political&#x2F;ideological battle, and other things that break the site guidelines, we ban them. We have to, because otherwise this place will be engulfed by hellfire and then become scorched earth. Those things may be exciting and&#x2F;or activating for a while, but they&#x27;re not interesting.<p>If you wouldn&#x27;t mind reviewing <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a> and taking the intended spirit of this site to heart, we&#x27;d be grateful. You can still express your views in that spirit, as many other HN users have been showing.')
