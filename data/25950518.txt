It still required drivers and other things that expose syscalls to be open and GPLed.<p>&gt; Even if Linux were permissively licensed,<p>The tainted kernel was the attack on the GPL itself i talked about. After tainted kernel, it is pretty much NOT-GPL, hence the devs gave in to a more permissive license while still calling it GPL. So the rest of the point is moot. Linux kernel DID adopt a permissive license, which is the reason we do not have proper open source android today.<p>&gt; But given the more or less total lack of adoption<p>chicken and egg problem. But that is *exactly* the argument against GPL for the kernel in the past.')
