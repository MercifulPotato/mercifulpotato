[...] Also, the Saturn V came back.</i><p>Since we&#x27;re nitpicking: The Saturn V didn&#x27;t come back â€“ the tiny <i>command module</i> came back, and it wasn&#x27;t reusable. In fact, the only reusable part of the Saturn V were the astronauts.<p>&gt; <i>Actually, going to the moon and back is not that far off a one way trip to Mars.</i><p>You&#x27;re moving the goalpost. This is getting ridiculous. What are you even arguing about? Starship + Super Heavy will be a much more capable rocket, superior to the Saturn V in almost every way. That doesn&#x27;t detract from the <i>incredible engineering</i> of the Saturn V, which was developed 55 years earlier, in record time, with slide rules (!), and which first launched 10 years after the first artificial satellite (!!) That is impossible to beat, and there&#x27;s no need for a pissing contest.')
