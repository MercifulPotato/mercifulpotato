Email is somewhere in betweenâ€”it works fine 1-to-many, but not so well many-to-many.<p>&gt; don&#x27;t you think these perpetrators will find an equally effective technology to spread their propaganda?<p>Maybe they will, but that&#x27;s hardly a reason to ignore these atrocities.  Maybe they won&#x27;t.  Maybe future technologies will be more careful about encouraging people to join extreme groups because it increases engagement.<p>&gt; it seems like the media want to convince me to hate Facebook<p>Nobody&#x27;s asking you to hate Facebook, but you should be aware of the power they posses, and how irresponsible they are being with that power.  You don&#x27;t need to bring your personal feelings into this at all.')
