It was overwhelming for months and it messed me up for years, including bouts of depression and lots of trauma purges. Not the kids&#x27; doing, just some mirror effect, situations triggering and unlocking memories. And I feel it&#x27;s even worse if you try alternative, progressive education methods, that give lots of agency to children, that focus on understanding the emotional state of mind, on accepting everyone&#x27;s emotions without judgement, with infinite patience, the absolute minimum of coercion, and go so much in opposition to the way I was &#x27;raised&#x27;.<p>Not saying I agree with parent that I&#x27;d be <i>happier</i> for sure in some ways, but I sure didn&#x27;t expect so much psychological pain in addition to the hard work of raising kids.')
