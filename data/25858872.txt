I was feeling like a genius because I could also make it so that the website is indexable by google because the text in the SVG is treated like text and It was mobile friendly because I could do a separate desktop and mobile version through a wordpress site builder. I believe in your idea because I have tried it and I think it could be used to develop 90% of SASS and startup web pages because you just need text, visuals and a couple of buttons which can all be done through SVG.')
