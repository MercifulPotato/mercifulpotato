It has been a while since I read it but there was an article comparing the energy efficiency of different cooking devices and even though induction cooker is at the top the efficiency is only 70%-80% something.<p>Edit: Found it:<p>&gt; There are no Energy StarÂ® certifications for ranges, but research by the U.S. Department of Energy indicates an induction cooker is 84% efficient at energy transfer, versus 74% for a smooth-top electric unit, giving it a heating performance comparable to a gas element. More significantly, induction is 90% efficient with its power use, using 2.8 kW to deliver 2.52 kW. This is a substantial improvement over electric coils, which use 2.0 kW to deliver 1.1 kW (a 55% efficiency), and over gas, which uses 3.5 kW to generate 1.75 kW (a 50% efficiency).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insteading.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;energy-efficient-induction-cooking&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insteading.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;energy-efficient-induction-cooki...</a>')
