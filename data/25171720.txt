Landlords make zero contribution, while attaining huge returns.<p>Abolishing landlords would accomplish one of Marx&#x27;s most significant goals without completely throwing out property rights and capitalism.<p>&gt; How would that one work?<p>Well, like any implementation, that&#x27;s up for discussion. The general idea is that we would remove the ability for landlords to charge rent. Landlords would have an explicit infringement on their property rights. They would no longer have the right to demand recurring payment from occupants of their properties. They would have restrictions of their ability to evict tenants.<p>Of course, the implementation is where this idea gets contentious. Are landlords allowed to evict tenants who destroy property? Do landlords even own property anymore, or is it explicitly given to tenants? What about multi-dwelling properties? Who owns the furnace in an apartment complex? Do we create a third-party authority? Can any of this be accomplished without full-fledged Communism?<p>Most of the complications lie in the change from status quo. It&#x27;s pretty complicated to decide who owns property that is already owned by landlords, but it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to make it illegal to enter new rental contracts.<p>I agree that simply throwing out the words &quot;abolish landlords&quot; trivializes a lot, but it&#x27;s still an idea worth exploring. What we have now isn&#x27;t inherently better. It&#x27;s a pretty obvious failing. People are homeless while homes lie vacant. People are inheriting huge swaths of property, making wealth and power, then turning that power toward policy that benefits them. These are real problems, and they deserve attention.')
