This amount would certainly not be permitted to rise above the value they bring to the company, but I&#x27;d feel no obligation to pay them exactly their marginal value to me. If I did, there&#x27;d be little profit in owning the company.<p>I don&#x27;t really see why I should be expected to do otherwise. The value a person brings to the company cannot be separated from the company&#x27;s capital and the person&#x27;s employment of that capital. An ML engineer would be of little use without the company&#x27;s cluster of GPUs on which to train models. So what brings the value? The cluster or the engineer? Which came first, the chicken or the egg?')
