What makes them the &quot;chosen ones&quot;? Just lucky to work for a successful company?<p>Google makes a ton of money off of each employee, and could probably afford it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csimarket.com&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;GOOG-Revenue-per-Employee.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csimarket.com&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;GOOG-Revenue-per-Employee.html</a><p>Google, like much of Silicon Valley, regularly puts forth the messaging that it represents the future, not only in terms of technology but in terms of society. (&quot;Making the world a better place.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil.&quot;) Forward-thinking often lends itself towards democratization, and of personal empowerment. So if Google wants to portray itself as futuristic, and its employees so lucky to be working for such a futuristic organization, then it would follow based on their own company line that janitors at Google might be entitled to more money at more traditional, hierarchical, less worker-empowering companies.<p>If Google didn&#x27;t want their employees to set fires, then maybe they shouldn&#x27;t taught them them the Promethean secret. Perhaps tech companies should cease pretending to be so much nobler than every other traditional form of business. The people running Google created this culture.')
