Eventually, they just disabled eco mode in software Which took a few weeks of me working from the mini dealer. There was display of how many  miles you had gained that reset when you filled the gas tank. My record is 42 Miles gained in eco. After the final update to the software, which was a full day in the garage, My best was 8.<p>One of those was worth running stories in the press about.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying here is that there is a deep vein of shadenfreude in the news about Tesla. A single Tesla on fire is a big national and some times international news story. I have stopped even reading the damn things. It seems like a weird combination of them being seen as rich people cars, early adopter cars, and liberal hippy cars. Everyone can hate someone on the spectrum. Typically, the issue in articles about Tesla flaws is so isolated and dumb that it exists solely to generate clicks. The last article about Tesla I clicked through stated that consumer reports had downgraded their durability rating due to the discovery of single human hair in the paint of a model Y. I get that it sucks. But, I don&#x27;t get why I should care about it.<p>I own a Model 3 because I needed a four door car because I had kids, electric seemed like a net win, the local Bolt dealer told me not to buy their car, and the range let me drive to the grandparents houses without a charge. I recognize that there is stuff about the model 3 and Tesla that sucks but overall it has been a pretty solid car for the last 2 years for me.<p>Would I recommend one to you? Yeah. I don&#x27;t think there is a company that offers the combination of electric car, mature tech, range, and charging network at a similar price tag.')
