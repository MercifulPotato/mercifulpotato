Companies like Grubhub list restaurants on their site&#x2F;app, but put the wrong phone number on it- one that goes to their own people instead. That&#x27;s clearly some kind of fraud or misrepresentation.<p>Makes me feel like I should setup a phone number and a website called something like &quot;GrubhubHelp.com&quot;, and list a help number for assistance with GrubHub orders. Then when customers call to complain, I&#x27;ll play an ad for the competitor who has paid me the most money.<p>Seems only fair, right?')
