We had ways to distribute, dairy, meat, and all types of food <i>before</i> plastic. But even if we do make use of plastic in the future, we need to rethink how distribution happens instead of just slapping everything in its own plastic bag&#x2F;box for its entire lifetime. It is entirely thinkable that you bring your own tupperware to the grocery store and fill it up, then bring it home. I&#x27;ve been doing this for years with takeout. People are just lazy and can&#x27;t plan ahead.')
