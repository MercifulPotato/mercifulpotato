The whole law enforcement industry in the USA is in need of &quot;re-structuring&quot;.  They also harassed me because I went to pee in the desert a few miles from the Mexican border (3 different law enforcement agencies came by (well, one was already present)).  We don&#x27;t need to de-fund them (maybe a little bit), but they need better training for sure.  Also, I&#x27;m white and they were white.')
