Item(by='tene', descendants=None, kids=[25885475], score=None, time=1611424516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884131, text='Personally, I always try to give people all the details up-front, but here are some rough situations where I&#x27;m likely to give people a very short summary instead of a full verbose request for reasons like you asked about:<p>If they respond immediately they can save me 30 minutes of work, but if not I&#x27;ll be done doing it the slow way by the time they get back to me.<p>I&#x27;m making slow progress on a tricky problem.  If I write a summary now, it would be theories I&#x27;m trying to disprove and evidence that currently seems relevant, but that summary will be less useful and accurate as the situation evolves and I better learn about the issue.<p>I can be unblocked on this task in three different ways, so I&#x27;ve reached out to three different people.  I&#x27;ll ask for help from whoever responds first.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is going to take me 30 minutes, or 3 days to figure out, but I&#x27;ll keep working on it until I do.  If it&#x27;s still a problem when you get back to me, I&#x27;ll ask for help then, but there&#x27;s a good chance I might have solved it myself by the time you get back to me.<p>I&#x27;m dealing with an outage, and it&#x27;s very time-sensitive.  I don&#x27;t have time to waste writing stuff up if you&#x27;re not here to help out right now.  If you show up while it&#x27;s still broken, great!  If you show up after the outage is fixed, I don&#x27;t need your help anymore.  I&#x27;m not calling you, because if you&#x27;re not currently at your computer, you probably can&#x27;t help me in the timeframe I need.')
