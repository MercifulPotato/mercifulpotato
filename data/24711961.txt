I&#x27;m a Brit, and clearly the culture around driving is different in many ways on our side of the Atlantic.<p>Some of the earlier discussion here has apparently been mostly people talking at cross-purposes and didn&#x27;t turn out to be very enlightening. However, it does seem that at least some people here really are trying to defend something that I think most people would consider unconscionable where I come from. The arguments have essentially been that people there have no realistic choice but to rely on theirs cars, even if driving them is obviously dangerous, or they literally can&#x27;t live a normal life and support their families properly.<p>This raised a lot of questions for me that single-car or car-free households face all the time over here, like how you get the kids to school or anyone who isn&#x27;t the driver to important appointments like medical ones. I was surprised that your response was more-or-less &quot;you don&#x27;t&quot;, but then in the context of medical appointments there is again a very different culture here to yours. It would be similarly unconscionable for most of us in the UK to bring a child into the world and not then make sure they get all of their check-ups and vaccinations at the right times, and you&#x27;d have to try very hard to find a situation where a parent without access to a car couldn&#x27;t still make those provisions for their child in some realistic way. From comments by yourself and others here, I conclude that this is not necessarily the case in the US, or at least in significant parts of it.')
