The energy is doing useful work by making the system more secure (at a rough rate of 50%, which is actually rather efficient as energy consumption goes). Of course, having some better solution that doesn&#x27;t need energy as its source of trust would be great, and perhaps proof-of-stake will one day work. But the fact of the matter is that there is no better alternative today, and the traditional governmental currencies don&#x27;t count.')
