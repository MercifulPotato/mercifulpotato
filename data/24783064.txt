They just won&#x27;t be employees of Google for much longer after Google finds out.<p>I don&#x27;t like that any more than you do.  Corporations have far too much power in the US, and way more control over the lives of ordinary citizens than they should.  But, there&#x27;s nothing against the rules here.  And, that&#x27;s the way big corporations like it.<p>Note that Google employees are still free to donate money or otherwise assist organizations calling for Google to be broken up.  While Google may not <i>like</i> this, it&#x27;s highly unlikely they&#x27;ll ever find out about it.')
