Item(by='axegon_', descendants=None, kids=[24685734], score=None, time=1601886779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671051, text='I think there&#x27;s more to it than the carbon-free tech for Honda(or any other manufacturer for that matter). F1 is getting eaten from the inside with politics and corruption. It takes a lot of effort to stay out in front. For the past half a decade no one has managed to give Mercedes a run for their money and expecting something to change with the new regulations is a huge leap of faith. Meanwhile costs and complexity is through the roof. Remember when a year or two ago Porsche was considering to supply engines for F1? Sure, they don&#x27;t have a good record as far as F1 goes, but let&#x27;s not fool ourselves - the engineers at Porsche are absolute gods when it comes to making small capacity, high power engines and hybrid systems. And realistically the main reason why they decided not to move forward was the huge leap of faith considering the exact complexity and costs I mentioned earlier. So there&#x27;s a good chance the whole thing isn&#x27;t paying off for Honda.')
