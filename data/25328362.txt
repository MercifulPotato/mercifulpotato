We just, as in a few hours ago, wrapped up our season as owners of a u-cut tree farm. It&#x27;s relatively small, just under 30 acres. But our family was just doing a post-mortem on what went well, what we need to change and making fairly detailed plans for next year and even several years out. I can tell you more then you want to know about the growing, spring&#x2F;summer and fall care. The shaping. The labor to trim, drill, bag, etc. It&#x27;s fascinating to see the impact 2008 had on planting and the resulting shortage of trees these past couple of years. I don&#x27;t have any real point other than, been there, doing that, have the t-shirt, ask me anything. Oh, and this part of the farm is basically a side hustle to my normal 9-5 infosec job. Merry Christmas!')
