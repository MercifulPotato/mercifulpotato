Specifically.  This is important.  AFAIK, no reasonable, law-abiding people advocated for or excused violence and destruction.<p>In fact, such violence was roundly criticized and there were calls from all quarters for the apprehension and prosecution of anyone committing violent acts.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the same refrain over and over again.  But no one ever actually names names.  So.  Who are these people who actually advocated for violence and destruction during the protests last summer?<p>That isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, friend.')
