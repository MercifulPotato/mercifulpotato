Think Entropy.<p>Imagine Oxygen molecules in a box. The individual movements are complex and unpredictable but at a very high level macro view we can see all of these movements in aggregate as temperature.<p>Temperature is not only much more stable then the chaotic movements of individual atoms but it is predictable and controllable. I can heat a kettle of water to a very specific temperature and I can accurately predict the rate in which it will cool down when I stop heating it. I cannot however control or predict the actions of specific molecules within the kettle.<p>The lower level you go the more chaotic things become. The higher you go the more deterministic things appear to be.')
