Item(by='apricot', descendants=None, kids=[24830600], score=None, time=1603133351, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824150, text='The C64 has no equivalent to the Apple II system monitor, which allows you to examine, change, and disassemble memory interactively, and includes a mini-assembler as well. It provides a very natural pathway to understanding the inner workings of the computer.<p>The C64 also has no equivalent to the seven expansion slots of the Apple II, which allow you to customize your computer (by installing a CP&#x2F;M card to run Wordstar and dBase II, for instance, or by adding bank-switched RAM) and to easily develop your own hardware.<p>The graphics and sound capabilities of the C64 are superior to those of the stock Apple II, and I think that explains why demos are still popular on it.')
