Instead, we get a few cookie and JWT widgets. Nowhere near ready.<p>CMS - they list 3 static site generators. A static site generator is all well and good, but it&#x27;s nowhere near being a CMS. They not only don&#x27;t have a CMS, but don&#x27;t even seem to know what a CMS is or that they need one and that a static site generator is not a substitute.<p>Database - it at least does have some okay ORMs. But do any web frameworks integrate with them to the extent that you can set up test databases and run test suites with them automatically? Do any of them support validations? Last I checked, Diesel&#x27;s support for associations is pretty bare-bones.<p>I&#x27;ve tried out Rocket. It&#x27;s all right for making relatively basic API apps. And it still doesn&#x27;t build on Stable yet, though that&#x27;s hopefully coming soon. I like Rust for a lot of things, but it has a long way to go before it can compete with full-fledged web frameworks.')
