Since we can scan QR code to open URLs, I create a page that takes a URL input and generates a QR code. And then I created a JavaScript snippet that I could add to bookmarks, so I can click that when I&#x27;m on a web page and let the bookmarklet create a QR code.<p>This is a super simple app and can be built with a couple of lines of code.<p>But I thought this might be useful for people who do not have the time to build it for themselves.')
