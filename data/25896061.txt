It&#x27;s tiresome.<p>I think it&#x27;s more that the question you asked, _in the way you asked it_, is so oft-repeated and shallow that it&#x27;s indistinguishable from concern trolling or other similar kinds of low effort drive-by sniping.<p>Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean that your question was insincere. But consider that pretty much anyone who has shown the slightest bit of interest in spaceflight has probably seen nearly that exact question hundreds, if not thousands of times. It&#x27;s nearly as common as &quot;why are we spending money on space when there are still so many problems to fix down here on Eaaaaarth?&quot; It&#x27;s likewise not a constructive question, and it&#x27;s just not reasonable to expect a positive response.<p>EDIT: By the way, I do find the question of what to do about all the stuff already zipping around in various Earth orbits, and how we regulate the addition of new satellites to be a really interesting and important topic. It&#x27;s only that I&#x27;ve never seen &quot;how much X is too much X&quot; — especially when asked in response to a report of someone doing X — generating meaningful discussion. How about... &quot;if one country regulates its own space industry to mitigate addition of new LEO debris (limits, tracking, investing in clean-up tech), then at least some other countries will just ignore it. Are there any existing multilateral agreements in place for this stuff specifically, or maybe agreements in other domains that have successfully avoided similar kinds of tragedy of the commons down on Earth? Nuclear disarmament and ocean protection aren&#x27;t working perfectly, but have had some positive impact...&quot;')
