It&#x27;s tiresome.<p>I think it&#x27;s more that the question you asked, _in the way you asked it_, is so oft-repeated and shallow that it&#x27;s indistinguishable from concern trolling or other similar kinds of low effort drive-by sniping.<p>Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean that your question was insincere.
