Note with this example, under &#x27;Contributing - Tasks I could work on&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t mention UX, and the only way to become a committer is to &quot;show us some of your patches, or solve some issues&quot; - none of which involve UX.<p>* There is a slight obsession in the open source community to use only using open source tools, while the majority of modern UX practice is developed on proprietary tools (e.g. Figma).<p>* Design by committee is the most frustrating and slow process, and great UX design comes from strong decisions by great designers rather than community votes.<p>* There is an underlying assumption that if you contribute UX designs and put them in the Wiki they will be ignored, so there is no point. It&#x27;s not the same as code where there is a one step process (i.e. commit), the whole team needs to embrace the UX and then work to commit it to code.')
