And this is progress? You’d rather that people hid what they really think?<p>Your entire view handicapped by your inability to see past what is and what is not allowed by law. You seem to think that only legal methods, instead of social or cultural changes are the only way to encourage a culture that values the freedom of speech. You are too shortsighted to see that freedom of speech is both a cultural and legal concept. More importantly, by arguing legal semantics, you don’t seem to understand <i>why</i> freedom of speech is necessary at all. Freedom of speech is merely an implementation detail.
