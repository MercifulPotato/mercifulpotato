Here is a thread in the last week where 50% of posters from HackerNews were berating Microsoft for open sourcing all of VS code, but not open sourcing one of their free language servers (calling them selfish, anti open-source e.t.c.). I think this is the exact same sentiment.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25719045" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25719045</a><p>So Microsoft open sourced all of VS Code, but didn&#x27;t want to open source the Pylance language server (a separate product which is installed separately as an extension) which they provide as a free (as in beer). This is because Pylance is also used within their other (charged) offerings such as full Visual Studio and is a differentiator from their competition in the premium space. Also they have hinted that it includes some proprietary secret-sauce that they don&#x27;t want to make public.<p>Bear in mind that Microsoft is making VS Code free and open source... here are some quotes from the thread:<p>&gt;  I find it what they are doing to be dishonest [...] the consequences of their actions is that people who dislike them will talk bad about them.<p>&gt; [Microsoft] have the right to be two-faced about their open source policy, I have the right to speak about how I think it&#x27;s bad to do so.<p>&gt; They should please stop acting like they are the second coming of christ for open source [...] they are misleading their users.<p>&gt; Microsoft proved that they only care for OSS [...] because it enables them to spy on coders and their code to develop proprietary and closed sourced spins for software development product. The OSS community got served.<p>&gt; Microsoft always does this, they fool people by pretending they’re in favor of open source or make something free but it’s just a trick used to bait and switch people into the proprietary anticompetitive Microsoft ecosystem.<p>&gt; Seems like Microsoft is back to pissing in the public pool.')
