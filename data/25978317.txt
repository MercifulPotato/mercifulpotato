I do numerical work—ML&#x2F;data science&#x2F;statistics—and I simply couldn’t accomplish any of what I do without the functionality provided by NumPy. np.array alone is worth all the king’s gold.<p>It is interesting to me that in many respects it serves as “guts”. I definitely drop down to use numpy directly with regularity. But it’s also possible to do 80-90% of the job without ever explicitly using the module itself. It’s baked in everywhere, to the point that it feels like just another standard library.<p>Exciting to see progress! Keep up the good work, numpy team :)')
