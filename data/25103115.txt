It <i>will most certainly</i> take multiple years of additional studying when you come in contact with anything related to software engineering, because that&#x27;s just what it is.<p>Of course there is no shortage of people who learn one language, one framework, one tool and sit on their ass depending on the people they work with to pick up the slack.
