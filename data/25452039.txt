Part of the problem is that we have created a culture that uses cars as a form of self expression, and many early parents aren&#x27;t ready to &quot;be&quot; a minivan. But the minivan is what you actually want as a parent: room for six people of any size, or four people and at least twice as much cargo as an SUV, with safe, remote control doors that can be operated by kids. It&#x27;s a living room on wheels, including the TV.<p>Honda is trying to bridge the identify gap a little with paddle shifting, ventilated seats, and almost 300hp, but really we should try to step back from seeing the car as an expression of who we are, and try to optimize for the functionality that we use every day. As much fun as it was to drive the BMW, finding a way to fit my growing family into it was a stressful mess and I&#x27;m happy to have found, perhaps unintentionally, a much better situation.<p>Some of this insight came to me from Steve Kaufer of TripAdvisor, who at the time I was there was running a $4B company and driving an old minivan, because that&#x27;s what his family fit in. He never cared for a fancy new car because fancy meant small and he wasn&#x27;t out to impress anyone on the road anyway.<p>But I also can&#x27;t pretend that Honda&#x27;s naturally aspirated 6-cylinder and perfectly matched 10-speed (domestic!) paddle shifter didn&#x27;t help seal the deal in my garage.')
