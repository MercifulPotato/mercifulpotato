Tipping is a very cultural thing. In Germany you might tip someone your change. Getting 1&#x2F;2 euro is rare. In Ireland, people usually tip closer to 10%. In AU&#x2F;NZ, people rarely tip at all.<p>I tip quite a bit now that I&#x27;m back in the US, but I prefer restaurants where servers were paid a better wage and their service was baked in to the cost of the meal.')
