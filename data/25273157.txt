Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=[25273279], score=None, time=1606882262, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25269550, text='Well that&#x27;s the thing.  Transparency is a dependency of trust.  And as it stands, I for one ain&#x27;t seeing a lot of the transparency, seeing as how (AFAICT) we can&#x27;t see &quot;under the hood&quot;.  The lack of a published privacy policy is another red flag; publishing that policy - and including the necessary provisions to ensure that Slyde or any future owners&#x2F;operators thereof will always put user privacy first - would go a long way toward establishing that transparency and therefore trust.<p>That said, it&#x27;s a similar problem with DuckDuckGo: how do we know they&#x27;re respecting users&#x27; privacy?  DDG has it easy, since they&#x27;re a search engine; absolutely nothing about their product requires storing any info about their users whatsoever, and thus (as far as anyone knows, and as far as they say) they don&#x27;t.  Slyde, however, is a social network, which makes the collection and storage of data much harder (if not impossible) to avoid.')
