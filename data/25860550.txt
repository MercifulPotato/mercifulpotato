You can&#x27;t graduate from a BA in history without writing non-trivial papers and having some ability of conveying critical thinking.<p>&gt; Anecdotally, the biggest benefit of a degree for me was just meeting others with similar goals. The meta knowledge about how to get a job, what skills I need, credibility when contacting recruiters, etc. along with the positive peer pressure from being around more successful students. These things are were all “unknown unknowns” before I started. My hometown has no tech industry.<p>You nailed it. These are impossible to replicate with online learning.')
