Because there are a million others vying for the same eyeballs. The question is, how do you stand out? If you were a YouTuber who wanted to make a living from YouTube content you create, how would you do it?<p>&gt;Then they need to start monitoring their pilots more effectively, and also spend a little more on up-front development so that the shows that make it out of the slush pile have some prospect of getting to the end of a natural arc.<p>How do you know they aren&#x27;t doing that? No matter how good your pre-production process is for finding good shows, ultimately, it&#x27;s the eyeballs and box-office that decide it. There is no formula to differentiate a hit from a bomb. What complicates things is that season 1 of the show may have been a hit, but subsequent seasons are not. There&#x27;s no magic here. At some point, you are going to be cutting something to make room for something else.<p>&gt;NF claims to be data driven<p>I&#x27;m sure it is, but there is no formula that you can use to figure out what is going to be a hit and what will be a bomb and lose you money. If there was, you wouldn&#x27;t see companies spending hundreds of millions on movies that end up bombing at the box-office.<p>&gt;The efficient solution is to produce consistently great content.<p>This is like saying the &#x27;efficient solution&#x27; to investing is to invest in companies that give a good return and not invest in companies that lose you money.<p>Pretty sure everyone wants to produce great content.')
