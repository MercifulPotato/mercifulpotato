It is working well and spurs interest in Python across the wider org - so we let everyone use it.<p>Similar to in OP&#x27;s case, I think the real selling point of Python over Excel is advancing the capabilities and the scale of the business. Talks of different programming languages falls on flat ears in finance - show what can be done instead. With Python, Zipline and notebooks I can manage a global equity portfolio, continuously adding active strategies and adapting to real-world changes and constraints. And backtest! Excel is great, but there is an upper bound to what can be reasonably done without a thriving open source community.')
