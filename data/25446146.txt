I&#x27;m still lost how yet another currency is going to help society. Im not trying to be an ass, I&#x27;m being serious on figuring this out. I constantly see this argument with no real logic other than trying to essentially use Marxist ideals of &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot; to a disenfranchised demographic. Yet trying to distribute a computer based&#x2F;useful currency to folks that dont have running water let alone electricity also confuses me. Tag on that the current distribution of bitcoin is in the realm of 30% of users own some 90% of bitcoin wealth. That&#x27;s a pretty shitty interpretation of redistribution of wealth. In truth, it pretty much follows the realized implementation of Marxism throughout history, &quot;everyone needs to redistribute wealth to me and my friends and away from the people who already have it&quot;.<p>Just saying &quot;this will help the poor because they have nothing&quot; over and over with no real plan, let alone action, doesn&#x27;t make it true.<p>One guy I argued with once told me about him donating his bitcoins to buy pizzas for people who needed it. Which, cool. That&#x27;s awesome. But the donation argument makes it sound like people dont donate dollars or euros. Or even like theres some grand mechanism that makes bitcoin better than traditional currencies... even though crypto gets converted to traditional currency so it can become useful.')
