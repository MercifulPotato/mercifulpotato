To take one such example, years ago X.org forked from XFree86. Both projects considered themselves implementations of the X Window System. Can you imagine if XFree86 supporters insisted that X.org not be allowed to use &quot;X&quot; in their name? If these supporters invented their own name for X.org, say &quot;Zorg&quot;, made outlandish claims that &quot;X.org&quot; sounded offensive to them, and that they earnestly believed that &quot;Zorg&quot; was a better name for the project, even though no one in the project itself referred to it by that name. Would you not agree that those using the term &quot;Zorg&quot; in this example are using manipulative language?<p>Another way to look at this: the difference between small-blockers and big-blockers is a deep philosophical divide, much like what often occurs in politics. Imagine trying to have a civil political discussion with someone that has different political beliefs than you, and that person keeps using loaded terminology, rather than neutral terminology. You can imagine that under these circumstances, it would be increasingly difficult to keep the conversation civil, and you&#x27;d be well within your rights to ask your interlocutor to use neutral terminology. If they refused, it would be a reflection on their lack of civility, not yours.')
