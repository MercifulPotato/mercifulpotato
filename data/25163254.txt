He&#x27;s responding to a century&#x27;s worth of epistemological thought, and that reply makes only limited sense without knowing what he&#x27;s replying to.<p>I see it as a kind of conversation:\nPopper: Scientists invent hypotheses, then try to falsify them.<p>Kuhn: Turns out that&#x27;s not really what scientists do most of the time, especially the most important ones. The inspiration comes out of nowhere.<p>Feyerabend: And that&#x27;s a good thing, because they&#x27;d miss out on pretty much everything.

But it&#x27;s a really important observation nonetheless, especially when a lot of scientists (and more importantly, science-adjacent types like most HN readers) are stuck back on Popper.')
