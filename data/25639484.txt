Training and supporting networkers and non-networkers.<p>I&#x27;m especially focussed on supporting folks who often get overlooked or steamrolled in tech, because the current situation is often poor for the underrepresented. That might mean women, LGBTQAI+ people, non-cis folk, non-english-speakers, people who aren&#x27;t speaking the native language of the place they live, and so on. Of course, I&#x27;m also very happy to work with all you cis white guys too :-)')
