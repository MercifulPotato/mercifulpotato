Corporations are more than just sum of the people - they are a process that runs <i>on top of</i> people. People themselves are replaceable - and if you change the behavior of one to something the corporation doesn&#x27;t want, it&#x27;ll replace that person with someone new. You want to change the behavior of the corporation itself - and that&#x27;s best done by creating monetary incentives and disincentives (i.e. punishment). The corporation will adjust the behavior of people on its own.<p>In other words: &quot;appealing to the people&quot; instead of addressing the corporation itself is like trying to heat up a climate-controlled room by lighting a small fire in it. You&#x27;ll be fighting the AC unit all the way and causing lots of unnecessary damage, when the right way to do it is to adjust the thermostat on the AC unit.')
