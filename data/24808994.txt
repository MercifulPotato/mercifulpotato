Laptop is 1080p at 14&quot;. Turns out Xubuntu can&#x27;t configure HiDPI display properly at all. I searched ten minutes, found some crazy guides advising changing a lot of stuff in the xrandr which I&#x27;m completely unfamiliar with. In the end end I simply cranked font size in the terminal, did what I had to do and closed it. Thankfully it was just a VM and not host OS.<p>In another episodes I saw Linux completely and irrecoverably  (at my level of skills) break xwindows after dist-upgrade (on a simple business line HP laptop with a single Intel GPU), stuck in dependency hell trying to run 3rd party software because libc6 had incorrect version and apt couldn&#x27;t resolve that (again, way above my skill level).<p>I&#x27;ll use Linux on servers and clients where it is great, but my work host system will remain Windows for the foreseeable future, thank you very much.<p>PS: and to address OP article - both my home Win10 and work Win10 never force reboot for updates for some reason, at least in the space of up to 2-3 weeks of continuous uptime. Yes, the sometimes nag me for updates (just like Linux) and I simply install them in some downtime periods (just like Linux).')
