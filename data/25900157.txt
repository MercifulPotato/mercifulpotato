Not because I don&#x27;t trust it, but I don&#x27;t trust myself to react as quickly with it on. If my &quot;gas foot&quot; rests, it will take longer for it to hit the brake if needed, than if I engage continuously while driving. No scientific proof for this, except my own perception of my own attention.')
