He says his talent stack is comedian+cartoonist, he&#x27;s not amazing at either individual skill but he&#x27;s one of the best at the combination which allowed him to create Dilbert.<p>I got value from this way of thinking but I also think specific goals are necessary (e.g. as a startup founder targeting a specific market, product or vision) and that there are some domains that demand you to be the best in a single talent vertical due to a winner take all tendency (e.g. athelete, musician, professional gambler - although in any of these we can still distinguish systems &amp; talent stacks from goals).')
