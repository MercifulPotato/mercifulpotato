He may personally dislike GPL3 but that doesn&#x27;t appear to reflect the opinions of the entire project. A license analysis of the current mainline Linux source shows that roughly 30%-40% files in the kernel are already GPL3 compatible because they&#x27;re either licensed as GPL-2.0-or-later or dual licensed as MIT or BSD. (I don&#x27;t have exact statistics on this, it&#x27;s a rough estimate from a non-exhaustive SPDX audit. You can reproduce by simply grepping through the source for license identifiers) This can happen because individual kernel developers can contribute using whatever license they like as long as it&#x27;s compatible with GPL2 for a binary distribution. Additionally, Linus and several other kernel developers did decide to adopt the termination provisions from GPL3 not too long ago [0].<p>Based on this, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to say that the kernel developers are currently opposed on the whole to GPL3, or at least to some of the ideas in it anyway. If the stance of some developers was &quot;we&#x27;ll upgrade the license if you remove all the extra provisions except the termination ones&quot; then it seems obvious why that is a no-go from the perspective of everyone else.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;latest&#x2F;process&#x2F;kernel-enforcement-statement.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;latest&#x2F;process&#x2F;kernel-enforc...</a>')
