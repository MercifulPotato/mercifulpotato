And this is their hand-picked benchmark.<p>Changes like this were first proposed a hear and half ago I think, or longer, and rejected because the performance cost of making the scheduler consider this constraint cost more performance than just disabling SMT, so it wasn&#x27;t worth the implementation complexity cost. But it&#x27;s true that companies and customers still _want_ it, they want to get all their cores&#x2F;threads for performance, and they want all the security... they just want to know they got those things, even if they really didn&#x27;t, because who can really notice...')
