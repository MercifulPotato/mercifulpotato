Presumably if you missed Google tooling you&#x27;d rather use Bazel, no?<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting Bazel is perfect: I think e.g. Starlark&#x27;s insistence on being a separate language does more harm than good. (FWIW I also think the JVM objection is a little silly.) But I am saying preferring the Google tooling would ostensibly mean you like Bazel a lot already :)')
