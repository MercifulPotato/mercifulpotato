In all the cases I’ve seen, there has been no recourse available to get the account back. The person hits a few walls of boilerplate responses and gives up.<p>In some cases, like this one, Facebook or Instagram will ask for identity proof, and once collected, will still send boilerplate responses that the account can’t be activated. It’s not surprising that Facebook collected his ID and still refused to help.<p>As for Facebook engineers solving complex problems with machine learning, I don’t see evidence of that. If anything, Facebook has huge disconnected code bases filled with bugs and biases that nobody can understand or do anything about.<p>This is good riddance in a way. That Facebook and Instagram are removing users who may have stayed as decent people bringing others to engage on these platforms is a net positive to society.')
