I feel like I am in a state of constant war against my body and the part of my mind that thinks it is going to starve to death. I&#x27;m sure a dozen diet-cult people will come out of the woodwork to explain to me how I just need to never eat carbs or only eat within an 8 hour window and all my problems will be solved as though I never tried any of those things in the decade or so I&#x27;ve been doing this, but it isn&#x27;t true.')
