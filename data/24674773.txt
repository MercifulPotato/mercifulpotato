It can be tricky to track down if it only happens in prod, though (due to different data â€“ like start&#x2F;end times for content coming from a CMS).<p>React could do better in both dev and prod though, IMO. It doesn&#x27;t tell you where&#x2F;which component had the issue, just the type of DOM node with a mismatch.')
