It&#x27;s just that everyone isn&#x27;t using it daily.<p>Think about this: back in the good old days that you harken back to when you say &quot;open web&quot;, could you send your grandma a meme? No? So then what&#x27;s wrong with the fact that the current open web is, although not all encompassing of internet users, many times larger than it was back then?<p>Why do we say the real internet is dying just because the 5 most used websites aren&#x27;t open? The open web is very, very open. But your mom doesn&#x27;t use it to watch videos. You&#x27;ve got Gemini, ActivityPub, Tor, bittorrent, i2p, IPFS, OpenNIC, and hundreds of other cool things that nobody can stop or control. Many of these things are less than 10 years old.<p>There&#x27;s an open web, it is growing, it is rich with information, creativity and diversity (including diversity of thought for the monoculture members out there), and all you have to do to use it is to take an interest. If you don&#x27;t like the closed web. Stop using it.')
