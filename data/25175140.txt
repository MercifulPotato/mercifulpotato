It provides great coverage on big issues, and recently, some fun ones (billie eilish comes to mind).<p>It&#x27;s unique in that it feels &quot;slower&quot;, more deliberate, and thoughtful than most newspaper&#x2F;tv channels. It gives context and covers multiple viewpoints before giving an opinion. Its daily espresso newsletter and quarterly tech issues are always interesting too.<p>I&#x27;ve subscribed to NYT and WSJ over the years, but none feels as differentiated as the Economist. (Haven&#x27;t tried Financial Times, if someone has and likes them, please do share your thoughts)')
