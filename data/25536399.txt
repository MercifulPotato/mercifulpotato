I’m not sure why M1 is any better at disk streaming samples than x86 based Mac minis either. In fact with a 16 Gb ram limit you can’t put more of those sample libraries in ram. Disk streaming of sample libraries has been a thing for 20 years+. In my DAW the sampler is never the bottleneck. I don’t use the huge multi sampled orchestral libraries but those too have been a thing for years on much more modest hardware than a recent Mac mini. A large ssd array should be plenty fast enough to support it. \nIf they are using 50 instances of high end software synthesizers, those are cpu bound.')
