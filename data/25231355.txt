There&#x27;s no mention in the post about &#x27;data&#x27; shared with the NYT, they just told them the investigations cleared them. Here&#x27;s NYT&#x27;s version:<p><i>Ms. Milosevich said Coinbase hired a consultant over the summer who did interviews and looked at the company’s history, and found “no evidence of structural bias.”<p>“Employees reported a strong culture, fair employee treatment, high employee satisfaction and high energy for belonging, inclusion and diversity,” she said.<p>Managers in the customer support team, where many of the Black employees work, wrote their own report last month.</i>')
