Apparently the Dengvaxia vaccine, while effective at reducing the chance of dengue infections, also has an effect similar to surviving an infection: it increases the chance that an infection will result in severe disease. That makes it a more complicated question whether it&#x27;s a good health intervention in particular circumstances, and in the Philippines there was a big scandal where a childhood immunization program using it may have reduced the total number of people who contracted dengue, but also increased the severity of the worst cases.<p>To my knowledge the pathogens that cause COVID-19 and dengue fever are extremely different, but it seems logically possible that there could be a COVID vaccine that greatly reduced people&#x27;s chance of getting sick at all, while also increasing the chances of severe symptoms for those people who did get sick.')
