Sure you can have reliable sources of news, but I force myself to deal with social media like entertainment so that I moderate myself. I will never sit and watch TV all day and so I will never sit and scroll through social media all day. I keep my follow list manicured so if someone is tingling my BS meter, I drop them. It is far too easy to get inside an echo chamber.  The goal is to always have credible but challenging points of view in my feed and to limit how much I time I spend in the feed.')
