Raw capacity that costs them $1 today costs them $0.80 next year, but they still sell it at the price they chose to cover the $1.<p>Having said that, there will be someone sprinting breathlessly into the thread to tell me that AWS has lowered prices on X a dozen times and on Y fourteen times and so on. But these decisions are made intermittently, by humans with bonus schemes, and AWS is harvesting the surplus in the meantime.<p>It feels from the outside as if retail Amazon pays serious, ongoing attention to selling at the minimum possible price, but AWS just doesn&#x27;t feel the same pressure to do so.')
