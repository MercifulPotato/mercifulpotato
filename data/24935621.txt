Does that mean it is low. Considering Netflix success, I am assuming there is a lot of ground to be gained there.<p>- GCP revenue at $3B seems quite low compared to even what MS reported. Their cloud(Azure + office?) revenue was $16B if I am not mistaken<p>- Dip in capital expenditure from $7 to $5 billion.
