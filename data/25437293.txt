We have ads for politics, charities, public service, pubic image of famous people, etc. We have ads for basically everything. We&#x27;ve been doing this for over 100 years too! I&#x27;m pretty sure if ads only helped sell more hamburgers then politicians would spend their campaign money elsewhere. Surely someone in the last hundred years would have figured out a better way to optimize that cash flow. But just simplifying the argument to selling more hamburgers is pretty  disingenuous.')
