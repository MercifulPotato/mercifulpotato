It flows from the Corp down to developers, managers, etc.<p>also it is good that corps and governments try to innovate and spend money on it.<p>Can it be more efficient?<p>Always(!)<p>Can it be more focused?<p>Sure.<p>But a big innovation takes a lot of factors to be well balanced and that alone is often not guaranteed nor possible given the circumstances. You just might not find the kind of devs it really needs (and not even knowing about it). So you hire the best thats available but it won&#x27;t work...<p>Bad luck. At least you tried.<p>I see it that way. Whether vcs pump millions into 100 startups so that one succeeds or corps pump millions into 100 projects... Who cares? The money is not burned. It hopefully ends in my pocket')
