Item(by='kens', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607795523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383265, text='The article doesn&#x27;t really make it clear that there&#x27;s an actual result, showing that many two-dimensional packing problems are equivalent to finding real roots of multivariate polynomials, and many problems are ∃ℝ-complete. (∃ℝ-complete is kind of like NP-complete for real numbers. The ∃ℝ complexity class lies between NP and PSPACE.)<p>The paper shows that various specific problems are ∃ℝ-complete. One such problem is packing simple polygons with at most 8 corners into a square, with rotation and translation. (E.g. cutting polygonal cookies out of dough.) Another is packing objects bounded by segments and hyperbolic curves into a square with translation but not rotation.<p>Random fact from the paper: there&#x27;s no agreement on how to pronounce ∃ℝ-complete.<p>The &quot;Existential Theory of the Reals&quot; is (ambiguiously) the ∃ℝ complexity class, a formal language, and an algorithmic problem.
