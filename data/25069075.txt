Everything you considered a product, has now become a service. We have access to transportation, accommodation, food and all the things we need in our daily lives. One by one all these things became free, so it ended up not making sense for us to own much.<p>All that becoming &quot;free&quot; (here meaning &quot;at no cost&quot;) will never happen in a capitalistic society such as many of ours. So from that point on it is pure fiction.')
