Item(by='epistasis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611889814, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25953061, text='The &quot;not enough housing to go around&quot; isn&#x27;t because of a &quot;free market&quot; (if such a thing even exists), it&#x27;s because wealthy people have enforced housing austerity and refuse to allow new housing to be built near them. Without wealthy people controlling zoning and restricting what can be built, far more people would be building their own homes, or would at least be allowed to pool together to build. Instead we hand over huge imputed rents to landlords and make anybody who is not super wealthy fight each other for the remains.<p>I think we should have robust social housing, as in Vienna or Singapore. But one thing that both places do that we do not is allow for far more housing to be built per person in high-demand areas (i.e. pricy areas). Their defining characteristic for affordability isn&#x27;t so much the social housing, it&#x27;s that they <i>build for everyone</i> as if housing were a human right, rather than a financial investment vehicle like we treat it here by enforcing scarcity.<p>To the extent that there is a &quot;free market&quot; it&#x27;s only on existing housing once it&#x27;s built. For existing housing, we let the wealthy do whatever they want, and use their market power to buy whatever they want, including hoarding it. However, it&#x27;s only because of housing austerity in the <i>building</i> of housing that this real estate becomes such a sought after commodity. It is only through scarcity and austerity of building permits that continued financial climbs are guaranteed.<p>Most of the political spectrum in the US has housing completely wrong, and thinks that everything is going to be OK if they can just keep the &quot;wrong&quot; people out. Instead, we should adopt radical inclusion and welcome all people, and adopt the true belief that <i>everyone</i> deserves housing, every single person. Not just the cool ones, <i>everyone</i>. That is, unless we want to continue the current meatgrinder of capitalism. Eviction may be the blades at the end of the grinder, but the auger is the housing scarcity and exclusion practiced by nearly every single person in the US.')
