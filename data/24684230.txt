I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but the on-by-default face retouch on my old samsung phone looks <i>horrible</i>. It makes my face look like melted plastic and makes the lens extremely blurry. A Samsung camera could have a million megapixels or whatever and it would still look like crap because of the filter, and it makes it seem like all android phones have garbage front cameras.')
