Alcohol sales in Georgia used to be prohibited on Sundays, so the most addicted alcoholics would come into her store and buy pretty much anything that had any type of alcohol in it. She said every Sunday that they would almost always sell out of mouthwash, cough syrup, rubbing alcohol, vanilla extract, nail polish remover, and even windshield wiper fluid.')
