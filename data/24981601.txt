The scope of monetary policy typically delegated to central banks is enormously powerful, but it has all the targeting selectivity of a thermonuclear bomb.<p>[0] since we are discussing MMT, we should note that the term “fiscal” is a reference to metaphor that is not at all appropriate to modern fiat currency systems, and that so-called fiscal policy <i>isn’t</i> constrained by a fisc and is just as monetary as what is traditionally called “monetary” policy. But it&#x27;s easier to use the classic terms than “taxation and spending” in place of fiscal and “central bank credit” in place of “monetary”.')
