My OSX environment fully mirrors various Linux deployment environments I run well enough to test any kind of shell scripting or crontabs or anything else I need to test locally before deploying them. Also, Parallels and VMWare both say they&#x27;ll release M1 compatible virtual machines soon should you need a specific release to test on. I don&#x27;t see the point of shelling out for Apple hardware if you just want to run a Linux distribution as your main OS. I&#x27;m more bothered by the current inability to boot into Windows.')
