They instead described the new Constitution as &quot;smelling of butter&quot;, which the censors missed due to lack of familiarity with the idiom.<p>(I once had call to describe a client&#x27;s request to micromanage which engineers were working on their account as &quot;The client believes my work product might smell of butter&quot; because my coworkers were dancing around the obvious issue so delicately that a Japanese colleague didn&#x27;t understand what they weren&#x27;t saying. That got some stares. &quot;What can I say; I learned nuance from the best.&quot;)')
