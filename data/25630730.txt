But I suspect for most people the real benefit will be protection from miscarriages of justice.<p>I&#x27;ve personally seen people put through the wringer by HR teams, and even when the HR team acknowledges they&#x27;ve fucked up, there&#x27;s no apologies or an attempt to make things right. Unions can provide protection in these case, whether that&#x27;s access to legal help, or just having a 3rd party on your side sitting in on employee dispute meetings.<p>I think a lot of people don&#x27;t appreciate how badly they can be screwed over by a HR team, accidentally or maliciously, until they find themselves in a meeting with three members of the HR team, with no one telling them what&#x27;s going on. At which point, it&#x27;s already too late to save yourself. A union gives you recourse and support, something invaluable when it you&#x27;re up against the entire HR team.')
