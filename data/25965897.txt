I use primarily either macOS or Ubuntu for development work day to day, but need to use Windows for specific builds and testing. I don&#x27;t enjoy the experience.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if these issues are because I don&#x27;t use it very frequently, but every time I start it up:<p>* CPU gets eaten alive by telemetry related services for minutes at a time.<p>* A barrage of updates I didn&#x27;t ask for get forced on me (Despite whatever settings I put)<p>* Anti malware tools cause system to be I&#x2F;O bound for about a minute<p>Longer term observations<p>* The disk usage goes up and up and up, even though I&#x27;m putting no data on to it<p>* I keep getting nagged to use a Microsoft account to sign in<p>* The default internet browser gets reset to Edge<p>* Some older applications just stop working for no reason, only to start working again weeks later.<p>On the plus side, Visual Studio seems to be much improved from what it used to be.')
