SAG, the DGA, and the WGA aren&#x27;t guaranteeing hours or limiting pay: they&#x27;re simply trying to curb abuse in what it a very abusive industry, and putting in place procedures to protect members and resolve grievances.<p>This is an important point, and one I haven&#x27;t thought of before - I think Americans often think of Unions as organizations that prevent layoffs and gain ever higher benefits, to the detriment of the company. Indeed, this announcement confirms their goals are slightly different from a typical union&#x27;s goals:<p>&gt; Its goal will be to tackle ongoing issues like pay disparity, retaliation, and controversial government contracts.')
