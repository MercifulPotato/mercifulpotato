Use a proper client and back it up.\n\n</code></pre>\nI think your advice is good for you and, perhaps, for some of us who are willing to do the work.<p>But the vast majority of people aren&#x27;t going to be able to casually fire up, for example, a Nextcloud instance and linode VPS. Not even close.<p>The long-term management of a DIY personal&#x2F;household computing infrastructure for email, important files, and online services just isn&#x27;t in the skill-set of most people who aren&#x27;t computing professionals. It&#x27;s not really even in the skill-set of most computing professionals.<p>I just used Google Checkout to get my music files after Google shutdown the play music service and transferred it to youtube music. I now have ~60GB of zips containing mp3&#x27;s and meta-data in csv files (admittedly, it was all badly curated by me with garbage id3&#x27;s and bad filenames). I&#x27;m now trying to properly tag and curate these media files and host it in some way that I can use it remotely. It&#x27;s not a trivial job. Especially because I&#x27;ve decided I don&#x27;t want surveillance capitalism coming between my music collection and me anymore (eg no spotify&#x2F;pandora&#x2F;apple-music for me). I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s trivial work for some of you but for me to manage a collection of music, it&#x27;s a challenging project with lots of trial and error (tbh, I kind of enjoy it). Can everyone do this? Definitely not. It&#x27;s a massive DIY undertaking.<p>If we&#x27;re now talking about email and files which are more important that one&#x27;s cool music collection, it&#x27;s a whole other ball game. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good solution for those of us who don&#x27;t want to roll-our-own infrastructure.')
