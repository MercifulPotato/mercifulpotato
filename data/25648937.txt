For the US and most countries it was what you would expect: porn, sports, movie and music stars.<p>Now for Iran it was control theory, FPGA design, chemical engineering, etc.. I suspect only weapons designers had internet access.  Maybe universities, but no porn?  Not likely..<p>So Google trends no longer shows porn or Iran.')
