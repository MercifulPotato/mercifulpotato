I’m not talking about canvassing and re-counts, because those only look at the very last step in the process of tabulation.<p>We should always be looking into voter rolls of who voted versus things like change-of-address filings and death certificates. We should always be checking the math on percentage of registered voters and looking at outliers. We should always be investigating provisional ballots, for example people who came to vote in person and were told they already voted. And probably many other things along these lines.<p>I think the other side of this is that the Constitution puts States firmly in control of their own voting process and procedures, which means there are 50 different sets of rules for how these elections can be held, and then in the months and weeks leading up to elections there’s a flurry of lawsuits that try to change all the rules one way or another, sometimes with changes being made up until the final moments of the election. This hugely erodes public trust in the entire process.<p>Now, I think Twitter has made some objectively very bad calls in the name of censorship the last few months. Freezing the NY Post’s account after the Hunter Biden story in particular. I think the “this tweet is disputed” flags are ultimately another failure on their part. Aside from being objectively the wrong thing to do in some cases, mostly I just doubt that these actions will have remotely the intended effect.')
