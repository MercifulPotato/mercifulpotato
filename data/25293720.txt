If you used this latch as the output latch in a flip flop, it would glitch on the falling edge of the flip flop clock.<p>I didn&#x27;t go through the entire game, so its entirely possible that it would not affect this particular &quot;design&quot;. But as its far more educational than practical, I think its still worth mentioning.<p>&gt; Especially because the d-flipflops found in standard cell libraries are frequently implemented as what amounts to two muxes and some inverters.<p>I&#x27;m curious where you&#x27;ve seen that implementation because I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that. Most of what I&#x27;ve seen uses two tri-state inverter latches.')
