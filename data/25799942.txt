A large enough uniform density sphere of say styrofoam would form an event horizon.<p>In terms of evidence, “Frozen stars” don’t match up with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory’s observations that suggest a collision between a black hole and a neutron star.<p>That said, the Messier 87 black hole image is the closest thing to a direct observation we have.  It’s possible that some mistakes where made, but many would argue it’s solid evidence on it’s own.<p>PS: Anyway, I am not suggesting this as some statement from on high.  I am saying if most people that take serious time and effort looking into something all come to the same conclusion it’s prudent to dig deep before coming to a different conclusion.  That’s especially true of physics where actually understanding the math behind existing models is difficult.  Essentially you should be able to point to some math and say <i>see this, this is wrong</i> and then justify that statement.')
