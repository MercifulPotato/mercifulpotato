Roughly half of the 100 largest food retail chains use Hazel technology, and we proudly count Uber Eats, Instacart, Target, Starbucks, and Whole Foods among our customers. In 2019, we won two food safety innovation awards, and we still have big ambitions to keep advancing the state of the art in food safety management. We&#x27;re also honored to have been recognized by Built in Seattle as one of Seattle&#x27;s best small businesses to work for in 2020.<p>We&#x27;re currently seeking experienced full-stack and back-end software engineers to help us realize our ambitions. Back-end engineers will work predominantly in our Google Cloud Platform environment with Python (Flask), Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL 12 (on Google Cloud SQL), and Docker; full-stack engineers will tend to work a bit less in infrastructure and will add JavaScript (React) to their areas of expertise. We keep processes and meetings to a minimum in order for engineers to stay in the zone. Our team culture is laid-back and friendly, balanced by a strong sense of personal ownership and motivation to deliver; we&#x27;re a small company, so engineers collaborate closely with non-engineers. People who are eager to mentor junior engineers are strongly encouraged to apply, as are folks with a background in devops, data science, or UI&#x2F;UX.<p>Compensation is $110K - $160K (DOE), plus equity and a generous benefits package (including parental leave). We&#x27;re currently working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic but planning on an eventual return to in-office work; at present, we&#x27;re not considering fully-remote team members, but I&#x27;ll continue to weigh it for the future. We aren&#x27;t able to provide H1B sponsorship; relocation assistance within the United States is negotiable. This role is not considered entry-level.<p>Full-stack candidates: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;hazelanalytics&#x2F;7c4ae7ec-ed3f-45cf-b2e9-0a8146b89840?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=Hacker%20News" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;hazelanalytics&#x2F;7c4ae7ec-ed3f-45cf-b2e9...</a><p>Back-end candidates: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;hazelanalytics&#x2F;64f146aa-a334-4491-915d-9e0bed3b0ba3?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=Hacker%20News" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;hazelanalytics&#x2F;64f146aa-a334-4491-915d...</a><p>(I&#x27;m the hiring manager for these roles; I&#x27;ve personally hired and _been_ hired through HN Who&#x27;s Hiring threads.)')
