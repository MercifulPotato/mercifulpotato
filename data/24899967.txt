The common person primarily votes based solely on a historical allegiance to a political party (be it individually formed or inherited) with about 75% of America essentially being unmovable D or R safe votes.<p>Censorship is a hard question and I think we do need to have better laws promoting free access to material (even &quot;libelous&quot; material) but this is also an area where I think it&#x27;s pretty clear the government has failed in a big way - twitter + FB shouldn&#x27;t be news platforms, the dumb news aggregators (like google news) do a pretty good job of being dumb platforms, but those commentary platforms are being run by private entities that can &quot;censor&quot; speech as they like depending on how it benefits or harms their platform.  America is in a bit of a crisis right now since the extreme partisan divide has driven the real media (print, TV) to actually split into mutually disproving and incompatible bubbles.  On election night one half of the country is going to be absolutely astounded since everything they consumed said their candidate was going to win.<p>I&#x27;m not certain what the solution is but some moderation is required to prevent the apparent acceptance of some pretty hateful views along with conspiracy theories.  The Internet introduced clickbait to the world in a manner it never previously conceived of - tabloids have been around for ever but never gotten serious consideration - suddenly major political figures are embracing and re-packaging tabloid headlines and it&#x27;s a bit of a crisis of information for our society.')
