Your list is pretty broad and COBOL probably won&#x27;t help.<p>It&#x27;s what value you can provide with those that counts.<p>One of my earlier companies started with a policy \nagainst hiring folks who just knew PHP, even though that was our main language. We wanted folks who knew SQL, some JS, maybe some C or something to prove they were well-rounded and could think about tech as a whole.<p>We dropped that policy when folks started coming in with _just_ Ruby on Rails under their belt. They were destroying our project-based interview and blasting out projects in weeks that typically took us months. And we found that we could easily teach them the SQL they needed when they needed it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s _just that easy_ but if a dev hits my interview process and shows they can understand my customer&#x27;s needs and build out a solution to those needs quickly, I _very much_ want to give them a job.')
