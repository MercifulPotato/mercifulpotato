But even if just a small fraction of civilizations engaged in interstellar expansion, they&#x27;d quickly subsume the galaxy on geological timescales. Darwin applies just as much across the stars as it does in a tide pool. As long as there&#x27;s even a small amount of competition, it will push every player to aggressively expand.<p>The only way out is either 1) technological civilization almost never evolve anywhere. 2) Virtually every technological civilization winds up eschewing interstellar expansion. Or 3) a single player previously won the game, and used its dominant position to benevolently stop the game.')
