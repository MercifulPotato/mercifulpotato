That is, be a concentrated anger-machine-echo-chamber. I&#x27;m not angry at the public corporations that have dropped Parler. I&#x27;m angry at the people that created Parler in the first place. It was basically a poison pill designed to test our feelings about free speech, designed to provoke. Mission accomplished, buttheads.<p>I think we&#x27;ll see the angry mob go end up at less discoverable, but more robust distributed platforms. Which is a shame, because it means eventually, when I say that you can find me on Mastadon&#x2F;Scuttlebutt&#x2F;etc, the average person will say, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re on that extremist network?&quot;<p>The benefit to Facebook&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;Twitter is that while Parler is dominating the discussion, they can start cleaning up their most toxic communities.')
