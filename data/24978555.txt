One was vertically integrated solutions, the linked article talks about this, where you would buy the workstation to run the software, or even buy them together as a packaged solution.<p>I used to work for a company that did this called MSI. It developed an application for designing mobile telephone radio networks. You would load up a terrain map, specify the location, height and antenna type of your transmitters, and it would calculate signal strength, interference, traffic capture, etc. we&#x27;d sell the software, workstations, backup systems, storage arrays, etc as a turn key system.<p>The second pillar was as development systems for server or mainframe applications. You wanted to be developing on a system with the same architecture and software as the target system. To an extent you can lump in sysadmin workstations into this category. When I was a sysadmin I&#x27;d develop scripts on my workstation, and often compile and test open source software on it before deploying it to our environment, such as GhostScript, Apache and early versions of Python. Yep, back then these didn&#x27;t come along with the OS.<p>The third pillar was academia and scientific institutions, where they were used for analytical work, or to develop custom software needed for particular research projects, or tools needed by the institutions.<p>Most of the vertically integrated ISV stuff moved to Windows, but some such as CAD and VFX is still rooted in Linux. The other two niches, dev workstations and scientific applications, also either went to windows or to Linux. So yes it didn&#x27;t all go to Linux, but the slices of the pies that didn&#x27;t got to Windows mostly went to Linux.')
