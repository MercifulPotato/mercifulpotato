It should have been one of the first after basic calc&#x2F;vector calc!<p>The typical progression is to start with systems you can solve by hand and then move to ones you canâ€™t usually solve, but can still usefully describe, teaching how to analyze them.<p>It should be the other way around! Start with generally useful tools that apply broadly and then teach the special cases you happen to be able to solve analytically. General tools like basins of attraction and nondimensionalization, should be considered more rudimentary than perfect closed form solutions.')
