There may be a day when the knowledge is obsolete. Where we can coordinate politically and socially enough to eliminate all usage of bash and $PATH. But those are social and political problems.<p>As a programmer, I expect you to have the technical knowledge necessary to do your job. Stop complaining about the social and political context that brought $PATH to existence and just know how to use it, and don&#x27;t write something like it yourself.<p>Programming is not AWFUL. People and the social and political aspects of interacting with others is AWFUL and always will be. We work around it, we make it better, and we improve it. But no, our tools are not CRAP, they&#x27;re not AWFUL. We build amazing, wonderful things with these tools.<p>What a short-sighted perspective. Just pass. Seriously.')
