You have the makings of a culture where people bust their balls for 18 hours a day in order to meet their objectives and don&#x27;t tell you that they&#x27;re spending 18 hours and not 8 hours, because they don&#x27;t want to rock the boat.<p>Yes, meeting objectives matter. But setting the right objectives is a conversation between the business&#x27;s wish list and the constraints of the resources that the business actually has. Trust is a two-way street; too many managers talk about trusting their workers but they don&#x27;t talk about what they do to earn their workers&#x27; trust.')
