I&#x27;ve been more than pleasantly surprised with the amount of games with minimal fuss that I have been able to get to not only run, but run VERY well on my new M1 MBA.  For example, I think there is going to be far more expansion of Mac in gaming than there is going to be with Linux and as for hardware all it will take is for a desktop with a PCI slot and some driver support.  It would not surprise me if Apple and AMD weren&#x27;t working on Apple Silicon drivers already, especially if the rumored mythical &quot;xMac&quot; mini tower is indeed in play (I hope so!).  I can get enough games running on my MBA right now that at this point I would have to think really long and hard about upgrading my Windows gaming box.')
