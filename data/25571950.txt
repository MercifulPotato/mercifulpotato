The monthly payments today are actually 40% lower on an inflation adjusted basis. Only the down payment is more expensive, by 30% after inflation.<p>I’m going to go with 1990 for a specific date. According to their source, house prices have gone up 2.6x since then.<p>In 1990 the prevailing mortgage interest rate was a little over 10%. Today its about 3%. For a house that costs the exact same amount, the payments today are 2.1x less. Conversely, the same payments today let you afford a house that costs 2.1x more.<p>Additionally, as far as I can tell, that figure isn’t adjusted for inflation, which is 1.99x since 1990.<p>Combining inflation and more affordable payments, an equally affordable house would today cost 4.2x what it did in 1990. Seeing “only” a 2.6x increase, the inflation adjusted monthly mortgage payments are almost 40% <i>lower</i> today. For the down payment, however, the easy credit doesn’t help you, only the inflation, so a median inflation adjusted down payment is still 30% more expensive today.<p>That’s my best guess for macro explanation. Cheaper credit and inflation.')
