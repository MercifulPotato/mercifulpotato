It&#x27;s time to shift from rote learning exams to another format (essay, lab assignments for computer science). Else it&#x27;s simply an arm race for cheating (soon some kid will just get an e-ink display in a picture frame and as soon as it goes out of the proctor&#x27;s webcam field of view will turn into a cheat sheet).')
