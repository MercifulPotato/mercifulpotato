HTMX maybe. That project has some good examples in the docs.<p>Googling can help in some ways, but it&#x27;s also casting way too wide a net in others, especially if you keep repeating that step. It&#x27;s like walking out into the street and shouting, &quot;I WANT TO BUILD AN APP&quot; infrequently, and then wondering why you keep doing this instead of building apps.<p>Perhaps it would help the author to think more about creating their own process for selecting, refining, and testing methodologies first, then ramp up to building an app second.')
