For this type of recommendation, I (personally) would want to know the person so I could guess at what their reaction would be.<p>This is also more unconventional than typical, no one ever recommended I take ayahuasca, so for me personally it would be novel enough that it wouldn’t be frustrating to get recommended it by an acquaintance. This is my perspective.<p>I would caution against the mindset in the middle of your paragraph though (“they must want to be healed”). I wanted nothing more to be healed, it’s just after 36 months of being poked and prodded by medical professionals it always struck me as a little haughty that someone else I didn’t know at all would presume to know enough about my situation to think their advice would be useful. But this is just my experience, and I only ever got useful unsolicited advice a couple times.<p>I just think people need to be emotionally in tune with their conversation partners, and if you don’t know them well enough to read them then you probably don’t need to be giving them advice anyway.')
