I don&#x27;t use any external libraries. I converted the input databases to lisp and compiled them in, and the output is simple postscript.  When I want to deploy I dump a core with the compiled functionality, then run sbcl with that core.  At some point I was using hunchentoot[1] to provide an http point of entry (great library, as all the ones written by Edi Weitz) but I am not bothering anymore, as most of the processing time is consumed by ghostscript and convert in the post-processing of the images.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edicl.github.io&#x2F;hunchentoot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edicl.github.io&#x2F;hunchentoot&#x2F;</a>')
