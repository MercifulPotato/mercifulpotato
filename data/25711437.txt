And they were being beaten and gassed by police, they weren&#x27;t killing police officers. I hear you that if that mob killed someone it would be just as bad, 100% agree.<p>&gt; It boggles my mind to think that censorship is how to handle dissent.<p>Because you have the right to be a jerk in your own house, but not in mine. Twitter is not Trump&#x27;s house, it&#x27;s Jack&#x27;s and his shareholders. Trump&#x27;s being a jerk so them kicked him out. Some things that will get you banned on Twitter, FB will let slide and visa versa. If people don&#x27;t like their policies, they can leave. It&#x27;s a free market, which is a traditional Republican position. It&#x27;s never been a Republican position to force a company to allow someone to create their own Terms &amp; Conditions or User Agreement or force companies to accept someone as a customer until this modern &quot;free speech should apply to private companies&quot; movement.<p>And dissent is different than lying. It&#x27;s clear his ego can&#x27;t handle losing and he will desperately resort to pressure folks to &quot;find votes&quot; in Georgia, or pressure Senators to not certify electoral votes that withstood every legal challenge. This isn&#x27;t normal and this isn&#x27;t OK. It&#x27;s not like this is a healthy debate or a passionate dissent that someone&#x27;s getting deplatformed for. This is a dangerous, self-indulgent, completely self-serving game of lying to the public that&#x27;s already resulted in multiple deaths.<p>If Trump gets arrested for speaking his mind in a public park then we have a huge problem. Until then, he can build his own platform and spout his ideas there. No one is stopping him and no one should.')
