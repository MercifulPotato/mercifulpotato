During the first half (weekdays) it attracted different people, who just didn&#x27;t seem to care for alcohol. When I arrived it took a while to notice, but I could spot maybe two or three beers in the crowd? Of course many people were on all sorts of drugs (but many also perfectly sober).<p>People were high, spaced out, suddenly worshipping a tree, or whatever, but none of them were loud, annoying or in the way. Not even the guy who had taken this drug (I&#x27;m not sure what kind) that makes your jaws go all tight, something that I associated with aggression, but he was having a great time and being nice.<p>When the weekend came, a different sort of people arrived, who did like to drink alcohol during the shows. And the difference was just <i>huge</i>.<p>Suddenly when there was groups of people standing around, some of them were yelling or seemingly unaware of their voice loudness. It was nothing bad of course, &quot;normal&quot; behaviour with alcohol, expected. But the contrast with people partying to their hearts&#x27; content, just without alcohol, was immense.<p>People were in the way, and stumbling around unpredictably. And I don&#x27;t mean people that were very drunk, it was only half way the evening. It was just the aggregate effect of adding some ethanol&#x2F;beer into a large crowd on a festival, but the difference was absolutely striking.<p>And then think about this crowd has been on all the other drugs in the days before, but then ethanol arrives, and the <i>entire</i> atmosphere on the festival just changes.<p>Cannabis is nothing like that. I mean just imagine the same situation a few days without and then with cannabis :) It wouldn&#x27;t change hardly anything (especially if they had been consuming other stuff) and if anything, I expect an increase in giggles and quietness ...<p>It also reminded me that before that festival I had almost always been consuming cannabis and ethanol at the same time. I don&#x27;t really do that any more.')
