Item(by='darkwizard42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609040181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542058, text='I LOVE this game but also think the steep learning curve for any new entrants into a group which is already familiar with the sets in question gives a big advantage to the veteran players.<p>I also think with too many expansions mixed together you end up with some very interesting and sometimes very dull games (all +money, no +action or +card). The sets are very well-designed to play within themselves, but when mixed with others the results can be mixed.<p>Last, too many mats and tokens to keep track of really detracts from fun with the game.<p>All this being said I have 6 expansions I have picked up with my partner over Craigslist and FB Marketplace and will continue to hunt for more!')
