They think they&#x27;re experts in everything remotely related to medicine, public health, pharmacology, and often a lot more besides. Just being a doctor is in no way a qualification to speak sensibly about pandemics, economics, or anything else outside their particular narrow field of training and experience.<p>Using motor oil on a daily basis doesn&#x27;t qualify my car mechanic as an expert on the international oil supply chain; dealing with individual sick people doesn&#x27;t qualify a doctor as an epidemiologist or economist. Maybe in this particular case your doctor friend IS an actual epidemiologist or economist, but I suspect that&#x27;s not that case.')
