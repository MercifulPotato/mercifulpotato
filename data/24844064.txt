Trust lasts until the next bad quarter if you&#x27;re lucky, because ultimately a company will choose to abuse your trust rather than go under.<p>I don&#x27;t want to come down too hard on companies here, they exist to make money, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re for (and plenty of them provide very useful services).<p>But the concept of trust doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense here. The people that make up a company aren&#x27;t constant, and if you do find a company with trustworthy employees, they won&#x27;t take your data with them when they leave, they will leave it for the next person to abuse.<p>Trusting a company beyond what they explicitly promise (anything in a EULA-like document that says they can change things at any time doesn&#x27;t count) is setting yourself up to be screwed down the road.')
