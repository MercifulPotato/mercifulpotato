It&#x27;s like when people try to apply feminist theory or diversity theory. (Some notes on diversity theory here, turn on showdead in your profile to see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25505252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25505252</a>)<p>I think either Assange only realized it when he got to the point of no return... or will never realize it. But at least, it&#x27;s a lesson for everyone else who is sharp enough to see it.<p>If you&#x27;re smart enough, you can work for the elites and rise in the ranks, and get what you want.<p>I&#x27;m sure Snowden had time to realize it... except he had settle for working for different set of elites than what he started out doing. Overall, I think he got pretty lucky. Unfortunately for Assange, things don&#x27;t look so good.')
