As noted elsewhere in the thread, feudal societies used to see most wealth accumulated in the form of real estate, which is more or less the definition of immobile capital. We&#x27;ve built huge and complex social institutions around making capital mobile, and even allowed them to suck up a rather notable percentage of GDP.<p>Imagine what a world would look like that put as much effort into the free movement of labor. And note: not <i>all</i> capital is internationally mobile, and in the same spirit, nobody would sensibly suggest that <i>all</i> labor would or should become mobile. There&#x27;s plenty of room and benefits for investing both close to home (which is all part of &quot;putting down roots&quot;). It&#x27;s a question of balance between local, regional, national and global for both capital and labor mobility.')
