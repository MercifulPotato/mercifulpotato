I can describe a problem quite well, and describe it well enough that I could be said to understand it. But I really can&#x27;t put many problems into math. I&#x27;ve seen others do it, and it seems like a wonder to me. I&#x27;m not a dumb guy either, but my english and math scores on my SAT were off by more than 130 points. Some people in this thread are claiming that it&#x27;s foolish to think that some people don&#x27;t have math brains. I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you -- you&#x27;re simply wrong. Could I understand math better than I do? Almost certainly, but it&#x27;s unlikely I could ever be an engineer.')
