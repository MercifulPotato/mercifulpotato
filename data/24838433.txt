Which to me doesn&#x27;t seem to be the figure of merit worth focussing on, since diffraction losses at visible light wavelengths are very small compared to radio based systems, so you will in fact be receiving a <i>lot</i> of photons.   The noise from the sun and other light sources will be far bigger than the signal, so an extra 3dB of amplifier noise actually is a pretty small issue...')
