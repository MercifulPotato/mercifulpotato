I meant actual pipes. Like sewage piping.<p>Reread my pipe example but imagine a 2D diagram of physical pipes instead. This is the physical analog of the point free style and the origin of the term when used in unix. The diagram should get around the problem that is caused by the point free style (aka Unix piping) when you use text to represent the concept. In fact this is one of the few times where graphical representations of programming is clearly superior to text.')
