And if you got back an error, you wouldn&#x27;t know whether it was the userID or the password that was invalid. SMTP can be used, however, since that protocol is designed to be able to send messages to a user on any mail server. (See my earlier reply for an explanation of how this can be done with SMTP: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24834067" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24834067</a>)')
