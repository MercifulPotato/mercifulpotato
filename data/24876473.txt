I said, if you have a better way for us to administrate this, please start a discussion. If the pros outweigh the cons, we&#x27;ll transition off.<p>Under the old model (non-monorepo), you merge and release one repo. Then you have to open a pull request in another repo to do a dependency bump. That step is busy work that doesn&#x27;t provide real value to the business, and it&#x27;s something you need to regularly if all of your repos are being actively developed.')
