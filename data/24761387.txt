Just the documentation for backups on your Hetzner server is ridiculous. Why, in the 21st century, should I as an application developer ever have to worry about that?<p>Let&#x27;s say that Hetzner server goes completely toast at 2am and you get a pingdom message. You log in, realize you have to restore from backup. You fire up a new instance, and go through your restore procedure, and everything works great. You&#x27;re lucky to be offline for an hour.<p>I cannot even tell you what would happen if an underlying instance running a Lambda goes offline, because it never happens. But let&#x27;s say that an underlying machine dies in us-east-1. Lambda just starts running more instances of your code on another underlying group of cpus, and you aren&#x27;t offline.')
