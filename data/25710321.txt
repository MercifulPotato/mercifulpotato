Last year I moved to a startup where I had to scale code to 5000-10000 concurrent users which has been done nicely so far! \nNow I have to refactor one of its core functionality  to enterprise level software. In short it would be a logistic division of my company and whose end users would be 3-4 tier city users of India who aren’t really so tech Savy ( basically it means exceptions catching and validations should be full proof). Last written code has been working good so far but I am not happy with the ‘if else’ way code has been written! \nAny suggestions on how to architect a logistic company or how to refactor code that with assumptions it would fail and recover automatically or atleast points developer&#x2F;data team that some thing wrong has happened (as there are 2-3 dbs which have to kept in sync, thanks to micro services :&#x2F;) \nIn short I have never written enterprise grade application !\nAny suggestions&#x2F;advise would be highly appreciated.')
