For example, compare his article to the Times article on the same case: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;supreme-court-google-oracle.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;us&#x2F;supreme-court-google-o...</a>.<p>It&#x27;s not enough to say that Lee is writing for a specialized audience while the Times caters to a more general audience.
