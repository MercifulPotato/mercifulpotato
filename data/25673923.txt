But for the typical blog post, or especially if the blog post has code snippets that you want to have syntax-highlighted, a static site generator is way easier to work with.<p>With the pace of change, I do worry a bit about the longevity of some of today&#x27;s static site generators, but the Markdown itself is pretty darn portable.')
