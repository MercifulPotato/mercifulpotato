Item(by='bb88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606602956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240549, text='&gt; Windows, MacOS, and iOS&#x2F;Android would all be stinking piles of hot garbage if it weren&#x27;t for open source, but then again Linux or the *BSD operating systems wouldn&#x27;t be where they are today without contributions from companies acting to make a profit.<p>The open source part doesn&#x27;t change anything.  Windows has so many hooks that 1984 (the book, not the year) is now a reality in 2020 with DLP software watching employees.  Apple&#x27;s walled garden is not there to encourage growth inside the walls but to extract profit from those that flourish inside of it.  And linux is so fragmented because everyone has a great new idea which requires a new X where X is a UI, library, window manager, etc.<p>Interesting that back in 1980&#x27;s the Apple II line was frankly pretty darn well open.  Sure Apple had copyrights on the assembly, but if you looked at the magazines at the time there were lots of articles giving annotated disassembly of Apple&#x27;s object code.  And yet, Apple sold a bunch of computers anyway.  Wow.  Fucking genius.<p>Sure Apple is fighting the Good Fight with privacy (and I&#x27;ve yet to see that it&#x27;s anything different than pure marketing).  But I ask why should Apple need to market &quot;privacy first&quot; when they can just open up their software and show us directly?  Let&#x27;s start by open sourcing any telemetry they send back to the mothership.  Is that reasonable perhaps?')
