Since we seem to agree that an external observer sees a coordinate singularity at the horizon [0], it is not clear to me that there is an objective answer to what &quot;their&quot; coordinate system looks like on the interior. I tend to use a hyperbolic coordinate system. In the region on the outside of the horizon, it matches the natural coordinate system for an observer maintaining constant acceleration away from the black hole. From a purely geometric perspective, it is also defined on the region inside the horizon.<p>By &quot;time coordinate&quot; I mean the hyperbolic angle. This corresponds to the proper time of our constantly accelerating observer. This remains a well defined coordinate on the interior of the black hole. As you identify, in the language of relativity, this is a spatial coordinate on the interior of the horizon. I specifically refer to this as &quot;coordinate time&quot; because it is the coordinate that our observer is using for time; not because it is actually a time coordinate in all regions of space-time.<p>&gt; No, which is what makes statements like &quot;infinite coordinate time&quot; incorrect; the correct statement is that neither coordinate patch covers the horizon at all.<p>You do not need to consider the horizon itself. Consider just portion of the path that occurs before the horizon. This path crosses infinite coordinate time. Put another way, the singularity in this coordinate system is precisely that coordinate time diverges towards infinity as you approach the horizon. Put another way, if you pick any finite amount of coordinate time, you can find a portion of free-falling path from before the horizon that crosses that amount of coordinate time .<p>[0] Although I think we need to be a bit more careful about what we mean by external observer for this to be formally true. A free falling observer is &quot;external&quot; until they cross the horizon, but they don&#x27;t see a coordinate singularity there.')
