That&#x27;s why SegWit2x didn&#x27;t happen three years ago. All the miners supported it, because bigger blocks means bigger transaction fees. Full nodes and core devs didn&#x27;t support it, because big blocks means you won&#x27;t be able to run Bitcoin on PCs much longer and therefore centralized online service providers will control it.')
