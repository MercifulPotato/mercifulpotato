From the beginning I chose to use recent daily deaths per capita as my measure of how badly a country is being hit by COVID &quot;right now&quot;. It is true that my first response did not make this explicit, and in retrospect I should have done so. Please read all my comments charitably, as I have done with yours.<p>I have already agreed that the measures you are using are also valid and that the trends are bad. However your points 1-4 are entirely about cases, trends, and the future, which has nothing to do with the point I made.<p>Accusing me of &quot;laughing at Europe&quot; is the sort of toxic rhetoric which doesn&#x27;t belong on HN and frankly says more about you than it does about my argument. I live in one of the worst-hit yet most-developed countries, and some of our ICUs have run out of beds.')
