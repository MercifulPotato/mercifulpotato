Elon Musk and Linus have had unrelated arguments where they engaged in very offensive argumentation (calling their opponents pedophiles, telling them to kill themselves) without any evidence, yet I rarely see these issues brought up on unrelated issues about them. But for Timnit, it&#x27;s a scarlet letter she has to bear.<p>b. I think we substantially underestimate how frustrating it might be to be a scientist of color where people are <i>constantly</i> discounting your expertise (because, yes, Timnit is an <i>expert</i>.) I&#x27;m sure seeing that same sentiment for the ith+1 time can evoke strong emotions and we are not necessarily seeing the context.<p>Regardless, maybe not an incredible look for Timnit but not super huge in the context of a large body of work.')
