The authors say (in the preprint [1]):<p>&quot;The trained network was able to differentiate positive and negative IBV samples with high accuracy (91.4%), sensitivity (91.9%) and specificity (90.9%) (Fig.2G). Of note, these probabilities refer to single virus particles in the sample and not the whole sample; the probability of correctly identifying a sample with hundreds or thousands of IBV virus particles will therefore approach 100%. &quot;<p>But then when the actual lab tests are performed:<p>&quot;The trained network was able to distinguish between virus-positive and virus-negative samples with excellent accuracy, distinguishing between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative BBXs with an accuracy of ~70% (Fig.3A)&quot;.<p>An accuracy of 70% is totally useless for such tests if widely applied, right? What am I missing here?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.10.13.20212035v3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.10.13.20212035v...</a>')
