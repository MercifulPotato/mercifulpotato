I want to setup some victim machines and applications to practice on (e.g. DVWA), use tools like Metasploit, learn more about Kali, etc...  What are some good recommendations for getting started on this journey? Whether it&#x27;s some good tools for setting up victim machines, useful books, or just sharing your own experiences with how you got started for some motivation.  Thanks!')
