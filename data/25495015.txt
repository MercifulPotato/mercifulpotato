And if you don&#x27;t deny free of charge use, you will have hard time doing business. Many enterprises (all?) have a procurement process which requires to look for a cheaper or a free alternative. If you provide Mongo under AGPL, it will be harder to get a company to buy a subscription. Procurement officer will nag you with questions why should we pay if there is a free alternative (that&#x27;s what you call market cannibalization)? Support is the thing that usually gets a procurement through but that effectively cancels all the &quot;unicorn&quot; growth (if most revenues come from support contracts as opposed to licenses) and essentially puts you outside the &quot;blue ocean&quot; because human support does not scale as software can.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blue_Ocean_Strategy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blue_Ocean_Strategy</a><p>Edit: someone mentioned AWS Linux and k8s below, I think it&#x27;s really off in business terms.
