Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603239320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24842054, text='$20,000 was chosen because LISEP concluded that anything beneath that wage could fairly be considered a poverty wage, based on the U.S. poverty guidelines put out by the Department of Health and Human Services, which considers a three-person household to be in poverty if it has an income of less than $20,000 per year.<p>Which underlines my point - poverty is not the same as unemployment. For starters, not all people live in three-persons households, especially ones that earn low wages (e.g. single young people just starting their professional careers). Secondly, defining every poor person as &quot;unemployed&quot; is making the term meaningless - just say &quot;poor&quot; then.<p>&gt; Because your comment is full of generalizations and cynicism<p>I raised very specific issues with this methodology, and with the terminology specifically, but if all you can do is dismiss them as &quot;cynicism&quot; (do you even know what it means? it doesn&#x27;t match any part of my objections) then fine, whatever.<p>I am objecting to the use of an established term to mean something this term is not supposed to mean. There&#x27;s nothing &quot;cynical&quot; about it.')
