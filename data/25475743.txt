Concise-and-clear is preferred over verbose-and-clear.<p>Except this is where the contradiction lies. In both well written literature and great text books... clarity trumps all even when conciseness is sacrificed. English is one of the most verbose languages out there. I can take your sentence and make it concise:<p>&gt;My eye bleed.<p>&gt;Writing about struct. No verbose or repeat. Short n&#x27; Clear beter den wordy n&#x27; Clear.<p>Is that better? Your misguided logic paints my concise version of your comment as &quot;preferred&quot; even though it has the exact same clarity. The stark reality is, for purely human reasons, people prefer the former example over the later and there is no real rationality behind it.<p>Try to think a bit outside of the box here. You share the biased and delusional opinion of a typical average programmer.<p>The real logic is, that the conciseness or verbosity is inconsequential. Our human nature allows us to prefer contradictory approaches in code vs. english because verbosity and conciseness doesn&#x27;t actually matter that much. Clarity is king by a long shot hence the reason why most humans prefer reading literature over code.<p>My code displays the ultimate clarity. You insultingly claim that your eyes may be bleeding, but I guarantee you that unless you&#x27;re mentally deficient, no part of my code was unclear. It was 100% obvious and crystal clear what my intentions are. The best part is, you only need to read it one time.<p>When is the last time in your life you&#x27;ve read a similar snippet of unfamiliar production code at first glance and left with the exact same level of clarity? Most similar production code needs a good number of guesses and hypothesis and a couple of reads and code following to develop the same level of clarity and confidence of understanding that my code can produce on a SINGLE reading.<p>I would wager we can agree on that point and if your claim otherwise I would wager that you are lying.')
