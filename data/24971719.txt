He did not mow it for a few years and the trees just took over. It took him years and a lot of hard work to clear it back to a field. Certainly in Vermont, the forests are voracious.  They will quickly take over almost any open land.  Obviously, different parts of the world have very different ecosystems, but in New England, I do not think replanting trees is needed.')
