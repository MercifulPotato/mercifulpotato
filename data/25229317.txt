So I expect there&#x27;s going to be a pretty painful transition period where Docker works on M1 Macs but a lot of popular images don&#x27;t.<p>Or maybe Docker&#x27;s official response will be a Docker for Mac release that still runs x86 in a qemu VM or something, and arm64 Docker on M1 Macs will remain an oddity for a while. But I hope they lean into improving tooling for dual-architecture support, because I think we&#x27;re increasingly moving into a dual architecture world, and not just because of the M1: as ARM becomes more popular in production, I&#x27;m sure more people are going to also find themselves in the opposite situation with x86 workstations &amp; arm64 production servers.')
