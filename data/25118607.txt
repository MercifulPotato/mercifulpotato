It does, which involves removing potentially harmful posts. Is this censorship to you?<p>Now regardless of 230, if the government says &quot;twitter, you can not moderate.&quot; That is a violation of Twitter&#x27;s freedom of speech. It can moderate content however it pleases as of now.<p>&gt; I know there is no law preventing social media from censoring people. If there was, we wouldn&#x27;t be arguing about this right now. What I&#x27;m saying is that free speech should be extended to social media.<p>The reason there is no law is because it&#x27;s unconstitutional. The government can&#x27;t force speech on platforms, even if said platforms are not responsible for its content.')
