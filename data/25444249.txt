This guy lost his life savings in crypto, while other people poured everything into Worldcom, their dream home in Miami, etc. Crypto might be riskier than those classes of asset, and its evangelists might be at fault for encouraging first-time investors to make potentially ruinous bets -- but the story of people becoming overly invested, emotionally and financially, in the new hot thing is much older than ethereum.<p>It was also in poor taste to scold him on the GH issue. It can wait, poor guy is just asking for help.')
