They can absolutely have meanings assigned outside the usual &quot;when multiplied by a vector&quot; type of calculations. For example the &quot;adjacency matrix&quot; representation of a graph is very often never multiplied by a vector even in academic algorithm descriptions. YMMV if you call it a (lookup) table in that context but the term &quot;matrix&quot; seems fairly well established there.')
