It&#x27;s been a while since I read it, but they&#x27;ve definitely found and punished misbehaving suppliers.<p>I think I remember one instance where underage workers were discovered and Apple forced the supplier to finance their higher education. In another they found a false wall had been installed in a factory to conceal hazardously stored chemicals and, again if memory serves, immediately terminated the supplier&#x27;s contract.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;supplier-responsibility&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;supplier-responsibility&#x2F;</a><p>According to HN search this is the only comment in over 600 that mentions this page. Beyond the marketing text, the PDFs at the bottom cover thousands of pages of supplier guidelines, government filings, lists of suppliers, audit results, etc.<p>Take with as large a grain of salt as you&#x27;d like, but at least it is a primary source on the topic. Apple naturally will be tightlipped during their investigation of these incidents, but I&#x27;m curious how they will be covered in their subsequent publications.')
