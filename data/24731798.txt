Raphael and I recreated \nthis unpublished part in a new DSL.<p>&gt; The DGFiP also did not wish to publish its internal test \nsets. We therefore proceed to the creation of a completely \nrandom test set, from the unpublished content, in order to \nbe able to reproduce the validation of Mlang outside the \nDGFiP.<p>&gt; A little less than a year after the publication of \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.merigoux.ovh&#x2F;en&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;20&#x2F;taxes-formal-proofs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.merigoux.ovh&#x2F;en&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;20&#x2F;taxes-formal-proofs....</a>, \nwe therefore found a compromise allowing to respect both \nthe &#x27;source code publication obligation, and the security \nconstraints of the DGFiP.<p>&gt; By allowing us to go to its operating site and \nconfidentially access the source code that it did not wish \nto publish, the DGFiP has enabled us to find alternative \nsolutions that make the publication of the source code \nconcrete and operational. .')
