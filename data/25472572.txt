Today it closed around 14.2, so it looks like the big money investors are betting on SolarWinds-the-business being toast. Even if it does survive, if it doesn&#x27;t somehow stage a miracle recovery very quickly, the current senior leadership are surely done as soon as they&#x27;ve finished being ritually sacrificed so their replacements don&#x27;t get saddled with too much of the fallout.<p>As another potentially interesting data point, SWI still appears to have a P&#x2F;E close to 120 even now. Given that traditional value investors might consider something closer to 20 to be reasonable for an established business and the huge ratios of many big tech stocks only make sense if you think they&#x27;re going to continue the dramatic growth some of them have enjoyed for a while, there could still be a <i>long</i> way for stocks in SWI to fall even if they do eventually stabilise.')
