Pursuing financial stability and then a family life has made my mind overall more stable, even if I don’t get the same mental challenges I might otherwise get. And while I might have been able achieve financial security and family life in academia, there is a good chance it would not happen or would come much delayed.<p>Not saying that this is the best of all universes but just saying that the road not travelled isn’t necessarily one that would haven ended in success, even though it’s tempting to think of things in that way.')
