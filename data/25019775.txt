Nationalistic Americans flocked to his appeals to close off borders, to renegotiate trade deals, back out of agreements that hurt the US, and promise bringing manufacturing back into our borders.<p>Biden is a career politician so he knows how to say all the right words to appeal to as many people as possible, but where those words fail is in their over-promise in that the sum of policies put forth simply don&#x27;t add up.  Not that trump hasn&#x27;t made promises he couldn&#x27;t keep, but he has taken and put into motion a lot of things that represent a very nationalistic ideology.<p>Personally I think that even with the dysfunctional pathologically lying brain that Trump had, he was on the side with the better economic playbook.  Regardless of what one may think about him, Trump is the one with business experience, and Biden is the one with political experience.  And as much as I would love to believe that we live in a world where we can make allies, and negotiate, and hand out financial aid, and work together to green the earth, the reality is we live in a Corporatocracy, and that even Biden came to power by its merits.<p>I was very much on the fence.  Lets just say I wasn&#x27;t feeling very positive about the next four years even before the election was called.')
