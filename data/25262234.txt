Item(by='corysama', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606796036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258616, text='For modern audiences, I would recommend <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metropolis_(novel)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Metropolis_(novel)</a> over the film adaption. The film is amazing for it’s time. But, is... difficult to appreciate today. The book however, has some of the most intense imagery I’ve ever read. I had to put it down between pages to give my mind a bit of time to process each scene.<p>An important bit of context for the book is that it was written by a woman who moved from an agrarian village in Germany —where nothing had changed for hundreds of years— to height-of-the-Industrial-Revolution New York. It was quite a shock. And, imagine the book is from her extrapolations.<p>A fun bit is that it was written long before the invention of computers. So, this vision of a technologically advanced society has no concept of computerization and substitutes mind-numbing, body-crushing proletariat labor as the means of automation.')
