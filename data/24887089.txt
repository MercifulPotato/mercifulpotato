Similar to the event held by San Francisco State University, we determined that this event was in violation of one or more of these policies and let the host know that they were not permitted to use Zoom for this particular event.”<p>&gt;However, Zoom did not respond to questions about which specific policy was violated or whether other events have been shut down by the company.')
