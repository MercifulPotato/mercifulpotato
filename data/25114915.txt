Ultimately I prefer the more information that we can get on politicians available.<p>I don&#x27;t think Matthew Green is arguing against transparency. What he&#x27;s observing is that non-repudiation is an <i>unintentional</i> byproduct of DKIM&#x27;s design. Because it&#x27;s a byproduct, DKIM&#x27;s users have made implementation decisions that make it susceptible to weaknesses in the <i>unintentional</i> non-repudiation property.<p>By 2030, a motivated nation state will probably have the ability to crack the 2048-bit RSA keys that Google is currently using for DKIM. Do you really want someone in 2031 to be able to contrive fake signatures for the emails of politicians in 2021?')
