The Apple Watch is about as powerful as computers from the 2000s (if not even more recently)[1] &amp; has it&#x27;s own line of accessories [2], &amp; has its own cellular &amp; WiFi connections. In theory Apple could make setup not require an iPhone if they wanted &amp; even allow wireless displays. Smartwatches really are more companion devices that are tethered to phones to speed up the setup&#x2F;input process &amp; the phone acts like a smarter virtual display.<p>[1] Can&#x27;t find the speed of the latest one but the S5 is a 64-bit dual-core 2.4 Ghz CPU (I think the S6 is 20% faster than that?) with 1 GB of RAM &amp; 32GB of storage. That&#x27;s a pretty hefty device &amp; will eventually consume a lot of needs for a phone.\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;watch&#x2F;watch-accessories" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;watch&#x2F;watch-accessories</a>')
