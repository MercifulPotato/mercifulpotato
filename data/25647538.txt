When a stock tanks, billions in value is lost. When a stock surges, billions can be gained. That sudden change is not the product of labor, nor the destuction of labor, but a capital multiplier from belief.<p>Also, arguing that since the first of any process happened in some manner implies that everything later in the process is created the same way isn&#x27;t true.<p>&gt;There are certainly a great many economists that agree with this definition<p>A great many are Austrian school, and would argue things like this, but this is overall a tiny fraction, and none are among the world&#x27;s top economists. Do you claim the majority or even more than a small fraction of economists would agree with this definition?<p>&gt;Actually, a famous economist gave a talk at Google<p>Name?<p>If what you&#x27;re arguing for is the Labor Theory of Value [1], which it sounds like, it&#x27;s widely and almost universally discredited. Every model macro model I can think of creates value in the manner I described above. Some intro examples [2]<p>Here&#x27;s another take hitting more modern economics [3]. The &quot;land and labor&quot; is an ancient and not very tenable argument from this modern viewpoint.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_theory_of_value" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_theory_of_value</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Macroeconomic_model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Macroeconomic_model</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Factors_of_production" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Factors_of_production</a>')
