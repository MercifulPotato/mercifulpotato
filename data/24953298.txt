No. Most of the harmful blue light comes from LCD backlight (of course it does not apply to OLED as much).<p>This kind of misunderstanding is why there have been so many dark mode or low contrast themes (like zenburn), which is a failure to recognise that what you have to turn down is screen brightness.<p>Like loudness wars for music it may be more pleasant to have nice brightness for a couple of seconds, but hereâ€™s my take: set brightness to a satisfactory value, then turn it down (a bit, maybe more). Your eyes will adapt. Over the course of a day facing a screen (which is basically a flashlight) it makes a massive difference. As a bonus when unplugged this saves crazy battery life.<p>&gt; Since not everyone can see well with Dark Mode, some mobile devices provide the option for Blue Light filters<p>Huh. f.lux &amp; al are not an alternative to dark mode, one should definitely use such settings, even with dark mode.<p>Final tip: pay attention to ambient and bias lightning.')
