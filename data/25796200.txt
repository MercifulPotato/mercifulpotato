Even if they&#x27;re lying, they&#x27;d have to under report deaths by a factor of 40 to approach the US per-capita death toll. How easy do you think it is to hide 40x the bodies that were reported?<p>&gt; Austrialia isn&#x27;t substantively better off than e.g. Sweden<p>In what way? They have 50x (1k&#x2F;1M vs 50k&#x2F;1M) fewer cases per capita than Sweden. They have the same unemployment rate (~7%). I&#x27;d call that &quot;substantively better&quot;.<p>In your worldview everyone who does better than the US at containing Covid is either lying or doesn&#x27;t exist. Think about that.<p>&gt; That seems facially insane to me<p>Preventing misery sounds &quot;insane&quot; to you? Or do you think the idea that giving assistance would prevent misery is &quot;insane&quot;? They&#x27;re both pretty normal ideas - maybe you&#x27;re the one with the distorted view of the world.<p>&gt; Clearly none of those things actually help<p>South Korea (1k cases&#x2F;1M) and Taiwan (36 cases&#x2F;1M) would like to have a word with you.<p>&gt; You have a completely distorted view of how dangerous this virus is.<p>In October 2020, Covid was already the 3rd leading cause of death for 45+[1]. In the past week, it was the single-largest cause of death. The next 2 (usually heart disease and cancer) take <i>decades</i> to kill you and aren&#x27;t transmissible.<p>Maybe you should consider the possibility that you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s been deeply misinformed. You&#x27;re saying completely untrue stuff with 100% confidence. I think you&#x27;re in denial.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2774465" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2774465</a>')
