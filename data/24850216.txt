I had to wait about 12 hours to deploy replacement certificates after Heartbleed, in order to balance cert errors with loss of privacy. A large number of the clients I had to support interpret the dates as local time, which isn&#x27;t helpful when they&#x27;re in the western hemisphere and GoDaddy wouldn&#x27;t backdate certs at all. Last I had a cert issued, DigiCert set not before to the order time even for re-issues or duplicates, so that was a lot easier to manage.')
