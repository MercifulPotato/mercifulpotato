By this, I mean he waxes philosophical about software development as though it were some divine practice handed down by the angels themselves - not what it actually is, which is a crude implementation and abstraction of the Universe&#x27;s actual programming language - subatomic particles.<p>We have the software we have because we as humans are so limited in our thinking and scope, and because every human has slight variations on their idea of the &quot;ideal&quot;, whatever that ideal might be.<p>If that <i>was not</i> the case, how could we have 50+ programming languages, when the very purpose of a programming language is to express your ideas into a somewhat tangible (insofar as one can claim the electronic written word to be tangible) form that can then be communicated to others.<p>Maybe now, I&#x27;m the one waxing philosophical, but my background is that of an evolutionary biologist; I was not formally trained in software or computer engineering, but it seems to be the &quot;point&quot; of every programming language is to express ideas and the point of every piece of software is to create a tool. Humanity and our ancestors have been doing this for millions of years, so why would we be expected to stop now??')
