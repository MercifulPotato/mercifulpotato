I have no medical&#x2F;psychological training past a psy 101 class in uni.<p>I took a fair amount of MDMA in my late teens&#x2F;early twenties. Mostly in nightclubs and music festivals. It was cool at the time (great memories and the music 100% was better).<p>In my late twenties (after 5+ years without MDMA), my partner and I decided to roll after getting some MDMA off the dark web. We went to a bar, which was my past go-to, and had an OK night. We left pretty early and went home.<p>When we got home, we had 100mg left each and decided to roll in the peace of our house. We both dropped a cap and spent the next 6 hours having very deep conversations and just caressing each other (I especially enjoyed touching her hair).<p>We didn&#x27;t have any major issues in our relationship leading up to that night, but we did have a bit of friction over our future plans. After that one night, our relationship was at least 30% more pleasant and we both felt significantly closer to each other.<p>We still have a great relationship 2 years later. Obviously, the MDMA isn&#x27;t the only factor, but it helped to dramatically strengthen our feelings towards each other.<p>One downside was sex. She was very in the mood and I was unable to perform on MDMA.<p>YMMV.')
