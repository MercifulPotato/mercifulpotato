Having had many of my project built using makefiles, running that makefile somewhere else was no big deal at all.<p>If anything, if making the switch now is hard work, you should use that effort into making your build more portable. You may thank yourselves 5-10 years down the road when this same thing surely is bound to happen again :)')
