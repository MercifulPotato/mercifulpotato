Primarily I wanted to play games on them (things like Heroes II on Intel 386)<p>At some point I had enough of games and as a side effect I had to reinstall my system so many times (thanks to win-cih and other viruses) that I started thinking about building my own OS. Childish dreams :) but it got me to C programming and that&#x27;s how it started for me.<p>So now, decades later, I have my own children and I think how on Earth am I going to get them attracted to technology when it&#x27;s sooo mainstream that it&#x27;s not mysterious anymore. It does not feel like adventure to my children, it&#x27;s their environment.<p>So instead of thinking much I started with things I remember from my childhood - simple instruction-less lego bricks, or more modern geomag, whatever else that comes without ikea-type instruction so my children can just build stuff. I&#x27;m yet to think the step-two.')
