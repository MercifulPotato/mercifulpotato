But the risks in mining uranium, operating the plants, and storage or repurposing of the waste are still lower than a million people installing solar panels on rooftops. Accidents happen and we should minimize them. Trying to live zero risk by cutting out what bit you before rather than what bit a lot of other people does not make sense.<p>I&#x27;m not against solar, I&#x27;m not against nuclear. I&#x27;m for reducing the biggest sources of damage (coal, gas, cows, planes, etc.). We, densely populated Europe in particular, seem to be having a lot of trouble deploying land-consuming technologies like solar and wind at a rate that makes us likely not to trigger any runaway climate-affecting processes. I see nuclear as an option, on the expensive side but definitely not beyond what our western society can pay, that would make a big step ten years from the moment we commit to it (and cost-wise roughly on par with off-shore wind, cheaper or more expensive depending on who you ask, so cost is apparently not the problem in any country that deploys significant amounts of off-shore wind). I just can&#x27;t decide whether there&#x27;s still hope of rationality in this debate, especially being involved with brainwashed climate activists that somehow convinced themselves it&#x27;s super dangerous (that&#x27;s demonstrably untrue) and a few of them know details like that it&#x27;s more expensive (but never know by how much (~2x according to UK and USA studies, I can lookup the links tomorrow (1:30am here)), nor can they explain how France doesn&#x27;t have crazy energy prices (&lt;2x compared to countries with nearly zero nuclear) with 70% of the power coming from nuclear, nor are they opposed to <i>other</i> solutions that would mean increasing the cost by as much if that gets us to CO2 neutrality)...')
