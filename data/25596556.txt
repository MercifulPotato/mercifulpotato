Item(by='ajkjk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609445158, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594898, text='I disagree back, but at a different place. &quot;who have to report progress and who are responsible for budgets.&quot; is the real problem. It&#x27;s crazy that progress on engineering is measured in the number of tasks completed. This was one of the points of agile in the first place (to deliver user-stories, rather than engineering tasks) but it has mostly been lost since then, because people who are managing engineers don&#x27;t know how to think about that at all.<p>A big engineering endeavor is more like an artistic endeavor that takes multiple people, like a giant sculpture or mural or something, than it is like a construction project. The right way, imo, to do it, is to put your faith in a tech lead and a trusted team to deliver it in a timely fashion, and then step back and let them work. They don&#x27;t need to be delivering tasks on any specific cadence; they need to deliver the overall effort.<p>More importantly, a tech team needs to be free  to do a good job of owning the work they&#x27;re doing. Properly owning and being invested in something feels basically impossible when someone is demanding you complete little one-off tasks for them -- good technical ownership means having the time and space to zoom out and fix systemic problems, rather than always chasing the next sprint&#x27;s deliverables.<p>Of course then the manager comes along and says: well, why don&#x27;t you just track the systemic problems that you want to fix in Jira? And it seems like a good idea but it ruins it. Having to document and schedule everything you do is completely in opposition to doing the kind of passionate, obsessive engineering that produces the good results.')
