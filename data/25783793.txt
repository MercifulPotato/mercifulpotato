Great content is often missed just by chance<p>- This in turn means that there’s no platform that encourages unknown authors to create high-effort, thoughtful pieces. Instead it’s far more effective to blogspam.<p>I&#x27;m working on a platform that uses something similar to a prediction&#x2F;stock market to incentivise people to search for high-quality content. Instead of upvoting, you effectively buy shares in new content, which you can then sell at a later point for a profit if the content proves popular. Equally you can buy &quot;downvote shares&quot;, which act like a short and help dampen rampant speculation.<p>It’s early days still, but I’m hoping this could be a great way to encourage higher quality content creation.<p>Draft paper here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;15Hc6wAXlfl8x5C0w11m7ZOEpbjjncxS2&#x2F;view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;15Hc6wAXlfl8x5C0w11m7ZOEpbjj...</a><p>EDIT:<p>Since this is a getting a bit of traction, if you&#x27;re interested in testing it out when I&#x27;ve got a prototype, I&#x27;ve created a mailing list here<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;EEMhkJRSUUAbwDgX6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;EEMhkJRSUUAbwDgX6</a><p>I think initial community is critical for getting these sorts of things right, so would definitely appreciate having some HN folks to test with.')
