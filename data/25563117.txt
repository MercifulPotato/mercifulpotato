Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[25563577], score=None, time=1609188986, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563048, text='&gt; I may be in the minority here, but to be honest I think I actually prefer getting ghosted.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate for recruiters to ghost candidates.<p>However, I will say that I think many younger candidates really would prefer being ghosted to being explicitly rejected. The nature of interviewing means that I send a lot more rejection e-mails than offer letters. A surprising number of candidates have very negative reactions to rejection letters, from trying to argue that we&#x27;ve made a mistake to posting negative reviews of our company on Glassdoor or even Google Maps. People <i>hate</i> the feeling of rejection.<p>I still send polite rejection letters, but I can see how jaded interviewers would err on the side of ghosting candidates to avoid possible retribution. It only takes a few serious over-reactions to make you extra careful about dealing with candidates.')
