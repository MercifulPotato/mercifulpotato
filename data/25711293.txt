I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because PeerTube just happens to have a different type of content than what I like to watch, or because I don&#x27;t understand how to make the best use of the search functionality, or if the search functionality is just bad.  Regardless, it&#x27;s a real tough sell for me to replace YouTube with a video service where I can&#x27;t find anything I want to watch!')
