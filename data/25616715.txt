Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=[25617538], score=None, time=1609622922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616586, text='&gt; The article you linked first assumes only one or two antibodies.<p>Assumes only a couple of neutralizing antibodies, which is fair for the vaccine candidates-- immune assays of Moderna&#x27;s vaccine show two typical antibody binding sites against the RBD that are strongly neutralizing.  I haven&#x27;t seen the ELISA data for Pfizer&#x27;s vaccine.<p>Given that we&#x27;ve got several papers describing how immune escape variants of other viruses have emerged in the past... I&#x27;m curious why you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of a risk here?<p>e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;11410701&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;11410701&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; As I said before, there is some pressure for antibodies, but the immune system is way more than that, and people can clear infections very effectively without any antibodies at all.<p>Of course.  I&#x27;m not speculating that there&#x27;s going to be some nasty variant that completely eludes our immune response.  I&#x27;m saying that it is likely-- and the consensus opinion-- that there is a real risk that the virus mutates to render the vaccine less effective.<p>&gt; Further research has shown that this variant does not seem to increase disease severity, and instead is just more infectious, as the spike protein evolved for higher binding affinity.<p>Some of the mutations slightly increase binding affinity.  Other deletions look like their primary fitness advantage is immune escape.  A missing stop-codon also increases mutation rates for a portion of the RBD, which implies we can expect quicker emergence of subvariants.<p>It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re having an argument I never was having: I have never said that this is likely to cause more severe disease.  I am just saying that the virus will be under selective pressure to evade the vaccine-induced immune responses-- which is something I think everyone agrees.  This is less likely to happen if there&#x27;s less infection around and people get vaccinated quicker.<p>Even in the worst case, where such a variant evolves quickly-- I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re that bad off.  As you mention, there&#x27;s other immune responses.  Strong T cell mediated immunity will almost certainly be cross-reactive and strongly reduce the risk of severe illness.  We&#x27;ll have more time to adjust vaccines without mortality accruing as quickly.  It is still something we&#x27;d prefer to avoid at all costs.')
