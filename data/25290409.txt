Having 0.5%~1% of people having a positive corona test in the last two weeks means that every week 3.2~1.6 million people are walking around with Corona. I would not call that a handful of people. (This is even the lower bound as it excludes untested people which are positive)<p>With a fatality rate of 2% (source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;mortality-risk-covid?country=~USA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;mortality-risk-covid?country=~USA</a>) that means 64~32 thousand die every two weeks. This translates to 1.7~0.8 million people dying every year. With that I&#x27;m obviously ignoring the large spectrum between &#x27;no lasting symptoms&#x27; and &#x27;death&#x27;.<p>With one of the most lax responses in the western world I cannot see how you conclude from this that the US&#x27;s response is &#x27;overblown and hysterical&#x27;')
