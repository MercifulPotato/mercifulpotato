If you want to use &quot;socialism&quot; as the opposite of &quot;capitalism&quot; then of course no, Germany isn&#x27;t a &quot;socialist country&quot;.<p>The being said Germany is a fairly &quot;social&quot; country in my book, very similar to France. They very often put the emphasis on the group rather than the individual (taxes, education, public infrastructures, health care, work&#x2F;life balance, &amp;c.)<p>But again we&#x27;re mostly talking semantics and local usage of words here, the underlying principles are very easy to tell apart (I doubt anyone could tell with a straight face that Germany and the US are running on the same principles for example.) now some people use the word &quot;socialism&quot; to describe that or part of it<p>In France 20th century socialists fought a lot for workers rights, abolishing the death penalty, depenalizing homosexuality, warranting liveable minimum wages, earlier retirement age, paid vacations, paid parental leaves, &amp;c, many of the rights we take for granted nowadays are direct or indirect achievements of socialists, which is logical since Europe (mostly invented and) soaked in socialism for the last 150+ years. That being said, yes modern France or Germany &quot;socialism&quot; evolved from their early definition but I still believe they&#x27;re indefinitely more socialist than the US.<p>I feel like many people get trapped in the socialism = communism, communism = never worked, hence communism = bad, hence socialism = bad, as if it was a binary thing. I guess we could argue about the exact meaning of &quot;socialism&quot; in 2020 but I doubt we can argue that &quot;socialism&quot; deeply marked a lot of European countries')
