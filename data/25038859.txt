It&#x27;s already hard enough for people to read and write code, so to learn another hard language like rust is not something you do lightly.<p>Rust is a cool language, but it&#x27;s a cool tool, nothing more. I&#x27;d rather see the ownership process implemented in some C&#x2F;C++ dialect. I&#x27;m not entirely sure, but I think that C++ concepts, in a way, have the same goals than ownership.<p>Safety doesn&#x27;t always matter. It matters for a company like Mozilla and anything that&#x27;s network&#x2F;system related, that&#x27;s for sure, but for games, I&#x27;m not so sure.<p>Also, statically typed languages that compiles to machine code are a niche now, new languages in that area don&#x27;t really matter. You either have kernel code, or interpreted languages. A big quantity of C&#x2F;C++ userspace code is fossilized code. Computers are quite fast for a lot of interpreted languages.')
