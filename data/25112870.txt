It could be true for some distros, some driver versions and some hardware... but if you consider everything, Windows runs better than Linux. Mostly because most hardware is designed to run well on Windows. The Linux versions are either an afterthought or built and maintained by third-party.<p>You mean drivers instead of hardware right? Typically performance is roughly the same. Sometimes better sometimes worse. \nThe issue is where they don&#x27;t exist or are an afterthought indeed and then it&#x27;s quite frustrating.<p>&gt;Windows updates aren&#x27;t stealthy and they can be disabled. If you really don&#x27;t want an update, it is MUCH MORE straightforward to avoid installing the optional update in Windows than it is for Linux distros.<p>What? What are you on about?\nI have yet to install an update for Linux that I didn&#x27;t specifically give my permission for. \nAutomatic updates are turned of by default on any distro I&#x27;ve tried and they don&#x27;t come as bundled as they do for windows where a recent random update I just checked includes some changes for input devices, office products, basic operations security and the DST start date for the Fiji Islands.<p>&gt;Which Linux distro has a better App Store than Windows? Since Microsoft launched the Windows App Store, it is the best App Store in any non-macOS computers.<p>It looks neat but....\nFor some reason it uses a different language (that I&#x27;ve never selected to be used) in most of it&#x27;s UI. Is a common problem in Belgium apparently and I guess same in other multilingual countries which is weird because that&#x27;s not an issue anywhere else in the OS.\nWhy am I looking at some loading ring for 3-4 seconds when i click on an app?\nWhere do I add alternative sources? \nCan I do stuff like build something differently on install if I want to?<p>&gt;Some distros do. Ubuntu has it, for example.<p>An outlier more than anything and one that asks you if you want it on install and later disabling it is a checbox away.<p>&gt;This is true. However, this has been a problem, which is why something like Ubuntu which has good defaults which they stick to has been so much successful than anything else.<p>Fully agree it has been a problem and still is for it&#x27;s adoption. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s what notably contributed to Ubuntu&#x27;s success in the past tho.')
