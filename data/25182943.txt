He learned English there, got along with his guards, and didn&#x27;t hate the Americans.<p>Coming home to Mainz and seeing what the French and British had done to his ancestral home and the civilians who lived there, he had other things to say about them. After escaping from a French POW camp (they were still being held despite the war being over and there were reprisal killings, etc.) he made his way back to Mainz (French occupation) but fled across the river in the dead of night to Wiesbaden, which was under American occupation and thus considered safer. A similar story for my Oma.<p>He was actually my father&#x27;s adopted father. My dad&#x27;s biological father I don&#x27;t know much about, but he served on the eastern front and came home a broken man with a missing leg.')
