I&#x27;ve been in the game for a while, and the point I would emphasize is smart hackers don&#x27;t get paid as well as people who do less difficult work with a lower bar to entry. Black&#x2F;grey market bug bounties for iOS vulnerabilities in the $1m range reflect the risk profile and value much more accurately. The bundle in this report are worth at least the pro-consulting rate, and are more commensurate with that high watermark. Good on them for doing it, and the prestige payout is great, but advertising those disadvantaged numbers bears comment.<p>Regarding amateurs, olympic athletes are amateurs, it&#x27;s a reference to people pursuing it out of interest instead of just a 9-5 job, even if they happen to do it full time. Amateurs will almost always outperform professionals because the skill distribution among pro&#x27;s has a longer tail, where to even get in the game without a pro backing you have to be above average. This was an amateur moonlighting effort that delivered better results than consultants who cost 10x the money.<p>Bug bounties find most vulns in scope that %80 of hackers would find, which I think is more valuable than an assurance level, because assurance levels are bunk. A security architecture is valuable, provided it&#x27;s built with an understanding of the threat model of the actual business and  gets implemented, but otherwise, I think the security  assessment document production business doesn&#x27;t have a long future.')
