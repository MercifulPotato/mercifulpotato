The word &quot;fail&quot; only appears once in the page, and not in regards to recovery, only preventative replacement.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely true that colo is cheaper than AWS for projects that can absorb the labour and failure related costs, but that usually is only true for hobby or very small business services.')
