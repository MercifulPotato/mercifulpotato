That action would include resettlement compensation if inclusive,  or at the very least I wouldn&#x27;t consider seriously starting the mechanisation of moving cities until that point.<p>I&#x27;m pretty taken aback to learn how culturally common this behaviour seems to be in this context given the feedback...<p>before this thread I would have said it&#x27;s a red-flag for a scam and walk away at that point...')
