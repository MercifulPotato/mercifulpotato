I stopped doing business with them after the exchange with the co-founder.<p>&gt;<i>Second, what is your general position on business ethics? If you get yours, then is it ok for them to be potentially screwing others? Basically are you of the perspective that as long as you&#x27;re taken care of, who cares about the others?</i><p>I do care about the others, but I also don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m obligated to spend months&#x2F;years of my life leading a class-action lawsuit on their behalf.<p>Short of that, I don&#x27;t have a good way of contacting their other affiliates at scale. I directly reached out to some of the affiliates they feature as success stories, and I reached out to other keto bloggers, but none of them were that interested in talking to me. I think there&#x27;s so much shady behavior in keto affiliate advertising that the affiliates either (a) didn&#x27;t care about the particulars as long as their absolute payout was decent and&#x2F;or (b) didn&#x27;t want to engage with a random blogger they don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s possibly just a disgruntled affiliate.<p>I wrote the article so that anyone who Googles the affiliate program will find out about their behavior. This is pretty outside the subject matter of my normal blog posts. If I was looking to write something that would appeal to lots of readers, I&#x27;d write about my usual subjects of solo entrepreneurship or software development.<p>What obligations do you feel I&#x27;m failing to meet here?')
