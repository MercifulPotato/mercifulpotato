Text needs merely a QWERTY (or touchscreen) keyboard, and the ability to compose text in the natural language of your choice (which most are able to do by the age of 10, barring low-literacy areas). In that sense, text is much cheaper to use for self-expression, even though necessarily limited. On the other hand, Gemini&#x2F;Gopher is near-symbiotic with BBS and IRC-based communities, which are a decent text-based interactive media that could be useful for self-expression in the hands of the right people.<p>I agree that multimedia-based networked self-expression is limited these days, but maybe something else will spark a Gemini-like comback for multimedia in the future.')
