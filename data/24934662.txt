Item(by='Rebelgecko', descendants=None, kids=[24934708], score=None, time=1604000178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931352, text='&gt;the reality is that the GOP wouldnâ€™t make these things a priority...<p>The author seems to be mixing up a tweet with the actual party platform. You can&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re making it a priority until we start to see NASA budget increases of the magnitude we saw during the Apollo era. Until they put their money where their mouth is, the tweet is just marketing fluff<p>&gt;This myth not only allows the government to ignore the ongoing climate crisis on Earth, which scientists say could reach an irreversible tipping point in less than 10 years<p>Bullshit. No one thinks that humanity is going to have self-sustaining colonies on the moon or Mars within 10 years. Our government may be ignoring climate issues here on Earth, but it&#x27;s not because they expect to leave the planet<p>&gt;At a time when American unemployment the worst since the depression era<p>This article was published today. Why is the author citing unemployment statistics that were published 7 months ago? It seems like intentional cherrypicking<p>&gt;It might or might not be a coincidence that the news of SOFIA discovering water on the moon came just days after the GOP announced their otherworldly priorities for a second term.<p>Is there any evidence that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a coincidence, or is the author just trying to spread FUD? How much influence does Donald Trump have over Nature&#x27;s publication schedule?<p>&gt;Is it space exploration or is it a decent standard of living at home? Is it the moon, Mars, or Earth?<p>This is a false dichotomy if there ever was one. For a decade, the US military spent more money on <i>air conditioning in Iraq and Afghanistan</i> than we did on NASA. Imagine what NASA could have accomplished if our military only occupied temperate regions<p>Edit: another thing that bugs me is this implication that NASA spending is orthogonal to quality of life here on Earth, as if they were just launching billions of dollars into the ether. What would communities like Huntsville AL look like if NASA&#x27;s budget was 0&#x27;d out? How much of the climate science they quote earlier in the article would have happened without NASA funding?')
