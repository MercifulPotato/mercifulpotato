Now your test is implicitly testing the test class. I also prefer to see explicit mocking than just trust that the fake does what it says it will. How do I know without looking whether the fake store method REALLY stores the doc, or whether someone set it up to just return OK? And how do you test error handling - make another fake for every error scenario?')
