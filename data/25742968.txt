There is nothing inherently wrong with this strategy and it produces solid gains over time, but it&#x27;s a lot harder going to accidentally create a billion dollar company. That said, Solect got acquired for 1.5B back 20 years ago, Shopify exists, it&#x27;s not like there are zero Canadian unicorns, they just get produced a lot more slowly.')
