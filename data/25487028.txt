On the surface, people may seem more tolerant of it, but privately they definitely act differently.<p>When I was in my last year of apprenticeship in Switzerland I managed one the estates of the owner&#x27;s homes for most of the year while they worked in Bern, which included the investment homes they had in Zurich and in Lussane. It was where generational wealthy people parked their money, guess who our neighbors were? High class Swiss escorts, I know this because I met them and asked to keep an eye on things while I was away and gave them vegetables from our farm in exchange as a good gesture of will.<p>I lived in S. Germany in what was once Ag land but had been urbanized for wealthy &#x27;Green minded&#x27; Germans, where prostitution is once again legal. I got chatted up on the train a few times only to find out (by my then German-Anglo fiance) it was a meet and greet tactic they use to get them into the brothels and is apparently common to use on foreigners and university students. They were all German not one was Eastern European, which to be honest is what I&#x27;m more physically attracted to than most Western Europeans.<p>I can go on here about working Summers in Croatia, and Italy that included catering to nude sunbathing crowds in camp sites and resorts which are frequented mainly by other Western Europeans, but suffice it to say: I was born and raised in CA, but I&#x27;ve lived and worked in Europe long enough to stand by my claims and spent my Summers as a child in the coast of Spain as I&#x27;m half S. European myself. Where the local &#x27;puti-club&#x27; is just another thing people joke about since its so common.<p>&gt; Why do we see so few Dutch and Swedish and Danish emancipated free empowered women self-actualize through porn work?<p>First, as I outlined already and my first hand experiences: I don&#x27;t think sex work is empowering at all and often has more to do with poverty and dire economic circumstances then the tired narrative of it being so that&#x27;s shoved down our collective throats by this neo-femisnist narrative. Which is why you see the higher frequency of E. European women you mentioned in those situations instead of a women from wealthy Nordic country with good social nets and social mobility.')
