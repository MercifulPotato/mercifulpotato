Ultimately it&#x27;s a message of <i>ability.</i> It is a movement by and for people who want to achieve and be a part of society. As somebody with diagnosed ADHD this is how I approach things as well. I don&#x27;t consider it a disability. I just tend to do things a little differently.<p>A valid criticism of the neurodiversity movement is that it seems to gloss over the fact that, well, often behavioral health issues <i>are</i> genuinely debilitating. A schizophrenic who hears voices in their head would probably not claim that it is some hidden strength.<p>On the whole though, I think the movement is a good thing. It is ultimately a message of <i>ability</i> and a call for inclusiveness.')
