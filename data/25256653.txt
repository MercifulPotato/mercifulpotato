It won the market by dint of excellent marketing and a good enough product with a little design panache. Admittedly, this has been really hard for it&#x27;s competitors to match 100% but really no chat platform has had any major innovation in like 20 years. They have mostly all failed due to a combination of network effects and poorly-conceived monetization strategies. Slack is hot, but it&#x27;s not going to last 10 years.')
