Like one state and 20,000 to 100,000 vote.  A once in a 30-50 year election.  You need to figure out before hand which state will be swing state that decides the election.<p>Now you have to commit voter fraud 50,000 times in that state.  You can&#x27;t do it in person because the numbers are too larger so you have to do mail-in.  How do you find 20,000-50,000 people across the state who you can get a mail in ballot for, steal it, and turn it in without anyone noticing.<p>This is basically an impossible task that even if you pull off has a low chance of making a difference, and a large chance of sending you to jail.')
