A decked-out A1200 setup with 060 accelerator and RTG graphics etc is easily $2000 or more, and that would still be <i>a lot</i> slower and less capable than the Vampire.<p>The Vampire is made for a niche of a niche and it&#x27;s priced accordingly, because building small-run hardware is expensive. If you don&#x27;t care for the last 1% of accuracy that an FPGA affords compared to an emulator, then you are not the target market, and a Raspberry Pi 4 will make a fine virtual Amiga using something like Amibian.')
