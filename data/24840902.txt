They&#x27;ve been working on AI&#x2F;Machine Learning models for 3 years, with a truly unreasonably large budget for hardware&#x2F;software, and very little to show for it.<p>If the models they were developing actually worked, there would be no reason  for my company to continue their primary business, because we would effectively predict the next 20 years of stock performance in a fairly large segment of the market.<p>At least the CFD people have gotten some good use out of the giant stack of GPUs they bought.')
