People don&#x27;t want to lose years worth of chat histories with friends, family and their significant other(s). That&#x27;s just how it is. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s so hotly debated around here. People want to preserve their chats and their media. There&#x27;s sentimental&#x2F;emotional value to these things and they don&#x27;t want to lose these things. That&#x27;s all that <i>should</i> matter. I feel like these discussions always get bogged down in &quot;but why&quot;, particularly from people who have a different opinion, when it&#x27;s irrelevant. People value things differently. Just because their values are different from yours doesn&#x27;t make them any less justified than you. This is reality. This is people.<p>If Signal wants to provide a <i>mainstream</i> secure and private alternative to WhatsApp, then it needs to make concessions to accommodate these preferences. If they don&#x27;t want to, that&#x27;s fine, but it also means I can&#x27;t recommend Signal to non-tech friends&#x2F;family.')
