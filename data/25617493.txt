I was Linux for a long while for work and gaming. Constant compatibility and hardware issues.<p>Even something like Zoom worked like shit on Linux half the time. Or was missing features.<p>Audio&#x2F;Video hardware had issues too. Something as simple as a webcam became this giant problem. Configuring mice and keyboards was a nightmare.<p>This is a lot to do with companies not supporting Linux and having to use community created reverse-engineered stuff, so it&#x27;s not all Linux&#x27;s fault, but at the same time, it just became a pain in the ass to maintain and fix constantly.<p>Also games, as much as Steam&#x2F;Photon&#x2F;Wine have improved, there are just some things that don&#x27;t work.<p>So, I switched back to Windows, and even if I prefer linux, I just can&#x27;t have it as my daily driver. so WSL2 is great for me.')
