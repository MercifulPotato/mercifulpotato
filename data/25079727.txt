I don&#x27;t want to die, but if I do, I&#x27;d like my family to survive.  If they die too, I&#x27;d like my friends to survive.  If they die too, I&#x27;d like people from my region&#x2F;country to survive.  If they die too, I&#x27;d like some humans to survive.  If they die too, it would be nice if some primates or mammals or something warm blooded survived.<p>My ranking of how much I care about something is almost directly the same as my genetic similarity to it, which I suspect is no coincidence.')
