Most tech people I knew had a 19 or 20 inch monitor, at 1600x1200 in the late 90s&#x2F;early 2000s. 2048x1536 was available too. Early LCDs were usually 1280x1024 and by around 2005, larger sizes and 1080p LCDs were available. It was hard to find anything approaching the pixel density of an old, common CRT until around 2010 if I recall correctly.')
