From what I read, it:<p>- Disables memory access or erases it<p>- Disables data transmission<p>- Lights an indicator<p>- Can&#x27;t be disable without physically connecting another calculator or computer. I think some even beep.<p>Well, of course back then I did an extensive job of using the built-in memory for my &quot;cheat sheets&quot;, even building programs with submenus for quick access, and some automated functionality. I don&#x27;t feel like it really hindered me later. At least, it taught me more about programming :)')
