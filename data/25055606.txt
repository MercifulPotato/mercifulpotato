Item(by='ecesena', descendants=None, kids=[25055901, 25056038], score=None, time=1605070480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25054863, text='You have to distinguish between resident keys and non-resident keys (that I&#x27;ll just call &quot;normal keys&quot;).<p>Resident keys are stored on the device, so today you can only have a limited number of RKs. This said it&#x27;s a temp limitation. As usage will increase, devices will allow for more RKs. For example, if I&#x27;m not wrong, yubikeys support 25 RKs, solokeys 50. (But the only sites where you can use RKs are basically Microsoft or demos.)<p>For each account on a given site, you&#x27;ll have an independent RK. (I don&#x27;t believe you can have 2 RKs for the same account on the same device, but that&#x27;s an implementation detail.)<p>Normal keys, instead, are generated on the fly. They are not stored, so a single device can support unlimited sites and accounts. When you enroll a device in, say, your primary Google account, trying to enroll the same device again produces the same cryptographic key. So, in fact, for each account you can only have one key per device. But you can have unlimited accounts times unlimited sites on a single device.<p>If you have 2 accounts on the same site on the same device, you&#x27;re correct in saying that the site can&#x27;t link the 2 accounts to the same device. In addition, on the device there&#x27;s nothing stored, so even someone with access to the device (say, border control) can&#x27;t see what sites you used the device with. Important: this is only for non-resident keys.<p>I can&#x27;t predict the future, but my expectation is that we&#x27;ll see adoption of RKs for username-less login, and non-RKs for 2FA. I personally don&#x27;t particularly like RKs for privacy reasons, but the specs seem to prefer them (and the UX seems much better).
