A hamster wheel of constantly shifting goal posts for mastery. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if they were fundamental advances in software development, but it&#x27;s mostly the same stuff with small advances but massive learning curves of arbitrary, non-transferrable minutiae.<p>The side effect of this ever shifting tooling set, is almost no one masters anything. All software is varying levels of crap written by newbies, because when the tools change every project you are always a newbie in that tool set.')
