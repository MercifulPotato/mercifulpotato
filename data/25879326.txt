I&#x27;ve driven multiple recent Mercedes, A220, C300, CLA250, and have never had a real problem connecting the bluetooth on my phone. I believe all of these models have had a spin-dial media interface though - I can&#x27;t stand touchscreen interfaces in cars - totally unintuitive and inconvenient while you&#x27;re driving.')
