If the Pais effect is described in enough detail, such that an &quot;ordinary&quot; person of &quot;skill in the [technical field relevant to the making or using of the invention]&quot; can use the teachings of the patent in combination with what is already commonly known to practice the invention without &quot;undue experimentation&quot;, then the patent is considered enabled.  If the patent does not teach enough to meet this criteria, then it is invalid for non-enablement.  One subset of non-enablement is that the &quot;invention&quot; is simply not possible (e.g., perpetual motion machine).')
