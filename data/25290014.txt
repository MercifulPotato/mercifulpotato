It compiles to the metal [0] so no VM is needed which makes it very fast and also appropriate for embedded applications (e.g. home automation on an RPi or Odroid). It has excellent numerical functions so it&#x27;s nice for scientific computing (I use it for research others might use Matlab or Julia for), and it contains CLOS, which is probably the most powerful O-O system ever built.<p>If you need to write a Very Large Lisp program for an industrial application with a lot of moving parts that has to run fast, you probably want Common Lisp.<p>[0] Racket is now compiled to the metal now too with the recent Chez compiler integration.')
