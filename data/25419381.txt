When the WHO released a statement saying that it hadn&#x27;t been proven that antibodies prevent covid, the media ran with the sensationalist &quot;antibodies are ineffective&quot; slant. I simply can&#x27;t believe that the news organizations that ran with that version didn&#x27;t do it on purpose.<p>The same can be said for reinfections and perhaps even long-term effects. The narrative surrounding these concepts is so common that I hear it from friends as if it were common knowledge. I don&#x27;t know about the long-term effects but I am pretty certain that reinfections are very rare. But the prevalence of either seems to be omitted from the story.<p>Of course we don&#x27;t know because the news often reports anecdotes when there is no data or even when there is data. The news isn&#x27;t held to the standard of giving a whole picture, just a glimpse of the current moment. In that they find a lot of wiggle room to publish things that are in the &quot;public interest&quot; while also benefiting from sensationalism.')
