He’s not just a bigot, bully, and career incompetent, he’s a Jim Jones figurehead for a calculated 50-year Republican party campaign to migrate the USA to a Russian-style one-party state. And he’s not even very good at that, shouting the quiet parts out far too loud far too often for the GOP’s own comfort.<p>But one thing Trump <i>is</i> really good at is lying to people, telling people who <i>want</i> to be lied to just what they want to hear.
