Packaged software sales model with designers and web hosting companies as the sales channel. Reasonably successful for more than 10 years but I call it a &quot;vampire start up.&quot; I had enough income to eat and hire a few people but never hit the right growth numbers. Also, small business is just as demanding as Enterprise customers for features and support but doesn&#x27;t have the budget to pay for it.<p>I tried a pivot to a SaaS model but missed my window of opportunity as Shopify and a few others started out as SaaS only and had more traction. Also, Magento commerce popped out of nowhere as a really good free, open source cart that made it difficult to continue to sell higher priced stand alone licenses.<p>Two actual points of failure: 1) had to start letting employees go because not enough income and 2) had to fire myself because not enough income.<p>In the end, I was able to license the technology to a few companies in a royalty deal and sell some other parts. Not a complete failure and I learned tons from the experience.<p>Business lessons learned:<p>* My sales&#x2F;revenue strategy was weak, i was depending on my channel to sell but they were only getting me a one time license purchase while they got the recurring hosting revenue.\n* Selling to small and medium sized businesses is almost as much work as selling into Enterprises and the pay off is much smaller. I&#x27;d recommend targeting enterprises or consumes rather than mid-market. Consumer has scale, Enterprises have cash.\n* The better mousetrap doesn&#x27;t always win. I had much better quality software than some competitors but they had momentum and staff that was already familiar with their product. If you&#x27;re going to be the &quot;better&quot; option, be 10x better.\n* Timing is critical. Some opportunities are about being in the right place at the right time. A few years too early or too late can sink an idea. Be prepared to scale as fast as possible when you see things working.')
