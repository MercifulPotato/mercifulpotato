Artists are now in a race to the bottom where they have to choose between playing the game, and changing their style, message and work to chase engagement metrics, or resign themselves to be drowned and forgotten for staying &quot;real&quot;<p>Youtubers suffer the same fate. You can see people moving from tech reviews to game streaming and then to music production or vlogging in their search for views. But they (most of them) are more businessmen than artists, and don&#x27;t feel tied to a message or artistic vision that they need to communicate.<p>I&#x27;d argue that an ideal system should have a place for artistic quality to shine beyond entertainment, and that used to happen, at least to a higher degree than it does now. Which is not to say that everything&#x27;s worse: the tools to become a creator are better and more accessible than ever (hardware, resources to learn, etc).')
