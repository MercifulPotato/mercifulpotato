Not sure what they think that means. This is <i>back pay with interest</i> -- assuming it&#x27;s two years worth of underpayment, it seems safe to say some women and Asians were being &quot;underpaid&quot; by less than 0.1%.<p>Plus they&#x27;re &quot;allocating a cash reserve [for] pay-equity adjustments for the next 5 years&quot;. Wouldn&#x27;t the DoL prefer that Google stop systematically paying women 0.1% less than it pays men? Why is the solution &quot;keep some petty cash on hand, in case we sue you again&quot;? Why in the world does Google need to <i>post a bond</i> for $1.3 million? When has it had less than that amount freely available in its metaphorical pockets?')
