You create a light beam that can make substances vanish, give them properties they shouldn’t possess, or turn them into a perfect mimic of another substance entirely. It’s 21st-century alchemy, in principle capable not just of making lead resemble gold, but of turning ordinary materials into superconductors.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&gt;&quot;For a quantum mechanical system, the equivalent is to know how its quantum wave function evolves in time, which is determined by a mathematical function called the Hamiltonian. And there’s the rub — in all but the simplest systems, such as a hydrogen atom, the Hamiltonian becomes too complicated for researchers to calculate the dynamics of the wave function exactly.&quot;<p>In the absence of that knowledge — needed to calculate in advance what control pulse you need — the only alternative seemed to be trial and error: trying out some initial control pulse and then iterating it by running the same experiment again and again.&quot;<p>PDS: Take out the word &quot;quantum&quot; above.<p>Now, think about what we&#x27;re dealing with as a system of multiple waves, multiple frequencies, except that <i>we can&#x27;t see them or have any other way of knowing what they are</i>.<p>A &quot;black box&quot; of multiple waves, at multiple frequencies, in other words.<p>There&#x27;s nothing quantum or magical about a system like that.<p>It&#x27;s just a system where the input to get the output we want cannot be pre-determined, because we cannot know the exact state of a system at a given instant of time.<p>(Hey, sounds a lot like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle -- &quot;we cannot measure the position (x) and the momentum (p) of a particle with absolute precision. The more accurately we know one of these values, the less accurately we know the other.&quot;  I wonder if there&#x27;s a relationship there?<p>Intuitively, my mind tells me that anything that science calls a &quot;particle&quot; today -- is really just the <i>instantaneous snapshot of a wave packet of multiple waves at multiple frequencies</i>, and this is why, and that the science of tomorrow -- will completely acknowledge this...).<p>So if we can&#x27;t know ahead of time how to modify a system of waves to our liking, we have to experiment, use trial-and-error, and repetition, to have any hope of engineering the output to our liking... as is exactly true with any black box system...<p>But, getting back to a system of multiple waves, this gets into some other topic&#x2F;problem areas around this subject...<p>Such as, how a wave can be used to read the vibration&#x2F;oscillation&#x2F;frequency of another wave, how that can be done in a system of many such simultaneously oscillating waves, fourier analysis, and how small can a process like that be scaled to, and what&#x27;s the maximum frequency of waves that a process like that can be scaled to, etc., etc.<p>Which actually brings us back to &quot;the collapse of the wave function&quot;... (Could a wave A, given a wave B, collapse wave B&#x27;s wave function?  Then (if that gets solved), could a wave A given a series of waves (a wave system) collapse the wave function of that entire series&#x2F;system of waves?  Questions related to this area include such things as &quot;how do you speed a wave up&quot;, &quot;how do you slow a wave down&quot;, and things like the phenomenon of how strobe lights at the proper frequency can apparently &quot;slow things&quot; down, even &quot;reverse&quot; them (i.e., rotating fan blades)...)<p>When science reaches the point where we can read (and subsequently write&#x2F;modify) any wave, at any frequency, at any distance, in any system of waves (without destructively interfering with all of the others) -- then we&#x27;ll be at the borderline between a scientific civilization, and a magical one...<p>Perhaps today&#x27;s quantum computers are early foray into this future knowledge and the possibilities it might hold...<p>&quot;Any science sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic&quot;<p>-Arthur C.
