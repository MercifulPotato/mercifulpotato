I do not have a CS degree. I dabbled in Python, but the first programming course that I took was Harvard&#x27;s CS50 MOOC. I really appreciated learning C because it taught me about the underlying system through concepts like memory management. I agree that Python is friendlier, but I feel like C trains a particular mindset. Python may be more suitable for those who want to get off the ground quickly.')
