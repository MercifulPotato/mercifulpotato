Or at least some size that&#x27;s smaller than the cache line.  You would still pay for the extra unaligned fetches.  I don&#x27;t think this is a valid scenario at all, M1 or not.<p>Anyone want to run these tests on an Intel machine and let us know if the authors &quot;naive model&quot; test hold there?')
