No need for a developer account, or any other external server or party. And there&#x27;s no issues with legacy support because ARM Mac binaries didn&#x27;t exist before now (and the requirement does not apply to Intel apps being run via Rosetta).</i><p>Self-signed applications are treated as if they&#x27;re radioactive by macOS, too.<p>&gt; <i>This really isn&#x27;t a big deal.</i><p>They&#x27;ve been turning the screws slowly over the last two years. It only takes another turn for them to switch off support for self-signed apps for security reasons. Browsers already do this for self-signed certificates.<p>It&#x27;s just not something I&#x27;m willing to base my purchasing decisions on, nor the decisions about what desktop platforms I target with my applications.')
