That is, my thoughts can operate with either one of the three and I switch between them depending on the context. Which is extremely convenient but comes with a drawback - I&#x27;m quite possibly the worst interpreter out there: ask me to translate a sentence with more than one verb and you get gibberish at best. Unless it&#x27;s written down and I have the time to process it.')
