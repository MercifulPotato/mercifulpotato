Your example says &quot;I would bring the DOW to 30k&quot; which is different from what Biden said. He didn&#x27;t say I will bring the vaccine to 100m he said I will get 100m people vaccinated in 100 days. While I can see how that could be interpreted the way you claim I also can and do read it the other way.<p>Either way I think at a minimum there should be attribution as 16.5m is a significant amount of people already vaccinated that the graph appears to give him credit for.')
