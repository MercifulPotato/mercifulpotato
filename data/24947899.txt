Item(by='zxcvbn4038', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604101518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940559, text='The captions feature of Google Hangouts is great if you can&#x27;t hear well, although sometimes it is akin to watching a &quot;bad lip reading&quot; video on You Tube which I&#x27;m sure nobody else notices because I&#x27;m the only one with them turned on.<p>The TDD service hasn&#x27;t changed since the &#x27;90s (1890? 1990? debatable) so I avoid it. It might have been amazing in the &#x27;60s but it is a punishment to use today compared to chat, messaging, e-mail, almost everything else.<p>Most banks don&#x27;t seem to get this and it is precious few that offer secure messaging as an option - First National Bank of Omaha is the best I&#x27;ve found. Citibank has excellent support via chat but all of their financial products are absolutely the worst and their fee structure should be considered usury. CapitalOne has amazing financial products but no provisions for the hard of hearing - if you send them a letter they will send you one right back saying &quot;Call our 800 number&quot; unless you explicitly write that you are writing them because you can&#x27;t use the phone. Thanks, CapitalOne, really helpful.<p>The absolute worst is Amalgamated Bank, as soon as they found out I couldn&#x27;t hear they closed my account and sent me my funds via cashiers check - two months days later.')
