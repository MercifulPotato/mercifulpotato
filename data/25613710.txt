It&#x27;s that the UK nutritional chart doesn&#x27;t track choline at all. It has nothing to do with diet. I was super confused at how this paper had anything to do with the conversation except to say choline exists and is important. Afterwards I googled and choline isn&#x27;t exclusive to meat sources so I&#x27;m still confused what vegetarian&#x2F;vegan diets and choline deficiency have to do with each other- very common vegan&#x2F;vegetarian foods are high in choline like brocoli, peas, chickpeas, various legumes, etc.<p>Could you cite studies that correlate vegetarian&#x2F;vegan diets with deficiencies in nutrition?')
