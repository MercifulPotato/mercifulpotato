Its like buying a car that can go 200mph then using it to drive A to B at the speed limit, same as you can do in a honda civic. Phones are faster, sure, but how much power do your use cases actually require?<p>For me, all I do is email&#x2F;text&#x2F;call&#x2F;mobile web, so getting a processor 10x faster than last generation is a waste of compute resources considering the last generation did all of the above without strain.')
