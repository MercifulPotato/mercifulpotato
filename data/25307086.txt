I can&#x27;t recall what post it was earlier that made it pretty bare. I think it was his reinterpretation of &quot;things that can&#x27;t be said&quot; to be the exact opposite of speaking truth to power, but instead was along the lines of &quot;people in power are having to deal with consequences of their actions that their money can&#x27;t save them from. And that&#x27;s bad.&quot; Yeah and people without money&#x2F;power also have to deal with the consequences of our actions. That&#x27;s a normal facet of life.<p>All the above is very loose of what he said and I honestly stopped paying attention to his posts and barely remember the details now. Someone else likely can make many corrections to what I wrote above. But honestly the plight of the billionaire gets even less empathy from me right now given what people are living through in 2020.')
