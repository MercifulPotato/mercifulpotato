They just want high quality content.  The users and the their dollars will flock to the high quality content.<p>Netflix is feeling like H&amp;M &quot;fast fashion&quot; where they churn out a bazillion low quality shows to throw everything against the wall and hope something sticks to keep people subscribing.<p>Meanwhile the entire field is getting diluted by other platforms popping up and customers are getting fatigued enough to pay for premium content only (HBO&#x2F;Disney&#x2F;ESPN) and then pirate everything else, imo.')
