I do find myself collaborating from time to time with IBMers but most of the time we&#x27;re pretty separate. \n Their culture is <i>very</i> different than ours so it can be interesting when we team up.  I think Red Hat is having a big impact on IBM honestly.  They seem to be really embracing Red Hat tech and culture.  I was really worried when the acquisition happened, but I no longer am worried about it.  In fact, for the first time in a long time I&#x27;m optimistic about IBM.  I&#x27;m looking forward to see what they do.')
