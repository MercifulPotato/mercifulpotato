For the majority of deaths where COVID-19 is reported on the death certificate (approximately 95%), COVID-19 is selected as the underlying cause of death.<p>Furthermore, the CDC write &quot;deaths from all causes excluding COVID-19 were also estimated. Comparing these two sets of estimates — excess deaths with and without COVID-19 — can provide insight about how many excess deaths are identified as due to COVID-19, and how many excess deaths are reported as due to other causes of death.&quot;<p>Since the surface-level description contradicts easily available evidence, why do you believe the rest of the details are any more meaningful?')
