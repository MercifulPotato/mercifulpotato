If it can&#x27;t be A&#x2F;B tested, they are fairly blind to it.<p>There is no good way to A&#x2F;B test how cancellations affect signups.  You can&#x27;t release new seasons of a show to just some customers in a region.  And if you only release new seasons in some regions, there is no way to know if the effect was because of local cultural reasons.<p>Until there is a large movement of people who make a lot of noise about not signing up for Netflix specifically because of their reputation for cancellation, this probably won&#x27;t change.<p>And until then, ironically, this reputation will only make the problem worse.  People will not watch a new show until they know it isn&#x27;t cancelled, leading to even more cancellations because of low viewership.')
