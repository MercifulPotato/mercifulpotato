That&#x27;s a pretty irate judge: they&#x27;re going out of their way, incurring more work upon themselves, to berate you.<p>The only surprising things here are a) it took the judge a week to deny this motion, and b) AWS hasn&#x27;t asked for the case to be transferred to arbitration (given the mandatory arbitration clause in the TOS somewhere).')
