I think it&#x27;s actually more interesting when you zoom out and look at bias caused to a lingua franca of standard modern discourse (it&#x27;s probably counted in units relative to pi and Euler&#x27;s consts on modern computers). If you switch individual words from roman (latin-1) to greek (I only was englightened to this by reading history book about the Byzantine empire, which the author had tried de-latinifying many words). You&#x27;ll see the huge ae-bias, the large effect on greek logic thought its effect on math. Now, what&#x27;s even more interesting is to also take a look at the east. Indo-European languages are all subclassed together in a morphological sense. Most classic Indic languages are heavily prosodic. Sanskrit is a very syntaxic heavy language. Actually the Dali Llama&#x27;s take on it was quite interesting (see: Universe in a Single Atom) about how ancient wisdom, and indeed Buddhism spread from India to Tibet in the first place. It was over the himilaways so the trek was akin people trying to invade the Swiss during the Middle Ages. The vedas seemed to be like early particle physists (and where basically describing the world using all possible of the word were equipossible with basic afterlife being measurable via some abstract karma) who wiped out the memory but indirectly mentioned other Decartes (mind&#x2F;body)-like sects. I wonder if it had anything to do with humidity needing that much &#x27;state space&#x27;. Celsus the greek school of thought (so). The rate at our technology reinvention or more weakly put our transmission of knowledge about nature and what words mean relative to the experiments and phenomenon they describe has rapidly gotten better, but words cannot simply express intent content in and between n-ary multiple brains in a global enough semantic way. I think various IEEE&#x2F;W3C and even Unicode will help debias and preserve aboriginal cultural behavior.')
