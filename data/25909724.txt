(This fatigue alone is something the young should be advised on as an attendant feature of both their eventual success and their failure; this sort of knowledge may enhance their savoring of the former as well as a better weathering of the latter.) As for the second question, I truly wonder.&quot;<p>It is an interesting thought - can we actually learn general principles about life from those that have gone before us? I get that we can learn skills and build on their skills... but how much of life has to be lived to be learned?<p>The fatigue comment also is somewhat refreshing and somewhat depressing... I&#x27;m at most half the age of Brodsky when he is saying this, but is it inevitable that the game&#x2F;race of life will eventually be tedious? Eventually be something that I no longer want to &quot;compete&quot; in?')
