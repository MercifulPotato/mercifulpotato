SMTP isn&#x27;t a &quot;patchwork of standards&quot;, it has a very specific RFC for it.  SMTP works very, very, very well.<p><i>Configuration issues can be, and often are, temporary. Also, bugs are a thing.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t just &quot;a bug&quot; or &quot;a config issue&quot;, this is an edge case bug or config issue.  I&#x27;ve handled literally hundreds of thousands of mail servers in high avail production, with some of those being extremely high volume.<p>What you&#x27;re wanting to change the normal flow of operation, for an extremely rare edge case.<p><i>Of course there&#x27;s a semantic difference between &quot;come back later&quot; and &quot;go away forever&quot;, I&#x27;m just arguing that a client that doesn&#x27;t blindly trust what every connected system tells it is going to more often successfully achieve its goals than one which does.</i><p>Not true here.  In 99.999999% of cases when you get a 5xx response code, the correct thing to do is immediate bounce.  This sort of mess, 5xx &#x27;by accident&#x27;, is insanely rare.<p>And it&#x27;s not &#x27;go away forever&#x27;, it&#x27;s &quot;this specific mail cannot be delivered, please return it to sender, so they can examine the issue and deal with it&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;bring a human into the equation&quot;.<p>How is this an issue?  For something which is very, very rare.')
