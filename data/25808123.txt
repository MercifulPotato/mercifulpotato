I do think there is the potential to have something that retains the relative ease of access that languages like JS, Python and Ruby have offered, but with a much better type system, and perhaps designed with the kind of API-heavy and event-driven programming we use on both the front and back end of many web apps in mind.<p>I suspect that to break into such a huge ecosystem, it would need to have almost transparent interop with JS so in the early days it could use the existing libraries, though I would also hope that many of those libraries would immediately be obsolete or would soon be replaced by native alternatives anyway given that most of them are relatively basic by general programming standards.')
