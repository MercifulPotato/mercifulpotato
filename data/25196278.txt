In mid-2013, NewsBlur was using 48 servers to run its Python&#x2F;Django stack. The workload was reasonably precisely declared (and I could grudgingly see why it used so many servers for its stack), so I was able to run the numbers and confidently concluded that something reasonably efficient (which for me would now mean Rust) could have handled the same workload on <i>one</i> equivalent server, though not with a great deal of headroom, and further vertical scaling might have started running into I&#x2F;O limitations. But for a one-man thing, I know I would prefer to use a single server as long as convenient, and a 98% reduction in hosting bill is very significant (though thatâ€™s a moderately extreme case, and I imagine smaller parts of the code could have been rewritten in a language like Rust to get a meaningful fraction of that resource usage reduction).')
