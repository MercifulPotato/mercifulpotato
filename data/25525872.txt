The web is in the worst shape it&#x27;s ever been. I&#x27;m not terrified of code, I&#x27;ve been writing code for over 20 years. I hate antipatterns and spaghetti code, which is what the modern web is, top to bottom, frameworks and libraries included. The main idea behind javascript was to give small and basic interactivity which is entirely self-contained. Is it now? The fact that the modern web relies on tons of known and unknown projects, complex ci&#x2F;cd pipelines and gigabytes of my hard drive is a clear indication that the js community messed it up. Very similar situation as php, which was intended to be a templating engine (and for that purpose it is brilliant) but just like js, it was turned into Frankenstein&#x27;s monster(still to a lesser degree). And don&#x27;t get me started on the endless security issues npm poses. I&#x27;m blown away by the fact that those are exploited so little - 15 year old me would have been in heaven if given those opportunities, along with half of my classmates. I seriously wonder what teenagers do these days.')
