If they couldn’t get an identifier from the OS, they would be able to get one from the store app, <i>so OS based permissions would be irrelevant</i>.<p>&gt; Again, I still say that the device itself will need to grant an app access to things like GPS, etc. If the user says OK to that request, then whatevs, but the OS will still force the app to request permission.<p>This is irrelevant to preventing tracking of user behavior across apps without consent <i>which is what Facebook is arguing  for</i>.<p>However you raise a good additional point.  An app which asks for GPS to provide a local feature would <i>also</i> be able to sell that data behind the scenes without consent, if the app was sold on a store other than Apple’s.<p>None of this is good.')
