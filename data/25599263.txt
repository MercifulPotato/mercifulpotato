When a bank lends out US dollars, they are effectively creating new money that is treated as “real” money. They don’t technically lend out the deposits. In contrast, crypto lenders can’t create new bitcoin. They need deposits to lend out. The depositer in turn is aware they don’t hold real bitcoin, just a deposit credit at the lender. This is the origin of the crypto mantra “Not your keys, not your crypto.”<p>It’s true that the “M1” value can increase, but unlike fiat money the distinction is (for now) visible to the user.')
