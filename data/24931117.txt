I&#x27;m George, the cofounder who did our first ~100 interviews. Would love to understand more about what makes you queasy so that we can better address those concerns for our customers.<p>One thing I&#x27;ll mention is that all of our interviews are, of course, voluntary. I always begin by telling my guests that if I ask them a question that makes them feel uncomfortable for any reason, I want them to let me know and we can move on. Personally, my experience has been that the people I speak with feel valued when a loved one asks them to tell their stories, and pretty much every person I&#x27;ve spoken with has seemed to enjoy the experience.')
