I wrote a snake game in python and lua.<p>0 based array (python) : \nscreen_pos = x + y * width<p>1 based (lua) : \nscreen_pos = 1 + x + y * width<p><i>shrug</i><p>So 0 based seems to work a little better for arithmetic based array references. But really you&#x27;ll never resolve this to perfection. Assembly language programmers are very unlikely appreciative of 1-based.<p>Its all about what you&#x27;re comfortable with.<p>Those wanting pointers can imagine a base address added to each calculation. 1-based then needs a -1... which is then a strange thing to advocate for.')
