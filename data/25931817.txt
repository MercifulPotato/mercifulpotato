The US supercharger connectors are Tesla-proprietary. In the US, the EU forced Tesla to join the CCS standard.<p>Notably, the CCS standard didn&#x27;t exist when Tesla began rolling out their infrastructure. And I <i>think</i> Tesla open-sourced the patents for their DC charging in the hope that folks would standardize on their technology, but I don&#x27;t know that they ever had plans to allow non-Tesla vehicles t o use their charging network.<p>I also don&#x27;t know if Europe CCS Tesla chargers can be used by non-teslas, but I would assume that&#x27;s the case--otherwise, what&#x27;s the point of the standardization?<p>At any rate, I do hope to see other manufactures push for a unified charging network, explicitly so that non-Tesla EVs can experience the same luxuries as first party vehicles.')
