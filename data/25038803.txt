It&#x27;s a replacement for REST. And the intent is to provide a statically typed, holistic interface and encourage best practices in API design. It&#x27;s also quite nice because there are clients that plug into it and offer substantial benefits as a result, like Relay.<p>There are lots of ways people write resolution methods for GraphQL, and this article provides a good number of them. You can think of them as query optimization approaches if it helps. But it&#x27;s not quite like SQL, where in SQL you say whatever you like and it just gets figured out. GraphQL forces an amount of intention and asks schema writers to consider the most concrete use cases possible rather than just enabling super generic ones.')
