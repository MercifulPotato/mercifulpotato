When people say every athlete takes PEDs, it&#x27;s usually athletes at the very top of their game. And yes, when there are millions or billions (if you&#x27;re Cristiano Ronaldo or Lebron James) of dollars at stake, athlete&#x27;s will take any advantage possible.<p>Do I think every professional athlete is on PEDs? Yes. Does it make what they are doing any less super human? No. It&#x27;s like your typical person looking at a bodybuilder and saying, I could look like that if i did steroids. Which is total bullshit.')
