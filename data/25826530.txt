Then again, I&#x27;m not quite sure what you meant by &quot;await is a partial solution&quot; and &quot;languages that are free to use threads have it best&quot;.<p>As far as your quote goes, I&#x27;ll add:<p>&gt; Or, more precisely: multiple independent callstacks that can be switched between. It isnâ€™t strictly necessary for them to be operating system threads.<p>(Quoting the same paragraph you quoted.)<p>Standard Raku provides support for OS threads; green threads; coroutines; multiple independent callstacks that can be switched between; an `await` that doesn&#x27;t require function coloring and is cooperative, supporting work stealing of its thread when it&#x27;s waiting; multiple other constructs for concurrency, multiple others for asynchrony, multiple others for parallelism; and is an extensible PL anyway.<p>If you could briefly put your comment into that context, so that I (and perhaps other later readers) could better understand it, that would be helpful to me. I plan to upvote both your above comment and any below if what you&#x27;re saying then makes sense to me. TIA if you have time to reply.')
