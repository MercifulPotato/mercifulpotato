You are correct and so are interviewers.<p>Interviewers and interviewees have different incentives.<p>My job as an interviewer is to see through bullshit as efficiently as possible and decide on some realistic compromise when selecting candidates.<p>I also sometimes look for job myself. Technically, I could go with the flow and do whatever other candidates are doing. But I don&#x27;t want to and I don&#x27;t need to. I have over two decades of both development and interviewing experience and I know that just being myself and not trying to impress anybody is already going to impress interviewers a lot.<p>I gladly offer information about which parts of the requirement I am lacking and also I will immediately say that I don&#x27;t know something when I don&#x27;t -- without trying to impress on the interviewer that I know more than in reality. This alone lets me stand out from other candidates.<p>There is one more reason not to try to game the process. It is the most important one. I want to be building trust with my manager from day one. Misleading about my knowledge and experience is best way to immediately taint that cooperation.')
