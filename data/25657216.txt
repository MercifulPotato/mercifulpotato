(They actually don&#x27;t build new roads, just widen them basically, or add expensive toll roads between cities.)<p>They built a central busway several years ago by taking away one lane of pavement from existing traffic.<p>That sounds terrible, but when I say dense, I mean ant-colony dense. Any method to increase to more than 1 or 2 occupants per vehicle was a huge win.<p>It didn&#x27;t work very well at first since the busway lane wasn&#x27;t separated from other lanes, so car drivers would &quot;poach&quot; that lane too.<p>But after it was fenced off, it works ok now.<p>They&#x27;re also completing some type of rail system, but it wasn&#x27;t yet open when I was there last year, though the stations existed. Again, because anything that can be done for mass transit with that density is a win. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they tried helicopters next. :)')
