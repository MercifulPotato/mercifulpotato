Most of the rest just get mild discomfort once a year or every few years. It&#x27;s so common and harmless that doctors won&#x27;t even bother testing for it unless you make them.<p>The connection between HPV and cancer is real but reporting on it overstates its significance. Your risk of developing HPV-related cancer is less than your risk of getting murdered (very low). Also there&#x27;s an effective vaccine against the most oncogenic strains. If you&#x27;re worried, get vaccinated.<p>HIV still sucks, try not to get it, but transmission isn&#x27;t that easy and, while treatment used to be very expensive, we have cheap and effective post-exposure prophylaxis and the price now for the generic form of standard treatment is less than $100 per year, and life expectancy with HIV is now nearly normal.<p>Chlamydia and gonorrhea are cured by a single dose of oral antibiotics. Syphilis is also cured by antibiotics.')
