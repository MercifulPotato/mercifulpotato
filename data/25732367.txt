It wouldn’t be enough technically if your ISP opposed you.<p>&gt; Would you have to start your own ISP, and if so, could your ISP be kicked off the backbone?<p>As a <i>technical</i> and not a legal&#x2F;contractual matter, yes, you could be kicked off by whoever you connected to directly.<p>You’ve claimed that you are asking a technical rather than political question, but virtually all of your specific examples seem framed as legal questions as obviously any connection to a third party can, as a technical matter, be abandoned by the third party.')
