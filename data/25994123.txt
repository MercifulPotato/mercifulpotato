I just want phone accommodation. I want a good place to mount it and I want its audio to come out my stereo. Maybe play controls on my steering wheel but that&#x27;s it. The car doesn&#x27;t need its own software. My car is fourteen years old. Hopefully my next car will last at least that long. Sundar Pichai himself could personally promise me that my car will receive security updates for twenty years and I&#x27;d still laugh in his face at the very idea.')
