We know what a dictatorship looks like, and we know how terrible your life can be when the government abandons its duty to protect people.<p>To put it other way, &quot;Your government shouldn&#x27;t have enough power to fight an epidemic, because that&#x27;s too much power&quot; has never been an actual argument in Korea, and (I believe) most of Asia as well.  We don&#x27;t want a small, underpowered government.  We want a properly supervised government that uses its power to protect people.')
