Item(by='gnicholas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611547354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898708, text='I recently opened UberEats because I was given an Uber gift card. There was a promo that said &quot;no delivery fee&quot; and I thought, &quot;that seems too good to be true, but let&#x27;s see.&quot; I then saw a promo for a local donut shop that was buy-one-get-one for certain items. It appeared that I could have two donuts delivered to my door for just a few dollars. This seemed too good to be true, although the donut shop is pretty nearby.<p>I went through to the payment screen and was greeted by several delivery-related fees, including a &quot;small order fee&quot; (which presumably only applies to inexpensive orders) and a &quot;service fee&quot;, and a &quot;CA Driver Benefits fee&quot;. None of these fees apply on orders that you pick up yourself, so it&#x27;s pretty dishonest to say &quot;no delivery fee&quot; front and center in the app.<p>The user only discovers these fees at the very last screen, once they&#x27;ve invested in researching restaurants, choosing items, adding them to their cart, and possibly coordinating with other family members regarding their preferences&#x2F;orders. Basically, users are much more locked-in by the time they realize there are actually many delivery-related fees, even if the &quot;delivery fee&quot; itself is not applied (when I looked another time, this particular fee was much smaller (1&#x2F;8-1&#x2F;4) of the delivery-related fees that remained.')
