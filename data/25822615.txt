I hear that Americans are obsessed with health, but oh boy, have they looked into Japan. Small clinics are everywhere and they&#x27;re always filled with anxious patients because they have a benign stomach pain or something. Physical checkup is mandatory for most companies. I also read that the fear of COVID in Japan is the strongest in the world, despite a relatively low infection&#x2F;death number here. People are always talking about their health, and so is the national media. If you watch the Japanese TV, you&#x27;ll also feel sick, simply because there&#x27;s so much fear! Maybe this is good for public health overall, but I bet there&#x27;s a certain mental toll.</i><p>Ah, this explains how the rapey, but criminally attractive, <i>bisyounen</i> love interest in my favorite Japanese love fiction always rushes the protagonist to the infirmary in schools at the slightest cough, missing valuable lessons, and at the approval of the teacher, for merely walking their on one&#x27;s own ambulance would be too much of a risk, if one have recently caughed.<p>From what I understand, in the U.S.A. and U.K. schools also have an infirmary and a licensed nurse that works there. â€” here in the Netherlands, no such thing existed, and a simple cough or headache was certainly not a reason to miss lessons.')
