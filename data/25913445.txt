Still you need a server that can handle users, p2p saving is secondary.\ni also found out about backblaze b2 and cloudflare bandwidth alliance where you pay for only b2 storage and cloudflare takes egress of data. if that works for peertube, that would be awesome. i will definitely set something up as a test in the coming days')
