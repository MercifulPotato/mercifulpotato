Your employer controls access to your salary, healthcare benefits, and potentially more. Leaving your job is never a completely safe move and there&#x27;s an abundance of reasons why it&#x27;s simply not an option to most people, and it doesn&#x27;t matter what tier of middle class occupation you have for that to be true.<p>Moreso this argument isn&#x27;t one to be taken seriously because it assumes every collective failure is a failure of millions of individual choices rather than any of the cultural inertia or environmental influences that steer our choices.')
