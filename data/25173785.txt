I would highly recommend something like this for remote employees. There is a strong enough delineation between home and work with the added benefit that I can turn the office into sort of a man cave. I can “decorate” it in ways that I don’t really want in my home. I guess its sort of a compartmentalized place that I can be an adult for work but also a kid during off hours.<p>I do miss the interactions with coworkers and the water cooler conversations but there are always trade offs.')
