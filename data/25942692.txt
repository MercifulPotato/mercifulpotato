That crimes were committed doesn&#x27;t mean he should burn to death. The legal system should pick the punishment.<p>There&#x27;s a reason you&#x27;re not allowed to have pure drive-by-wire either, requiring mechanical connection to brake and steering.<p>While doors are generally less of a concern, but it&#x27;s still nice to know that the door handle works when the electronics do not. Such as when there is a fire. Braking a window is harder than you might think if you don&#x27;t carry a dedicated tool for it.<p>(And no, while this guy was a criminal, that does not mean all fires are by criminals, nor that criminals should burn to death)')
