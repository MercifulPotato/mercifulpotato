It is completely a red herring to just read a headline about how little electricity a tiny country uses and that mining uses the same amount.<p>what? &quot;wasted energy&quot;? yeah a lot of energy is lost as it cannot be transported to commercial and residential areas economically. so miners set up processing at the source of the energy and use it. in fact, a lot of it actually reduces pollution creating the polar opposite of what you believe, in those circumstances it is a sustainability solution.<p>now aside from fighting me about your worldview, this is also an area to remain vigilant about! nation states can absolutely mine at a loss when they turn to competing for control of the cryptocurrency networks for geopolitical reasons. right now it is renewable.<p>but what about the hardware, the single purpose hardware and e-waste? there is a large trade of &quot;obsolete&quot; hardware, as it is economical to use for people with the cheapest power. this is also another specific area to be vigilant about, by making sure the infrastructure is in place to put that hardware and keep it active, instead of landfills.')
