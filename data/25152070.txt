They all had some inherent advantages, at least at the time, and a lot of disadvantages. While I am very nostalgic for a lot of those (and still engaged in a several!) there is indeed a lot of viewing the past through rose-colored glasses at play here.<p>Forums certainly had their strengths, but also tons of weaknesses. Low effort posts, poorly moderated, highly dispersed, mostly anonymous (For better and worse). I suspect the forums that stuck around and added value for their members were a very small minority.<p>The one common thing I noticed about online communities that flourished long-term was actual engagement between members outside of the stated topic. I was on a listserv over twenty years ago that was ostensibly about a certain band, but typically ventured well off-topic most of the time. Everyone went their separate ways, but a lot of the core members have reconnected on Facebook and know each other better than ever. Conversely, I&#x27;ve been on a certain well-known forum for almost as long, and while I know a lot about people&#x27;s lives through various engagement I have almost no connection with them outside of the actual forum itself.')
