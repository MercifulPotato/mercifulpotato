There are so many places in the Android sources where uses of google servers, services, etc. are baked-in.  Even one of the &quot;de-Googled&quot; Chromium forks has to do some hacky stuff to ensure requests to google servers  generated by internal request don&#x27;t pass through.  I mean, it&#x27;s not technically impossible, but I suspect you mean something much narrower than just &quot;never connects to a google server unless you explicitly request it to&quot;.')
