Item(by='bitdizzy', descendants=None, kids=[24850700], score=None, time=1603300886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848716, text='Correlation being 0.8 means that R^2 is 0.64. A test that can only explain 64% of the variance in its result based on the fact that I am still me is suspect.<p>&gt; This places exactly zero constraints on the utility of IQ tests. Instead of asking why group A scores higher than group B, I can simply ask why group B is impaired relative to group A. Apparently that should be enough to convince you of the validity of the comparison.<p>I said significant impairment. I don&#x27;t mean significant in the statistical sense but in the sense of &quot;wow that&#x27;s really noticeable&quot;. Basically any test of aptitude can be used to detect lead poisoning, or the impacts of brain tumor removal, for example.<p>Please answer my request though, in which contexts do you think IQ suffers from denialism?')
