They haven&#x27;t made any breaking changes so far.<p>Which brings me to another point: not all breaking changes are equal. Sometimes, a change to a syntactic element is needed. But if there&#x27;s an identical replacement for it, and it can be updated mechanically, there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem (in theory).<p>Making constructions or the standard library do things (subtly) differently without a fall-back to the original functionality is a much bigger problem: then you have to inspect every occurrence and verify if it still works under all conditions.')
