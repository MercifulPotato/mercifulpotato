I have two reasons why I think the opinion is still valid:<p>I&#x27;m not completely incompetent. I have produced useful web frontend work. After having spent more time on web technologies than a lot of others I still find it to be slower and harder. This point is about learning - I have done some learning in both and I can compare. It&#x27;s a small sample size, but seems to agree with the experience of other people.<p>The other point is that most people talking about this are already experts in HTML&#x2F;CSS. That learning is a sunk cost for them so they&#x27;re not making fair comparisons. I also sometimes feel like there&#x27;s a little &#x27;Stockholm syndrome&#x27; - they&#x27;ve invested time and effort in learning the techniques and tools required to produce good quality web UI, and now that they can they overlook the effort required to get to that point and proclaim the wonderful nature of what they&#x27;re using.<p>The sunk cost thing is the important aspect. I&#x27;m not even saying that it&#x27;s wrong that it&#x27;s become the standard UI description language - it as at least an open specified standard. I&#x27;m just saying that not enough attention is paid to the downsides.')
