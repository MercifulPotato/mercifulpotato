The correct design is probably something like isolation by default but optional (ie, allowing sharing). The current design means further protocols and de-facto standards are required to support, eg, streaming and screenshots. That is bad for an ecosystem that relies on low barriers to entry to get good software written.<p>Basically, there needed to be a security model but the developers skipped it because it seemed like it shouldn&#x27;t be the compositor&#x27;s job. And after a very painful couple of years, seems quite likely that it <i>was</i> the compositor&#x27;s job.')
