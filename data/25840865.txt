In the park, protesters faced the familiar pop, pop, pop of pepper bullets and stinging clouds of tear gas meant to push back hundreds of them as they tried, again and again, to break through the police barricades set up around President Trump’s home.</i><p>&gt; <i>Later, American flags and parked cars and buildings were lit ablaze — including St. John’s Church, a historic landmark opened in 1816 and attended by every president since James Madison. Firefighters quickly extinguished the basement fire, which police said was intentionally set.</i><p>Protesters then, as on Jan 6th, tried to entice officers to take their side;<p>&gt; <i>A black officer, according to witnesses, briefly took a knee in solidarity with the protesters, who cheered.</i><p>&gt; <i>Not long after, another officer made an announcement on a megaphone: “Attention: We will continue to move back unless you break the police line.”</i><p>&gt; <i>And again, cheering from the protesters, many of whom appeared to want the officers to join them rather than fight with them.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;may&#x2F;31&#x2F;fires-light-up-washington-dc-on-third-night-of-george-floyd-protests" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;may&#x2F;31&#x2F;fires-light-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;31&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;washington-dc-george-floyd-protests.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;31&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;washington-dc...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;dc-braces-for-third-day-of-protests-and-clashes-over-death-of-george-floyd&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;31&#x2F;589471a4-a33b-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;dc-braces-for-third-day...</a>')
