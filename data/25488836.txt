Basically I&#x27;m doing DIY thermostats for floor heating and only 4 copper conductors were available. Stumbled on PJON with Softwarebitbang and it seemed to fit the bill, although they do recommend twisted and&#x2F;or shielded cabling.<p>With no background in hardware and Arduino  there was a lot of learning to do, but in the end I&#x27;m really happy that it&#x27;s been working flawlessly for a few months now and one copper conductor is even unused.<p>Don&#x27;t have an oscilloscope so no idea how &quot;ideal&quot; the situation is on the wire with regards to electrical interference, but for anyone interested, it&#x27;s running in a star topology with wire lengths about 20 metres on, with ESP32&#x27;s as the microcontrollers.<p>edit: thanks for PJON, gioscarab!')
