Jobs &gt; Candidates. When&#x2F;If this balence is broken tech jobs salary will decrease. It also is justified because tech jobs generate value, in either revenue or equity, arguably. That also can change in the future.<p>Creating a digital currency and digital passport doesn&#x27;t create wealth out of thing air. So you need money to pay for the services you plan to provite your denizens with. You are invariably asking richer individuals to pay for their own services plus extra for the poor denizens.<p>That&#x27;s just socialism, when you force your denizens to finance equal services for all. Or donation with extra steps when they do it out of the generosity in their hearts.<p>I don&#x27;t see how you can spin this into anything that makes sense.')
