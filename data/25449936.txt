One of the distinguishing features people have highlighted with the M1 is a 128-bit wide bus, much as the Sony&#x2F;Toshiba Emotion Engine has (though it appears to have 128-bit wide registers, while the M1&#x27;s are 64 bits wide), as well as custom supporting hardware (the M1&#x27;s Neural Engine and image signal processor, as opposed to the EE&#x27;s two vector processing units and hardware MPEG-2 decoder). Can someone who understands more about processor hardware provide some input?')
