False claims outside any contract shouldn&#x27;t be considered fraud.<p>And yes, there can be limitations on freedom (including freedom of speech), but the burden of proof falls on the side arguing for the limitations. And the reason for limiting formal freedom (e.g. freedom to lie on a contract) should always be to increase  &quot;freedom&quot; in practice (all the practical and legal arrangements that contract law makes possible).<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good reason for insurrectionist speech to be (legally) banned, because I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good reason for any political speech to be banned, as horrible as it may be (nazism, keynesian economics, etc), because all political speech is ultimately violent speech. And banning one strand of political speech is morally the same thing as banning any other.')
