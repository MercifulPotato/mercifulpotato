In most cases they are applied because the authors want to do open source and it&#x27;s expected that the licence is enough to uphold that spirit. But it&#x27;s not enough and hasn&#x27;t been for a long time now. The AGPL was created for this reason but oddly developers have gone the opposite direction and &quot;permissive&quot; licences have become the fashion. Many of them are now realising there was a reason for licences like GPL and AGPL after all.')
