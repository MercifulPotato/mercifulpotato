The only answer I see is that you make more money. But it is well understood that money doesn&#x27;t lead to happiness.<p>What if your company was making enough money that you could pay everyone worked there generous salaries and your customers are happy. If you product is complete I don&#x27;t see the need to add more. Why not let everyone work half time, and continue to deliver an excellent and focused product. Slowly adding features and integrations only as they make sense.<p>What we see instead by companies aiming to maximize profit is that they keep adding stuff that no one wants, hiring more people and squeezing every cent out of their customers. Sure, they make more money for a while but if you give me those two options I would much rather work half the hours and pay my employees more with happy customers.')
