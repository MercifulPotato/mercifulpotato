They&#x27;re not like Backpage at all in that regard (and that verdict was harmful regardless). All the violent parleys Amazon mentioned are from nobodies and they have barely any upvotes.<p>You&#x27;re right with the second paragraph though, in the US de-facto monopolistic companies are allowed to discriminate their customers regardless of public interest. Visa and Mastercard is allowed to ban Wikileaks from receiving any donations at all (thank God for cryptocurrencies) since they posted info about war crimes and Amazon is allowed to ban social networks that doesn&#x27;t fact check.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t be that way. Public interests needs some protection, even though companies are the suppliers.')
