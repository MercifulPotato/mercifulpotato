A lot of parties are going to be harmed by this; it is an expensive tuition payment to the school of hard knocks.<p>The most interesting technical thing about this fracas is the fact that WSB has managed to play the options-sellers off against the shorts to set this off. The kids have temporarily played the adults off against one another and caused an explosion.<p>In the end, the savvy and the lucky will have more capital than in the beginning, and the un-trained and unlucky are going to be very sad. In the meantime, food-fights are fun while the food is flying.')
