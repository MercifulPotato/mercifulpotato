It is not triggered automatically, so every time I change the database I need to manually run a one-line script. But it&#x27;s not that bad because once stable, one doesn&#x27;t change the database often. Rclone also support strict one-way copy. On the mobile side, Keepass2Android can automatically sync down the database.<p>Also, not all hopes are lost. There is a 3-year-old ticket to add trigger system to KeePassXC: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keepassxreboot&#x2F;keepassxc&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1016" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keepassxreboot&#x2F;keepassxc&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1016</a>')
