Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=[25867116], score=None, time=1611273876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25866196, text='Yes, it&#x27;s possible to take an existing Apache 2.0 codebase, release some new Apache 2.0 code, build a $15B business, and then stop offering your code under Apache 2.0. Great! Shareholder value! That&#x27;s literally what you set out to do! How could it have possibly failed?<p>What I&#x27;m actually saying is that <i>when people think that outcome is a bad thing</i>, their beef is with our particular breed of capitalism. When they say &quot;This good outcome could have been so much better, had there been regulations on breaking up large companies so they can&#x27;t bully small ones,&quot; then what they&#x27;re saying is that they&#x27;re objecting to the free market as it exists in our particular breed of capitalism. And when they say, as others say, &quot;This good outcome could have been so much better if it weren&#x27;t for the dictators at the OSI micromanaging the term &#x27;open source&#x27;,&quot; then what they&#x27;re actually saying is they&#x27;re objecting to <i>companies</i> freely choosing to believe what the OSI says, because the OSI has no power. If you think that something was short of the mark here, that something was our breed of capitalism.<p>I&#x27;m agreeing with you. Capitalism did not fail. It did what everyone expected it to do. If you&#x27;re happy with the outcome, great! I&#x27;m not telling anyone they ought to be unhappy with the outcome. But if you <i>are</i> unhappy with the outcome, I&#x27;m telling you why.')
