Conversely, sometimes people can reach substantially incorrect conclusions based on correct reasoning, interpretation or data.<p>I&#x27;m worried this one will get lost in amongst all the other good points. Human society has numerous mechanisms (traditions and ethics being the big ones, but also rules and stories) that are there to guide people to make good decisions even if they can&#x27;t explain why they are good.<p>Everyone knows lying is bad, for example.
