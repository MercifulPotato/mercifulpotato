One of our devs accidentally caused an infinite loop with one of the Google Maps paid APIs on our dev account and within hours both our prod and dev accounts were suspended (pro tip: don&#x27;t link your prod account to the billing account of your dev account). The worst part was that after removing the suspension, our cloud functions were broken and had to be investigated and fixed by Google engineers themselves resulting in our prod app being down for 24 hours... be very careful.<p>Luckily we were able to get $11K refunded on our card and received $6K credits after spending all night with Google support.')
