I feel like coding is not that dissimilar.<p>In the early phases of learning a new coding language, I learn how to write lines of code. Sometimes it compiles, most of the time it would cause errors.<p>At some point it works, but a more seasoned engineer could easily find places to refactor it in order to make it more extensible&#x2F;flexible, easier to read, less brittle, and most importantly to this discussion on coding language, more idiomatic.<p>Now, you could say surely I could&#x27;ve seen these by reading the docs and learning about certain library features or patterns specific to the language. But in my experience, I tend to learn faster by first exercising my brain and trying it out on my own take before having someone (be it a mentor or a tutorial&#x2F;book) correct me so that I have a bit more context about why an alternative approach is better.')
