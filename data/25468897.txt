Still, we may need to do some testing on the specific vaccine. Perhaps much of this testing can be done with computer modeling, and some with animal testing.<p>and<p>&gt; The question ultimately comes down to risk vs benefit. We need to get over our evolved but suboptimal instinct to avoid directly causing harm preferentially over passively allowing harm to occur. In the end, the amount of harm is all that matters. In a situation like this, delivering a vaccine as quickly as possible while maintaining sufficient safety and efficacy, there is a sweet spot somewhere that minimizes disease, death, and disruption. We want that sweet spot, even it if means delivering a vaccine that has not been tested as much as we would like. It would mean accepting more risk form the vaccine in order to reduce risk from the pandemic.<p>Think of the crazy amount (highlight on the crazy) of opposition you have to vaccines now. Imagine if you get one vaccine with just a slightly higher amount of negative reactions, and even a few deaths that were clearly vaccine-caused, due to rushing the approval process. You will have set back public health <i>decades</i>.<p>Look at covid: its fatality rate is actually quite low, well well below 1%. If we give the vaccine to <i>everyone</i>, you need to have <i>extremely</i> low adverse reactions for it to be a net positive because we&#x27;re giving it to so many people.<p>I feel that these types of articles that argue &quot;We need to get over our fundamental human irrationality&quot; are pointless, because we are, after all, human.')
