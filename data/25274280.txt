Item(by='cromwellian', descendants=None, kids=[25276077], score=None, time=1606897118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25270540, text='No, Pressured Water Reactors (LPWRs) are large, expensive, dangerous, etc. Molten Salt Reactors, especially Thorium Molten Salt Reactors (e.g. LFTR) are much much smaller and passively safe.<p>What you&#x27;re missing is that cost scales with volume. If you use a technology that allows you to reduce your reactor size by a linear factor of 2, you reduce its reduce volume and cost by a factor of 8.<p>Likewise, while ITER is uber expensive like large PWRs, ARC is 10 times smaller, and a factor of 30 times or more cheaper.  It&#x27;s also not as complex as some fission reactors, the most complex elements being the HTS magnets and the blanket.<p>This is the problem with ITER and PWRs, they have convinced the public that nuclear energy is inherently dangerous and expensive and impossible to make substantially safer, cleaner, and cheaper, but that is false.<p>You should look up at the history of LPWRs vs MSRs from the guy who invented them. There&#x27;s a documentary on the Oak Ridge Molten Salt Reactor experiment. He himself thought LPWRs were too dangerous requiring ginormous size and shielding, but the US government and cronies, preferred LPWRs, and so MSRs were abandoned, despite successful trials.')
