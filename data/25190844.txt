The other project had a nonstandard license with a clause that only applied to browsers run on Microsoft Windows, which is really bizarre for a JS library that can run on any browser.  Apparently the original developer was working for Microsoft at the time, and Microsoft mandated the license clause.<p>In a funny twist of fate, Microsoft now uses SheetJS open source to power some Excel exports in Office 365!  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tasks.office.com&#x2F;License.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tasks.office.com&#x2F;License.html</a> is the license disclosure, and you can actually see it in action in the exported files.<p>We were blown away when we found out.  It&#x27;s the ultimate endorsement!  Oftentimes we just wonder what would have happened if Microsoft just let the original project adopt a standard open source license.')
