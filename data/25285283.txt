Item(by='vosper', descendants=None, kids=[25285728], score=None, time=1606968656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284773, text='You&#x27;re probably right, but I&#x27;ll give you a concrete example: here&#x27;s a post from today that was downvoted when I commented on it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25280929" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25280929</a><p>It appeared to be making a factual claim about how MDM works, (and here&#x27;s where I get subjective) counter to a prevailing narrative in the thread. It&#x27;s not downvoted anymore, but there was no explanation available (and there still isn&#x27;t). Was the comment wrong? Did people just not like it? Did they think it was off-topic to what it was replying to, or missing the point? We&#x27;ll never know. I&#x27;d like to know :)<p>Also, I think a system like I&#x27;m proposing would make it easier to find the quality comments and threads, and avoid (if you want to) the controversial stuff, the hot-takes, the me-too comments, the pandering to the HN crowd &#x2F; tropes - etc...')
