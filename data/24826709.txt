We all understand and agree how IPv4 and IPv6 works (mostly), and how HTTP works, and how (mostly) the networking layer works.<p>Introducing more competing standards leads to a complete mess, have you seen USB lately? USB-4 and its optional components, USB 4 gen 2x2 and USB 4 Gen 3X2 but there&#x27;s also USB 4 Gen 3x1 and Gen 3x2 as well as 3x3 and 3x4, except I am lying about the last two, or maybe the first two? I can&#x27;t remember the standards are confusing.<p>Oh, that USB-C cable bricked your Nintendo Switch? Oh the Raspberry PI screwed up their type-c implementation?<p>Yup, competing standards are amazing, especially when they compete with themselves!<p>I agree with what you&#x27;re saying partially, but at times you <i>do</i> need someone who can make a decision and be the <i>decider</i> of <i>how</i> things work.<p>Do you really think you could type in this textarea today without people deciding that? I am sure of the 100&#x27;s of processes involved in using a computer, writing in this text area, clicking &quot;post&quot; (http, browser, the OS, kernel, drivers, even electricity itself, ISPs, etc etc) somebody made a decision and that was that.<p>We couldn&#x27;t use the internet without a person being a dictator somewhere in the chain.')
