None of the people&#x2F;groups I know using matlab have moved to pytorch, or even gnu octave which is a much closer fit.<p>Because its not really about matlab so much has the huge collection of library&#x2F;extensions for matlab or its close relationship to simulink. Decades of industry specific modeling&#x2F;simulation&#x2F;tooling built into peoples workflows are hard to change.<p>If you look at the &quot;applications&quot; section here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mathworks.com&#x2F;products.html?s_tid=gn_ps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mathworks.com&#x2F;products.html?s_tid=gn_ps</a> pytorch really only touches on a couple of them AFAIK.<p>Deep engineering tooling is one of the places where opensource really hasn&#x27;t yet made inroads. From the lack of a good solidworks&#x2F;cad toolchain to the modeling&#x2F;simulation space. Even EDA remains deeply dependent on proprietary tooling despite the recent success in a number of places. So while board level design with kicad may start eating into the Altium space now that its beginning to get RF&#x2F;etc capabilities. I don&#x27;t see it biting into the cadence&#x2F;synopsis&#x2F;mentor space anytime in the near future if ever due to the secrecy of the foundries.<p>I think a large part of that is there is a lot of breath in this space, and the customer base is generally quite small.<p>So I think a good opensource PCB layout&#x2F;modeling tool, and a decent parametric 3d cad program will happen a lot sooner.')
