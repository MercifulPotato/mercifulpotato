Have you considered doing atomic swaps with a network like Stellar for a low fee transaction environment? They have a Metamask alternative called Albedo that you could probably effectively integrate into Brave.<p>I&#x27;ve worked a lot with Stellar and would be glad to help (not shilling, I don&#x27;t own many XLM, I just know the network well).<p>Contact in bio if you&#x27;re interested.')
