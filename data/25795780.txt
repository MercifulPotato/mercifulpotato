Of course it is protected by &quot;freedom of speech&quot; or in this case more likely by &quot;freedom of art&quot;. But then Erdogan&#x27;s lawyers found out there&#x27;s an old German law about insulting other countries&#x27; state heads.<p>To make it clear: Insulting is not freedom of speach in Germany. So it does make sense that it had to be checked whether it was an insult of a state head or not.<p>It ended with removing that law because it&#x27;s stupid.')
