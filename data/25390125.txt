How does anyone grow in this environment?<p>I&#x27;ve heard this argument often.<p>What I&#x27;m about to say is not directed at you personally but your argument.<p>Maybe you, general you, are the one who needs to grow. It&#x27;s possible that your knowledge of the subject is dated, judgement clouded by any number of things, that you underestimate the severity of the problem, that you&#x27;re conflating a dislike of a person, movement, idea with groups of people, or other things.<p>I say this because most of the time when people make this comment they follow it up or precede it with some very questionable statements. Generally these inappropriate statements are rooted in ignorance of the topic though sometimes your argument is used in bad faith to justify hateful or discriminatory ideals, speech, and action.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not suggesting anything against you idrios, merely adding my experience with this argument.')
