That seems to indicate there&#x27;s some non-zero something there, with how much being up for debate.<p>It is already public knowledge that Hunter Biden has addiction issues. How does this photo make you believe the other claims are authentic? I&#x27;ve heard before that a standard disinformation tactic is to sprinkle some truth along with the lies.<p>I&#x27;m particularly skeptical of using an unrelated personal problem to assassinate his father&#x27;s character as being involved in some sort of international business crimes.<p>&gt; We should probably withhold judgement and let the facts come out. Let people compare the signature on this contract for the laptop with Hunter&#x27;s, let people forensically analyze the image, etc.<p>while you&#x27;re claiming that reasonable people should withhold judgement, the election is 2-3 weeks away and low-information voters are not going to wait for a forensic analysis to form their impressions. It should be &#x27;innocent until proven guilty&#x27;, full stop, but you&#x27;re saying it should be the other way around and that we should keep our minds open to the possibility that he&#x27;s guilty. Totally backwards.')
