It may be that the only way they could have heard of Y within 2 years of facing the problem is through conversation. But once they hear the name of Y, they have something to punch into google.<p>&gt; they should be encouraged to at least try to find a solution<p>Note that having someone _assume_ you did not try after you&#x27;ve spent hours of effort is also quite isolating.<p>People who do not first try are indeed frustrating. There is a judgement for junior engineers to learn to exercise here.<p>------------------------------------------<p>&gt; it also robs you of a learning experience if you are always relying on other people to guide you through solving problems<p>Which is why this is a matter of judgement and balance, where extremes like &quot;always&quot; rarely apply.<p>&gt; it can be exhausting for the person that has to guide you.<p>Very yes.\nThis is why it&#x27;s crucial to deny without justification some honest requests from those who need help.<p>1) So you do not exhaust yourself.<p>2) So that fear of exhausting yourself doesn&#x27;t push you to assume a request for help is an excuse and treat another person as if they are lazy.<p>------------------------------------------<p>&gt; Well, that is also where the maximum reward exists - when you think something is impossible and then you discover you are able to do it.<p>1) If.<p>2) We should aim to recognise the difference between &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;unimaginably hard&quot;.<p>Impossible problems are a waste of time and we should not encourage people to solve them but instead to be skeptical of impossibility.<p>Landing a man on was impossible _until_ congress allocated money to have a lot more engineers collaborate. Then it was no longer impossible but did come with many easy, moderate, hard, and unimaginably hard problems.<p>3) Unimaginably hard problems don&#x27;t just require focus. They also require de-focus to see odd connections. We should aim to help junior engineers recognise the difference so they wisely decide when to keep banging away and when to go for a random walk.')
