The first picture from the link shows some rather monumental structures that tower over occupants and users of green spaces. Later in the Wikipedia article they talk about tearing some of these down.<p>As well as amenities, green spaces etc there is always a requirement for buildings to be of ‘human’ scale for it to feel liveable.<p>Also there are benefits to organic growth over centralised planning as growth can adapt to requirements of a place. Centralised planning tends to be too rigid and once a failure becomes apparent it is difficult to re-plan without sacrificing some other amenity.')
