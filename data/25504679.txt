That can either be per incident or per hour.<p>In case anyone is thinking this gives engineers the wrong incentive, my experience has been the opposite. Nobody minds being on-call, and not only no one is intentionally sabotaging the systems in order to get called out.<p>The call-out compensation is widely seen as an extra to compensate for a night of bad&#x2F;interrupted sleep as opposed to being something you look forward to cashing in, and it serves as an incentive to convince managers that systems are better off being resilient on their own rather than relying on manual intervention.')
