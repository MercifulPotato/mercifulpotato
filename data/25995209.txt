I think the actual use case for a casual gamer is absolutely there, running and playing decent games from many different devices, without having to invest in and own a more expensive PC equipped with higher end internals (graphics, etc.).<p>I am worried about Google&#x27;s ability to actually execute and make this successful, however (And that does give me hesitancy to buying some of the games that are on there, because they aren&#x27;t transferrable to somewhere else if Stadia is shut down).<p>For one, with this in-house studio model, they haven&#x27;t even <i>shipped</i> a single game yet and they&#x27;re pulling the plug on the approach. That just seems like giving up before they&#x27;ve even tried. But Ok...<p>As others have said, the single biggest issue with Stadia is not that it doesn&#x27;t work wonderfully (it does), it is the extremely limited catalog of games available that needs to be addressed. If they can successfully address that, then they really do have a pretty sweet offering that will be tough to beat.')
