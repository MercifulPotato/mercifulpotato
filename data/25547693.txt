This mission failed to land on the moon, and the lunar module carrying its generator burnt up during re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, with the trajectory arranged so that the cask would land in the trench. The cask survived re-entry, as it was designed to do,[18] and no release of plutonium has been detected. The corrosion resistant materials of the capsule are expected to contain it for 10 half-lives (870 years).[19]</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliar...</a>')
