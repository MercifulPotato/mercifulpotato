The awkwardness is only temporary. If you can already see the beauty of Lisp code, then you just need to build a little project in it to make the awkwardness fade away.<p>I recommend Clojure&#x2F;ClojureScript. It&#x27;s quite practical for web development and also an excellent gateway into functional programming.')
