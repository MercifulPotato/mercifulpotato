Item(by='0xy', descendants=None, kids=[25341672], score=None, time=1607398518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25341150, text='&gt;I will resign immediately if you don&#x27;t do X, Y, Z.<p>&gt;We accept your resignation with immediate effect.<p>That couldn&#x27;t be clearer to me. Negotiation is bad in those cases because they&#x27;ll always resent you (and such demands are only made when emotions are at boiling point).<p>I&#x27;ve literally never given ultimatums to any employer, because that&#x27;s like negotiating with a nuclear weapon equipped.')
