When I tried making a Jupyter notebook for a presentation I was planning and tried to type code there I realized: &quot;I don&#x27;t know the syntax, because I never needed to learn it. If I present like this I&#x27;ll look like someone who doesn&#x27;t know how to code&quot;. Was really ashamed of myself at that point.<p>So I forced myself to write code in Vim without any plugins for two weeks until I could type fluently. I was in insert mode most of the time, and did not use hjkl movement naturally, but it worked wonders, I could write words without interruption, my thoughts flowed freely.<p>Then I tried switching back to Sublime and felt less precise. Like vim was this stone path I was walking with confidence, and Sublime this fluid river I needed to row a boat on. Also for some reason I noticed that when using Vim, my wrist would feel lighter, while switching back to Sublime and using a mouse my wrist would suddenly gain &quot;pressure&quot;. That&#x27;s when I made the switch to Vim permanently and started customizing it. Only switched to Emacs, and later Spacemacs due to poor &quot;Find and replace in project&quot; functionality.')
