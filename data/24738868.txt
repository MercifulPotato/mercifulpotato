The next time, a kernel update makes sound stop working after waking up from standby. It&#x27;s mostly small regressions, and they usually get fixed a week later, but something temporarily stops working at least once every 2 months.<p>However, Arch also makes it much, much easier to run recent versions of, basically everything. You never have to fiddle around with 3rd-party package repos, you just install stuff and it works. It&#x27;s how package managers are supposed to work, but not the experience I&#x27;ve ever had with Debian and Ubuntu. Of course, the fact that Pacman is fantastically fast compared to apt doesn&#x27;t hurt either.<p>I love Arch. In aggregate, I think it prevents more headaches than it causes. But you have to be prepared for some unexpected problems and fiddling around.')
