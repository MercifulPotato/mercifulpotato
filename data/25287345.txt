I know that&#x27;s not people want to hear, but I don&#x27;t think there is any way around it.<p>1. Ban all single use plastics that can be replaced somewhat economically with biodegradable materials (with a small price increase, maybe 2-5-10%).<p>2. Standardize plastic container compositions, shapes and sizes in a huge ISO catalog. <i>EVERY</i> product a company makes&#x2F;uses has to be from this catalog. Companies can add another category one by going through the standardization process. Marketing can be done by applying biodegradable materials to the exterior.<p>Basically have a few material compositions:<p>- high strength&#x2F;heavy<p>- medium strength&#x2F;medium weight<p>- reduced strength&#x2F;light<p>Have a standardized set of sizes:<p>- 100ml (and US equivalent)<p>- 250ml<p>- 330ml<p>- 500ml<p>...<p>Plus a standardized set of shapes for each size.<p>At the end of the day you&#x27;d get:<p>3 x number of sizes (probably 40-50 sizes?) x number of shapes (probably 10-15 shapes per size?) = 1200 - 2250 categories. And I&#x27;m being generous here, I think we should probably keep this total number under 500, ideally under 100, but I don&#x27;t think such a low number is feasible.<p>Then charge a deposit for each plastic container and upon container return give this deposit back.<p>Same thing for glass, actually.<p>This would make plastic containers reusable, even across brands, and would probably reduce our plastic waste by orders of magnitude.<p>Heck, the same thing could probably be done for plastic bags.<p>However, this plan would also reduce plastic consumption (and production, so $$$) by orders of magnitude, so I don&#x27;t expect it to ever pass a solid lobbying plan.')
