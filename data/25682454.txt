I lived most recently in Atlanta, where they&#x27;re on the right track with new projects (and a Microsoft campus to the west), so I expect it to be a much nicer place to live 20-30 years from now.  But I&#x27;m 25!  I don&#x27;t have time to wait until retirement to enjoy my life!<p>Seattle is streets ahead of Atlanta, with some promising light rail expansions planned in the future.  Again, on a 10-20 year timeline.<p>I have grown to despise cars so much that I thought it was time to give Japan a try.  If I ever leave Japan, I&#x27;d sooner move to Germany or the UK than return to America.')
