I personally left a negative review and removed the game until the patch was removed.<p>Whether the anti-cheat should be there isn&#x27;t the issue. The issue is &quot;does this stop the game from running on Linux&quot;. The answer was yes it does.<p>For a lot of people the only reason they buy a PC is to play games. So you might be okay saying &quot;well I don&#x27;t care about those titles&quot; but for a lot of people those big titles with shitty DRM is literally the reason they bought the PC in the first place and saying the concern was absurd is just incorrect.')
