I hate when people use that excuse for them flagrantly shooting somebody or their pet. Police training is the first place we can improve. Changing their mentality from a warrior to a guardian also does wonders in lowering use of force. There are real world solutions to this problem but almost half the country think those who got shot by police probably deserved it. Almost the same crowd protests wearing masks as stepping on their liberties. Absolutely illogical.')
