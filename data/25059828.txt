This is definitely true of two working spouses as both incomes would start from zero.<p>For one spouse staying at home, they would now qualify for all forms of assistance and tax credits.  Balance that against the single earner&#x27;s reduced break points on marginal taxes and the status quo probably brings in more money to the government.<p>Of course it looks like big incentives when you don&#x27;t look at the penalties from being married.')
