A Russian influence operation to support the Trump campaign <i>actually happened.</i> This is a <i>fact</i> supported by <i>evidence</i> which bears up under examination.<p>There is <i>no</i> evidence of electoral fraud or whatever nonsense is currently being claimed. It <i>did not</i> happen. It is, in fact, a deliberate <i>lie.</i><p>Someone saying stuff on CNN is not <i>reliable information.</i> Are you really going to compare that to the Mueller report?<p>In fact, what is reliable right now is how courts have been deciding these ridiculous claims. And they’ve all been universally rejected because the claims have no evidence, make no sense, and are basically asking for something that’s actually illegal.<p>So we are talking about two completely different things. Something that really happened, based on evidence, and something that is a bunch of lies and distortions. That is my point.<p>And, I’d really encourage you to learn how to better judge things. Or, to stop participating in this <i>anti-democratic</i> bullshit.')
