What to do?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hello all,<p>We are a startup in edtec spear. Recently we got into partnership with one of the biggest companies in India for post exam reports. As a part of the contract they dont want us to use their name anywhere without their permission. As it&#x27;s our first client or partner we decided to sign it.<p>When we asked for a press release on the partnership they denied it. As a startup it&#x27;s important for us but we are bound with the contract.<p>Any suggestion or advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks')
