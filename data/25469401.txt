Getting augmentations were meaningful choices which alter ways you can approach explorations (such as picking up heavy items blocking vents). Stumbling upon critical information from hacked computers not only fills background info for you but makes your character more knowledgeable, and lets you use that information in dialogs to alter the direction of quests. Important story altering decisions aren&#x27;t presented as important decisions, they&#x27;re just side effects of regular gameplay. A hack centric or stealth centric or dialog centric character build are all viable.<p>In this sense, Deus Ex has &quot;content&quot;. And exploration and gameplay are immersively impactful. A more apt comparison might be with Tomb Raider.')
