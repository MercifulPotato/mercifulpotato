Because I don&#x27;t have a double-SIM phone, that means my other SIM is not active at the moment.<p>Really dangerous trend is when this SMS confirmation is requested when I don&#x27;t expect it. Once I was in the Philippines and AirBnb wanted me to verify my authentication attempt. It can be not only frustrating, but dangerous - I have accommodation scheduled and without the access to my home number I could be easily left on the streets in a foreign country.<p>And my last complaint -&gt; SMS can arrive pretty late when you are in a foreign country. Sometimes too late that the authentication window is closed.')
