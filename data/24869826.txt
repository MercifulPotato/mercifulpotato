Making food is one of the most basic things people do, yet we&#x27;ve put a $50k+ barrier of entry on what constitutes an acceptable kitchen, along with massive regulatory hoops that have to be jumped through.<p>I think there&#x27;s still a place for inspections, but unless you&#x27;re absolutely terrible it should be informational for consumers rather than a hurdle that must be passed before doing business.  Let people choose to eat at uninspected facilities if they want (with the knowledge of what they&#x27;re doing), and have liability laws in place for when things go wrong.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, we should make it easier to become a street vendor.  We encourage children to be entrepreneurial with lemonade stands and bake sales, yet it&#x27;s stupidly hard to actually do something like this as a real business.')
