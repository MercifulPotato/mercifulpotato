They publish codebase snapshots to a read-only website every once in a while. They have a GitHub mirror of the XNU codebase, but it&#x27;s a few years behind and its Issue Tracker is disabled. Apple should engage more with the community. However the community needs to engage conscientiously. This leak is bad news, since it&#x27;s the exact sort of behavior Apple probably wanted to avoid. It&#x27;s so disrespectful. Last thing we want is for other companies like GitHub to think, &quot;wow Apple was right, maximum engineering secrecy by default is the way to go.&quot;')
