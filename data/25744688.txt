AWS is a privately held subsidiary of a publicly traded company.<p>The 1st Amendment does not protect all free speech. It simply bans the US government from passing laws that limit free speech.<p>for AWS, it will come down to whether they’ve defined situations where they can end their agreement &#x2F; contract (MSA&#x2F;EULA) with Parler. Btw, that’s the argument Parler is making that they had an agreement with AWS and not they’re in breech. The feee speech comment is weaker than arguing a binding contract exists.<p>Of course, it sounds like they have the default MSA with AWS. So, likely has terms very much in AWS’s favor. Also, I’d say they probably have some type of clause related to activities that could hurt AWS’s brand equity as be grounds for early termination.<p>Bottom line: as the cases referenced show, the government cannot limit free speech with laws - 1st Amendment (read full text). Private&#x2F;public companies can do whatever is in their contracts that customers agree with at sign up.')
