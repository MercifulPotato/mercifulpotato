Sure, Google care now, but they are gonna drop this like a hot potato once the promotions come through.<p>From speaking to devs who engage with Google on Stadia, it appears to be a tire fire, in that the Google people don&#x27;t appear to care about how much work the gamedevs need to put in to keep up with their API changes (much like lots of Google services, actually).<p>Because of the poor devrel, I will be incredibly shocked if Stadia survives another two years.<p>Without a financial incentive, I&#x27;m not sure Stadia would have any games, and financial incentives don&#x27;t fix the extra work needed when google change things for no reason (or not for a reason that gamedevs are likely to accept).')
