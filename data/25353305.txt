Now imagine that a single citizen of that country decides to go live in the mountains, out of contact with the rest of the country, but still legally alive and legally a citizen, and therefore legally a &quot;required&quot; vote. The legislative process grinds to a halt!<p>This is, of course, why no government is run that way. And it&#x27;s equally silly to run a FOSS project that way. Even if literally everybody likes some change, just one contributor <i>failing to get in contact</i> means you&#x27;re stuck without the ability to make the change.')
