Probably a couple of years of pulling that mess. I often think back now to how I had a complete system that timed for efficacy, taking a few 30 min before practice then more while suiting up, then even more if I could during and then after practice. I&#x27;d alter this timing on game days since practices were walk-thrus, etc.<p>In some ways it&#x27;s a relief to hear from someone else with that experience (this was 20 years ago for me).')
