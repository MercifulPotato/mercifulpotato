The first and more common on traditional media is exposure-type ads which are just about getting the brand name embedded in your head so choose that product over another next time you&#x27;re shopping.<p>The second is the type in these sponsor ads. They have calls to action and are still interested to a small degree in brand awareness, but it&#x27;s not the main focus.<p>All that&#x27;s to say, the latter type of ads is about how many people follow the link and less so about whether the ad landed on all the eyeballs.<p>At least that&#x27;s my layperson&#x27;s view, devoid of having ever studied advertising.')
