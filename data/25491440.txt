Fuzzy Logic is mostly a marketing term, and although it may still exist other machine learning&#x2F;estimation tools exist that seem to completely subsume it. If I remember correctly some fundamental aspects of fuzzy-set theory are still unproven and possibly shown undecidable.<p>To be honest this is more a hearkening back to the 90s retro take on The Beloved Old Fuzzy Logic of yesteryear and ignoring it&#x27;s rot of irrelevance than any actual evaluation of the technology... &quot;The smartest appliance I have ever owned&quot;.
