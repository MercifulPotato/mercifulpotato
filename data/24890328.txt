Because we don&#x27;t share the same virtual space, of course our experiences feel disjointed.<p>* We can&#x27;t silently &quot;react&quot; to someone else speaking, making it difficult to intuit the consensus opinion. These reactions need to appear on _their_ tile, not on your own (looking at you, Zoom).<p>These are not hard to implement, but conferencing solutions are so sticky that they just don&#x27;t seem to have the incentive to improve their stagnant UI&#x27;s.')
