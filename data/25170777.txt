Calling something &quot;western&quot; with obvious derision and speaking to folks not knowing how our eyes and brains perceive the world, is seriously hindering my even desire to want to engage in your point.<p>It should be no shock that cinema makers, by and large, double down on what cinema buyers are into buying.  There is a clear feedback loop there and it has led to some results.<p>That you could get to different spots with different audiences is not really a surprise.  Nor is it a requirement that one audience is wrong.<p>My hypothesis on the shaky cam is that makes it harder to try and take in details that are not essential.  In large, you can&#x27;t take in any details and can only remember it after the fact.  You have to, in a very real sense, fill in the details on your own.  With a bias knowing how things actually ended.  Is why the shaky cam footage usually is brief and gets to a conclusion faster than drawn out fights.   This probably limits the enjoyment from going back on something, but realistically most folks don&#x27;t repeat view things anyway.<p>Making things more deliberate in fights wouldn&#x27;t make things better or worse.  In fact, I have grown tired of them in well choreographed fights, even.  Real fights are quicker.  With advantages compounding rapidly.  Did you get the first good hit in?  You are probably winning.  Are you the bigger opponent?  Probably winning.  Mysticism is fun to watch, no doubt.  But especially when movies try and claim their is no mysticism involved, it just gets tiring to me.<p>Now, are there still other ways?  Absolutely.  For myself, I have actually grown to dislike most movies and other visual mediums for the reason cited above and, in large, because books work better for me.  Do I think this means that folks are better adapted to books?  I mean, maybe.  Probably not, though.  Likely it is just my perspective on how this stuff best flows.<p>(And as a closing shot, I&#x27;m remembering that I love watching ballet.  A well choreographed and executed dance is amazing to watch.  Without me having to suspend any disbelief on whether someone could actually win a fight. :D)')
