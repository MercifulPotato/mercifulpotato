I have quit Twitter and FB for exactly this reason - I do not like their policies of censoring the posts. This is that simple. If you see a turd on the ground - you don&#x27;t have to step into it and then complain about the smell. Many censored entities do not have even Telegram account, where there is zero censorship where people could follow them. This means they do not care so much about reaching out to readers. They would rather complain but cling to Twitter.')
