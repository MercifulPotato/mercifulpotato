They want their content on Google because if they don&#x27;t then it won&#x27;t be seen. I&#x27;m not saying this was a deliberate strategy by Google but it is the reality.<p>I would argue most people don&#x27;t want to buy newspapers because we have created an expectation that content should be free.<p>As to the quality of the content, a) that&#x27;s subjective and b) it can be seen as natural evolution of an industry whose income source has been decimated by Google&#x2F;Facebook. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to produce what you (and I do as well, to be fair) consider garbage than to produce the quality content we would like to see coming from newspapers.')
