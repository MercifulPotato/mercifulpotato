It&#x27;s not entirely clear from the article who&#x27;s responsible for this, but I note that the so-called &quot;NHS&quot; test and trace is in fact an outsourced organisation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NHS_Test_and_Trace" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NHS_Test_and_Trace</a> run by Tory placewoman Dido Harding.<p>&gt; &quot;She is a former chief executive of the TalkTalk Group where she faced calls for her to resign after a cyber attack revealed the details of 4 million customers. A member of the Conservative Party, Harding is married to Conservative Party Member of Parliament John Penrose and is a friend of former Prime Minister David Cameron. Harding was appointed as a Member of the House of Lords by Cameron in 2014. She holds a board position at the Jockey Club, which is responsible for several major horse-racing events including the Cheltenham Festival. &quot;<p>&gt; &quot;In May 2020, Harding was appointed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock to head NHS Test and Trace, established to track and help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in England. In August 2020, after it was announced Public Health England was to be abolished, Harding was appointed interim chair of the new National Institute for Health Protection, an appointment that was criticised by health experts as she did not have a background in healthcare.&quot;')
