I have never seen a case where there was a business reason to distinguish a null vs blank string. Dates? Yes. Numbers? Yes. Strings? Nope, never.<p>Let’s start with the most common false example: middle names. What are you going to do differently in your app if some one has an unknown vs a blank middle name? … Nothing. The displays will be the same. The search will still have to account for ignoring middle names because missing middle name might show up as “NMI” in an external system. There are no implications to having a missing middle name vs no middle name. You might need a flag for “date that the user verified that this is their full name” but that has nothing to do with null strings.')
