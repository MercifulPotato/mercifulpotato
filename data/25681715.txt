Item(by='rgovostes', descendants=None, kids=[25683432], score=None, time=1610082545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655657, text='Interesting that the book received praise from Ed Scheidt, who designed the cryptographic methods used in Kryptos.<p>&gt; This is THE book about code breaking. Very concise, very inclusive, and easy to read. Good references for those who would make codes, too, like Kryptos.<p>That sounds like a strong hint that the book comes close to discussing the kind of code used in the remaining unsolved section, though if so I suspect Dunin would have realized it in the writing process. (Others have already attempted and failed to identify the cipher through the process of elimination.)<p>For a good casual book on the subject, consider Simon Singh&#x27;s &quot;The Code Book,&quot; or if you want something more comprehensive,  David Khan&#x27;s &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; is extensive (though it was first printed before public key cryptography was widely known and completely reset the field).')
