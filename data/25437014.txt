I&#x27;d say you absolutely cannot do any manufacturing in serious commercial volumes without at least 10 engineers hired just to do supply chain management full time.</i><p>As a small manufacturer with less than 10 engineers total (though in industrial automation, not B2C electronics), how do &quot;real&quot; electronics manufacturers do supy chain management?<p>We did a &quot;small&quot; run of a little machine that went from our usual quantity 1-3 units to quantity 100, and the strain it put on engineering was intense. Usually we just sent purchasing a BOM, this was something else. You have to be an engineer to comprehend the specs and requirements that engineering sends to you, you have to be in finance&#x2F;management to understand tradeoffs of quality, savings in volume, and time, and you have to do grunt-work just to keep track of it all and keep communication and relationships active. The result was that design engineers were spending a ton of time on supply chain management long after the design had ended; do bigger shops have engineers who spend all day on the phone asking &quot;where&#x27;s my stuff&quot; or surfing Alibaba?')
