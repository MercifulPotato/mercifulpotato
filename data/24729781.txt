Last I looked into FaceTime tech, they didn&#x27;t do anything special - their quality comes from use of H.265 and the fact that iOS devices have good quality HW encoding blocks which provide good compression at low bandwidths.<p>FaceTime stream is usually also low motion &#x2F; change so it&#x27;s possible to achieve very good compression even with basic quality. Although they still don&#x27;t quite match the quality of AV1 powered Google Duo on very poor connections.')
