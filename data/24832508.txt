There was kind of like a large group of home schoolers, all of them tested very high. My test scores for a private Catholic School at the end 6th grade, they wanted to put me into Sophomore in High School. Thank god my parents understood socially it would have been hard.<p>There were 80 kids in my home school group that were in my grade, maybe half skipped a year when they went to school. That&#x27;s a small sample size, but not that surprising as most home school parents highly value education.')
