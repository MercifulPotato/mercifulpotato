It&#x27;s not like solar + batteries where we have plenty of working solar + battery setups, and we just need to figure out how to make more of them more cheaply. It looks like there&#x27;s still some fundamental research needed before fusion can generate more power than it consumes.<p>Heck, 10-ish years ago, I met someone who told me his cabin in the woods was off-grid solar because an off-grid system was cheaper than running electricity to the cabin. We&#x27;re not even close to that state with Fusion.')
