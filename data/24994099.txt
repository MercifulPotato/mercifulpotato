I&#x27;m glad that they&#x27;re allowing psychedelics for certain types of treatment, but I hope that the choices open up further than psilocybin.<p>Back in my teenage years I took pretty much every psychedelic I could access, and trip-sat (like babysitting) for about two dozen of my friends over the course of a few years. I found in tripsitting that psilocybin was among the more difficult to manage psychedelics, especially for first-timers. I found that 2C-B&#x2F;E, DOC and LSD were the best-tolerated substances among people that weren&#x27;t &quot;psychonaut veterans.&quot;<p>This is purely anecdotal and in no way meant to imply that I know what the hell I&#x27;m talking about. I only bring it up as a thought that popped into my head relating to the use of psychedelic drugs in therapy.<p>Also, no. I do not know where to get any of this stuff anymore. Haven&#x27;t known for over a decade.')
