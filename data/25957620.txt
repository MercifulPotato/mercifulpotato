Why should they have to allow for equal access to investors?  Sure, the law currently requires it, but if we made a law saying First Amendment now applies to all private businesses people would be fine with it because it is now the law?  I think not.  So, given they are a private company, shouldn&#x27;t they be free to do business with who they want and how they want?<p>As for the penalty of breaking the law, if it is enforced it will likely still have been the cheaper option for those who made the call.')
