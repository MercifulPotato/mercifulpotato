That&#x27;s not productive and the context is one where some degree of empathy should be expected. It&#x27;s a commons. And trust me, I know how internet nerds can be on a commons - internet nerds that often get things very wrong in their criticisms but will swear and yell at you while leveling them.<p>That context is important. The goal that I hope we all want to push for a data commons is a productive shared environment. But when it becomes narrative or editorials, now there are very serious political and scholarly issues at work and popular narratives are frequently self-sustaining via institutional norms. You can cite hundreds of documents and publications for a popular liberal (like lib dem) narrative even if it&#x27;s no better supported than a position published by an esoteric scholar in Maine and <i>win</i> any arguments about which should be included in the definitive encyclopedia entry on the topic and which should be quietly shoved aside. Even disagreements listed in these pages tend to be relatively popular narratives that are not particularly disagreeable to those in power, or have become popular enough despite that opposition and are the exception.<p>Turkish nationalists denying the Armenian genocide on Wikipedia will be drowned out by process: the dominant media and scholarly narratives (which are roughly correct). But what would we see on a page about Evo Morales back in October 2019? Would we not see the repeated dishonest narratives and headlines of the New York Times? In fact, we would: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Evo_Morales&amp;oldid=923888426" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Evo_Morales&amp;oldid...</a>. No contextualization, just the implication that the NYT narratives are a good resource. And here is the closest snapshot in time to that wiki page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20191112031842&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;person&#x2F;evo-morales" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20191112031842&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytim...</a><p>In short, mistakes should always be contextualized by the roles of those involved, the goals sought (and hopefully shared), and a desire to get at the truth even if it&#x27;s uncomfortable.')
