If you are talking about tooling, that would expand the same text at different level to different readers, then -- I didn&#x27;t understand that, and that wasn&#x27;t my response; I&#x27;ll have to ponder that for a while before I respond.<p>I do think that algorithmic complexity is the right context to consider notation, if that wasn&#x27;t clear -- not in that we can (or should) distill knowledge to the smallest representation, but in the implications of what different &quot;interpretation machines&quot; (that is, persons reading ...) need in order to understand a notation.')
