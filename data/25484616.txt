So there are capitalists, and a capitalist rent-seekers; and there are workers, and worker rent-seekers.<p>&gt; if the there already is redistribution,<p>So if people are opposed to the rent-seeking, they might fell that the correct decision is to avoid increasing the amount of rent-seeking.<p>&gt; The flipside of that concept is to have privatized profits but collectivized negative externalities.<p>This exists and is terrible.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s not to mention entire industries consisting in intelligent and skilled workers spending their lives redistributing wealth from a wealthy person to another (traders, corporate lawyers, etc.)<p>So some of this is actual productive work that allocates capital or resolves disputes, and its not always easy to draw the line between parasitic activity and productive activity in these domains. Even if the line can be drawn in theory its not clear how to regulate it. And the regulatory effort is itself vulnerable to parasitism, rent-seeking, and capture by the object of regulation.')
