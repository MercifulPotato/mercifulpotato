But they only used that phrase as a kind illustration of the common sense that people should have about not having a backup of their data.<p>Yes, Google does need some government regulation. And yes, people <i>shouldn&#x27;t need a government regulator to tell them</i> not to keep all their data in the cloud without any local backup at all.')
