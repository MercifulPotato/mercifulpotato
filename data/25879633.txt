Representative government doesn’t need to fall on the same lines as local policy decisions on pollution rules, water rights, and emergency prep.\nIn the same way that some districts are richer than others, water is produced in some watersheds and consumed in others. Strongly aligning politics to those watersheds might not promote the cooperation you expect.')
