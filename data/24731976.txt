(question is more oriented to legal or tax liabilities and work permissions than meet all technical requirements from job offers)<p>EDIT: work directly to those companies (as a contractor or, if possible and viable, as an employee - with benefits), not through intermediaries or as a SW shop (B2B deal)')
