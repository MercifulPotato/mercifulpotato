If you look at most of the world religions they pretty much agree on what those are: Abrahamic religions call them out as Pride, Envy, Gluttony, Lust (note on this, it is all consuming desire it is not just sex but sex is a powerful vector for unhealthy lust. As an example one can lust after social acceptance), Anger, Greed and Sloth. Buddhism calls the three fires out as ignorance (Greed, Sloth), attachment (Envy, Lust, Gluttony), and aversion (Pride, Anger).<p>I don&#x27;t see it as a poor choice to live to those defined moral codes. The negative association with being religious is due to many people letting other people think for them now days. If one take the actions and words of a person over studying for oneself what the text say then that is exactly what one is doing. If one ascribes negative connotations to the underpinnings, without knowledge of whether those that claim knowledge yet may be ignorant of what the text says, then one acts in the same ignorance. Most of the religious texts, espouse universal love, non-judgment (by other people) and harmony. Most of the people that claim they understand them, have never event read the texts from end to end, much less any of the competing religions text to compare and contrasting one against the other.<p>For example let&#x27;s take Abrahamic religions because they are fun to pick on, most Muslims, Jews and Christians (especially Christians) could not even tell you what Psalm 137:9 is, much less explain why someone would be happy to dash child against the rocks. Well deeper understanding would be that this is what the Israelites wanted, revenge for their dead children that were bludgeoned to death. But what happened was not revenge, but rather judgment and that is the lesson being conveyed, our hearts will seek revenge but what puts things in balance is not revenge but judgment. Point being, I have been hard pressed to find a single laymen from any of the 3 Abrahamic branches, that know the verse much less that could explain it (honestly Muslims where the most knowledgeable on the subject). Further most Christians don&#x27;t even realize that Jesus was a devout pacifist, cavorted with mainly &quot;sinners&quot; and routinely spoke out about the pious.<p>As a side note Jeremiah 32:35 is another fun one. Why did it not enter his mind? Is he not all knowing and omnipotent?<p>While it may be a fairy tail, by all accounts Jesus and Buddha were pretty awesome dudes, I want to be like them, even if it&#x27;s just for the time I am here.')
