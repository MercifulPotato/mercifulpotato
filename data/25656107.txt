Up against a single payer one of their primary value add for most people isn&#x27;t even better health care per se but better customer service, faster appointments, clear and helpful advice, etc. This is a good deal for the NHS as well because they still get your tax contributions but the private system takes some of the load off them.<p>In theory I&#x27;m mostly a Friedmanite.
