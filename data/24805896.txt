Item(by='knodi123', descendants=None, kids=[24809330, 24806767], score=None, time=1602889885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24802472, text='What I said was &quot;there was an effort to do so from someone outside of her campaign - but the questions that were provided were not the ones asked, so.... It&#x27;s false to say she received some debate questions in advance.&quot;<p>Was there dishonesty from the DNC?  Yes! But it&#x27;s important to say what happened.  Someone did a bad job of trying to supply her with a couple of questions.  Instead the only thing they managed to provide her was a hint about two of the subjects that would be discussed.  So to the point I responded to - Did she &quot;receive some debate questions ahead of time&quot; - nope!  She didn&#x27;t!  Just some things that were close.<p>Did that give her an unfair advantage?   Maybe!  But I doubt it - if Bernie&#x27;s campaign didn&#x27;t expect a question about the Flint water issue, then they&#x27;re idiots.  And I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re idiots.   The help offered to Hillary was inaccurate and of dubious worth.')
