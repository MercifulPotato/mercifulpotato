The Quest 2 base model costs $300 and is entirely standalone, no PC required.<p>I have a Valve Index ($1,000 + gaming PC + installing 2 lighthouses on my walls), and while my experience is definitely better (other than the cord), the Quest provides a comparable experience for beat saber, rec room, pistol whip, which comprise 90% of what I use my Index for anyway.')
