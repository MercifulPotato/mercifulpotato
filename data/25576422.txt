I&#x27;m not sure China cares, and accordingly the practice will continue.<p>You&#x27;re correct, but there&#x27;s another angle to this than ending the practice: moral complicity.<p>An individual in the antebellum south couldn&#x27;t reasonably end the institution of slavery in the US, but he could have taken actions that affected the degree he was personally complicit.  If he owned and profited from slavery, he was clearly complicit.  If he did but had a change of heart and manumitted them, he&#x27;s far less so.  If he became an abolitionist and did his best to avoid supporting slaveholders or the products of slavery, he&#x27;s hardly complicit at all.<p>If Apple chooses to deal with companies that use forced labor (or chooses to look the other way), it&#x27;s complicit, and that means it&#x27;s customers are too (to a lesser degree).')
