There are a bunch of them, even high end cards, that come with good coolers. Look for example at reviews of the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 5700 XT.<p>If you do not need a strong graphics card you can always just get a weak one, with less energy usage. GT 1030 for example, though that&#x27;s really weak, but it&#x27;s also just a 30W card.<p>Or depending on the processor you need you can use the integrated graphics. The AMD Apus are pretty great, Ryzen 3 3200G and Ryzen 5 3400G  - and there are new 4000 versions that can be be bought in kits or OEM machines. Intel has their own weaker integrated graphics on most of their processors, even their stronger units, for just office work strong enough.')
