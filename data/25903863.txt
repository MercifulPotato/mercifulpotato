It&#x27;s basically a super-downvote and allows people to censor opinions that they don&#x27;t like. Comparing with downvotes:<p>- Flags work on comments <i>and</i> posts, but you can only downvote comments.<p>- Flags work on replies to your comments; downvotes don&#x27;t.<p>- A few flags will remove a comment entirely, downvotes can only make it grey.<p>- A few flags will remove a post entirely, and even with showdead enabled you have to see it in &#x2F;new or at the last page of &#x2F;hot, then choose to vouch for it to rescue it. This almost never happens. A flagged post is basically a death sentence for that post.<p>- You get flags at 31 karma, but can&#x27;t downvote until 501.<p>So the answer is that flags are utterly broken and vulnerable to abuse, and &#x2F;new is where it shows most strongly. Tons of posts are killed there. Controversial topics almost cannot be discussed on HN because it only takes a few people to vanish the post for good.')
