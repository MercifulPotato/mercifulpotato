Notion provides exactly this feature when you share a doc but OP seems to have missed it and instead uses &quot;lock a document&quot; to do what he wants, which created all the problems in the first two sections. This feature is easy to find and is similar to what Google docs offers and so fairly learnable.<p>&gt; First thing you learn when getting used to Notion is that every page you share should be locked from editing!<p>&gt; The next problem with edit lock is that you can&#x27;t unlock the page just for you. So you are a good user of Notion and keep all pages locked from editing. But every time you want to modify a page, you unlock it and everyone can (unintentionally) modify it while you&#x27;re editing.<p>&gt; Adding or editing content isn&#x27;t the only case when you need your page to be unlocked. It is impossible to add comments on locked page.<p>^^^\nThese quotes are all wrong. You don&#x27;t lock your document. When you share a doc, configure the access rights (edit&#x2F;comment&#x2F;view only, similar to what you do when sharing a Google doc).')
