But certainly, here in the UK, house prices have more than doubled in the last 30 years <i>after adjusting their prices for inflation</i>, so inflation is nowhere near the whole picture.)<p>It is included but at a very different proportion from its actual impact on consumers. For example, the UK standard inflation index, CPI, includes the following items in its measure (as of 2017 [1]):<p>04.1 Actual rentals for housing: 5.6%<p>04.2 Owner occupiers&#x27; housing costs: 17.4%<p>(Also, I&#x27;m not sure whether &quot;Owner occupiers&#x27; housing costs&quot; only includes mortgage repayments, but that&#x27;s the closest thing I could see on the list. And the way it&#x27;s phrased in that list, with the word &quot;actual rentals&quot;, makes it sound like price increases won&#x27;t necessarily be reflected in the index so long as everyone were to downsize correspondingly - but I&#x27;m not clear about that one.)<p>It&#x27;s like that because inflation is meant to reflect a very different concept than we&#x27;re talking about here. We&#x27;re talking about something becoming intrinsically more valuable (in this case, because of scarcity). Inflation is meant to judge when a currency has less intrisic value. So if a house price goes up by 100% but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s twice as valuable, then in some sense the inflation there is 0%.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ons.gov.uk&#x2F;economy&#x2F;inflationandpriceindices&#x2F;articles&#x2F;consumerpriceindicesabriefguide&#x2F;2017#whats-in-the-basket" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ons.gov.uk&#x2F;economy&#x2F;inflationandpriceindices&#x2F;arti...</a>')
