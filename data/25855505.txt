What&#x27;s shown on the video is just a modal window not getting focused after its parent has been manually selected. This is going to go away once the activity overview starts to group child windows together with their parents (it didn&#x27;t so far because it required wlr-foreign-toplevel-management protocol to be extended upstream to provide information about parent-child relationship).<p>&gt; Full GTK desktop apps like Audacity look cramped on the tiny screen<p>FWIW such apps can be scaled down - which makes them pretty usable in many cases.<p>BTW. The video shows the state of the software from initial shipment in November. Plenty of things have changed already since (YouTube works out of box, jumpy scrolling is fixed etc.)')
