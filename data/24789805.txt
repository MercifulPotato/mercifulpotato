Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[24799690], score=None, time=1602776718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24785354, text='By evidence I mean something in some data somewhere that&#x27;s more than just the opinion being posted, which we can look at and evaluate objectively. I know that&#x27;s a bit of a lame answer, but I can&#x27;t give you specific examples without giving the same examples to others who would want to circumvent leaving evidence in that way.<p>The main thing to understand is that we need <i>something</i> to look at other than just an opinion that one commenter was expressing which another commenter didn&#x27;t like. That&#x27;s evidence only of difference-of-opinion, not abuse.<p>Such data isn&#x27;t always secret and isn&#x27;t always just on HN. For example, if someone is asking for HN upvotes on Twitter, we sometimes get links from eagle-eyed HNers. Similarly when someone is sending out spam emails trying to organize a voting ring. And sometimes spammers copy comments from other forums and paste them into HN. Those are pretty basic examples but I hope you can see that in each case there is some objective data that supports a judgment of abuse.<p>Conversely, suppose you like $BigCo and someone else hates $BigCo, sees your comment praising them, and replies &quot;how much are they paying you, shill?&quot; That&#x27;s the kind of thing we don&#x27;t allow, because there&#x27;s literally nothing supporting that judgment. The same type of commenter will see various comment arguing for $BigCo in HN threads and then post to other threads with high confidence that &quot;HN is overrun with astroturfing&quot;. What they mean is that it&#x27;s overrun with comments they don&#x27;t likeâ€”and even then, &quot;overrun&quot; is an exaggeration.')
