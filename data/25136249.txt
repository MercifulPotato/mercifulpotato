Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605704493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134370, text='&gt; I sure knows that when I&#x27;m doing the hiring, I rarely if ever read what colleges or what previous companies the candidate worked on. All that matters is what their experience is, what they learned so far, what they tell me they wanna do in the future and how they are as a person.<p>You are not the only hiring manager. I have seen decision makers openly read college name or even high school name and use that information to judge candidate. I am talking about people who did it very openly, I am pretty sure that there are also people who don&#x27;t broadcast it and are still affected by that.<p>Most of it was &quot;bonus&quot; for someone with known school, but I have seen also negative judgement.')
