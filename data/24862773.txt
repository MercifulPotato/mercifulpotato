They also shut down schools and bars and restaurants. It was not only churches.<p>2. It is possible to hear the word of God without physically going into a church. It is not possible to move from one place to another without being in a vehicle to move from one place to another. There is no way to virtually get in an aircraft.<p>3. Church is a habitual destination; most people do not ride an aircraft every week. This means that the total volume of people affected in this risky way is a lot lower because the total number of people flying is lower and the number of times that those people interact with others is lower. The mere cost alone is enough to deter people from getting in an aircraft each week to fly around.<p>4. There are fewer aircraft and airports in this country than there are churches. This makes it easier to verify mask compliance. Churches have been shown to defy common-sense mask restrictions very often.<p>5. There have been many cases of churches being the epicenters of serious outbreaks that kill many congregants because people said that God would worry about it. There were videos in March of Christians saying that they didn&#x27;t need to wear masks because they were &quot;bathed in the blood of the lamb&quot;, and no one was able or willing to do anything about that, whereas maskless passengers get kicked off aircraft. To my knowledge, there haven&#x27;t been very many or any high-profile cases of many people dying because they all got on the same flight, yet the same cannot be said for churches in the United States.')
