Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610258243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704610, text='&gt; but modern pop music is very constrained in its use of modulation so society has lost much of the grammar of Baroque, Classical and Romantic music.<p>Just to give a sense of context, try this exercise:<p>1. Pick any modern pop song.<p>2. Write down <i>every</i> seemingly superficial aspect of the song you hear: vocoder overuse, why an cheesy electric guitar sound accompanies a certain lyric, whether a given sound is employed for irony&#x27;s sake, which sounds or lyrics are allusions to other songs, etc.<p>3. Continue until you literally cannot think of anything else significant in the music.<p>If you&#x27;re exhaustive you should come up with dozens of bullet points for even a short song.<p>Now realize that wrt Schubert, you&#x27;ve mentioned a <i>single</i> such bullet.<p>That is to say-- we&#x27;re all missing most of the grammar of those bygone eras.')
