The flags register adds an extra implicit input&#x2F;output everywhere, and renaming is expensive enough without that.<p>However given they are already paying the cost of a variable length instruction set (for compression) I think a wide set of reg&#x2F;reg, reg&#x2F;imm8, reg&#x2F;imm16, reg&#x2F;imm32 compare+jumps would have been even better. Right now compare+jump against an imm32 is 3 instructions (4 if it’s long) vs 2 for x86, that number could have been 1 (given variable length).<p>Personally I think only two good choices exist for instruction sets, fully fixed size at 32b or variable with 2b control (max 2 inputs and 1 output reg!) followed by 0b, 2b, 4b, etc data (and thus very powerful instructions like the aforementioned). Anything else seems to be off the pareto curve. Goodbye cmov.')
