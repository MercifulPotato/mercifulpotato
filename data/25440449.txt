Some cities and counties have banned them [2]. American Airlines, and probably others, do not permit them on airplanes.<p>However, my point isn&#x27;t that governments are successfully implementing effective mask mandates. They&#x27;re not. My point is that I don&#x27;t think people have a right to endanger others in public spaces. I think not wearing a mask is morally wrong. You should show more consideration for your fellow residents and get some proper, tight-fitting masks without valves, even if they&#x27;re not as comfortable.<p>And while the &quot;State&quot; is slacking on enforcement, the grocery stores here have been good at tossing out people who aren&#x27;t masked up. The social pressure has led to a lot of mask use. The 300-person wedding here that led to dozens of infections and several deaths has been named and shamed by the media, which should hopefully deter others. Society is much larger and more powerful than your &quot;State,&quot; don&#x27;t forget that.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;prevent-getting-sick&#x2F;about-face-coverings.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;prevent-getting-si...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;suzannerowankelleher&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;why-some-cities-and-counties-are-banning-face-masks-with-valves&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;suzannerowankelleher&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26...</a>')
