If you travel back in time and kill your grandfather, you simply create a timeline in which you were not born, but can continue to exist, because you are from a timeline where you were born.<p>I&#x27;m by no means suggesting that either model is unique to America&#x2F;Japan (Rick and Morty for example uses the branching timeline model), I just find it interesting how they differ.')
