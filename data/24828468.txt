Truly a wonderful resource in the community.<p>I am however surprised by the omission of what I consider to be an obvious example of multi-tile creatures which would be vehicles in Cataclysm: DDA<p>I suppose a vehicle is not a creature, but I think that for all intents and purposes, that the implementation details will be very similar. I think it&#x27;s also possible to get AI controlled vehicles which are functionally very very similar to a creature.<p>Of course, he may have left out Cataclysm DDA because its implementation is funky. You&#x27;ll notice this if you take a pickup truck and turn in diagonal, suddenly opening up half of your vehicle to zombies despite it being closed when the vehicle oriented in any of the four standard directions (up, down, left, right)')
