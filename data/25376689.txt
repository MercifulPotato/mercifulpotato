Here are their populations in units of 1000 people: 5.9, 2.8, 7.1, 1.9, 23, 2.1, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 28, 9.3, 6.4, 2.9, 2.9, 2.2, 2.2, 4.4, 3.8, 8.4. The first 5 of those have daily cases over 150 (and the top 3 are 560, 244, 217).<p>57 counties have daily cases over 50.<p>One county (population 0.9k) has 0. Here are the rest under 50: 20.8, 24.0, 25.6, 31.3, 31.9, 43.0, 44.8, 49.7. Populations in k are 1.4, 2.4, 1.3, 3.2, 6.7, 4.2, 5.6, 2.3.<p>Their biggest counties are in the middle. The 10 counties with population of 20k or more have daily cases of 99.4, 87.4, 84.8, 85.7, 64.8, 71.6, 123.9, 90.1, 189.1, and 68.6. (Populations in k: 190, 110, 61, 39, 35, 28, 28, 26, 23, 20).<p>Compare to Washington (picked because I live there, so use it as a reference). We&#x27;ve got 9 counties under 20 new cases per 100k, 17 from 20 to 50, and 13 from 50 to 94.1.<p>Our biggest counties (pop. in k: 2300, 900, 820) have daily cases of 22.5, 34.9, and 31.1. I&#x27;m in a county with 270k people, and we are hitting new highs now of 19.6 daily cases per 100k, which would make us the second best county in the state if we were in South Dakota.<p>Rural areas are supposed to be where you go to escape a pandemic. How do you turn rural areas into places that are hardest hit?')
