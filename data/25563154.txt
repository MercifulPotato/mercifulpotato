Ghosting is a behavior of individuals that is very rude of those individuals and very easy to solve by those individuals (all it takes is &lt;30 seconds to send an email).<p>I know plenty of recruiters. The fact that they work within a system isn&#x27;t relevant. Ghosting is not a complex issue that requires a post-mortem. It&#x27;s not sending a single, short email. Quotas, constraints, and everything else that you&#x27;ve mentioned are totally irrelevant.')
