In fact the revenue from direct heat use will generally be more than electricity sales. The 5MW plant in Alberta I referenced was built around a proposed industrial park, with the idea being to create a district heat system that upgraded the heat in some facilities and donated it at other facilities.<p>The best use of heat is <i>as heat</i>, without converting it. The problem is that heat doesn&#x27;t travel very well, 5-8 km is really the practical limit before insulation costs swamp revenues. And a lot of industrial heat is too far away from a viable user of that heat. If the facility can use the heat internally their process engineers have already incorporated that (through pinch analysis etc).<p>We have one project now where we&#x27;re replacing a heat exchanger that is supplying process heat from the exhaust with a power plant, but then using the waste heat from the power plant (still 80% of it left!) to replace the process heat. Overall efficiency will be around 60%.')
