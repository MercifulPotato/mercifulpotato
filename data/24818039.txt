For a while now data can be on disk, but all indexes afaik still have to be fully loaded into memory in startup.<p>The use cases are systems where you need &quot;five nines&quot; of uptime and fat responses. Coming out of Ericsson the classic area where it is used is in Telco (for instance &quot;home location registers&quot;, the database recoding in which cell a mobile phone currently is, often use ndb) but there are different usages in Web (i.e. Session Store), &quot;real time&quot; information exchange (betting, gaming, ...) and so on.<p>It is not as easy to administer as a &quot;normal&quot; MySQL, but when deployed carefully it is powerful, fast and scalable (both locally as well as geo l-level)')
