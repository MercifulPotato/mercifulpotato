Groups exist along a spectrum of cohesiveness, and a political party and&#x2F;or political cult centered around one individual, is several orders of magnitude more cohesive than grassroots social movements with loosely affiliated themes, during whose protests some unaffiliated rioters and looters caused the majority of the damage. In effect, you&#x27;re comparing incidental property damage to a calculated, targeted, and rallied-for&#x2F;single-leader-inspired insurrection; it&#x27;s like comparing storm damage to arsonists.<p>And how do I know it wasn&#x27;t just random unaffiliated violent individuals causing most of the damage during the insurrection? Because they freaking wore matching hats and chanted Trump slogans...')
