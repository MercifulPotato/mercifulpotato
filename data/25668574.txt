If it can&#x27;t easily connect to, use and get used by the rest of the business, it&#x27;s a folly.<p>A master of software engineering delivers what the business needs in the minimum time possible.<p>Some businesses care about maintenance.  Some don&#x27;t.<p>Some care about UI&#x2F;UX, others with a trapped audience don&#x27;t.<p>Some care about efficiency and optimisation, others don&#x27;t.<p>You can&#x27;t be a &quot;master&quot; until you have a sense of what your business  is interested in.  Not what it <i>CLAIMS</i> to be interested in, but really cares about.<p>It&#x27;s been different in every company I&#x27;ve ever worked for.<p>Good luck.')
