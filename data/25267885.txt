If they can get people to switch to it, that would seem to increase the friction of switching to some other provider (i.e. a business win for Amazon).<p>If you&#x27;re invested in Terraform already, and have dealt with the headaches of managing that .tfstate file properly, this likely isn&#x27;t worth looking at... yet. If you&#x27;re a newbie and haven&#x27;t really practiced Continuous Delivery before, this is a welcome addition to a gap in Amazon-provided tooling.<p>But for those of us who&#x27;ve been around the block with AWS... Yeah, we&#x27;ll keep using Terraform and check back in a couple of years.')
