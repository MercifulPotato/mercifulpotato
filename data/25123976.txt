They do not mention SMTP&#x2F;IMAP&#x2F;POP access on their 2FA docs. 2FA is not supported by any email client for generic IMAP&#x2F;POP&#x2F;SMTP[1]. Just think of that experience, providing a token on every sync or sending. This is why we sometimes take such a harsh stand in our copy. You <i>need</i> to tell users about these things and not throw marketing BS counting on information asymmetry.<p>We (Migadu) do support TOTP + Yubikey on the admin account. We also support TOTP on the webmail just like Posteo does. However, we call that B.S. ourselves and are working on a real solution for mailboxes.<p>If you do setup 2FA on Posteo, how is your e.g. IMAP access protected? They most likely offer an app-specific password which is <i>very</i> different than 2FA. We do those too, they are called _identities_ in our context.<p>We have a long and bumpy road behind and ahead of us, but one thing we made clear on day one is that we will not B.S. users. Email is not perfect, it has serious conceptual issues due its age, but one should not go about it as &quot;there we fixed it!&quot; (Hey hey.com!)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;173807&#x2F;does-imap-pop3-asp-undermine-two-factor-auth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;security.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;173807&#x2F;does-ima...</a>')
