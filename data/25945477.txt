Item(by='Proven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611855709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25943393, text='&gt; One way is to become more restrictive in licensing, choosing only copyleft licenses that were originally created to offer more protections to individuals than corporations.<p>I would disagree with how you made that characterization. Licenses apply equally to everyone, and corporations are made of individuals.<p>If you meant end users vs. service providers, that&#x27;s what Elastic did and to end users their new license looks more permissive than GPL 3.0. Yes it does have &quot;a major restriction&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t force individual users and even those who redistribute Elastic software to release their modifications, whereas GPL 3.0 would have that effect.<p>To me - a user - the new Elasticsearch license is more permissive (because before some Elasticsearch add-ons were restricted) and I can live with that. \nAmazon - thanks to a more permissive license that Elasticsearch used to release under - can still do their thing. Good luck to them. If that license wasn&#x27;t permissive they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this.\nAnd the Fedora community and other busybodies ... I don&#x27;t care what they say :-)')
