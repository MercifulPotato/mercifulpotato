Please provide concrete examples of how a native app is less capable of invading your privacy than a web app that has been added to your home screen.<p>(Please keep in mind that home screen PWAs don&#x27;t even have the same level of access to your Safari sessions that random websites have, which is why you have to log into PWAs a second time, even if you are already logged in using Safari.)')
