Lost the interest because of what you mention, but also because building algorithms with it imply a big cognitive load for me.\nSince then, I&#x27;m very happy with TCL, one of the inspirations for Rebol.  Its syntax is regular, it&#x27;s a professional tool, conservative, i.e. doesn&#x27;t break code at each new release, has great GUI with Tk, and many other advantages.')
