But, I think pharmaceutical propaganda has made people believe that there is really a way to <i>kill</i> the pain. Something I&#x27;ve learned from opiate addicts is that it doesn&#x27;t make the pain go away - it just makes you feel good enough to forget the pain.<p>It was my opinion before doing it that I would be feeling some amount of pain no matter what I did. So I just followed the other aftercare instructions first - ice it, take ibuprofen, (lightly) swish with warm salt water. The pain was reduced enough that I didn&#x27;t feel the need to take the opiates.')
