It&#x27;s great for that.<p>Then I persuaded our team at work to switch from skype&#x2F;hangouts&#x2F;slack to discord. It just work much better, has less connection problems, uses no transfer when you&#x27;re not talking, filters noise better, allows to change volume level per user, has infinite history on text chat.<p>There&#x27;s no competition.')
