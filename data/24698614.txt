It&#x27;s harder to debug things or pair program when needed, it&#x27;s harder to grab someone&#x27;s attention, it&#x27;s easier to miscommunicate, and communication is a lot slower. You also don&#x27;t get the same camaraderie as you would face to face, but the upside is that you also don&#x27;t get distracted by attractive coworkers.<p>YMMV. Your home <i>can</i> be your ideal office, and is for many of us working remote (myself included). There are technology companies with hundreds of employees with billion dollar+ valuations who are fully remote. There is no proof they would be more efficient if you colocated all of those folks in person.')
