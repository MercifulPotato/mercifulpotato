If they didn&#x27;t need to buy oil in dollars, they would reorient their factories to sell their manufactured goods domestically, giving everyone a high standard of living. Instead, they are making more and more goods for our fat American consumption just to earn more and more dollars.<p>Sure, removing dollar as a reserve currency will make all of us poorer by global standards but we won&#x27;t need to import manufactured goods from China any longer.')
