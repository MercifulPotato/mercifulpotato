There are two problems with Python.<p>First, the excellent readability leads directly into hard-to-read code structures. This might seem paradoxical but Dijkstra insisted that the same thing happened in FORTRAN, and I&#x27;m willing to defer to his instinct that there&#x27;s something about the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; approach that physicists have which causes a predilection for both FORTRAN and Python.<p>Second, Python 2 to Python 3 was horrible, and created political problems which hadn&#x27;t existed before. Now, at the end of the transition, we can see how badly it was managed; Python 2 could have been retrofitted with nearly every breaking change and it would have been lower-friction. Instead, there&#x27;s now millions of lines of rotting Python 2 code which will never be updated again. Curiously, this happened in the FORTRAN world too; I wasn&#x27;t around for it, but FORTRAN 77 was so popular compared to future revisions and standardizations that it fractured the FORTRAN community.')
