Not just her friends at school, but the national and global crowd she can access through the phone.<p>You can stop it, but you won’t. The messages we give to girls now are awful. They are taught by the crowd to freely wield their sexual and social power instead of being taught to use it thoughtfully. This power is intoxicating and can only be tamed by strong values. They will be indoctrinated against your “outdated” parental authority.  Their “heroes” will be criminals and bad women like Cardi B. If you really want to stop that, pull her out of the school she’s going to, find a ‘conservative’ school to send her to, and spend time teaching your values at home.  You probably won’t do any of this. It’s not the phone, it’s the values and who is teaching them. And right now, that’s not you.')
