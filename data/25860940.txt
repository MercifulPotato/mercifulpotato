Especially with package managers like homebrew, which comes with a loud warning that non-default (root) paths may not be supported by dependencies.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t really, since this is a system level issue. Applications need to package their dependencies, not the other way around. Dependencies form graphs, not flat lists. The existence of a global cache of libraries shared by all programs is a total inversion of requirements.')
