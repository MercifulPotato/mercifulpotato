Why is the out-of-service shading for the DNR under 4th Avenue this weekend so halfhearted? It&#x27;s particularly hard to tell when the lines are skinny. I guess they were thinking of how good it was for Manhattan?<p>So tell me: when I click on tonight&#x27;s map, what am I supposed to make of a one-way train service on the W, between Whitehall (where it usually stops) and 86th (which is not part of its usual route)? Is that actually a real thing? I am especially confused given that the more-information click takes me to a &quot;look up service changes by line&quot; page that doesn&#x27;t show anything when I ask for service changes on the W.<p>And if the D train tonight is running northbound on 6th Avenue and southbound on 8th Avenue, why is the only unusual color displayed on 8th Avenue, given that people who catch the D expect it on its usual route under 6th Avenue?<p>I guess there&#x27;s no hope for the F-diamond train but that probably doesn&#x27;t matter much; I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even running post-pandemic...<p>This gets worse the more you look at it. A project manager wanted shininess, and they have it, but geez, can&#x27;t anyone actually try to use the thing before showering it with praise?')
