The decision to include so many characters from Asia and so few from Africa is a bit more frustrating; Iâ€™d expect to see a lot more North Africans in 9th century England than either Middle Eastern or East&#x2F;Central Asian characters (because it is closer, as a matter of trade-routes).&quot;<p>The article&#x27;s quibble is mostly with it concentrating them into your settlement, rather than around pre-existing trade hubs.<p>It&#x27;s still a stretch to have a randomly diverse community... but the &quot;historically accurate black African representation&quot; is probably enough that you don&#x27;t have to work at explaining a minority of diverse characters.')
