Look at those dummies trading stocks&quot;.<p>I stopped reading when I realized this was a hit piece against Robinhood when they brought up the leverage bug. It wasn&#x27;t Robinhood&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s not like they told the user to do it.<p>If anyone is to blame for the amount of dumb stock plays, it is Wall Street Bets (&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets).<p>---<p>Also the reason young people flooded the market when the pandemic hit wasn&#x27;t that we suddenly had time (not entirely at least), it was the many saw the market as overheated and not worth the price.<p>When stocks took a 30%+ dip in March, it was basically free money to buy them combined with the fact we could get in to huge share prices with fractional shares.<p>Once again, I have to say: Millienials and Gen Z are much smarter than they are given credit for. Gen X+ should be asking themselves why they are making choices that Millenials and younger refuse to.')
