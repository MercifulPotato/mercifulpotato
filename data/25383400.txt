How is it freedom, when a corporation gets to dictate how you use their product after its bought and paid for?? That&#x27;s not freedom, not in any sense of the word. Corporations should be free to manufacture any car in any way they like. But they shouldn&#x27;t be able to tell us what to do with our property, don&#x27;t you see or appreciate having a freedom to do whatever and however you please with items that you have bought?<p>It&#x27;s like arguing that you should be able to enter an employment contract that stipulates physical punishment for making mistakes at work - surely, being able to enter such contract is freedom! If you don&#x27;t like it, go somewhere else, market forces will sort it out! And yet, we as society have decided that no, physical punishment is not acceptable and you cannot waive your right to be free of it. That&#x27;s freedom. Not what you are saying.')
