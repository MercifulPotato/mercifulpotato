Item(by='908B64B197', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605745893, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25143220, text='&gt; Not all engineers are CS grads. Not all engineers _need_ to be CS grads. Git is a great tool, but it can also be pretty complicated if you have to go off the beaten path.<p>I expect someone that calls himself an engineer to be able to get git, nevertheless.<p>&gt; And IMO, it&#x27;s not a question of saturation. It&#x27;s a question of credibility. You, for instance, are (presumably) skeptical of whether or not Lambda grads would be able to pull their weight on a team. Spending 4 weeks working directly with a Lambda grad seems like a pretty good way to either prove or disprove your hypothesis.<p>&gt; Skepticism is healthy, however I object to the idea that one needs to be an expert to teach. Even if you&#x27;re just a _little_ better at something than someone else, there&#x27;s no reason that you can&#x27;t teach someone what you know.<p>&gt; AFAIK, very few schools have an applied software engineering program that adequately prepares grads for doing real work on a real team. That&#x27;s something that really can only come from experience.<p>My issue with bootcamps is that they teach &quot;tricks&quot; and not fundamentals. Someone with the fundamentals can easily adapt to another tech stack&#x2F;codebase. But someone who simply learned whatever framework through rote won&#x27;t. When you look at the &quot;final projects&quot; these bootcamps often get their grads to code, you&#x27;ll pretty much get N identical github repo of that batch. But sure, if a dev shop measures performance by the number of Jira tickets a new hire can fix then yeah, getting someone from Lambda who learned that exact framework through rote might give you a good signal after 4 weeks while your college hire is still figuring out how the toolchain and lib work. But my bet is that the college hire will outperform the bootcamp grad in the long run.<p>I think the only way to prepare new grads to real work is to blend-in semester-long assignments and projects into the coursework. That and select students that can learn fast.')
