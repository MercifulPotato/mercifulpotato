We traded and collected and I&#x27;m pretty sure I have the whole 50 cards or so still in a little baggie somewhere in storage.<p>I also remember Cincin... so perhaps that was where I got them too. Cheers! (from a transplant from Albania)<p>EDIT: Looking at those series of pics you linked to, I can say I do remember them. My friends collected them. It was the biggest thing happening in our lives.')
