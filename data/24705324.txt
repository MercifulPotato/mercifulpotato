In fact, we do, when it suits us. Talk about Facebook &quot;allowing hate to spread&quot;, and all those &quot;private company they can do what they want&quot; arguments disappear (or get made by an entirely different set of people), as some people miraculously become able to understand the difference in kind between a single individual and one of the largest companies on Earth.')
