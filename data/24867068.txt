Nothing crazy or generous -- only $50&#x2F;â‚¬50, but every little bit counts.<p>How do you know I actually donated? Well Krita emailed me a donation # but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s persionally identifying or not, but if you really care email me and I&#x27;ll share that with you, or screenshots of my paypal statement bill or something.<p>Oh also totally overlooked (can&#x27;t edit now) Inkscape, which I personally know I&#x27;ve used in the last year, same amount:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inkscape.org&#x2F;support-us&#x2F;donate&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inkscape.org&#x2F;support-us&#x2F;donate&#x2F;</a><p>For those who don&#x27;t have money to spare, donating time or speaking well of these programs and increasing their adoption are just fine as contributions (at least I think so, maybe others might disagree).<p>[EDIT] - If you don&#x27;t have money but you have time and expertise to contribute a translation&#x2F;pull request&#x2F;etc that&#x27;s actually worth even more than the money you could give and it would pay off <i>repeatedly, forever</i>. I&#x27;ve actually done the bare minimum by giving money since I know contributing a code fix or feature implementation&#x2F;etc would be way more valuable.')
