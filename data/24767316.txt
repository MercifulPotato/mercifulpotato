Because SF (until recently) has disproportionately been a sellers market, leases are written such that they benefit the landlord.<p>Buyout clauses are not symmetric and are uncommon in SF.<p>In the context you described, both the tenant and the landlord have incentives:  the landlord wants to pay you to break the lease so they can charge higher prices, the tenant might want to accept the money. The landlord doesn&#x27;t have to have any clause in the lease whatsoever to make this offer because you aren&#x27;t obligated to accept it.<p>On the other hand, in the current market the landlord has no incentive to accept an offer that is less than what they feel like they will lose by you leaving. Since the market has collapsed, they&#x27;ll lose quite a bit.<p>I don&#x27;t see the math adding up to making money by breaking out of the lease in SF - unless the prices fall considerably more.')
