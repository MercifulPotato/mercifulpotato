That&#x27;s because this is a generational thing. When millenials are 50, then 50 year old men will do worse than 50 year old women.<p>How specifically was this accomplished? Well many small actions were taken. So it&#x27;s hard to pinpoint which one exactly it is. Women are favored both with explicit policies to favor them, as well as by being given more consideration when policies are designed (&quot;How will this affect women&quot;). Hence I don&#x27;t think there is one big thing that needs fixing, rather it&#x27;s many small things. And doing so will take a long time, decades possibly.')
