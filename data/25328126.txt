Algorithmically speaking in computer science, we can formalize efficiency with complexity theory.<p>Can we do the same with neural networks?  Is there a formalization of why &#x27;skip connections&#x27; (which I know nothing about) are better, why transformers are more efficient than recurrance, etc?<p>Is it useful to talk about their complexity or universal properties or size (and I realize this is muddled up a bit by the fact that hardware architecture can sometimes trump efficiency).')
