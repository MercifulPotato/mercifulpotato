On the ThinkPad p1 extreme it&#x27;s a joke. The Nvidia driver core dumped on me yesterday. The usb bus got into a bad state the day before (this started happening after I started using a USB 3.0 HDMI adapter, to avoid having to use Nvidia to power external monitors). That caused the webcam on the same internal hub to stop working, an in our WFH times, a webcam is essential.<p>The crazy part is that the webcam driver I used on the MacBook was reverse engineered and never actually reached &quot;stability&quot; or got added to the kernel. I just compiled it and packaged it with DKMS and then forgot all about it.')
