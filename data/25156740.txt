Lodash being a large, heavily overloaded and generic library it seems fair that the definitions are complex.<p>When it comes to external code like that, I don&#x27;t think you can argue against the value of intellisense and safety (especially when upgrading versions). Those are in my opinion the biggest benefits of having strong types.')
