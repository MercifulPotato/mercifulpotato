Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604214296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24953440, text='&gt; algebraic sense of wonder<p>I strongly identify with this view. Have always loved math. I remember writing a paper in middle school on how all of nature is built on math which ties closely with this quote &quot;algebraic sense of wonder&quot;. My B.S. degree is in mathematics and I loved it.<p>And yet... I very strongly - no, extremely - dislike functional programming. When building concrete things, I love pragmatism above all else and to me functional is the diametrical opposite of that. A CPU has registers, instructions and addressable memory. Any abstraction that strays too far from that reality is a distraction (and maintenance burden) I don&#x27;t want to deal with.')
