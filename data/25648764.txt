The boogey man of &#x27;forcing people to quarantine&#x27; can be avoided while still creating incentives and expectations that individuals should opt-into a plan that concentrates risk and concentrates isolation requirements around known risks.<p>A positive test in the West comes with vague advice to quarantine at home.  It should&#x27;ve instead come with a pre-paid package providing hotel+food+income-supplement that continued for the quarantine period so long as you don&#x27;t violate the isolation expectations ... Incentives, not punitive measures, would&#x27;ve sufficed to make it possible, easy, and expected for people to _avoid_ spreading to their co-dwellers&#x2F;neighbors or anyone they come into contact with by necessity for basic survival needs.')
