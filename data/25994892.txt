Code complexity? Ease of testing? Compatibility&#x2F;leveraging of tools? Apropos for your programmer ability? Apropos for non-programmers if it crosses out of pure programming?<p>Best practice is definitely a weasel word. Something that should be qualified with what is being optimized, what prompted its adoption, and comparisons to other approaches that highlight&#x2F;justify its use.<p>It also falsely implies there is no better candidate out there (another computer science irony: your &quot;best practice&quot; has been proven via magical super-turing computation to truly be the best ever?).<p>It assumes false authority.<p>Really, they are only good for setting a reasonable standard and moving forward rather than constant bikeshedding.')
