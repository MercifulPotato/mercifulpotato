Computer Science attracts more trans people than any profession I know that isn&#x27;t related to drag performance.<p>For me personally, I loved programming as a kid because it had a macho culture I could actually participate in (programming definitely has a macho culture of all-nighters, showing off skills, putting down people who don&#x27;t understand things as well) and my body (which I hated) didn&#x27;t matter. Now that I have transitioned to male and have a body I can stand, I actively dislike Computer Science and can&#x27;t wait to leave it.<p>As an aside, programming was heavily female-dominated when my grandma was a programmer. There are a lot of factors that contributed to the shift, including changing professional requirements, new job opportunities for women, the advertising around video games, and the stereotypes that developed about programming and nerd culture.')
