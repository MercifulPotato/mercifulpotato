This statement reflects the learnings across 10 months of fighting this virus. We really do need to some moving, congregating, and gathering in groups indoors. So on some level forcefully shutting everything down should achieve that, but we are humans and will make mistakes. So should we shut our way down into compliance or focus more on the specifics of what science says reduces transmissions? Dr Morrow makes a clear case for the latter. The only trick is how you convince everyone to comply.')
