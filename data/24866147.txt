With time, your memory wears out and you start forgetting the little achievements, feeling like you&#x27;ve wasted your time. Seeing your daily jog or journal of thoughts preserved, memories made, helps you relive the good parts (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve written down) and that makes the best parts of life last longer as they are relived, re-encountered.<p>I&#x27;m building functionality to help people preserve those memories&#x2F;personal logs in an ads-free way and make them privately share-able with loved ones at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dreamlist.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dreamlist.com</a> . However I also own the domains journalee.com and braingarden.net. Debating whether to explore those. What do you think?')
