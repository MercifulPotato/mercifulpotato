Item(by='arcturus17', descendants=None, kids=[25476409], score=None, time=1608371675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475903, text='Except maybe vinyl, I&#x27;ve gone through it all: taping songs off the radio, burning minidiscs and CDs, Napster, eMule, Pandora, iTunes, etc.<p>I love Spotify and the actual way of consuming and discovering music. Some say that music taste stagnates as we age but I come from a metal and rock background and I have been making escapades into electronic music (including EDM), funk, soul, and more in my late twenties and early thirties, and I expect this trend to continue into old age.<p>None of this ever happened when I was in my teens, where I would just buy the metal magazines, go to the metal record store, and speak only to metalheads. Part may be me, but another part is certainly Spotify &#x2F; music streaming.<p>My only criticism is that Spotify&#x27;s music recommendation algorithms are really subpar. When I like a new song, I tap &quot;Go to Radio&quot; and it shows a playlist of related songs, but it seems like it relies too much on the preferences of other users and on obvious connections between artists.<p>Pandora in the mid-2000&#x27;s already blew it out of the water in this regard - I remember going through a personal golden age of music discovery thanks to it. I could not believe how spot-on the recommendations felt and how they could dig out superobscure stuff that resonated with me. I don&#x27;t know what the state of the service is right now but if it was just as good as in the 2000&#x27;s and it was available in Europe I would pay for it without a doubt. What&#x27;s surprising is that Spotify&#x27;s recommendation tech is so far behind, and that they don&#x27;t seem to care.<p>Other than that, I can&#x27;t think of a single non-essential service in my life providing more value than &quot;$9.99 a month for unlimited music&quot;. The utility to cost ratio is off the charts since I use it for six or eight hours daily and it costs peanuts.<p>If there was a nuclear apocalypse and I had to listen to cassettes on my pipboy, I&#x27;d surely be nostalgic about the good old days of music streaming.')
