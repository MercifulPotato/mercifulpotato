Sorry if it didn’t make sense. I think whats also interesting is it has become on one hand more accessible but on another less. Even with ARM cores the cost to get to 5nm is staggering and can really only be done by a few companies. It’s very obvious who has the scale.<p>Heck even semiconductor companies themselves are worried if they can make it to the 5nm node alone - the XLNX&#x2F;AMD and especially the IPHI&#x2F;MRVL merger can be viewed from this light.<p>What is most interesting is the timing. Software did eat everything, hardware used to keep up. Moore’s law died a quiet death and the solution is everyone makes custom chips for everything. Well then the people who have to most compute are going to make the most chips, but also at a time where the actual entry to do leading edge is the highest. It’s just a very cool time for them to have done it. I’m excited and will be following. Thanks for the feedback, the writing is hard sometimes.')
