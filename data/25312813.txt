So you need to make a choice from a number of framework agnostic libs.<p>Or you&#x27;d like to switch a library (say from Enzyme to React testing library) and you need to convince other developers. In that case latest ThoughWorks Techradar could help if they put the already used library on Hold.<p>What also matters to me personally, among other things, is that the considered library should be actively maintained, preferably with a good number of contributors and frequent commits')
