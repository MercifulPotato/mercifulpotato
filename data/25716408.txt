I also feel like I&#x27;m not really qualified to understand these documents - they are generally written for people who have the appropriate qualifications.<p>For example when buying a property in the UK, the soliciter will be the one parses the legal documents.  It&#x27;s crazy to think that normal people are expected to fully understand these, and it doesn&#x27;t surpise me when they just blindly sign them.  At the end of the day they want the thing and carry on with their lives - throwing caution to the wind.')
