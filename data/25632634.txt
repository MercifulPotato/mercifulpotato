There is no defining union industry in principle, only in past embodiment. The intent of a union is to balance the leverage of workers compared to management via collective bargaining. So a union is valid anywhere there is a real or perceived imbalance of leverage.<p>Claiming one can go get a job anywhere else only balances the leverage when certain assumptions are met (e.g., symmetry of information, no conspiracies to suppress wages or prevent hiring etc.) Considering the tech industry hasn’t always met these assumptions, I don’t know that your claim proves true')
