In fact I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s easier to do and has fewer social downsides than Richard Stallman&#x27;s refusal to carry around a cell phone. (And he seems to get around without one.)<p>In fact, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s instructive to go back through your examples and apply the parent&#x27;s dogma. For example, if the dogma is heartfelt, then parent is going around signalling this trait to any potential love interest. That narrows the field, but it&#x27;s narrowing it to those who find that trait desirable.<p>I&#x27;m not endorsing the dogma-- e.g., it filters out those who would find it desirable <i>if only</i> OP could break the ice first. But that&#x27;s no reason to find it social unfeasible.')
