For both the driver and other vehicles. Make predictions, gather actuals, continuously try to narrow the delta. Forward anything really weird up to the mother ship for detailed analysis.<p>Knowing when the driver is surprised would be a pretty good signal. If both the driver and the simulation are surprised, then the simulation could infer which events were way out of scope.<p>I have no reason, data, or insight for my conjecture.<p>It&#x27;s just how I&#x27;d do it. And would account for why the onboard computer is so beefy.')
