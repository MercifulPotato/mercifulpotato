After lots of questions about how you need to config, you get your kernel... THAT is Linux -- the kernel.<p>The rest, the part you are complaining about bloating is the GNU part. I&#x27;m not complaining about that GNU part, btw. I&#x27;ve lived in it since the early 90&#x27;s. But the Linux kernel can be as slim and responsive as you want it to be if you are willing to compile yourself. You can even compile it as an RTOS, and you can never convince me that would be too sluggish.<p>What I got voted down for was pointing out that Linux-proper wasn&#x27;t the slow part of that blend. It was the desktop. And that part is GNU, not Linux. Period.')
