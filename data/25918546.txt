I wholeheartedly disagree.<p>I understand what you&#x27;re saying and yes I believe obviously we have more pictures&#x2F;proof of existence (connected world) and yes there are a lot of areas where we have made progress but is &quot;trust&quot; in general better ?<p>I don&#x27;t want to make this political but it is the elephant in the room right now. There is a whole side of a political party + media completely dismissing and grouping the whole other side in simplistic and alienating ways.<p>I&#x27;m not for either political side and I&#x27;m not a trump supporter. (Sadly I have to add this disclaimer, it&#x27;s incredibly saddening)<p>I think someone else in this thread mentioned China as a high-trustful society. I think that goes to show that we&#x27;re not talking about overall &quot;better&quot; and overall &quot;accepting&quot; but specifically &quot;trust&quot;.<p>Maybe we find out that trust is in conflict with the other values we hold ? but to say that general trust is high now seems really naive.<p>I know it&#x27;s an outlier but you don&#x27;t need media selectiveness to show you San Fransico&#x27;s homelessness problem , in fact I see more of that from word of mouth&#x2F;first hand experience. I personally have seen signs of deteriorating trust in my &quot;neighborhood&quot;. I don&#x27;t want to put up strawmen but maybe it depends on how much your view is based on media vs what you see ? in which case where you live would probably have a huge impact in what your views on this are ?<p>I hate using that because I don&#x27;t want to say that some people are too privileged to see this, imo obvious, change. As someone who was raised in a rough neighborhood (poor&#x2F;high crime rate) and then moved out to a better place, I was shocked how my world view changed and I really thought the whole world had moved to a better place until I went back and realized there are still people in that &quot;old world&quot;. It was incredibly shocking that I believed some of these things and now I&#x27;m vigilant and accepting that my world view (large part to where I live) tints the world.<p>I obviously don&#x27;t know the solution and maybe &quot;trust&quot; is a value we have to lose to have some of our more progressive values or maybe it&#x27;s just harder to incorporate those other values with trust.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say that in the 50&#x27;s communities were more trusting (<i>for some, racism&#x2F;monoculture related I&#x27;m sure). Not better but more trusting (huge emphasis on </i>for some).')
