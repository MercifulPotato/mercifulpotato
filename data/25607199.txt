Rather encourage having an idea of where you&#x27;re headed with the chain of commits, and review and merge a sequence of smaller steps, and ideally validate each of them by deploying to production. This is easier to review, easier to merge and less risk to deploy.<p>If JIRA is not a good fit to this model, too bad, that&#x27;s JIRAs problem. Don&#x27;t make you dev process worse to appease JIRA.')
