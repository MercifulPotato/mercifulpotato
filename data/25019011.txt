If the demographic already had very little support prior, all it shows is that wasn&#x27;t as bad as expected. In this case, Trump&#x27;s policy having fewer discriminatory outcomes than expected doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t racist. That&#x27;s not to offer additional commentary on if him or his policy is racist, but that increase in support doesn&#x27;t contradict the possibility.')
