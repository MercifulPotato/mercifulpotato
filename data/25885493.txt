Google still rate limited me when I used Colab Pro, and I ran into a myriad of other small problems.  If that&#x27;s all one is willing to spend to play with AI, 100% go for it.  It&#x27;s a great place to start.  But if you&#x27;re at all serious and can afford it, I think a local machine with a modest GPU is worth every penny.')
