What you describe is actually hypothesized in the concept of the &quot;uncanny valley effect&quot;:<p>&quot;...as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers&#x27; emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic, until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes strong revulsion. However, as the robot&#x27;s appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels.<p>&quot;This area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a &quot;barely human&quot; and &quot;fully human&quot; entity is the uncanny valley. The name captures the idea that an almost human-looking robot seems overly &quot;strange&quot; to some human beings, produces a feeling of uncanniness, and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive humanâ€“robot interaction.&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uncanny_valley" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Uncanny_valley</a>')
