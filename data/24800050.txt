But isn&#x27;t just a bunch of boring and inconsistent tales? is there really anything to be learned from the bible?<p>You could say the same thing about the Iliad or Aeneid, or the Arabian Nights, or pretty much any long-standing work of literature.<p>I&#x27;m not a Christian either, but I love the Bible - it&#x27;s a book of great beauty and wisdom, and a foundation &#x2F; moral guide for many of the world&#x27;s great civilizations. If that isn&#x27;t reason enough for you, then nothing will be.<p>&quot;In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:<p>Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.&quot;')
