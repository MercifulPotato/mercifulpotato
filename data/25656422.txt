Not everything has to be for everyone.<p>In defense of the BotNS, I think that it&#x27;s mostly lazy readers that think Severian is having his way with all these women - astute or second time readers will note that these women are manipulating Severian who is actually somewhat dim. (Consider Agia). But this is more likely to turn off female readers.<p>In the context of Wolfe&#x27;s treatment of women The Sorcerer&#x27;s House becomes a favorite novel. It seems designed to bait that most common criticism. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from a 3&#x2F;5 review:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not overwhelmed with the treatment of women in this book -- every woman wants to sleep with Our Hero, for example, and quickly opens up to him, and I don&#x27;t see why. He&#x27;s not charming, he&#x27;s unsettling. But maybe that&#x27;s because we see him through his own report of himself to his brother... I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not a fan, anyway. Even if it works for the character, I could have done with a female character who really stood out.&quot;<p>This response is I think what Wolfe was going for. Baxter getting all the girls is a glaring clue hiding in plain sight. But even if it&#x27;s in service of the novel it&#x27;s normal to want to have a character for yourself and is a reasonable expectation of a fantasy novel. Fair enough.<p>&gt;&quot;We believe that we invent symbols. The truth is that they invent us; we are their creatures, shaped by their hard, defining edges.&quot;<p>&quot;The would-be sorcerer alone has faith in the efficacy of pure knowledge; rational people know that things act of themselves or not at all.&quot;')
