You see people responding to emails after hours and during weekends, you see people going the extra mile to meet a deadline, the promotion process is regularly pushed and you&#x27;re always trying to do more to move onto the next stage, etc.<p>It&#x27;s all part of the corporate culture, so you don&#x27;t even think of it as &quot;workaholism&quot;, it&#x27;s just normal. You live in a bubble and many of your friends work at the same company, so you can&#x27;t even see a different perspective.<p>That said, it can be very lucrative over several years since they pay so well. I&#x27;ve since left the company, but have a good nest egg from my work there.')
