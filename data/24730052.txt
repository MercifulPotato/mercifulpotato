If it weren&#x27;t for that there probably wouldn&#x27;t be much of an economy left by this point.<p>That&#x27;s a non sequitur, as inflation is actively managed with a goal target rate. Had it started to drift, the rates that govern inflation would have been adjusted.<p>&gt; Of course artificial deflation is no better; the ideal is not forced deflation but rather a currency whose supply is not subject to manipulation.<p>This does not follow either as the currency supply needs to be able to respond to external factors, such as increases or decreases in population. In an increasing population, a currency with no new coins is deflationary. In a decreasing  population, it is inflationary.<p>Money supply needs to be able to respond to externalities.')
