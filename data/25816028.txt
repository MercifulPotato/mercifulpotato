And that&#x27;s explicitly designed for a single infantryman. I&#x27;m not well versed in the constitutional law but there seems to be a principle that extremely dangerous weapons will not be owned by civilians in the US, regardless of historical precedents, textualism, originalism, or any other contrary principles.<p>I&#x27;m also curious about the constitutional ramifications of the ban on civilian ownership of machine guns manufactured after 1986. Could <i>any</i> class of small arms be gradually banned by specifying a date of manufacture cutoff for legality in a similar way? Seems contrary to a plain reading of the 2a to phase out weapons this way but I know that my layman&#x27;s plain reading is worth very little here.')
