Not only can I read local newspapers and magazines from all over the world, which wasn’t easy to do before the internet, but also there are tons of new digital-only publications and millions of blogs.<p>In the 1990s in the US, before the internet took off, most people had access to one local paper (two in some cases), maybe an a few local magazines (include “alternative weekly” newspapers), a few local TV and radio stations, PBS and NPR, the 100 or so cable channels their local provider offered, the hundred or so magazines and newspapers the local Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble sold, and whatever magazines and newspapers their library had in the periodicals section.  And a lot of this media was owned by a few big corporations like Time Warner, News Corp, Condé Nast, etc.<p>&gt; versus when you have just one, and that one actively works to prevent other options from emerging.<p>How has Facebook tried to prevent news outlets from emerging?  They benefit hugely from news outlets, and kind of even depend on them for existence. They need the content for people to post and share. New publications like Vox probably owe some of their success to Facebook, and vice versa.<p>FB might have a lot of power to amplify traffic to certain publications (kind of like the big retail chains did in the 90s only more so), but that’s very different from actively preventing new news outlets from emerging.')
