One complaint might be the branding but keep in mind that the Apache Foundation has a strict policy of enforcing trademarks. The Apache Foundation itself doesn&#x27;t choose winners and many equivalent projects live under the same umbrella, just like Flink and Kafka.<p>Performance is often transient and it isn&#x27;t the only criteria used when choosing a vendor. Some enterprise customers prefer a single vendor, i.e., &quot;one throat to choke&quot;. Others have very specific constraints: greenfield decision making is a luxury.<p>My impression is that Amazon responds to customer requests to solve specific problems and they make a decent effort to continuously improve the performance and other aspects of their services. At one point people said &quot;no one gets fired for choosing IBM&quot; and this switched to Microsoft and, rightly or wrongly, Amazon AWS now wears this crown.')
