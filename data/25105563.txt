Free trade between the US, Canada, and Mexico should be something you can explain (ELI5) in one or two pages. A lawyer might extend that to 10 to 20 pages to make it formal using legalese. The actual agreement ran over 700 pages and included carve outs for all sorts of things for many different companies and industries. It was a trade agreement.
