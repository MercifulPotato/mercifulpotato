SCO taught us anything, it should have taught us that &quot;easily... prove&quot; and &quot;in court&quot; do not belong in the same sentence. The case SHOULD have been thrown out in 5 minutes due to lack of merit, which ANY programmer could see. Instead, it took FOURTEEN YEARS to decide, and is STILL working through appeals. Microsoft funded the litigation, and the scumbag executives of SCO continued to get paid through most of this charade. It all still makes my blood boil.')
