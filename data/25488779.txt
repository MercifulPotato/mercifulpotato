It&#x27;s the same problem I have with Apple&#x27;s work to ban game streaming services from their site- it would be a lot more convincing that they are acting in the users best interest of they weren&#x27;t also selling Apple arcade. We really should be concerned about gatekeepers prioritizing their own services over the competition. I&#x27;m not saying that these sites should be restored to a place of prominence (they shouldn&#x27;t) but that the underlying idea that a monopoly like Google search should be restricted in its ability to branch out or self promote its services is valid.')
