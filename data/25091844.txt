None of that depends on “pods need to move in a tube”. And if it’s such a major benefit, why hasn’t any of this been done on light rail? There’s no driverless light rail anywhere in germany - and the question you need to answer is “why is that?” You’ll quickly figure out that some of the reasons are technical and some are political, but “must be in a tube and maglev” is not one of them.<p>Hyperloop appeals to us technical folks because it’s cool. But it suffers from many of the same problems that occur when technical folks propose solution, we tend to propose technical solutions to non-technical problems. And we usually fail because we ignore the non-technical side.')
