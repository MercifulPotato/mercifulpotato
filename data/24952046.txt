I try to avoid buying devices like that whenever possible, because they just lock me into those ecosystems.<p>The Amazon app store is an option, for things that are available there. It&#x27;s not everything, but it feels like there&#x27;s a decent selection there.<p>That said, for those apps that are only found in the Play Store, there are third-party clients like Aurora Store: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f-droid.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;packages&#x2F;com.aurora.store&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f-droid.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;packages&#x2F;com.aurora.store&#x2F;</a><p>(Warning: possibly against some part of the Play Store ToS and Google is notoriously opaque regarding enforcement. Use caution.)<p>That, unlike e.g. the Play Store, should be installable normally as any other Android app even on compatibility layers like Anbox.
