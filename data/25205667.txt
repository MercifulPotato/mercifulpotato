And I say this from experience, having seen both of these failure cases numerous times in the wild.<p>If users are frequently reporting that the application&#x27;s getting stuck at a particular percent, then - to me at least - that&#x27;s valuable information for whether I should consider doing some optimization to speed up whatever step in the process corresponds with that progress percentage, or to break down that step further into smaller steps to keep things moving, or both.')
