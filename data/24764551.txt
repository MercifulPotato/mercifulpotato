To that end, I did not want to slow down adoption by choosing a license that screamed &quot;$$$&quot; or made somebody&#x27;s legal team uncomfortable. In any case, if a big company wants to copy you, they will and can with the resources they can throw at it.<p>On the other hand, there are popular projects that do use AGPL (MongoDB) so it might not be that big of a deal in the real world :)')
