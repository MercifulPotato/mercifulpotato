Item(by='karmakaze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608244679, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25458230, text='Disregarding whether the title helps you or not, the content of the post is useful to put things into context if you&#x27;re not already very familiar with git or find some things surprising.<p>Commits are not &#x27;just&#x27; the snapshots as the ancestor references and metadata matter. I for one think the title is a distinction without a difference (if you already accept that a git hash represents both the current set of exact files and ancestors) but the content is well presented for anyone.')
