The parent notes that some people hold it, and we can imply that enough people hold it (and with enough collective influence) that businesses were coerced into changing their policies, but that doesn’t suggest any kind of majority or even a sizable minority. Indeed, the whole idea behind “tyranny of the minority” is that it takes only a very small minority to drive broad-reaching change in cases like these. I think one of us has misread the thread, but I’ve now triple checked and I don’t think the error is mine in this particular instance.')
