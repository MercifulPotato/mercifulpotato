With Aquameta, I&#x27;m trying to to break down the technical barriers between users and developers by putting the development stack in the database (PostgreSQL).  Right now users edit data, and developers edit code, but with Aquameta, everything is data, so it opens up huge new frontier of possibilities.  We&#x27;re challenging the assumptions baked into Unix that date back to the 60&#x27;s, that the file system is an acceptable way to organize the dev stack.  It is not, and once you see the inefficiencies that the old paradigm has plagued us with, you can never unsee it.  They are everywhere.  By putting everything in the database, we gain a huge multiplier of interoperability and reusability, almost for free.<p>Here&#x27;s an intro video from a couple of years ago:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=G0C8AsXNPAU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=G0C8AsXNPAU</a><p>Aquameta has a functional IDE and is getting very close to a v0.3 release, the first release that users can easily download and install.  I have a lot of ideas for how to monetize.<p>I am foremost a systems engineer, but I very much value biz dev as an essential part of bringing something into the world.  We&#x27;re mission driven, but missions don&#x27;t get too far without the Benjamins.  I&#x27;m looking for someone to flesh out the business side of things, someone with connections to the investment world, and skills in market strategy, sales and marketing.  I&#x27;m currently in San Francisco.  Hit me up at eric@aquameta.com.')
