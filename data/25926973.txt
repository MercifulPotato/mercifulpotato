Sure, it&#x27;s possible. But there is no evidence for it here, only assertion. And the quantitative problem is very large, so those factors would need to be very powerful.<p>Aside from that, it&#x27;s naive to believe that the qualitative factors will only work in the positive direction. Whatever is gained from excluding the wrong-thinkers could easily be dwarfed by legal or reputational problems, blowback from boycotts or other &quot;cancellation&quot;, inability to address the whole market due to a lack of diverse viewpoints, etc.')
