I imagine just about every language spec (with the possible exception of assembly languages) states something like <i>If memory is exhausted, a handler is executed</i> or <i>If memory is exhausted, the behaviour is undefined</i>, and it&#x27;s always going to be up to the compiler&#x2F;interpreter to make reasonable use of the available memory on the specific target platform.<p>Would a C compiler be non-compliant if it generated code that used 100x the memory that would be used by code generated by typical C compiler? How about 1,000,000,000x so that its generated programs <i>always</i> failed immediately?<p>Java is an interesting case for this, as it famously doesn&#x27;t require that a garbage collector needs to be included at all (unlike .Net which does). In Java, not only are you permitted to have a conservative GC, you&#x27;re permitted to have no GC whatsoever (something OpenJDK now offers [0]). Apparently [1] Java requires that <i>the collector (if it exists) will run before the JVM throws OutOfMemoryError</i>.<p>I imagine the formal methods folks must have done some thinking on this topic, as their whole field is about doing better than <i>just go ahead and test it out</i>. Could a standards-compliant C compiler used in a safety-critical domain generate code that, only very occasionally, uses a billion times the memory it typically uses?<p>Somewhat related: one of the motivations behind the Zig language seems to have been a frustration with clumsy handling of memory-exhaustion.
