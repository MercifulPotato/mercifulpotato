It&#x27;s more like a Dan Brown book though: people might find the stock goodies and baddies narrative, historic&#x2F;mythologic references and attention to detail with symbols and places all too believable but it&#x27;s certainly possible to overanalyse design decisions which amount to <i>stereotypical heroes in stereotyped historical settings sell better</i>.<p>If one actually wanted to produce a nuanced representation of that historical timeline, it would be difficult to do so as a game based on killing large numbers of NPCs')
