So that&#x27;s ~327. So despite coal being 16% of the energy production, it is 40% of the emissions and gas is 58% of the emissions.<p>Looking at NYISO we see a different story. Currently there is a lot grayed out in the gas area. Right now gas is 28% of the total electricity generation while peak of the day it is 39%.<p>If you look at CISO (California) you&#x27;ll see the opposite happen. Mid day solar takes over and emissions drop. The famous Duck Curve. They go from 150gCO2eq&#x2F;kWhr in the morning to more than double that at night. You&#x27;ll also see wind die down at times. Interesting thing is how hydro changes.<p>So a lot comes down to how you&#x27;re providing your base load and what energy sources you are using at what times in the day. If you look around the map a lot you&#x27;ll see that a lot of countries&#x2F;areas that have very consistent loads (and hence emissions) export a lot of their energy at those different times. While a lot of people like looking at averages the problem here is substantially complex because there&#x27;s temporal components (hourly, weekly, seasonly) as well as a lot of environmental factors.')
