Item(by='brazzy', descendants=None, kids=[25200126], score=None, time=1606234070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198173, text='&gt; sounds like speculation. it&#x27;s a major desirability factor in bitcoin.<p>No, that&#x27;s a plain fact. Nobody ever buys security as an end unto itself. You buy security to protect the thing you really want. Which in the case of Bitcoin is by a <i>vast</i> majority &quot;getting rich&quot;.<p>&gt; you wouldn&#x27;t lock a $5000 bike with $5 lock. so difficulty increase correlates very much with amount of wealth poured into bitcoin.<p>It correlates, but not in direct proportion. With any other kind of security, you don&#x27;t need to spend 10 times as much to protect a 10 times higher value, and there is a possibility of security getting cheaper due to advances in technology.')
