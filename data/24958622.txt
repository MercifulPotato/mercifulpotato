UHaul is up to double the cost of their budget competitors like Public Storage. I&#x27;m budget conscious, so I quickly ruled out UHaul.<p>The other companies all follow the same template. I didn&#x27;t find any locally-owned self-storage companies, only franchises. It&#x27;s impossible to call the local franchise office directly, even after you&#x27;ve rented a unit. The phone numbers listed in ads and on websites have local area codes but they are forwarded to national call centers.<p>My first attempt to rent a unit, I find the best rate online, drive to the facility, and ask to rent a unit at the advertised rate. The manager has me fill out the application. The lock I&#x27;ll need is $10. Sure, that&#x27;s reasonable, I guess. Then she explains that there is a $20 move-in fee. No problem! This fee was hidden in a footnote on the comparison shopping site, but I spotted it and was willing to pay the 50% markup on the first month&#x27;s rent. It&#x27;s still a third of the cost of UHaul. But the amount she wanted to charge my card still seemed high.<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she explained, &quot;it includes a $15 monthly insurance premium.&quot;<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t need insurance.&quot;<p>&quot;Everyone&#x27;s required to have insurance.&quot;<p>I was indignant and walked out on principle. It was false advertising, plain and simple, and I refuse to reward that behavior with my business.<p>I now resolved to get an actual-for-real-no-takebacks final price over the phone before driving anywhere else. So I sat in my car and called a local Public Storage franchise. Or tried to. This is when I learned about the call centers. I was frustrated at having just driven 20 minutes for nothing, and getting a call center agent after dialing a local area code phone number did nothing to improve my mood. The agent asked for my first name. Then she asked for my email address. I balked. I explained to the agent that I just wanted to get an actual-for-real-no-takebacks quote to rent a storage unit at my local Public Storage franchise. She couldn&#x27;t tell me. I&#x27;d have to ask the local manager, she explained.<p>&quot;OK, can you just give me the phone number?&quot; I asked, exasperated.<p>&quot;Once I get done with you&quot; she responded impatiently.<p>I was incredulous. Some of the quotes in this story may not be word-for-word accurate. But that is a word-for-word quote: &quot;Once I get done with you.&quot;<p>In what is not my proudest moment, I informed her that I was quite certain we would be altogether done very soon, but first I would like to express what a dumpster fire I have found the self-storage industry to be. My prophecy came to pass as she soon hung up on me.<p>At this point, I was becoming less price-sensitive. I didn&#x27;t embark on this venture thinking quality customer service would be a high priority for me, but I didn&#x27;t realize how low the baseline was in this industry.<p>There was a reasonably priced place near my home, so I decided to drive there. I figured there couldn&#x27;t be much more that could be unexpected at this point. I filled out the application and listened patiently as she explained the move-in fee and required insurance. I wasn&#x27;t completely resigned, however, and I asked if I could forego the insurance, perhaps by signing a waiver. She told me the insurance was required by state law. I wasn&#x27;t going to argue with her--I really just needed to rent a unit already--but that seemed highly unlikely. I rented the unit.<p>But when I got home, I did some research, and it turns out, she wasn&#x27;t as far off as you might think. Ohio does have a state law devoted to self-storage unit insurance[1], believe it or not. But rather than mandating insurance, the law sets out a number of regulations that self-storage providers must follow in order to sell insurance to their customers. Normally, an agent must pass a test to be certified to sell insurance, but this law, which was passed at the behest of the self-storage lobby, makes a special cut-out so that minimally trained self-storage company staff can sell company-mandated insurance to their customers as a hidden monthly fee they can tack on to advertised prices without getting in trouble for false advertising.<p>And hey, what do you know? The business did not comply with several points in the regulations. For example, the literature describing the insurance did not include various mandated disclosures. So I went ahead and wrote a complaint to the Ohio Department of Insurance outlining the violations.<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;codes.ohio.gov&#x2F;orc&#x2F;3905.063" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;codes.ohio.gov&#x2F;orc&#x2F;3905.063</a>')
