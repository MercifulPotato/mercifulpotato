The T shaped developer skillset is extremely, extremely valuable and will only probably continue. Sure, you could get deeper in a language you already have experience with, but do you think that will better prepare you for future experiences in different languages? Do you want to stick with the tech you&#x27;re currently using for the rest of your career? If you do, that&#x27;s great! Don&#x27;t even worry about the other stuff. But I can say, any time I&#x27;ve spent in my career learning something new has never been wasted time, even if I never used the tool again.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s also fun to just see something different.
