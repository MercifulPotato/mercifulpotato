Then make users have to choose to then stash it somewhere they won’t draw from and trigger these events, if they want to “invest in a crypto”. It’d also be wise because coinbase can then charge their fees as they so do.<p>This is also fundamentally not so different from e.g. having spend vehicles with your brokerage.
