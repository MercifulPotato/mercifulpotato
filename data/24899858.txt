There are no competitors.<p>The funny (sad) thing is that these utilities are almost easier to work around Twitter in this case.<p>Power company cuts you off?  Buy a generator, no big deal.<p>Town turns off your water.  IBC totes are cheap.<p>Comcast terminates your account?  Verizon is happy to pay you money and if they aren&#x27;t where you are then you can suck it up and by satellite.<p>If your a media business and Twitter&#x2F;Facebook won&#x27;t let you advertise and breaks links to your content you&#x27;re basically screwed.  There are no real alternatives because that&#x27;s wher your users are.')
