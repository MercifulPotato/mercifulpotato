It should remain entirely inactive until things get more exciting than they should ever get on a passenger flight.  What you are talking about is a <i>malfunctioning</i> MCAS, which isn&#x27;t operating by design.<p>&gt; recovering from a stall (even if one happened, which it didn&#x27;t in either crash) is Day 1 of every flight training course<p>Yes, of course it is.  It is also very rarely encountered by passenger jets, and when it does happen things are very exciting indeed.  Your odds of hitting the ground have already gone up quite dramatically at that point, MCAS or not.')
