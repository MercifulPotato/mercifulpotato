As a user, you can very easily turn it off and on at will, mute it, even set status messages like &quot;I will check my messages twice a day&quot;.<p>From a workflow standpoint, this is optimal.<p>The catch is that many people view Slack as e-mail but with an expectation of instant response. The farther your Slack communications stray from engineers, the more likely you are to encounter this mindset.<p>Years ago I would have argued that Slack is merely a tool and these are personal problems, but after setting Slack up at a few workplaces I&#x27;ve realized that they structure the defaults and notification settings to encourage this &quot;always connected, always on&quot; mode by default.')
