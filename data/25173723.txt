Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=[25174509], score=None, time=1606003976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171266, text='I think my instinct for this and my relative lack of interview experience have been at odds. When I’m <i>already on the job</i>, I have no doubt that my experience and opinions show my value. I don’t even worry anymore about demonstrating value: it comes out of every action I take, and if it’s not manifest in the interaction I can either demonstrate it with outcomes or retrospectives. But that translates poorly to an interview environment where the person on the viewing side of a whiteboard might not even have the instinct to hear “this is a problem I would solve by choosing a technology that already addresses it” or even “this is something I would google because it’s not the core problem I’m solving, just a detail”.')
