It&#x27;s old, its heritage is older and always offered a different approach to the batch style of Fortran, it&#x27;s not going to change for you.<p>I hate this kind of wording because it makes it seem that Lisp is mysterious, or super difficult, or requires a ton of unlearning, or has no good (and free) learning material (you knock it but I enjoy Steele&#x27;s 30 year old cltl2 mirrored on a CMU page), or is only for impractical purposes and CS-guilded programmers. I don&#x27;t believe any of that, there are plenty of examples to the contrary. In contrast your own difficulties are puzzling. I hesitate to suggest reading, watching, or doing anything else, though things come to mind, simply to avoid wasting your time or money further if you took me up on any of it, as it might all be useless.')
