Somewhat recently, they rolled out a change where some keywords in your query will be left out to generate results for something unrelated. I&#x27;ve been having to wrap everything in quotes, add plus signs, and&#x2F;or click on the &quot;no, what I submitted really was what I wanted to search for, thanks&quot; links on the results pages. I really hate to say it, but half of my searches are done on Bing now where I don&#x27;t notice this kind of behavior taking place.<p>Also, if you want to talk about bad UX on Google products, I could write a book on frustrations I have with using Maps.')
