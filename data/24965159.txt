She can usually do okay with a gel ball roller, but one day I let her try my fountain pen and it was the least painful writing experience in her life.<p>She emailed the Goulet Pen company for suggestions on good pens for lupus&#x2F;arthritis and got a detailed response with suggestions.  They were fantastic and helped her place an order for a less expensive pen that fit her hand better to test the waters for future orders.<p>Their YouTube pen videos are good too.')
