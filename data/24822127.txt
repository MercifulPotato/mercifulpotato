Fact of the matter is, the way these are you either have to get apple to repair them for an extortionate amount, or throw them away, which is objectively bad for the environment.<p>So you decide to trust someone else, you&#x27;ve likely done your due diligence, and ended up with a professional that claims to do it for half the price.<p>I had to replace my Mum&#x27;s Macbook Pro&#x27;s track pad, and while I have the general knowhow (as in, replace laptop parts), I wasn&#x27;t willing to do it myself because I&#x27;d never done it before, and looking at the steps required I probably wouldn&#x27;t have had the patience to do it due to the billions of things they&#x27;d done to prevent me from doing it. So I went to Apple, who quoted me £350+. Not willing to shell out that much considering it was a 2012 model, I went to my local computer shop, who quoted me ~£90, told me about all the issues that might arise, but he&#x27;d happily do it otherwise.<p>By comparison, I had to replace my Dell XPS&#x27;s track pad less than a month ago. It was extremely easy. A bunch of screws, and remove random parts. Then pop out the trackpad, replace it with the working one, and lastly replace all the parts I&#x27;d taken out and screw them back in. It took all of 30 minutes.<p>For sure there will always be bad technicians, but the majority know what they&#x27;re doing and maybe they break the first one or two, but after that they&#x27;ll be fine. Providing the technician isn&#x27;t purposefully malicious, the likelihood of someone going wrong (or your trust being broken) is relatively low.<p>So sure it&#x27;s small, but given the right setup, most technicians who repair for a living will learn to repair it safely and accurately for a fraction of the price.')
