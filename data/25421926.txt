Responses to any criticism of Google&#x27;s UI falls in the following buckets:<p>- Well <i>I</i> think it looks great.<p>- Stay in your lane, how dare you criticize our designers. This makes them feel unsafe at work. (Whatever the fuck that means)<p>- We did a user study and they liked it, so it must be good.<p>Fundamentally, Googlers are afraid to make real judgement calls. You&#x27;re accountable to those. So you hide behind endless user studies, committees, etc. This doesn&#x27;t just apply to designers: Engineers are also sandbagged with &quot;we need more data&quot; until a risk-taking idea gets snuffed out of existence.<p>The internal &quot;inspirations&quot; doc for Material cite the original Google.com search UI. A big white screen with a text box in the middle.<p>If you ever wonder &quot;why the fuck can&#x27;t I tell where one piece of the UI ends and the other begins&quot; or &quot;why do I have terrible eye strain from this UI&quot; when looking at a Google property, it&#x27;s because designers are boxed in by that &quot;inspiration.&quot;')
