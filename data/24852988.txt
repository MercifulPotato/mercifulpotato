The biggest difference between Internal and Retool is that Internal is designed for everyone (engineers and non-engineers) whereas Retool is designed for engineers. Both are legitimate approaches - just depends on what you’re looking for.<p>My co-founder and I have led several product and engineering teams at tech companies - and have experienced first hand the struggles of building and maintaining internal tools. We believe that empowering product teams, operations teams, IT teams, etc. to build and update some of their own tools would speed the business up, and free engineers to focus on bigger things.<p>Set up is lighting fast and you can customize and update your tools whenever you want.<p>We also provide developer tools as well. You can read&#x2F;write via API, manipulate data with javascript, and more. We’re making some big investments in this area.')
