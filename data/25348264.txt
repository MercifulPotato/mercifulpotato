Maybe broadly we could say that it&#x27;s music that is either notably ahead of it&#x27;s contemporaries in terms of innovation or that intentionally breaks out of stylistic models of its time to do something new.<p>So in those terms, Beethoven was at one point &quot;avant-garde&quot; in that his some of his compositions were so strikingly progressive compared to those of  his contemporaries that they stood out. They were &quot;at the front&quot; of musical innovation in that sense.<p>John Cage started to compose music that intentionally and radically diverted from the trajectory of traditional western art music, so that was considered &quot;avant-garde,&quot; although it was so influential, that I&#x27;d say much of it has become &quot;canonized&quot; in a way that performing it isn&#x27;t really innovative of &quot;edgy&quot; in the way it was at it&#x27;s original reception.<p>Today I think it&#x27;s hard to pin down because there aren&#x27;t really any established traditions that composers are breaking away from like they were at the cusp between the 19th and 20th centuries. I&#x27;ve seen and performed pieces for amplified fluorescent light bulbs, 4  screaming men in loin clothes, and for a solo performer articulating gestures in ASL to a pre-recorded musical track. None of it was scandalous, and some of it was quite good.')
