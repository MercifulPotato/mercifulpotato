It&#x27;s not glibc, it&#x27;s different. Not necessarily better or worse.<p>* You can&#x27;t use manylinux1 wheels with alpine, so if you&#x27;ve got python&#x2F;c extensions, you&#x27;re going to be building them instead of installing upstream binaries. So cue the need for a dev toolchain, and a much longer install time.<p>And once you have all that, you&#x27;re running a different version in dev&#x2F;prod, which is one of those things that docker is supposed to be good at fixing.')
