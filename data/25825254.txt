While not a panacea, it does remove the clutter of &#x27;issues as discussions&#x27; and allows you to really use the issue tracker for <i>just</i> issues.<p>This is what I would recommend every open source project do on GitHub:<p>- Convert discussion issues to discussions<p>- Label the existing issues as issue type (e.g. bug) if this makes sense for your project<p>- Add an issue template that specifies if it is a feature request &#x2F; discussion etc that it will be moved to discussions and they should proceed there, otherwise it can be filed as an issue<p>- And importantly, close issues you don&#x27;t intend to address, and a short explainer why (even if its just &#x27;no longer relevant&#x27; or &#x27;is not going to be considered, if requested open a new *discussion etc, make some boilerplate)<p>That makes sense to me at least. I know discussions isn&#x27;t perfect (far from it) however it cuts down the clutter on the issue tracker and makes it much easier I think to engage with the community (issues have this &#x27;binding&#x27; status a lot of the times that discussions implicitly don&#x27;t, so its much safer to spitball IMHO)')
