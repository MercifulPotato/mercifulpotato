My biggest concern about the future right now is the economy. I think we&#x27;ve made great progress in the last several decades breaking glass ceilings for women and minorities in the workforce and made some fantastic, huge technological breakthroughs. But I think a side effect of this is fewer jobs (from automation) and increased competition for those jobs. So I lean left on this issue -- I think we need an increase to minimum wage or a basic income or anything that gives more support for the unemployed. Worst case in my mind, they take advantage of this system and remove themselves from the labor pool making job applicants more competitive. I&#x27;ll also add, with a bit of incredulity, that my conservative friend doesn&#x27;t see a gap between wealthy and poor as an issue.<p>But I&#x27;m not 100% left. I&#x27;m not for socialized healthcare -- I worry about doctor visits becoming like the DMV (though even that would be an improvement to what we have now) and I worry about hospitals charging whatever they can because it&#x27;s on the government&#x27;s paycheck (even if that is an improvement to them doing it because it&#x27;s on the insurer&#x27;s paycheck) -- because I think there are better fixes to healthcare that don&#x27;t require it being provided by the government.<p>On a more meta-level, I think there are far more political ideologies than just left and right, that progressive democrats have forced themselves to align with establishment democrats, as how Christian conservatives have forced themselves to align with anti-establishment conservatives (there might be a better label for it). So in that light it&#x27;s ridiculous to me how, say, a progressive democrat can denounce a Christian conservative while supporting an establishment democrat when they have nearly as little in common with both.<p>Also, thank you for asking me this outright. Nobody on the internet ever has. What do you believe?')
