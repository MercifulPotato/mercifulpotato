Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25410668], score=None, time=1607891678, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409683, text='&gt; They&#x27;re not. One can&#x27;t cut taxes below zero, for starters.<p>You might want to check with the IRS, since that&#x27;s exactly what the EITC does. It&#x27;s also the de facto result when a company takes a tax loss (e.g. from deducting more expenses than it had in revenue, common for startups) and can then sell the tax loss to another company to offset its tax burden.<p>&gt; Tax cuts didn&#x27;t build the Hoover dam, the interstate highway system, nor send a man to the Moon.<p>As opposed to Tesla&#x27;s plant at Niagara Falls, or the various privately-owned rail networks in the world, or SpaceX?<p>&gt; The day that the US government announces that they&#x27;ll buy 100 million masks a month for a strategic reserve or replace all of the mobile devices for all federal employees, as long as they&#x27;re at at most a 50% premium over the cheapest option and are fully traceable from raw materials to finished product as being fully built in the US and allied countries, is the day that people will start investigating if it&#x27;s possible to do so, and start trying to do so if it&#x27;s possible.<p>But that&#x27;s actually more expensive, and less productive, than just making it more cost effective to manufacture things domestically than somewhere else, because domestic production has low taxes and efficient regulations and production in countries that engage in currency manipulation or have inadequate environmental protections are subject to tariffs.<p>&gt; It takes two to tango.<p>That&#x27;s the <i>problem</i>. It doesn&#x27;t matter how willing one side is to negotiate if Democrats are too busy fabricating lies about Russia collusion to come to the table. Compromise requires <i>both</i> sides to be reasonable.')
