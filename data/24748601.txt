This seems like a classic case of lack of composability in Python: you need a different CSV parser for each and every application even though the core logic of parsing the CSV format is the same. This is because anything fast has to be implemented in very concrete, specialized C code. In Julia, you can write something generic and let the compiler specialize it for you, so you get many different ways of applying the same thing for free.')
