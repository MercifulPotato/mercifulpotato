Maybe we don&#x27;t want them to have ACKs, but as long as it&#x27;s opt-in, is that not enough for the upper layers?<p>&gt; Besides that the crypto and handshake parts also need streams with guaranteed delivery and ordering, since they carry TLS stream data.<p>QUIC packets are individually encrypted so more metadata can be encrypted too. And I don&#x27;t think connection establishment uses any sort of stream abstraction either since people speak of n-packet handshakes?')
