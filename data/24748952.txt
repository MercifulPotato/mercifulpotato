In the last 2 months I have been getting weekly something like 1-2 calls in the beginning and now, this week almost 10 calls from all kinds of numbers from various german numbers. Looking into them (online, people reporting these calls, all are ads and all kind of bullsh*t).<p>I don&#x27;t share my number, it was quite private, I never got these calls, maybe I had 5 calls in 5 YEARS, now I get more than that in one day. Why is this, I think? A lot of restaurants use lists and then just pass them to guests at the tables or make them visible for everyone writing on them. Recently there are places that offer QR codes and individual forms, and it gets better, but having these lists visible, anyone that is at the restaurant can just take a picture of the whole list.<p>I could say that I entered a different name some time ago and I got a spam call asking &quot;Is this different name?&quot;, but that would be illegal and I would get a fine. :)')
