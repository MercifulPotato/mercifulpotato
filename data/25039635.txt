Two small suggestions:<p>- Have an option to start camera&#x2F;mic turned off, and make it clear that your camera feed will be visible to people you approach. My own camera view and mic (and the option to turn them off) are also kind of easy to miss on my 27&quot; screen.<p>- If I press and hold, say, S and then tap D, the avatar starts moving right and doesn&#x27;t stop moving right until I release S. I&#x27;d expect it to continue moving downward when I release D.')
