Bloc, lib, con, ndp and green not to mention another protest right party.  A few years ago the cons were split into two parties.<p>Rarely outside of BC does lib-ndp vote split work in the con favour and often works the other way for the lib in Quebec with the bloc.<p>The ndp and lib seem like they are progressive and the idea that one should vote for the other to block the cons misses the differences.  And your vote is worth a few dollars so vote for what you want... because funding matters.')
