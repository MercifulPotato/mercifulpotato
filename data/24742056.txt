The guy has some state of the art test equipment and thoroughly tests equipment that people send in to be tested.  Some of the results are really suprising, like a $14K DAC that was, from a performance standpoint, just garbage.  He&#x27;ll test almost anything, including the &quot;audiophile network switch&quot; that (surprise!) didn&#x27;t do anything.  If you&#x27;re into this space his tests are almost always interesting.')
