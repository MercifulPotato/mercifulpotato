That is so vague (and non-binding in any case) that I am kind of surprised they didn&#x27;t get 99%, with only the CEO&#x27;s of office space subleasing companies not joining in.<p>I have WFH for several years now, I&#x27;m not opposed to it, but the idea that it&#x27;s going to become the &quot;new normal&quot; seems, at the least, premature.  My guess is that the long-term impact will be less than currently expected.')
