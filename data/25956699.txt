Metahumor and offensive words are nothing new. This confusing humor is alongside others like 4chan. When <i>normal</i> people see that kind of humor and culture they are immediately offended because it doesn&#x27;t really match anything in reality. Normal people don&#x27;t go around using those words that way unless they&#x27;re 13. While it&#x27;s possible an influx of new users drives up the number of people joining, thus creating a squeeze on the number of people learning to adapt to that culture and thusly carrying that humor too far, this is nothing out of the ordinary in the world other than that Facebook now deems those words hate speech (assuming what people are commenting on is what they got banned for.)<p>There are likely people <i>on this forum</i> who would reject that culture because of their ideals. Those words fit right into a category called &quot;ableism&quot; whether you use them for humor or not. You&#x27;re not fighting some hedge companies paid troll machines or whatever else you can dream up. What&#x27;s happening to WSBs is more tantamount to what happened to the internet and many small forums back in the late 2000s when Facebook and Twitter signed on millions of people who had never used the internet before. What you&#x27;re fighting is people who <i>want</i> the internet to reflect reality.')
