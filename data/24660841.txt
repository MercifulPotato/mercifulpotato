I&#x27;m not completely clear what &quot;growth hacking&quot; means, but I definitely think SEO crosses a line (basically hacking google&#x27;s algorithm to mislead them and their customers). Even worse would be things like paying for fake traffic to drive up ad revenue. People generally understand there is a line between legitimate business and scamming people, even when greed&#x2F;desperation drives them to bend the rules somewhat and rationalize it.')
