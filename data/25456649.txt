I can tell you, the regulations on the retail side of finance are nonsense and help no one.<p>Like gun control, bad actors don&#x27;t care about your laws.  The only people who are regulated are the honest ones, and the amount of regulation can put them out of business, or even dissuade them from being has honest as they&#x27;d like.<p>If RH lied about how they&#x27;re compensated, then they are certainly guilty, but the harm to consumers is just the tip of the iceberg.  Consider how much RH has harmed all the honest financial advisors who had to compete with a &quot;free&quot; service that hides their cost to consumers.<p>If I had lied to one client about how I was compensated, bye bye license.')
