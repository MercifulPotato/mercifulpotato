Once there is a mechanism to verify the identity of the other party, those two parties don’t need the platform to do end to end encryption. Each party generates a public&#x2F;private key pair, does some double encryption magic, and it’s all over. The platform doing this is a convenience. The platform storing this is just giving the government a convenient place to decrypt it once they have coerced the keys from one or more of the parties. I wonder how that would fly with the citizens of other countries that use Signal? Would they be comfortable with the US government reading their messages?<p>Why is the left now so into policies that they decry when done in other countries: social scoring, travel bans, censorship? What is going on? Is the US going through it’s version of China’s Cultural Revolution?')
