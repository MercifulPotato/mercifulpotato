I know this is going to sound like parody or satire, but I swear I&#x27;m being sincere: this is a huge deal for applying to FAANG (and companies that do FAANG interviews) and leetcoding in Swift.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly painful and off-putting to re-implement stuff you get for free in Python and Java when you&#x27;re trying to learn everything else at the same time. Some companies give you the option to use whatever you want if you&#x27;re applying for an iOS position (Google), and some don&#x27;t (Apple, Facebook). But either way, if you do iOS, odds are you spend 99% of your time at work writing Swift and&#x2F;or Objective-C, which means you&#x27;ll have to put in extra effort in learning&#x2F;re-learning Python or Java.<p>This is especially great for string algorithm problems. Manipulating strings in Swift in an interview is a traumatic experience if you haven&#x27;t drilled it repeatedly, and you rarely need to do it during Real Work if you have functional backend developers.')
