As someone in a &quot;manager&quot;-ish position though, termination sounds a little on the extreme side considering healthcare is strained to the breaking point currently.  people get in a rush sometimes.<p>I once caught an employee i hired a few years back watering down something called DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) with tap water.  DEF is extremely critical in modern trucks as it arrests and reduces gasses and chemicals from diesel exhaust that directly contribute to climate change and global warming.  Newer trucks wont even shift into drive without it.  When i asked him why he was ruining all our DEF he pointed out that his last employer did this routinely to get customers in and out faster and reduce costs.  Instead of firing him I explained how the diesel particulate filter works, and why adding tap water would foul it.')
