How would “.toupper()” work on a raw set of bytes, which would either contain an MP3 file or UTF8 encoded text?<p>Every single operation on a string-that-might-not-be-a-string-really would have to be fallible, which is a terrible interface to have for the happy path.<p>How would slicing work? I want the first 4 characters of a given string. That’s completely meaningless without an encoding (not that it means much with it).<p>How would concatenation work? I’m not saying Python does this, but concatenation two graphemes together doesn’t necessarily create a string with len() == 2.<p>How would “.startswith()” work with regards to grapheme clusters?<p>Text is different from bytes. There’s extra meaning and information attached to an arbitrary stream of 1s and 0s that allows you to do things you wouldn’t have been able to do if your base type is “just bytes”.<p>Sure you could make all of these return garbage if your “string” is actually an mp3 file, aka the JavaScript way, but... why?')
