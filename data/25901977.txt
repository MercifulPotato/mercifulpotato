When X% of people have Telegram, Whatsapp and Signal installed, then it becomes a non-issue to have Signal only sticklers.<p>&gt;  The only real chance here is that since this is all about closed groups that network effects aren&#x27;t so huge, so a considerable exodus without actual terminal velocity is possible.<p>This is my experience so far. I think you&#x27;re right that the network effect is very fragmented and micro. In my case the few active groups that I value have migrated, the rest don&#x27;t care and could email me or sms me and I&#x27;ve seen sufficient migration to Signal, signalling that moving from 1 to 4 might be viable.')
