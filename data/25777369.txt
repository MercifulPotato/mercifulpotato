IE 11 is no longer supported.  All major browsers are evergreen and, except for some small edge cases that jQuery didn&#x27;t really support anyways, they are pretty much completely unified in the APIs they support.  If you are really worried about that 1% difference, then you can use tools like babel to cover those cases.<p>The only reason to reach for jQuery, IMO, is familiarity.  If you don&#x27;t want a framework, then just write vanilla js.')
