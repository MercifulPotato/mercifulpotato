Price of consoles would go up and price of games would come down. Net result for the consumer wouldn&#x27;t be that much different. Of course, the whole dynamics of game consoles business would change much more than this simplified example, but all in all it probably wouldn&#x27;t be worse, just different.<p>However, there isn&#x27;t just an option to completely eliminate walled gardens. There are many possibilities, like limiting what rules are legal, or requiring that equal rules&#x2F;fees apply to all developers, or limiting max fees, or allowing small fee to be charged even if official store is not used, or requirement that all apps that are available via 3rd party stores are also available on the official store and that base price is the same (markup being the only variable)... I think platform creator should still be acknowledged in some way, just not by having a complete and total control over the platform.')
