I think I originally computed from 20 MB&#x2F;min which I just found by searching on the internet randomly.<p>Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a consistent number on the amount of data held by the Library of Congress, so how about Wikipedia instead? Wikipedia says Wikipedia is 18.9 GB compressed [1], so 200 TB &#x2F; 18.9 GB = 10582 Wikipedias. Wikipedia says a Wikipedia would be ~2821 Encyclopedia Britannica volumes which are ~1000 pages each, so this would in total constitute ~30,000,000 volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica exfiltrated before discovery. Hardly a sizeable amount of data.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia</a>')
