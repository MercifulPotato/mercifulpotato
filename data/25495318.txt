This is sad news but not surprising. Mobile phones have gotten good enough that you don&#x27;t need a DSLR anymore to take &quot;nice pictures.&quot; All the computational photography to create fake bokeh, good low-light photos, etc. pretty much ate up all the demand for DSLR.<p>If you look at the photos on a big monitor, you can spot the difference between a DSLR and smartphone. But on a smartphone screen, where 95% of the photos are viewed these days, the difference is negligible. Heck my wife recently printed out 4x6 prints of her smartphone photos and they looked pretty good too.<p>I&#x27;ve recently got a iPhone 12 Pro, and it&#x27;s good enough that I&#x27;m thinking of selling my Fuji X100V. DSLRs used to be accessible for amateurs. But unless you need specific capabilities (strobe usage, fast sport shooting, ultra-telephoto, etc), most people don&#x27;t need to buy a DSLR if you have a decent smart phones these days.')
