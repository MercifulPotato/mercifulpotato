This reviewer is perfectly proud of the fact that a newbie doesn&#x27;t stand a chance against a veteran player.<p>That&#x27;s basically true for <i>any</i> game where there&#x27;s a wide range of possible skill levels.  The question is -- how much fun is it, as a beginner, to play against an expert, knowing that you&#x27;re probably not going to win?<p>Most games like this (chess, Starcraft, etc), it&#x27;s not fun at all: the core strategy is to damage your opponent&#x27;s ability to play and execute their strategy.<p>Losing in Dominion isn&#x27;t nearly so bad.  A beginner can look at the cards, form a strategy, and see their deck beginning to start to work (or see that it doesn&#x27;t work) before the game ends.  That means you can still try things and have a sense of satisfaction, even if you end up losing.<p>If you&#x27;re the competitive type who can&#x27;t have fun if you&#x27;re not going to win, then sure, playing someone at a much higher skill level isn&#x27;t going to work.  But lots of people don&#x27;t mind losing if the process isn&#x27;t crushing &#x2F; humiliating  like chess, and in those situations, Dominion is a pretty good game.  I know a couple where the husband is really into board games, and the wife thinks games are kind of fun but not super-serious; Dominion is one of their go-to games, because he can minmax to his hearts content while still making it fun for her.')
