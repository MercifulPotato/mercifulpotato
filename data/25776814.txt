The Model S is my favorite looking Tesla that&#x27;s currently in production, and that&#x27;s because the proportions are right, and the front bumper isn&#x27;t one giant expanse of plastic, but is instead broken up by a faux grille. The Model Y and X look like unattractive blobs with poor proportions (in fairness, all crossovers look like this), and the 3, X, and Y all have the front bumper that is just an ugly expanse of plastic that has no visual breakup.')
