They bet everything on their 10nm process - which has greater transistor density than TSMC&#x27;s 7nm process - and they lost.<p>Intel flew too close to the sun and their wings melted.<p>The vitriol everyone has for them is based on the fact they could have been pumping out cheap 4 &#x2F; 6 &#x2F; 8 core chips for people, but instead held the entire world of computing at basically quad-core CPU level for the better part of a decade.<p>And I share that vitriol. I&#x27;m happy they&#x27;re suffering and are in pain. I hope the same thing happens to NVIDIA. I hope the same thing happens to AMD. I <i>relish</i> when a company and when people are made to suffer when they hold back our technological process in the name of fucking quarterly profits.')
