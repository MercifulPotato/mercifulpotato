The history on Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t mention them having moved and still has the &quot;Tech companies from the Netherlands&quot; category (not sure if that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re still originally from there, or because the category was never removed).<p>Not sure blocking Iran would have happened if they hadn&#x27;t opened a corp overseas.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kvk.nl&#x2F;orderstraat&#x2F;product-kiezen&#x2F;?kvknummer=600348310000" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kvk.nl&#x2F;orderstraat&#x2F;product-kiezen&#x2F;?kvknummer=600...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=GitLab&amp;diff=826856844&amp;oldid=825392993" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=GitLab&amp;diff=82685...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;</a><p>Edit: slightly older, 2017 reference of USA headquarters <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;6J-gitlab-s-secret-to-managing-160-employees-in-160-locations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;6J-gitlab-s-secret-to-ma...</a><p>Editv2: the TOS still says that the intellectual property is with GitLab B.V. but the branding page says the trademark is held by GitLab Inc. The privacy policy is not GDPR-complaint (on multiple counts and I haven&#x27;t even read it, just spotted some things like implicit+non-opt-outable consent while looking for who is the data controller) and doesn&#x27;t mention who the data controller is. It does make clear that all data goes to the USA and you better suck it up. Looks like they fully embraced all of the USA&#x27;s freedoms including censorship and privacy violations under their home country&#x27;s law. I&#x27;m giving up searching for more info about the move at this point: there is no news article in HN search, the blog search requires me to accept more tracking which (after seeing the illegal-in-the-EU privacy policy) I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to engage in, and the website seems to have had mixed mentions of B.V. and Inc. as of 2016.')
