I can&#x27;t actually remember the last time my Windows workstation crashed outright (if ever?) but my Mac locks up at least 2-3 times per week. I also have to be extremely careful to avoid high memory pressure under Big Sur now, otherwise Finder spirals into a restart loop that can only be fixed with a hard reset. I also had to give up my Mac Thunderbolt setup because I&#x27;ve been fighting the same Thunderbolt crash that many people have been complaining about since Catalina was released in 2019 ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rachelbythebay.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;gameover&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rachelbythebay.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;16&#x2F;gameover&#x2F;</a> ).<p>Meanwhile, my Windows machine just keeps chugging along, drama free. All of my hardware and peripherals work just fine with it, but I often have to play the plug-unplug game with audio peripherals until video playback works on my Mac.<p>Five years ago I never would have guessed I&#x27;d be writing an HN comment praising my Windows machine and lamenting all of the issues with my Mac, but here we are. It&#x27;s downright depressing to think of all the time I&#x27;ve lost in the past year waiting for my MacBook to reboot or replugging USB cables until everything works after I wake it from sleep.')
