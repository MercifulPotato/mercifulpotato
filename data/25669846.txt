So the capitol police isn&#x27;t staffed and doesn’t plan for a situation where they need to do both of these things?<p>What struck me the most is that the rioters seem like just a few hundred&#x2F;thousand. Definitely scary but should have been able to be controlled by law enforcement. It wasn’t a million people or a zombie horde.<p>Their web site [0] says they have 2,300 officers and staff. So even if only half are officers it seems like 1,150 armed, trained capitol police should be able to control a mob of this size.<p>Certainly rioters trying to stage a coup is a rare event but seems like something that the capitol police should have contingency plans for.<p>Them saying that they had to choose between evacuating lawmakers and protecting the building seems like they need a lot of help planning.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uscp.gov&#x2F;media-center&#x2F;uscp-fast-facts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uscp.gov&#x2F;media-center&#x2F;uscp-fast-facts</a>')
