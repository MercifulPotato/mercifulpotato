You&#x27;ll find that they&#x27;re, by and large, decent people with the same basic motivations as you. ...<p>This sort of cuts both ways, but there has been a marked change in recent years<p>From my personal experience in the US, most people avoid talking about politics but once you get a die hard supporter of the current mainstream Republican party to start the stereotypes mostly hold up (there are also diverse viewpoints within the party, which unfortunately are now labeled as &quot;RINO&quot; by the party&#x27;s mainstream voices). The supposed similarities seem to be more superficial and sometimes only justification for other deeply held beliefs.<p>Them calling people they disagree with &quot;out of touch&quot; seems to be more ingrained dogma than anything else since it ignores that the views they disagree with aren&#x27;t limited to some &quot;coastal elite,&quot; but are widely held by people across the entire country, including their own neighbors. Even more so when they dismiss other s within their own party who hold different viewpoints than them as being &quot;RINOs&quot; who are somehow not true Republicans.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that the US&#x27;s Democratic party has members who are just as dogmatic, but I&#x27;ve personally observed a lot less of this behavior coming from the die hard members of that party.<p>&gt; ... Trying to force your progressive values onto everyone via some sort of bizarre doctrine of cultural dilution is unbelievably wrong-headed.<p>Circling back to superficial similarities, many who are in opposition to the Republican party view Republicans as trying to force conservative and religious culture and views onto them. There is a debate between conservative stances which try to to preserve some form of the status quo in the US vs more liberal stances that argue that some of the ways in which someone can exercise individual freedoms (a local maxima of freedom) limits other people&#x27;s individual freedom (a global maxima of freedom)')
