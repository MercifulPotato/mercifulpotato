The trade-off is that ctrl is almost exclusively used for unix-y thing, and all the usual GUI-y things use Cmd. Using a shell is just painful for me in anything other than macOS for that reason alone.<p>Incidentally, because of the pervasive support for readline shortcuts in all text inputs, del is just ctrl-D.')
