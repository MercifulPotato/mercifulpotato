As an example of an extreme case one might say &quot;you are wrong&quot;, placing all the responsibility on the other. It is hard to avoid placing responsibility, but it is easy to accept responsibility, so no pecking order is threatened, everyone is happy.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that I could give an example correctly, because English is not my native language, so I could fail to communicate subtle shades of meaning, but I try nevertheless.<p>&quot;I see that you&#x27;ve chosen X as a decision, and I&#x27;m not sure why. I think, you&#x27;ve chosen X over Y, because of A, B and C, am I right?&quot;<p>And I&#x27;d start small. Explicitly not challenging decisions of superiors. Asking questions afterwards, when it is certainly late to change decision (so no one tempted to think, that I&#x27;m trying to make it my way). Making sure that a person asked would see me as a newbie seeking wisdom: &quot;I&#x27;m eager to agree with you, but I need to understand first&quot;. Choosing time when people asked do not need to stop doing some very important stuff to answer my questions. And so on. I&#x27;d poke the situation cautiously and watch what would happen. Hopefully I&#x27;d find people who are nice enough to allow me to ask them countless questions, to discuss decisions, and hopefully I&#x27;d find ways to ask questions which work without undesired social side-effects.')
