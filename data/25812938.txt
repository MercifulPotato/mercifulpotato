Leaving aside how ill-defined such a standard is, if that were the bar, Twitter would have to remove most of its users.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not taking a position here, but the legions of strawmen being propped up to misrepresent one side of the discussion isn&#x27;t helping anyone (or one could say, &quot;is degrading the service for other users&quot;).')
