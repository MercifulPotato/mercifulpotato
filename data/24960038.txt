(My American Aunt has always insisted SMS was obscenely expensive and refused to use it to communicate.)<p>Most common plans that I know of have unlimited SMS&#x2F;MMS&#x2F;Phone calls (unless you get a really cheap one).<p>&gt; Do you get Data as standard with the plan? (Eg is it that people can&#x27;t easily use WhatsApp because they don&#x27;t have data when out and about or is it that people just won&#x27;t agree which IP product to use in the first place?)<p>Data is generally standard with a plan. SOme only give you a limited allotment, and some give you some version of &quot;unlimited&quot; (i.e. if you use too much they will start to throttle you).')
