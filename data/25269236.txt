I suspect that I have exactly the right use case for this.<p>The two main issues with running SQL Server are (1) you have to license all the cores on a system and (2) the standard license only recognizes up to 64GB RAM.  So I actually wound up buying a 3GHz single-socket system for around $10K to save $20K on the SQL license.<p>With this, I can move a couple of the big DBs to another system that has 32 Cores with 256GB RAM and the entire DB will fit in memory, put in 5GB ethernet, and gain a tremendous amount of performance.<p>But, more importantly, I can migrate the workload on a case-by-case basis.  Human costs always dwarf my software and hardware costs.')
