I do a tiny bit of this.<p>Mostly, I invest in companies whose products I&#x27;d love to buy. I buy Apple gear, I bought a Tesla, I buy stuff on Amazon all the time and I love CloudFlare. Simply following the products I&#x27;d like to buy in the future and ignoring P&#x2F;E ratios and ignoring the screams of much more experienced investors (who all hated TSLA because &quot;they lose so much money!&quot;) has worked out gang-busters.<p>I find it hard to square the &quot;value investing&quot; concept with the idea of following my own product instincts. What publicly traded company has products people DESPERATELY want, but fails to make profits eventually? Are there... any? That&#x27;s a death only start-ups who don&#x27;t know enough VCs ever face these days. There is close to unlimited liquid cash in the world - but there are very very few interesting products.')
