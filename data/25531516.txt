It&#x27;s less predictable day to day but long term it better aligns incentives between the winning customers and the exchange. They don&#x27;t really kick people off unless they&#x27;re exploiting bugs in the exchange or engaged in illegal activity. They certainly won&#x27;t ban you for winning on the exchange.')
