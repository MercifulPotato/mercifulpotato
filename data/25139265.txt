Note that the distribution doesn&#x27;t even need to be very even--let&#x27;s say each nation is capped at 100 warheads and Russia has 1000 interceptors and the US has 10000--the US doesn&#x27;t have much leverage on Russia despite an order of magnitude more interceptors. So as long as all of the interceptors aren&#x27;t concentrated on one side of an engagement (and it would be very unlikely for this to be the case for any enduring period of time) all is well.<p>And of course, there&#x27;s the additional deterrent of a globalized economy. Most nuclear countries depend on the global economy and have a strong incentive not to devastate it by way of nuclear warfare. The odds of an isolationist country like NK owning all of the interceptors is pretty low IMO.')
