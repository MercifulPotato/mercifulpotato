It&#x27;s his believe that race <i>is</i> a core issue hurting the American soul these days, and that he is committing the paper of record to cover the topic in proportion to its significance.<p>Edit: I previously included a paragraph here pointing to this issue being brought up even though it&#x27;s one among many as evidence for race being a top issue. But reading some past comment of yours, you seem more reasonable than I expected, on that issue and in general.<p>Our disagreement may just be smaller than it appears, or concern &quot;the media&quot; more than the issue of race. If one were to stipulate that BLM was a major story, and maybe even that some of the President-unelect&#x27;s words and deeds can be interpreted as not entirely lacking a resemblance with something that may, in a certain light, be considered to possibly fall under the umbrella of &quot;being a racist&quot;, or even just that he was frequently misinterpreted in such a way by a bit more than half of the population... then race is, de facto, a major issue. Add to that some coverage that&#x27;s been criticised as tone-deaf, and my starting point of considering the Times to not be the worst, and I think there&#x27;s a good-faith interpretation of Banquet&#x27;s intentions.<p>If, instead, you believe journalism in general, and the Times specifically, have been circling the drain for decades, it may sound different.')
