Potentially a lot more, if there&#x27;s prospects to alter&#x2F;expand ourselves into being capable of contemplating&#x2F;experiencing more complicated ideas and scenarios beyond the scope of our current bodies.<p>It just seems like making the best of a bad situation.  If I imagine two futures, one where people get old and decrepit, live in terrible pain, and die at 80, for such a stupid reason as that they&#x27;re produced by a blind-idiot-god process that doesn&#x27;t need them as more than a disposable fuck&#x2F;murderbot.  And this keeps happening till an asteroid hits and they all die.<p>And another where they never <i>have</i> to go away and can explore the furthest reaches of what they can be, until, eventually, after an incredible amount of time, we have a last mournful party and turn off the lights across the cosmos.<p>The second story&#x27;s sad!  But not as sad and ugly as the first, and it might make life coming into being have been worth it, on balance.<p>I heard someone say, once, that the growth of humanity could grant us purer, more complete, and more perfect death than nature alone would deign to give us.<p>I&#x27;d rather die with an eon of friends at my side, having lived a few millenia as a walrus, than practically stillborn here and now.')
