My case is a little different as it was probably caused by a brain injury, but I would advise you to at least try it out for a few weeks.<p>The difference in how I feel on vs. off testosterone is pretty astounding. I’m in a better mood, have vastly more energy and ambition, and actually have a sex drive.<p>If you do try it go straight for the injections - a lot of guys don’t fee right on the gel. I had estrogen issues when I was on it, personally.')
