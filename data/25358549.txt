It has various sites in Sweden, but so have some US companies, without any of them being considered as Swedish.<p>Even the Eastern Block countries, during the Soviet hegemony, produced more diverse semiconductor devices than ever done in Sweden.<p>The most technically advanced countries in semiconductors in Europe, before the global fashion of mergers, acquisitions and spin-offs that obliterated most traditional semiconductor companies starting around 1999, were (in no particular order):<p>Netherlands (Philips)\nGermany (Siemens)\nFrance (Thomson CSF)\nItaly (SGS-ATES)\nUK (Plessey and a few others)<p>Relics of the former European semiconductor companies can be found now mostly in Infineon, NXP and ST, but all these present companies are the results of long chains of mergers and acquisitions of various companies spread all over the world, so it is difficult to define them as belonging to Europe, US or to any other specific country or group of countries.')
