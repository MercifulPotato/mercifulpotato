By providing better payment options. I frankly don&#x27;t know anyone who still uses checks for anything, and that&#x27;s probably with good reason. Instead of sending a check, the payer could simply transfer money.<p>Though it would be nice if you could pay by having the bank hold the money in escrow and releasing it upon proof of delivery.
