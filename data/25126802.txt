So by this reasoning, I need to study quantum mechanics; it would only take a few weekends of focused study to understand the Schrodinger Equation etc.<p>These things fall into the &quot;Don&#x27;t need to know&quot; category because we as a species have made very effective user interfaces to them whereby you really need to know almost nothing about their internals to use them.<p>The ideal version control system would work like a mouse or a monitor. Completely intuitive, just worksâ„¢.')
