I taught myself to do small things and I learned that a thing called BASIC existed but I didn&#x27;t actually have much use for it.<p>Then one day I heard that a command called &quot;win&quot; existed, so typed it in and suddenly - and I remember the absolute excitement of that moment as if it was today and I am getting giddy just writing it down - the black and white screen exploded into the colors that is the windows for workgroup startup screen. Suddenly the mouse that came with it made <i>sense</i>!<p>Pretty sure that is the single most important event that steered me onto the path I have taken.<p>Then later I had PentiumIII running windows2000 and from somewhere aquired an ISDN card, put it in, rebooted, installed drivers, shut down to go to sleep, remembered I wanted to read something, booted up, shut down again, went to sleep, booted again in the morning only to be greeted by a bluescreen, that I wasn&#x27;t able to fix - I would have to re-install Windows.<p>But I remembered that I had bought magazine that had something called &quot;NetBSD&quot; on a CD, so I thought I&#x27;d give that a go, and since then I have used the odd binarblobdriver, but my operating systems have been thoroughly open source and I&#x27;ve grown up to be a programmer - probably seeded from trying to manually install all dependency of X11 before I learned that pkgsrc is a &quot;package manager&quot;.<p>But that splash of color really impressed me, and I am continued to be impressed how a machine that basically only knows how to turn on or off tiny little lamps in a grid took over the entire world.')
