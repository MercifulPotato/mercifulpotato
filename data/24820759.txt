If anything it makes it worse. Instead of dealing with professional community managers operating with clear rules, you are at the mercy of some random nerd running a server from his mom&#x27;s basement. You can run your own instance, but then you&#x27;re just talking to yourself. Nothing is stopping you from building your own Twitter, hell we had blogs for years before Twitter. You go to Twitter so you don&#x27;t have to promote yourself to get an audience, and abiding by Twitter&#x27;s censorship policies is the cost of admission.')
