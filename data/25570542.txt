Some people will care but most people will continue to be unable to tell the difference between an Airbus and a Boeing and generally not have type numbers, incident history, etc. memorized. Most of the bad press is already ancient history for the general public.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s not a lot of flying happening currently anyway. So, good moment to do this. By the time traffic picks up again, the fixed model will have months&#x2F;years incident free flights behind it.<p>But I agree, it will be interesting of the general public cares at all for anything else than $&#x2F;flight, which is the reason why cattle class is a thing: people are happy to sacrifice comfort, dignity, etc. to save a few dollars on a flight.')
