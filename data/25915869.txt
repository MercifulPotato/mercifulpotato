It&#x27;s luck if you make just one or two trades.<p>In the long run, statistical iterations (that you have modeled&#x2F;researched correctly) will give you positive returns with a very high confidence.<p>Situations like in this post are obviously not that.   I have a trading strategy that I execute over hundreds of trades per year based upon financial modeling and financial statement analysis.  There&#x27;s a little luck involved, but over many trades, the luck aspect cancels itself out.<p>It&#x27;s like rolling the dice.  If you bet on getting a certain number, and roll once, it&#x27;s luck.  If you bet on averaging a certain number and roll 1000 times, there&#x27;s virtually no luck at all.')
