HN has actual discussions and is, for the most part, politically neutral. That is, while some discussions will have a political component to them, such as discussing tech censorship, no opinions are being buried for simply existing &quot;on the other side.&quot;<p>While being a free speech advocate is political, it does not fit into the US left&#x2F;right political structure. So I don&#x27;t see opposing the censorship of political speech as being &quot;the other side&#x27;s politics.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s funny because I clearly remember when it was the other side with a &quot;moral majority&quot; who was trying to silence all opposing views. I was against it then as well. I think we should all be against authoritarianism no matter which political party we support. As I see it authoritarianism has led to suffering of the common people almost every time.')
