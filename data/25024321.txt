His response was to:<p>1. Say that he didn&#x27;t know who the Proud Boys are. Even the most generous interpretation of this doesn&#x27;t look good. He was asked to denounce them during the debate and either (a) attempted to do so (fumbling the response) without knowing who they were or (b) it was an intentional dodge â€” and either way, he didn&#x27;t follow up with his staff to learn more.<p>2. Say that they need to &quot;stand down&quot; and &quot;let law enforcement do their work&quot;, but not condemn them (i.e., still fall short of the ask during the debate, when given a chance to correct the fumbled response).<p>3. Dodge an explicit question about whether he misspoke when he said &quot;stand by&quot; (again, failing to fully correct the fumbled response).<p>4. Continue to shift away from criticism of right-wing groups to left-wing groups.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;briefings-statements&#x2F;remarks-president-trump-marine-one-departure-093020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;briefings-statements&#x2F;remarks-pres...</a><p>&gt; Painting it as some siren call for white supremacist supporters to rise up and take the nation by force is just as disingenuous and hypocritical as Trump himself.<p>When right-wing groups interpret it as a siren call and he fails to unequivocally correct that interpretation, it&#x27;s not disingenuous to be concerned.')
