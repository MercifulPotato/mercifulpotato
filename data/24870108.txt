There&#x27;s a long rant bubbling up about AEM, but I&#x27;ll resist the temptation and just say a suitable 4-letter word, instead.<p>Their products cost a <i>fortune</i> and for the privilege of forking over your hard-earned money, the company does things like this.  I still <i>own</i> a license for one of the older versions of Photoshop post-Activation.  I corrected it in a manner that would probably qualify as &quot;cracking it&quot; before ever activating after having run into grief with the product at my day job (at the time).  Anymore, if there&#x27;s a reasonable alternative, that&#x27;s the kind of stupid I won&#x27;t spend my money on.')
