Now you need to add the time to saturation (TTS) which gives you how long the beam has to sit on the phosphor to achieve the maximum amount of light. Different tubes do this differently from moderating the energy in the beam itself to modulating &quot;time on spot&quot;.<p>What you end up with at the end of all this research is a really nice ideas of the &quot;hard bits&quot; around engineering a CRT for a particular application. When we looked at CRTs in depth in the EE program one of the things that came across was how so many of the things you had to vary were interconnected. The professor suggested that was why there were so many different models to choose from, even when they were all the same form factor.<p>Thanks for the links too, I&#x27;ve added the bunkerofdoom one to my collection.')
