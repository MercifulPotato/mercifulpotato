We&#x27;re offering minimum guaranteed revenue</i><p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but since you&#x27;re part of YC, you may want to reach out to your legal mentors and ask if this post&#x2F;advertisement&#x2F;promotion satisfies the SEC&#x27;s Howey Test[1] due to HN having a material portion of US participants some of whom may not be accredited investors and HN is publicly readable.<p>The US legal case SEC vs. Howey[2] uses 4 prongs to determine whether an offer is an &quot;investment contract&quot;, namely &quot;a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.&quot;<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re satisfying all 4 prongs of the Howey Test by offering: a) a purchase contract for a Wifi Dabba; b) investing funds in Wifi Dabba; c) expectation of profits via &quot;minimum guaranteed revenue&quot;; d) from the efforts of the promoter, Wifi Dabba.<p>Many 2017 cryptoasset tokens tried to raise money via token sales to US investors which the SEC classified as unregistered securities offerings which violate the Securities Act[3]. The SEC has had varying success going after organizations that offered unregistered securities offerings, but I don&#x27;t think you (nor YC) would want that legal hassle.<p>Based on your website and explanation, Wifi Dabba&#x27;s mission sounds exemplary and a net-positive to democratize connectivity in India. Hence, I&#x27;m really rooting for Wifi Dabba and hope that you&#x27;ve spoken to a US legal advisor or YC legal mentor.<p>EDIT: You mention on your website that you&#x27;re a Delaware entity with an office in California, which implies that you are really bound by US jurisdiction + potential US investors. Please seek legal counsel.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;h&#x2F;howey-test.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;h&#x2F;howey-test.asp</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co</a>.<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.govinfo.gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;COMPS-1885&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;COMPS-1885.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.govinfo.gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;COMPS-1885&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;COMPS-188...</a>')
