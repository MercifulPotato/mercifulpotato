Item(by='pqb', descendants=None, kids=[25182070], score=None, time=1606083356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181440, text='&gt; I&#x27;m over here laughing in my &quot;over an hour of CloudFormation only to have a run fail, and then a rollback fail, and have to contact AWS support&quot; life.<p>Oh, I see I am not alone in having the same experience with the AWS CloudFormation (CF) update flow. I have started feeling &quot;good enough&quot; in CF after about 6-8 months to write templates from my memory (accompanied with a documentation page). The funny thing about the CF is fact, the all people I know had working flow based on searching GitHub&#x2F;Gist over an example, edit, refine, deploy, push fixes, deploy, rinse &amp; repeat.<p>In the blogpost I have noticed mentioned Pulumi. To be honest, I have not used it yet, but I have tried AWS CDK [0]. I suppose it is AWS&#x27;s go-to solution for everybody who wants to use the CloudFormation for saving deployment stages and also have programmed templates in languages of their choice (like a TypeScript or Python). It is interesting solution that I suggest investigating if you haven&#x27;t done already. It supports &quot;importing&quot; CF templates as-is, so they can be incrementally translated to CDK.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;aws-cdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;aws-cdk</a>')
