For example, for any human rights issue X, will I speak out for X in a place that has free speech but not yet legalized X? Absolutely. Will I speak out for X in a place that I might get a $100 fine? Probably. Will I speak out for X in a place that I might get jailed or beheaded? Probably not.<p>In this case though I don&#x27;t consider it immoral to violate certain ToS terms, especially when they track and sell user data and don&#x27;t offer a clear opt-in&#x2F;out option to that, and perhaps even doubly on the sites that I actively contribute useful content to the platform in good faith, and the legal risk is extremely low.')
