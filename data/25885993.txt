Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611435439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882513, text='&gt; I think you obsess with the official numbers a little bit too much.<p>Maybe but that&#x27;s because it was that particular statement that started the discussion. The only reason I mentioned it was in response to OP&#x27;s statement:<p>&gt; [hybrids] they are about the only way to comply except pure BEVs<p>Of course it warranted the addendum &quot;on paper&quot; since in reality and according to all studies and data from any source they <i>do not</i> comply as a fleet, it&#x27;s a mathematical trick.<p>Saying that I obsess over <i>the particular point that started the discussion</i> seems a bit unnecessarily dismissive. You obsess about your <i>very</i> particular situation and your neighbor&#x27;s even if we can both agree it&#x27;s not generally applicable to the vast majority of people out there.<p>&gt; if you see somewhere that the fleet average for the XC60 T8 is just 7L&#x2F;100km then that&#x27;s frankly fantastic<p>I simply googled for websites that collect user submitted fuel consumption data and picked the median rather than the average. This data is of course very limited. And it may very well be fantastic but again, the whole point of my interjection was that official numbers are fake and from the data I do have access to fuel consumption of PHEVs is marginally better than the equivalent ICE (despite being a bit heavier). As a fleet they barely make a dent in the emission problem. But people either see this as being different from their particular situation and assume it <i>must</i> be wrong, or they realize it&#x27;s exactly their situation and don&#x27;t like it being pointed out.')
