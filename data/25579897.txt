You call working in the US &quot;indentured servitude&quot;? Really? If so, it&#x27;s a very nice kind of slavery, where lots of us can buy houses and many idiots have the time to stand in line for a PS5. If you took away the societal whim to buy the latest shoes &#x2F; rims &#x2F; playstations (which I think is temporary and only based on cheap credit) then you have a massively productive economy and still one of the highest living standards in the world. In spite of the obvious inequalities. The answer isn&#x27;t to tear down the system, it&#x27;s to get better education to more people so they stop trying to tear down the system, and start trying to make the system work better for them.')
