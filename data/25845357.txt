The bartender bursts out laughing for few sprints.<p>I mess it up as well, both in Lua and C. The key to success is to <i>not</i> calculate values by adding or subtracting them, but to use meaningful names instead. E.g. dist(a, b), holen(a, b), endidx(start, len) and so on. Forget about <i>ever</i> writing “1” in your code, point your finger and call operations out loud. It doesn’t eradicate errors, but at least elevates them to the problem domain level. Off by one is not exclusive to 1-based or 0-based, it is exclusive to thinking you’re smart enough to correctly shorten math expressions in your head every damn time.<p>(But sometimes I also feel too clever and after some thinking I’m just writing (i+l2+b+2) because it’s obvious if b already comes negative and means “from behind” in “0-based -1 is last” terms.)')
