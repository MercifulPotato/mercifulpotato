It&#x27;s also much more expensive and power hungry to stuff a bunch more DDR4 onto a tiny board, and often messes with the layout (i.e., of you need two RAM chips instead of one).<p>The rk3399 CPU on this board also dates from 2016[^1] so adjust your expectations accordingly. :)<p>[^1] It&#x27;s also a well-documented chip that&#x27;s cheap, provides a nice performance bump over an RPi, and requires fewer proprietary blobs.')
