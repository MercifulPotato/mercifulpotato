The first advice I give to anyone who wants to blog is to just use wordpress, don&#x27;t focus on the presentation, just on the content. Once you&#x27;re like 10 blog posts in, then feel free to move the content elsewhere, but not before. Anything that prevents you from writing content is friction at this point.<p>Other advice I also give: write short posts and write unfinished posts. If you wanted to write perfect 10&#x2F;10 content again and again, you should write a book instead. A blog is about low friction to write. People are interested in your thoughts, get them out there.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptologie.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptologie.net&#x2F;</a>')
