Stop mobbing people for &quot;enabling&quot; $BAD_GUYS and start praising people for catching and dismantling bad arguments even if the argument served the cause which you agree with? I am not seeing this happening much though, it&#x27;d require saint-level commitment to the quality of argument which probably not many are capable of and not many would consider a good thing to do.')
