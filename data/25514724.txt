All kinds of dark patterns (you have to remember a code you supposedly set with AT&amp;T when you first signed up that — get this — is never used for any other service). Verizon just paused my billing and then started again (presumably because the original person assisting didn’t want to have a ding on her record).<p>Sad thing is this must be effective or they would not keep doing it.<p>There used to be a service that would charge $5 just to cancel Comcast but I can’t find them anymore.')
