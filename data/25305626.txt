Item(by='rendall', descendants=None, kids=[25306492], score=None, time=1607105231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303200, text='&gt; <i>Reducing a culture to a single point of reference should self-evidently be a demeaning stereotype.</i><p>Let&#x27;s grant that premise! You are correct!<p>What does that have to do with the Dothraki, a fictional nation?<p>Remember, the <i>bailey</i> is &quot;The Dothraki is a demeaning stereotype&quot;<p>The <i>motte</i> is\n&quot;The Dothraki is historically inaccurate.&quot; or &quot;The Sioux have endured demeaning stereotypes.&quot; These are both true and uncontroversial.<p>The essayist even seems to take umbrage that the Dothraki armor looks nothing like Sioux buckskin! Would he take umbrage if they looked alike? You betcha he would.<p>The truth is, GRRM&#x27;s throwaway comment notwithstanding, the Dothraki serve an analogous role to ASOIF narrative as the Huns, Vikings, Kazakhs, Barbary pirates and Mongol raiders did to European history. Are you and the essayist seriously arguing that these ancient peoples are somehow demeaned by the freaking <i>Dothraki</i>?')
