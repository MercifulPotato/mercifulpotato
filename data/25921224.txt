Things are not well for this nation. The capitol was just stormed.<p>Those statistics are easily gamed. For one, salaries aren&#x27;t that high in the cheap COL areas and there aren&#x27;t any jobs or room for advancement in Tusla. Sorry, that&#x27;s just the facts. There are plenty of shitty places to live for cheap. But there is no hope of ever advancing or growing yourself - which is extremely important for a nation - advancement.<p>&gt; and there are still plenty of single women who aren&#x27;t spending all their time looking for someone a little bit snazzier on Tinder.<p>This is irrelevant- less people are partnering up and less people are having sex. Single women exist - they&#x27;re working and focusing on their careers, not settling down.<p>&gt; The dollar&#x27;s buying power is less than what it was 20 years ago, meaning what you earn doesn&#x27;t stretch as far as it once did. Government statistics show that while household income has been steadily increasing, it has failed to keep up with the pace of inflation. In addition, the cost of buying items like houses and automobiles has increased at a rate that outpaces the rise in inflation.<p>- From the BLS<p>So let&#x27;s be clear - it costs way more now to buy a house and a car. You need to spend 4 years not working (and not saving) and going to school to make an OK salary while taking on tens of thousands of debt (avg debt is 30k). Healthcare is extremely expensive. Computers are replacing more and more tasks. And what about people who aren&#x27;t smart enough for engineering school? Which is most?<p>Costs are rapidly outpacing gains for the common man. And we&#x27;re surprised people are anxious and don&#x27;t want to marry and have wanton sex all the time? They can barely pay the bills.')
