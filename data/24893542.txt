I agree that the way I phrased #4, sounded more like what you do in simple ear training exercises (&quot;Is this chord a major or minor?&quot;).<p>But... when I watch, say, a video of Herbie Hancock copying another player&#x27;s complex chord progression perfectly, there is clearly a harmonic+melodic version of &quot;perfect pitch&quot; for those few people who can hear music and reproduce it accurately.')
