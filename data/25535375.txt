My situations were probably edge cases in terms of how much gear was connected to a single computer, but still.<p>I think you&#x27;re right that legacy, mindshare&#x2F;knowledge etc played a big part in it, and I&#x27;m sure Windows is much better with this stuff now. Although the handful of studios I&#x27;ve been to in the last few years were still running Macs, but again maybe that&#x27;s just mindshare.<p>A funny thing I realized recently while trying to setup OBS for video conferencing on my Mac at home (I work as a teacher occasionally): There is no way out of the box to capture system audio, you either need to do it through external hardware or use a hacky solution like Loopback. On Windows, this &quot;just works&quot;.')
