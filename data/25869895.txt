It&#x27;s commonly called, &quot;tribalism&quot;.<p>And yes, <i>healthy</i> politics is conducted on the basis that human societies are tribal. Democracy is just the &quot;accounting system&quot; for competing tribal concerns.<p>Universalism, &quot;classical liberalism&quot;, etc. is an occasional side effect of &quot;healthy tribalism&quot;. It cannot be a political goal, because there are genuine contradictions in the preferences of various groups -- and they cannot be all jointly-realised.<p>Faux-universalism fails to acknowledge this an ends up preferencing the &quot;natural&quot; distribution of resources, ie., that arising from the most powerful groups (taking, competing) with the weaksest.')
