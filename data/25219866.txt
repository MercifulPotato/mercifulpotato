I originally got the birds for myself and my daughter to take care of but my wife fell in love with them and she treats them like babies, which is fine, but even when we&#x27;ve had very sick hens killing ourselves has been off the table and we&#x27;ve ended up paying vets big fees to take care of it. She wants more birds in the spring but I&#x27;m not going to go along with that unless this becomes a more serious &#x27;farmy&#x27; type situation and we become more self-sufficient with the animal care.<p>I grew up rural and have dispatched my share of animals hung around on my grandpa&#x27;s farm during meat bird processing, so I&#x27;m not squeamish. But I need a good humane way to do this that won&#x27;t upset my wife and kids.')
