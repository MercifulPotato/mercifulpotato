Item(by='ksk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607546490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363667, text='&gt;The democrats collected evidence, went to court, and lost. Russiagate, however misfounded, was legal. To imply that there were no other avenues for them to go down so they turned to voter fraud is laughable.<p>You forgot a few steps. First, they claimed there was fraud (w&#x2F;o evidence). Then they &#x27;leaked&#x27; the Steele dossier and other nonsense documents. Then, there was 24&#x2F;7 wall to wall coverage for <i>months and months</i> of it (including insane stuff like the pee tape) to manufacture consent. High profile Democrats happily went on TV expressing fake concern and repeated unproven allegations. They happily were the &#x27;inside source&#x27; to NYTimes, rollingstone, nymag, etc, etc for more ridiculous stories. Then, they wasted tax payer money knowing full well that it was bogus.<p>Respectfully, I would invite you to do the same as you ask others. Take a step back, and consider (even if you aren&#x27;t convinced) whether you&#x27;ve been had by the Dems on the most ridiculous story (if not on all of them) about Trump.')
