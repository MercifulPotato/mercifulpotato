Having a computable version of BB(n) for all n <i>does</i> solve the halting problem, which is why it&#x27;s impossible to compute with any existing computer.<p>If you run a program with n states for BB(n) + 1 steps it will either already have halted, or it will never halt. This is by definition.')
