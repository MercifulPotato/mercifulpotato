Stated plainly: If we aren&#x27;t allowed to engage in some form of positive discrimination, we aren&#x27;t allowed to compensate at all. To some people, that&#x27;s how it should be. I don&#x27;t agree, but I understand why they may feel that way. We all just want the best for ourselves and our respective groups, I guess.')
