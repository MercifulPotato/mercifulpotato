Item(by='ChrisLomont', descendants=None, kids=[24842243], score=None, time=1603225716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24835569, text='&gt;\nWhat &quot;public awareness&quot; is going to help bring these people in from Russia when we show them our hand of &quot;we know who you are and what you do&quot;?<p>It lets other countries know we&#x27;re looking for someone. For example, here [1] is the US indictment from 2015 for  Russian national Aleksei Yurievich Burkov. This let other countries know we wanted him. He was arrested later that year in Israel, and held because he was indicted by an ally country. He was extradited to the US in early 2020, tried, and sentenced to a long prison term.<p>Care to explain how public awareness does not get people arrested? Even from Russia?<p>There are plenty of cases like this. I see very few arrests and extraditions followed by public indictments. Do some searching in the DOJ court cases.<p>I&#x27;m done here. You form a lot of opinions based on very little data, and seem uninterested in solid statistical evidence before making claims, which is what I care about. Unfounded opinions are not useful to me.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;14431846&#x2F;united-states-v-burkov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;docket&#x2F;14431846&#x2F;united-states-...</a>')
