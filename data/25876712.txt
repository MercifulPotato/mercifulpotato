No new vision. Perf&#x2F;watt improvements have been happening every single year since the first chips were manufactured.<p>I&#x27;d say the M1&#x27;s improvements are a lot more than performance per watt. It has enabled a level of UI fluidity and general &quot;snappiness&quot; that I just haven&#x27;t seen out of any Mac or PC before. The Mac Pro is clearly faster than any M1 Mac, but the browsing the UI on the Mac Pro just feels slow and clunky in comparison to the M1.<p>I can only chalk that up to optimization between the silicon and the software, and I&#x27;m not sure that Apple&#x27;s competitors will be able to replicate that.')
