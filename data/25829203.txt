This is definitely interesting, and I appreciate the details, but I don&#x27;t feel like I have a better understanding of what the maladaptive behavior looks like.  I think you&#x27;re describing the <i>causes</i> of being &quot;not equipped&quot;, but I&#x27;m interested in how &quot;not equipped&quot; manifests itself in practice. That is:  what is the actual behavior we see on the outside?<p>The story about the foster kid who gravitates towards abusive relationships is closest to the level of analysis I was hoping for.  In that specific case, what is still unclear to me is exactly how -- in the details -- a lack of a stable&#x2F;loving home pushes one towards abusive relationships<p>Do you perhaps have some anecdotes about specific people behaving in ways that well-adjusted people wouldn&#x27;t?  Speaking for the rest of us, I think it&#x27;s hard to grok this kind of stuff without a lot of detail.<p>I recognize that this is a hard question to answer, of course.
