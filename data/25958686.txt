That has <i>nothing</i> to do with &quot;the little guy is winning&quot; whatsoever, and in fact may indicate that &quot;the little guy&quot; is about to lose his shirt, due to lack of predictability.<p>Trading was <i>not</i> stopped &quot;to save the hedge funds&quot;.  This is an outright lie that needs to be squashed.  Stop saying this.  I don&#x27;t mean to be rude, but the narrative you&#x27;re spreading is actively dangerous and not supported by any of the facts we have available to us.')
