The result was the complete destruction of the empire, their infrastructure including libraries, and the death of most scholars.<p>However, parts of Spain were under Islamic control from 711 AD to 1492 AD, and Sicily from 878 AD to 1060 AD. It was there were books from Islamic libraries were translated to Latin, giving origin to the European Reinassance.')
