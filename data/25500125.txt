Personally, I don&#x27;t think anything there is a testament for abandoning classification trees entirely; just &quot;common pitfalls&quot; to avoid when building new ones. The Library Explorer is very purposefully classification-system agnostic, so if a better classification system comes along, we can import it and switch to it! And unlike a physical library, we don&#x27;t have any re-shelving costs :)<p>One of the core design features I was aiming for with Library Explorer was that the user should never be navigating the &quot;hierarchy;&quot; they should be navigating the books. Forcing the user to move through categories forces them to try to understand the hierarchy, which can at times be not super user-friendly. Note that the Yahoo&#x2F;Google examples in the video do just that; the user picks a class, and then sees websites. By showing them the books directly, the user &quot;deduces&quot; the classification tree (lots of books about physics? I must be in the physics section); the classification labels aren&#x27;t really necessary for exploration.<p>In general, I think there are trade-offs. A classification tree is a model with flaws (just like all models). But its core benefits are (1) it&#x27;s a tree; so each node has semantic siblings, parents, and children; (2) each node in the tree has a finite number of child nodes (and usually &lt;30 child nodes; which makes it ideal for human traversal); (3) each book can be uniquely identified by the path from the root. (3) Was very important for physical librarians (classification systems were sort of like a search index for librarians), and was the cause of some of the issues described by Shirky. But online, we don&#x27;t need (3), so we can kind of throw it away. The tree can be degenerate; books can (and do!) appear in multiple nodes of the classification tree, because, unlike in a physical collection, in a digital collection, books are disjointed from the classification tree itself.<p>Tag-clouds are _definitely_ more flexible (as Shirky said, classification trees are a _restriction_ on the tag-cloud model), but come at a cost of being harder to navigate (as flexibility usually does) and get a &quot;big picture&quot; idea of. I haven&#x27;t seen a good example of a UI that lets you navigate tags in a way that doesn&#x27;t just let you travel from one node to a neighbouring node (please post if folks have one!). Trees allow you to travel up (parent node), down (child node), and left&#x2F;right (sibling nodes). Graphs you&#x27;re limited to just traveling to adjacent nodes. You could try to algorithmically _deduce_ parent&#x2F;child relationships though (that would be an interesting thing to try! I&#x27;m sure algorithms exist that do this). Ways of browsing graphs is definitely an interesting problem space! Open Library does also have tags (called &quot;Subjects&quot;), so finding a way to make them more user-browsing friendly would be great :)')
