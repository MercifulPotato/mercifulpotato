The (dead) dream of the ideal user agent is a program that lets you browse with your preferred color scheme, fonts, font size, etc; websites look just like any other program. Or not, if you prefer. Content is dictated by the authors but appearance is dictated by the user-agent.<p>The idea of the user agent dictating presentation rather than the content author is kind of dead on today&#x27;s modern web; while it&#x27;s certainly possible to set a global stylesheet, doing so creates an incredibly frustrating game of trial-and-error as some websites break while others work fine.<p>The idea does live on outside the mainstream in ideas like Gemini, Gopher, and a small subset of the Web that focuses on textual content with very conservative progressive enhancement.<p>I wrote about this previously: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seirdy.one&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;website-best-practices.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seirdy.one&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;website-best-practices.html</a><p>Most websites should be able to work just fine with nothing but HTML. That doesn not mean that they should actually be just HTML (my website certainly isn&#x27;t); it means that enhancements like CSS and JS should be <i>progressive.</i> Exceptions exist, obviously.')
