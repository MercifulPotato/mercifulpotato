ES modules while taking away features like scoped module support and dynamic import, it&#x27;s very  complicated and allows bad practices like include files.<p>Promises are very complicated compared to first class functions. What makes JS&#x2F;Node hard to grasp is that it&#x27;s async.\nAsync is an (often unnecessary) optimization, with tradeoffs.<p>Loading modules from URL&#x27;s is a cool concept! ES modules helps here, but you could also have a package-list file that lists all dependencies of dependencies as well as download mirrors, or hashes with peer-to-peer distribution.<p>A permission system is nice, modules should not have system access by default.<p>Not everyone wants to use TypeScript. It will probably become obsolete once optional type annotations gets added to JavaScript.<p>An opinionated toolchain is nice, but should be optional IMHO.')
