Covid isn’t lethal enough to burn itself out rapidly, but one can imagine that the R0 would be a smidge higher if it was less lethal, since all those dead people could’ve spread it just a bit more if they’d lived.<p>But it doesn’t appear like Covid is the absolute Max lethality possible for a pandemic; the 1918 flu pandemic seems to indicate that a virus can have a higher CFR and not burn out. So it could certainly get worse, but in general the trend is towards being less lethal making viruses more fit.')
