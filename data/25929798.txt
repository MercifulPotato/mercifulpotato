Fundamentally, Gamestop isn&#x27;t a thirty billion dollar company. The odds that retail investors stay greedy long enough to force the current shorts to cover are not very high, IMO. Some of these redditors are going to want to cash in their gains, and when that happens I guess it&#x27;s going to collapse very quickly.<p>I don&#x27;t buy individual stocks and even I&#x27;m tempted to get in on the short side right now. Seems like an easy way to turn $1k into $10k. Take my wife out for a nice dinner or something.')
