Then the script used the neocities gem [1] to automatically upload.<p>I now use Jekyll, but I&#x27;ve thought about making my own because only I will use it and I&#x27;ll understand it from top to bottom. With Jekyll whenever I need to make a change I have to re-read the docs to figure out what I need to do.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;neocities&#x2F;neocities-ruby" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;neocities&#x2F;neocities-ruby</a>')
