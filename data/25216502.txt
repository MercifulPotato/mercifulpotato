Think about the amount of paperwork required so that someone is spending 35h&#x2F;week working on it. And we&#x27;re talking about a 5 people org. All that to claim tax credits the company will maybe get next quarter. As opposed to a US startup that pays way less tax and can just hire the engineer they need as their 5th employee. Which one is getting a head start?<p>And on the other hand, all these programs are administered by an army of bureaucrats, all paid with a cushy pension fund.<p>It&#x27;s a great job program for bureaucrats, not so much for startups!')
