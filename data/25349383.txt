While watching a video, AirPods switch from Mac to iPhone when I get a call, but won&#x27;t switch back after I disconnect the call. I have to manually do the switch back. So this is still not an optimal experience.<p>I forget how this is on my Bose. I think video keeps playing with muted volume when you take the phone call so when you disconnect you just rejoin the video.')
