The drivers are horrible and the state of the tooling is insanely bad. The vendors have no clue, Intel personnel have no clue as they don&#x27;t care about OpenCL 2.0 but will still gladly charge $10,000 in licenses if you really want to go that route. Verilog&#x2F;VHDL is wtf, and you still need to redo your drivers.<p>So much potential.<p>I talked to a couple companies that use these in production, they reveal that they wrote their own drivers and still have issues.<p>You pretty much have to be a Microsoft doing sci-fi tech to get the benefits out of these, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way.')
