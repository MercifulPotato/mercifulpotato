Further if you set what a company can be worth you’ve limited their resources and limited their innovation as a result.<p>You’ve also turned human labor into currency in an attempt to get rid of currency. You cannot get rid of the concept of money. Without it you must trade resources (like labor), which history has shown is a very bad idea. The idea of a government being able to print money is a very deliberate feature, not a bug. I cannot do this justice, but read up on why we have money in the first place.')
