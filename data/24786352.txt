There&#x27;s also an advanced printer configuration flow which takes in a lot of options and settings for the printer to work, but that&#x27;s usually not necessary.\nThe web interface is my last resort before falling back to editing config manually, but you really shouldn&#x27;t need it anymore.<p>Really, the only problem I&#x27;ve had with printing from Linux had to do with Xerox printers that required downloading some magic file from the Internet and then required me to install SAMBA to login to a Windows domain and then manually pick the right trays and other config for the specific model before I could print. Otherwise, it would register the printer but the printer would refuse the job with an error.<p>Normal network printers were just a matter of clicking &quot;add&quot; and selecting the printer. The entire process took way less time than the Windows printer drive install took.<p>Making printing work that way was a choice by the printer manufacturer, it could&#x27;ve been a lot easier. If this is what CUPS would need to do for me for every printer out there then I&#x27;m glad for the authors&#x27; sanity sake that they don&#x27;t.')
