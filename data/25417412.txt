The reason for this is that LED lighting can be designed to produce exactly the frequencies plants actually absorb, and distributed optimally through the day. Current solar technology isn&#x27;t sufficient to make that cheaper than regular farming for staple crops, but I can certainly imagine it getting there for anything that&#x27;s grown in a greenhouse today.')
