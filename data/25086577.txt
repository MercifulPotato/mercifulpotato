Consider that we aren&#x27;t that far from the times of &quot;whites only&quot; establishments here... you posit that somehow we&#x27;ve come full circle when actually the folks in power today have a lot of continuity with the ones in power then.<p>The shamelessness of the propaganda here to prop up the existing power structures is breathtaking.<p>(Doesn&#x27;t it seem like a strong Jewish Lives Matter movement may have helped prevent some of these German government abuses?)')
