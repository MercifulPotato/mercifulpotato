Are they as good as a decent orthodontist? No -- and they&#x27;re nowhere near as good as a great orthodontist.<p>Are they acceptable for fairly simple cases, which mostly means patients who had braces growing up, didn&#x27;t wear retainers, and don&#x27;t need much correction? Maybe, even probably.<p>If you&#x27;re considering D2C, it&#x27;s worth visiting a few local orthodontists for in-person consultations (which are generally free) and openly discussing the pros and cons with them. You&#x27;ll probably find at least one orthodonist who will either say &quot;Your case is so simple that, while I&#x27;d do a better job, the odds of D2C going terribly are pretty low&quot; or, well, anything other than that. You can&#x27;t lose from having the conversations, and one of them may earn your trust and present something that works for you.<p>D2C vendors&#x27; biggest weakness has been accepting too-complex cases and&#x2F;or accepting patients without having an unbiased orthodontist review the case first. Try to fill that gap yourself and then see what you think.<p>IOW: It&#x27;s not a scam, but it is a higher-risk, lower-quality service. It isn&#x27;t a cheaper version of an orthodonist. If your case is simple, money is tight, and you know what you&#x27;re buying, those may not dealbreakers.<p>(You&#x27;re probably already beyond it, but for anyone else: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ogbo9Ny_y-g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ogbo9Ny_y-g</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investors.smiledirectclub.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;news-release-details&#x2F;smiledirectclub-files-28-billion-lawsuit-against-nbc-over" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investors.smiledirectclub.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;news-rel...</a> are decent starting points.)')
