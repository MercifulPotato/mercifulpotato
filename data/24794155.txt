He left his wallet and a crack pipe in a rental car that he returned. Some people are just forgetful.<p>Aside from the leak, it&#x27;s also not the loss that it would be for most of us. He&#x27;s rich. He had some sort of iCloud backup thing (sorry not a Mac user) to restore all the data, so he wasn&#x27;t missing anything.
