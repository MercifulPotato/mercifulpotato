As a violinist, I can recognize absolute violin pitches, but can&#x27;t do so with other instruments. This is definitely a learned skill; presumably there&#x27;s something about the timbre of the different pitches that my brain has memorized after so many years of playing.<p>However someone with &quot;true&quot; perfect pitch is able to detect pitches across instruments (or even a sine wave) and can distinguish minute differences in pitch; for example, someone with perfect pitch can tell that an instrument has been tuned to A415 (a typical tuning for Baroque music) instead of the standard A440.')
