Nothing in their study supports their assertion of a casual link.<p>Based on their alarmist and projective tone, they probably made this error on purpose in order to push an agenda for their own benefit. The fact that Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s disreputable name is attached is only 1 of numerous red flags. Disappointing.<p>Title of Article: Long-term study reveals harm in regular cannabis use<p>Original Paper: Young-adult compared to adolescent onset of regular cannabis use: A 20-year prospective cohort study of later consequences<p>Lead Author Dr Gary Chan, excerpt from Bio: &quot;Dr. Gary Chan is a NHMRC Emerging Leadership Fellow at the National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research. His principal research interest lies in the field of substance misuse prevention and the application of cutting-edge statistical method for longitudinal analysis and causal inference.&quot;<p>Methods: &quot;A state-representative sample in Victoria, Australia (n = 1792) participated in a 10-wave longitudinal study and was followed from age 15 to 35 years. Exposure variable: Patterns of cannabis use across 20-years. Outcomes at age 35: Alcohol use, smoking, illicit drug use, relationship status, financial hardship, depression, anxiety and employment status.&quot;<p>Results: &quot;Substantially more participants (13.6%) initiated regular use after high school (young-adult onset) than in adolescence (7.7%, adolescent onset). By the mid-30s, both young-adult and adolescent-onset regular users were more likely than minimal&#x2F;non-users (63.5%) to have used other illicit drugs (odds ratio [OR] &gt; 20.4), be a high-risk alcohol drinker (OR &gt; 3.7), smoked daily (OR &gt; 7.2) and less likely to be in relationships (OR &lt; 0.4). As the prevalence of the young-adult-onset group was nearly double of the adolescent-onset group, it accounted for a higher proportion of adverse consequences than the adolescent-onset group&quot;<p>Dr Chan says: &quot;Overall, regular use of cannabis – more than weekly and especially daily use – was found to have harmful consequences, regardless of the age people began using it.&quot;<p>&quot;The study was conducted in collaboration with Murdoch Children’s Research Institute and the University of Melbourne.&quot;')
