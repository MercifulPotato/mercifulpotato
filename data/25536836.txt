So someone can continue to linearly add value by producing more of the same thing. Your value is based on the sum of your total output.<p>To contrast with software: you reach a point where continuing to crank out more of the same doesn&#x27;t actually create value. Your value is based on how much of the overall body of work you addressed. How big of a piece did you take out from the whole pie.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m still thinking over the additive&#x2F;subtractive concept. It does seem like you could reframe a problem either way. Include a daily quota and the car example becomes subtractive.')
