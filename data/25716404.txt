There were a few deaths, and that sucks. But it wasn&#x27;t uniformly violence coming from antifa. And the protests were in support of racial and social justice.<p>On the other hand we witnessed the following on the 6th (among too many other things to mention):<p>1.) A literal gallows erected on Capitol Hill\n2.) Thousands of people entering secured areas of a government building.\n3.) A police officer literally beat to death with a fire extinguisher<p>This was all in an attempt to overthrow a democratic election. These were insurrectionists intent on using domestic terrorism to overthrow the American government and the concept of American democracy itself.<p>---<p>That is to say, what we witnessed with BLM protests is completely and diametrically opposite to what we witnessed with the so-called Patriot movement on the 6th.<p>I have absolutely no problem with social justice advocates using AWS as a platform. I do have a problem with domestic terrorists and their enablers using AWS as a platform.')
