Item(by='drusepth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606173308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187618, text='+1 for Heroku for sure.<p>My SaaS has grown from $50&#x2F;month costs to over $2k&#x2F;month costs on Heroku over the last few years and I&#x27;m always eyeing AWS and others as a cheaper alternative, but honestly the ease of mind Heroku gives me is more than enough to cover the costs. I&#x27;ve had a few &quot;hugs of death&quot; over the years when posts went viral and scaling up both in quality and number of servers was literally just a few mouse clicks and then I was back online. Other times, when e.g. Postgres fell over from heavy use, their support brought it back online for me free of charge (and quickly), and offered a list of helpful suggestions that I could do to keep it from happening again.<p>I see paying extra for Heroku like paying extra for a devops guy. If you&#x27;re comfortable enough in AWS to handle things in the heat of downtime, it&#x27;s probably worth moving because it&#x27;s significantly cheaper. If you aren&#x27;t, then Heroku might be a pretty invaluable resource even when growing into the upper echelons of cost.')
