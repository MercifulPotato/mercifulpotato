This provides roles for the large numbers of &quot;elites&quot; as well as provides a place for lackluster elites to drift out to pasture with other less aggressive organizations catering to their less aggressive demographics. This also forces economic efficiency, because the larger corporate and other giant institutions are filled with bloat-scale inefficiencies. This would also create product and service diversity, as well as force multi-organization cooperation at a scale rarely seen today.')
