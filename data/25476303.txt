The younger generation has no concept of listening to a song you &quot;don&#x27;t like&quot; 50 times, simply because you listened to the album you purchased 100 times.<p>Not necessarily true. When Spotify reaches the end of one of my playlists, it automatically starts playing a radio of &quot;recommended songs&quot; based on the playlist. However, these recommended songs are usually the same, with only minor changes over time.<p>As a consequence, I can think of several songs that I don&#x27;t like that I have listened to more than 50 times, simply because they tend to be the among the first recommended songs to play when I&#x27;ve finished one of my regular playlists.')
