I found [1] might be a good starting point.<p>I&#x27;m not that into finance stuff, but the idea of a short squeeze still happening at the end of this week definetly seems interesting. It could be triggered by all the call options expiring on Friday, which will have to be covered by then. If that increases the price even more, I guess the short sellers will have to cut there losses and buy back stock, which supposably still might be sold short over 100%.<p>That&#x27;s at least how I understood it and I have no clue if that might actually work. Of course there is a huge amount of people buying into GME just beacuse it is fun, memes, or whatever. But the idea behind all that definelty seems like an interesting bet.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l528pz&#x2F;gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l528pz&#x2F;gme_...</a>')
