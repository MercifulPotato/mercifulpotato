Which is a shame, because I was genuinely excited to read that GH has released a dark mode.<p>I use many dark mode themes and have even created them. The important thing to constantly keep in mind whilst authoring a dark them is: resist the urge to go &quot;too dark&quot; and contrasty, and to keep checking against a known &quot;good&quot; reference.<p>If any GitHub execs are reading this, and would like to see an example of what we&#x27;re talking about here, then the JetBrains &quot;Darkula&quot; theme in IntelliJ is a well done dark theme.')
