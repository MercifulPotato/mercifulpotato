But it cannot make the same mistake as what US is making right now. Even during SARS, that worse version of the Chinese system did not make things as bad as what US is currently making.<p>&gt; the strength of the West is that it&#x27;s largely leaderless, and its &quot;regional&quot; leaders regularly gets switched out, so even a bad leader cannot leave much long-lasting harm.<p>This is hilariously illogical thinking.<p>The selection of leader is through merits and competency. If the pool of candidates were bad, swapping out frequently did nothing to help the situation.<p>The strength of the west is that its rationale thinking and openness to debate and challenges have helped the nations to collectively think out and plot the optimal path to future.<p>Swapping out &quot;bad&quot; leaders is not even relevant in the context of open debate and collaborative thinking. In such a system, it&#x27;s not possible to have &quot;bad&quot; leader.<p>Xi takes advises more openly from intellectuals than probably any world leader. Examples: Xi asked his leadership group to study Block-chain and Quantum tech [1,2]. Can you imagine Trump keep silence in such a meeting without claiming he knows the subject better than anyone else?!<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xinhuanet.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;leaders&#x2F;2019-10&#x2F;25&#x2F;c_1125153665.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xinhuanet.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;leaders&#x2F;2019-10&#x2F;25&#x2F;c_11251...</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xinhuanet.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020-10&#x2F;17&#x2F;c_1126623288.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xinhuanet.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020-10&#x2F;17&#x2F;c_1126623288.ht...</a>')
