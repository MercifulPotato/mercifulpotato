A manager can either be an umbrella to shelter under, or they can be a shit funnel.<p>Great work gets done when you can give your engineers a hard problem (or a long list of easy problems) and let them put their nose to the grindstone to get it done, while deflecting the rabble of inane ideas for new features, shifting deadlines, office politics, customer&#x2F;supplier relations, etc. etc. etc.  If a manager sidesteps all those, and passes them to the engineer, there will be have no time or energy for the actual work. If they are a single point of contact where an engineer can pull in a prioritized task list and push out questions and results, that&#x27;s an ideal environment to get things done.<p>Unfortunately, other managers which interact with these EMs can sometimes have a hard time telling the former from the latter, and have a hard time evaluating the quality of the work&#x2F;difficulty of the problems being solved, so the only visible difference is the happiness of the engineering team and the accomplishments that were made.')
