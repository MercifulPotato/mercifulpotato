Not thinking that other people are inherently inferior or malicious due to their race, but that there should be no affirmative action.<p>That sounds like a ill-minded umbrella term to me, invented to call people you don&#x27;t like racist.<p>&gt; racial animus is a powerful factor motivating opposition to social spending and redistribution<p>It&#x27;s not a surprise if you define racial animus as being against welfare.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com&#x2F;you.stonybrook.edu&#x2F;dist&#x2F;f&#x2F;1052&#x2F;files&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;Feldman-and-Huddy-2005-Racial-Resentment-and-White-Opposition-to-Race-Conscious-Programs-10jw0wa.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com&#x2F;you.stonybrook.edu&#x2F;dist&#x2F;f&#x2F;1052...</a><p>&gt;  Consistent  with  the  expectations of new racism researchers, resentment accounted for racial bias in support of the experimental college scholar-ship program examined in this study, reinforcing its role as a measure of racial prejudice. But these effects were confined to self-identified liberals. Racial resentment did not explain racially biased program support among conservatives and was not linked to other negative racial attitudes among them. This leaves the concept of racial resentment in real doubt. If  resentment measures prejudice among liberals but not conservatives it cannot function successfully as a broad measure of racial prejudice.')
