Cusack plays a cynical ghost hunter who finds a deeply complex haunting. I won’t spoil the ending, but at a moment where inexplicable things are piling up, he assumes instead that he’s been given a hallucinogen in a gift.<p>Decent movie, total waste of Samuel L Jackson though. I think he got paid to sit around the set snacking on the buffet.')
