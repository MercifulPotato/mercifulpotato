I always hunt for it for a while and eventually have to go up to the url and manually remove &quot;blog.&quot; and the rest of the blog page parameters.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just missing it? But the big &quot;Open Library&quot; icon is not clickable, and even the &quot;about&quot; page doesn&#x27;t seem to have a link to openlibrary.org.')
