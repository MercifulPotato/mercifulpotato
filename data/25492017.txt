Asians don’t face the legacy of say Jim Crow, and the American system is otherwise basically fair, so Asians have been able to prosper even if roadblocks have hampered other groups.<p>I guess, but this viewpoint fails pretty badly at explaining why Asians prosper so much more than whites do.<p>&gt; Asians are thus stripped of agency—their success isn’t their own, but instead the byproduct of a ploy by whites.<p>To be fair, critical theory says exactly the same thing about blacks -- their lack of success isn&#x27;t their own, it&#x27;s the product of a ploy by whites. I don&#x27;t see why we&#x27;d expect a different analysis for Asians.')
