Without a cap on H1B the US would have 10 or 50 times the level of incoming immigrants.<p>Plus H1B is limited to having degrees (or a lot of work experience) in a small subset of occupations.<p>The US could bring over 1 million doctors in one year if it were legal.<p>H1B is only one specific case of immigration: generally speaking the developed world allows for unconstrained immigration if you have a job offer. Americans are particularly restricted in hiring foreigners, which is also one reason why it has so much illegal immigration.')
