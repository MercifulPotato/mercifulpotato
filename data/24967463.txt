I don&#x27;t see the problem. I sync my whole music collection to my iPhone (using iTunes&#x27; very helpful transcoding option from lossless to 256 Kbit&#x2F;s in order to fit onto the 512 GB internal storage). Using an USB cable about once a week to do so isn&#x27;t really an issue, is it?<p>&gt; Then when listening to said recordings on my phone, the music player tries to upsell me with Apple Music.<p>This can be disabled in the settings entirely. That way you won&#x27;t see Apple Music in the music.app. Again, I don&#x27;t have any use for Apple Music either, but I think it&#x27;s fine for it to be present by default since for most people streaming is the most common way to consume music these days.')
