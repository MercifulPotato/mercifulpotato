It&#x27;s possible, and many stores are doing it successfully. But hardware stores? Selling bolts? Their only customers are people who don&#x27;t use Amazon (older&#x2F;rural) or people who need that bolt <i>right now</i> and are willing to pay 2-3x retail price for it. Especially in a pandemic where Amazon&#x2F;Walmart are allowed to be open with few restrictions, but mom-and-pop has to close.<p>Successful small business going forward has to offer something Amazon&#x2F;Walmart can&#x27;t copy. Authenticity, experiences, memories. Escape rooms were a huge success story, creating axe throwing and fowling and other group activities, and often those places opened their businesses in the empty stores of businesses that couldn&#x27;t compete with Amazon&#x2F;Walmart and went out of business. Live music is another place Amazon can&#x27;t compete with. A beautiful river-front promenade with park benches and an ice cream shop and a coffee stand and a vendor selling popcorn from a cart with some people getting ready to launch their kayaks while others are fly fishing, Amazon and Walmart and big box stores and strip malls can&#x27;t compete with that. That&#x27;s downtown, small, local. That&#x27;s high profit margin.<p>Rather than clinging to the past where shopping local meant paying high prices on commodity items, we should be looking forward to a future where shopping local means &quot;I can&#x27;t get this anywhere else&quot;. That takes innovation. Grocery and bolts aren&#x27;t innovation, they&#x27;re commodities.')
