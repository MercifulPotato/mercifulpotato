Long term I think the story changes quickly.  I still can&#x27;t shake the idea that we as a human race are going to have to adopt a universal basic income of some sort.  As we automate more and more things we&#x27;re eventually going to get to the point that there are not enough jobs for humans to do unless we intentionally stop automating some industries.<p>Assuming we can find a way to get to a UBI, programming becomes just another art.  If you already have your basic needs met (housing&#x2F;food&#x2F;education&#x2F;transportation) and have the choice to either pursue an art, or pursue a career making more money, people will have options.  I have no doubt there are a lot of people that will value the freedom to decide what they want to do every day of their life over making more money in the rat race, and some of them will spend that time programming&#x2F;donating their time to FOSS projects.<p>Between now and then, your guess is as good as mine.')
