Item(by='supernova87a', descendants=None, kids=[25568038, 25572165, 25567900], score=None, time=1609229967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25567746, text='Thanks for that example info.<p>In every state&#x2F;county website I have looked at, it has <i>somewhat</i> comprehensive information for the distributors of the vaccine.  But nothing for the consumers.  It is all from the logistics point of view -- down to the distribution point of &quot;hospitals are going to get it&quot;.  After that, nothing.  Total absence of information.<p>Unanswered is the major (but simple) question of, &quot;how do you apply&#x2F;request to get the vaccine?&quot;<p>No answers on that front.  For 330M people waiting to find out how.  It&#x27;s kind of an embarrassment.<p>Edit: I acknowledge we&#x27;re in an unprecedented time with a vaccine developed at unprecedented speed.  But I have a feeling this is not going being managed well.  We had months of warning that a vaccine was coming.  And months more until the general population&#x27;s turn is ready -- and I bet we still won&#x27;t have good information.')
