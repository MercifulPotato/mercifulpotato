When you look at the details, RH is not the same as a free service like Facebook.<p>(Beyond which you can even argue that you _are_ the customer on Facebook, depending on what you&#x27;re doing on the platform. And doing so will also help you better understand how Facebook works, which &quot;summing it all up&quot; memes never really promised to do in the first place)<p>Looking at &quot;free&quot;: I pay for RH Gold, meaning I pay a fee plus interest rate. The customer service has been fine. They refer to me as a customer in their communications. They update me on market conditions and send emails reminding me to do things like update my trusted contact information and look after other important details.<p>It&#x27;s not the only brokerage I use, but it&#x27;s easily a better customer experience than other brokerages in those ways and others. The app alone strikes a great balance between &quot;not useful enough&quot; and &quot;overburdened with interface depth.&quot;<p>&gt; Update: A representative for both Citadel and Citadel Securities told Inc. that these are completely separate companies with a firewall between them.<p>Could the writer not have asked about this before hitting the Publish button?')
