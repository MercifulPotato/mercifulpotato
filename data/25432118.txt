Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25433355], score=None, time=1608051513, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431780, text='&gt;&gt;We can just elect another diplomat in their place.<p>Wow, I wonder how would you ever attract anyone to that job then, if it basically comes with a &quot;disposable&quot; label, and if the government basically says &quot;go and represent us, but if things go tits up we&#x27;ll just replace you&quot;.<p>&gt;&gt;No matter how you put it, diplomatic immunity disproves the idea that everyone is equal under the law.<p>Well, that idea was never true, going back thousands of years. Diplomats are effectively guests and get special treatment, like any guests do. If they abuse our hospitality then they get kicked out, simple.<p>&gt;&gt;You can&#x27;t have diplomatic immunity and also have everyone equal under the law.<p>Of course you can - after all this isn&#x27;t a loophole, it&#x27;s specifically agreed upon and allowed in the law of our democratic societies.<p>&gt;&gt; You have to choose one or the other or else it&#x27;s impossible to know where to draw the line.<p>Why would it be impossible? It&#x27;s pretty easy in fact - diplomats have immunity in order to carry on their jobs. Just like the American president(and most presidents and leaders in fact) is immune from prosecution while in the office - that&#x27;s also not &quot;equal under law&quot;. \nOr like police officers are immune from certain prosecution, how journalists are, private investigators etc. The rules are equal - but the rules also say that certain people are exempt. I just don&#x27;t see the issue here.')
