It’s not like Las Vegas where there are  a few bridges over the large streets; in Hong Kong one can walk blocks on walkways above the streets in the busy areas. \nThis was especially nice for US visitors since the traffic comes from an unexpected direction.<p>In contrast to this, I find Amsterdam, one of my favorite cities, to be full of street crossings with cars, bikes, and trains to worry about.')
