I was already using Libre Office so Ms Office wasn&#x27;t a sticking point for me. I assume you tried Libre office and its probably not compatible enough for you.<p>Ms Office is very compatible with Wine - even the newer ones. The only problems seem to be with apps were direct replacements like Skype or are irrelevant like OneDrive.<p>For setting up wine and managing my apps I use Lutris. It is meant for games but is brilliant for setting up windows apps as well. I wish they would acknowledge that fact in their UI but it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much that everything is called a game.')
