However: I think you are underestimating the efficiency of wheels.<p>See here for an example how a dozen HP (ironic unit name) suffice to pull tons and tons of stuff on a train track [0]. Same principle goes for street&#x2F;tire to a large extend.<p>So I&#x27;m pretty sure that is the one thing that knocks the horse out of the park.<p>I excluded planes here, but I would imagine that they reach their improved efficiency by doing a lot of movement via gliding, while a horse has to actively &quot;work&quot; for every bit of movement.<p>All of this is intuition though, so please chime in if you can provide some actual science :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Au3U72CX74I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Au3U72CX74I</a>')
