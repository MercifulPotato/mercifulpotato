I have actually verbalized this idea to the chefs in the past, I&#x27;m glad to see it actually being done. If made cheap enough this could be a real solution to keeping bugs away without resorting to nasty chemicals or netting everywhere.<p>This has the potential to be a big win for not only comfort, but health and safety as well. Less bugs in kitchens = less chance for food getting infected or worse yet, having eggs laid in it.')
