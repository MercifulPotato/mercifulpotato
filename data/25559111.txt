The main reason I have my doubts about tesla fulfilling all the visions people seem to have about them is manufacturing. This is a well solved problem for existing car makers, so tesla&#x27;s real value would be as a brand. I dont see batteries being the USP, same as I don&#x27;t see engines right now, no matter what certain engine fanboys say. Also, Panasonic is usually not getting the credit it deserves when people talk about Tesla&#x27;s battery tech. As long as Elon is at the helm and manages to sell the vision peopl what to hear, tesla should be fine so. the last two years taught me as much.')
