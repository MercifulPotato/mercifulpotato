Opinions are my own.<p>This is a nice article with some fun comparisons and important details around the specifics of operating TiDB and systems like it on AWS. If I were running a replicated database such as TiDB, hypothetically of course, I&#x27;d probably opt for an instance type with locally attached storage. EBS volumes are already replicated themselves for durability so if you&#x27;re running a replicated DB on EBS volumes then you&#x27;re going to be replicating while you&#x27;re replicating. Yo dawg. That&#x27;s going to be some extra latency, even with a majority quorum replication protocol like Raft.<p>Historically if you wanted locally attached SSDs the more expensive storage instance types like i2&#x2F;i3&#x2F;i3en were all you had but now there&#x27;s m6gd, c6gd, and r6gd[0]. Lots of options at all sorts of price points for your workload. The Graviton 2 based m6gd instances with local NVMe SSDs are more cost effective than the m5 instances that the blog post is using, which do not have a local SSD.<p>As the post calls out, if you are going to use EBS then use it for the materialized key-value store portion. Maybe even make a little Step Function to snapshot the EBS volumes to figure out where you can safely trim the Raft log at. It could be nice.<p>0 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;about-aws&#x2F;whats-new&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;announcing-new-amazon-ec2-instances-powered-aws-graviton2-processors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;about-aws&#x2F;whats-new&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;announcin...</a>')
