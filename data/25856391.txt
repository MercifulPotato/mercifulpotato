The (classic looking) Bluetooth radio is by far the most complicated electronics on board.<p>When I switch off the car, for safety, anti-theft and leaking, the battery is disconnected entirely with a key.<p>The radio looses everything: paired devices, position of radio tuner, volume, BT&#x2F;aux&#x2F;radio mode etc. Whenever you start the car, you&#x27;ll need to mash at least five buttons and knobs to either find a radio station or reconnect Bluetooth.
