He thought we were in danger of being killed by North Korea because Trump and the leader were exchanging words a few years ago.  It was media saber rattling, but sometimes people can&#x27;t tell the difference when the they are constantly being shouted at with alarmist &quot;news&quot;.<p>What I do instead is visit the LOCAL newspaper for the COVID guidelines in my area, maybe once a week.  Follow the guidelines, but otherwise move on with your life to the degree possible.')
