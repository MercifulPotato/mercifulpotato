Determining actual value is an estimation process, so he works very hard to avoid bias.<p>An example is he comes across a company with an excellent business model, that he would like to own. If he knows it’s trading at $10, when he does his DCF analysis he will need a valuation over $15. When he makes key DCF assumptions (growth rate, profitability, margins, lifetime of competitive barriers, etc) he is also subconsciously rooting for that &gt; $15 result. It’s too easy to say, well normally I don’t think growth rates this high can last that long, but in this case the company is unique and special, so I’ll give it higher growth prospects than I usually find prudent, etc.<p>Go read his shareholder letters, you can find them back to the mid-70s online (and Buffett partnership letters back to mid 50s), and he often discusses his efforts to avoid bias (sunk cost fallacy, Mr. Markets influence, etc).')
