If you put one on with the noise cancelling disabled, it still provides a quite decent amount of isolation. But then instant you press that little switch... near total silence.<p>I used to tell people that first class tickets on planes are a waste of money because: You&#x27;re still on a plane, it&#x27;s still noisy, you just get better food.<p>But now with my Sony headphones, cattle class feels like first class. It&#x27;s bliss: I can sleep. I can watch movies and actually understand what people are saying. I can read a book without feeling like there&#x27;s a running hair dryer behind my head the whole time. The cries of babies are completely inaudible.')
