But my previous job it would have been a perfect fit (a big SPA for monitoring a bunch of IoT devices that had web socket connections to a backend). We were two frontenders and two backenders and we spent so much time implementing and maintaining, not to mention _arguing_ over the API between the SPA and the backend, and that API would&#x27;ve basically gone away if we&#x27;d used Phoenix Live. I really hope to get to use it at some point.')
