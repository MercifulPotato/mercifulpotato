On the Internet, what he&#x27;s notable for and what NYTimes was reporting on, his identity <i>is</i> Scott Alexander. Talk about Scott Alexander I&#x27;ll know who you mean. If you had dropped a reference to &quot;Scott Siskind&quot; any time before today, I wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>Taken to the extreme, &quot;identity&quot; in your comment might as well apply to his driver&#x27;s license number. The NYT could print that, causing him additional hassle for just as much of an addition to the story.')
