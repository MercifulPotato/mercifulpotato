I object to freedom of speech because it doesn&#x27;t still seem like an ideal to me in the first place. Don&#x27;t attack a straw man.<p>What is the argument that free speech is an ideal? That it promotes a more vibrant discourse? That it permits political positions that the powerful dislike to be communicated? That we can drive out bad speech with more speech? That the court of public opinion decides well? That it ensures everyone can participate in matters of public debate?<p>Has it done so? Again, I&#x27;m not talking about the insurrection at all, so let&#x27;s set aside the debate over whether your comments about it are factual. Look at the last several decades. Do you think that the social norm - the ideal - of freedom of speech has improved our society? Can you concretely describe an example?<p>I believe in the <i>right</i> to freedom of speech as a limitation on government power. I don&#x27;t want the government throwing anyone in prison for what they said. I don&#x27;t believe in it as an <i>ideal</i>, as an aspiration  for either individual communities or our society as a whole.<p>Or, bluntly: Do you believe HN would be a better community without downvotes and moderation?')
