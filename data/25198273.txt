That&#x27;s the kind of time you need to be taking in tech debt for speed and pushing something that&#x27;s mostly correct, brings in revenue and has tangible results. Iterative improvement is key as long as it&#x27;s visible to the people who actually control it (your bosses&#x2F;managers) and those who actually use it (customers).<p>Remember that when you start something new, the expectations are not high. It&#x27;s a completely different thing if, for instance, you&#x27;re Amazon and you&#x27;re releasing the next managed software solution. That would be something like a core competency, be supported by several teams and to an extent already be expected to have certain results.')
