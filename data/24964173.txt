I&#x27;ve never voted for a major party presidential candidate, have long thought voting has more effect on the voters (making them think they wanted the resulting policies) than input to the system, and abstained in 2016 with no regrets. But with the incumbent party going off the rails and completely throwing out all pretense of law and order while running interference with Goebbels&#x27;s Big Lie, this year&#x27;s referendum is different. I don&#x27;t see how the country could survive four more years of Trump, and the repudiation needs to be as strong as possible.')
