Disposability culture drove many repair shops out of business.  Many repair shops I and my family used to are now gone or dying.  The guy who used to do sewing machine repairs for my mother is gone.  The cobbler that used to repair my boots is gone.  Furthermore, appliances that used to come with repair manuals no longer do, and finding the manual online is often a real chore.  Fewer people will repair things on their own when manufacturers make it difficult to find even basic documentation.')
