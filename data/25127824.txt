Zen 4 is perfectly good so far. \nApple&#x27;s M1 already outperforms most desktop CPUs, it goes to reason that a model with more cores and bigger L1 could outperform the whole industry.<p>Surface Go is nowhere close, half as fast in single core, 1&#x2F;5th as fast in multicore. The 5W TDP is really a generic number with no real meaning as Intel doesn&#x27;t really abide by it, I would say it probably uses about the same power as the M1, possibly much more under turbo while also having a much higher power floor (IE: When at idle the Surface go uses much more power)<p>Keep in mind that the Surface Go is very low-cost and the CPU is at a 14nm build.')
