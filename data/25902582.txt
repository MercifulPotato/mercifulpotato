This is probably something you&#x27;ll do once or twice a day if you make a routine out of it. I intend to get the prices down at scale, but when you put it against other consumer products (RXbar, starbucks coffee, etc) it turns out to be not so bad.<p>30s (maximum) vs 5 minutes (minimum) - I think you&#x27;d get it after you sat down and tried it. I&#x27;m getting feedback that it is a dealbreaker and why my product is superior. In an A&#x2F;B test, people literally gave up on the pills because they got bored.

While you are right, that&#x27;s not what 99% of Americans believe and they all specifically search for natural products. The fact that this odd effect comes from a fruit I think is important because it is perceived safer than if it was a synthetic compound causing these taste changes.')
