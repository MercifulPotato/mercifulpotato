Logically, therefore, the cloud service on which this relies must keep that personal info about you.<p>This is definitely one model, thereâ€™s also the chromecast model which allows you to turn off the phone. I guess it might not as fully featured as Sonos though? Chromecast appears to work by the service issuing a token of some kind to the chromecast after you start playing from your phone.')
