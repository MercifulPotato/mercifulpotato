In effect, the Russian one is also in phase 3; they kind of pretended it wasn&#x27;t, but are doing a very limited rollout that is for all practical purposes just a phase 3 trial.<p>Also, this one was developed in Germany and the trial is being run in Germany and the US; people might be forgiven for trusting a combination of the EMA and FDA, who will need to approve this, somewhat more than Putin&#x27;s one.')
