It hides being unreliable by putting some page load progress bar on top of the page. That progress stalls at 95%. Then you need to click again to retry. On bad days it breaks &gt;50% of the time.<p>Seriously, that progress bar is hiding the read problem here: some timeout of a 50X error or something. We --GH users-- are devs! We know that your hiding this, it&#x27;s not very respectful I think.<p>Oh, and, we pay for GH.')
