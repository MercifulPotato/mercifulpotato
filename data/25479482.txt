Functional requirements of specific services never sleep into the domain model. Call it bounded context, single responsibility principle, or encapsulation, but even if we play little semantics games a home is not the same as a mobile home. Pinning together unrelated concepts based on the naive belief that sharing a keyword is enough to bundle concepts together just misrepresents the whole issue as a straw man.<p>&gt; Right, that&#x27;s his point.<p>No,the point is that it&#x27;s absurd to talk about class hierarchies with this example, based alone on the simplistic idea that having the word &quot;chair&quot; appear in the identifier is all you need to logically bundle unrelated concepts. The example is poorly thought through even through the perspective of a straw man.<p>&gt; Again, that&#x27;s the point he&#x27;s making. In terms of modelling the world (...)<p>That&#x27;s what you are failing to understand: they are not modeling the world. At all. And from the start.<p>Only the domain model (chair) models the world. The rest is not the domain model, but data types used in the service layer to meet functional requirements (i.e., PhysicsChair).<p>Let&#x27;s put it bluntly: the straw man you are trying to defend is something that no one one the world at all ever mixes up. Ever.')
