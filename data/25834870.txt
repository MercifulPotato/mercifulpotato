Item(by='mainstreem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611072789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834786, text='&gt;anyone stating to be &quot;proud to be a&#x2F;an `nationality`&quot; is just another simpleton, it&#x27;s the belief that someone, because they just so happened to be born where they did, are inherently better or more than someone who arbitrarily was born somewhere outside some geographical area.<p>This is completely absurd. Cultural differences do not need to be in a hierarchy to be valuable. Pride in one&#x27;s heritage or taking joy in the cultural artifacts of one&#x27;s own culture doesn&#x27;t imply superiority -- that&#x27;s some Postmodern &quot;everything is power&quot; bullshit.<p>The differences between cultures aren&#x27;t something that we SHOULD simply &#x27;stop doing,&#x27; in part because this means some culture will remain, and be actually dominant, and eradicate the rest.<p>The differences between cultures should be celebrated and intermingling should be encouraged; they can be of equal value without being all the same monoculture.')
