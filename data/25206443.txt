At some point I started seeking out Raspberry Pi Zero based handheld gaming consoles. I wanted to program my own games on a little gameboy that I could hand to people. I didn&#x27;t find anything at the quality bar I wanted, but I found a guide on how to build your own. I got as far as wiring the screen up to the GPIO pins. It was an awesome experience.<p>I imagine a future where the rpi can be used in various homebrewed form factors as a console.<p>I know there are makers out there who are working on this.<p>Take my advice and pay for professional resin printing instead of the basic 3D printing yall are usually doing!<p>A high end case on a tried and true gameboy design would probably sell IMO.<p>I wonder if there will be a rpi4 in the Pi Zero form factor.')
