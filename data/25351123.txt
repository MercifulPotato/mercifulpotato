The &quot;you should already know this&quot; attitude is no longer widely accepted IMO.<p>I feel a lot of people are overly judgmental and unwilling to provide education. It&#x27;s still important to not being found out to be one of the dumb ones by making the unforgivable error of saying something stupid.<p>I&#x27;m shocked how many engineers, especially goods ones (ie ones you would benefit from hearing from the most) that simply refuse to inform people their mistakes and correct their misunderstandings. So not only are they judgmental, they&#x27;re unwilling to do anything about it.<p>I understand some of the reasons this is hard, and am very understanding. There&#x27;s time crunch, communication problems, and people have had negative experiences providing constructive feedback. People are damned proud of the way they operate and don&#x27;t want to hear anything that would imply their way is not optimal, even if it&#x27;ll help.<p>At the same time I think some people want this. They want to be judged superior, by virtue of others being deemed inferior, and want that status quo to continue.')
