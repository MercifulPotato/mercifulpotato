Put in context, that&#x27;s 2x the followers of TYT&#x27;s Cenk Uygur, 4x as many as Jimmy Diore, and just a few hundred k short of Steven Crowder. That is not indicative of a &quot;marginalized&quot; voice IMO, and your only defense of his position boils down to &quot;Hey he&#x27;s not advocating for genocide, just mass incarceration of our political opponents.&quot; That strikes me as a tone-deaf position to take on a social media site where hand-wringing over the fate of the Uighurs in China is so en vogue...')
