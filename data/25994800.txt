What are your thoughts on it?<p>I used to always install VLC in all my machines. One day, I found a file that had wonky audio -- it randomly sped up and slowed down, but in a somewhat bearable way (it was a 2h-movie,) like some weird  flutter was going on. I didn&#x27;t make much of it at the time. Later, I got another file that would randomly lose audio. As in, sometimes, the audio would cut for a while and then come back. Except I used to replay this file often and noticed it happen in different places every run -- this got me thinking it could have been a software issue.<p>At the time (this was roughly 4 years ago, I believe), I happened to see IINA mentioned somewhere, and I therefore gave it a go. It seemed to consume more CPU, but it didn&#x27;t have the wonky audio in neither of these files. I became a fan and, while I keep VNC installed &quot;just in case&quot;, I get this feeling that IINA has higher compatibility and a better interface. For example, IINA has what seems like a better algorithm for finding subtitles from a path, and it&#x27;s just more well integrated with macOS.<p>I wish I could go back to VLC, but I keep feeling like it&#x27;s going to fail me or that the UI isn&#x27;t as polished&#x2F;well-integrated into macOS. I hate that I feel this way because I honestly feel like I&#x27;m &quot;betraying&quot; this wonderful piece of software that is VLC.<p>I guess there isn&#x27;t really another question. I&#x27;d like to say thanks, and here&#x27;s to hoping that in the near future I&#x27;ll go back to VLC. You have done a remarkable job and I think you should be extremely proud of yourself! VLC rocks! :)')
