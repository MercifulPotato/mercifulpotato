Item(by='these_are_not_t', descendants=None, kids=[25509668], score=None, time=1608659540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508672, text='&gt; should have the right to receive all unpublished footage [<i>of the licensed work</i>]<p>I think it should be read that way. You are not conflating copyright and privacy, you are conflating scopes of content production (the licensed work vs the whole work of the artist).<p>In your example, the topic of the licensed video is the albatross, not the artist holidays. That clarification being made, there&#x27;s probably some truth in the privacy issue (you brought that example for a reason): one must make a distinction between works of fiction and other works : reporting, biography, and perhaps other kinds. Games are works of fiction, just like movies and music, while someone&#x27;s holidays isn&#x27;t. Maybe one may see that as another form of scoping.')
