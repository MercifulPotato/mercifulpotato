For simplicity, let&#x27;s use education, which, as we know, has a direct correlation with net worth, as a proxy for wealth. Thus, as I have argued earlier, the aggregate constituency of congressional representatives largely consists of non-wealthy people. Therefore, by reducing taxes on businesses (especially big businesses, which are mostly owned by wealthy, including the &quot;top 1%&quot;) and high-income people, post-2016 tax reform disproportionately benefited a very small segment of said constituency (often referred to as &quot;socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor&quot; [2]).<p>&gt; So... what does trickle down have to do with anything?<p>Trickle-down economics is directly related to taxes, as it is based on the notion that &quot;taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society should be reduced as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term&quot; [3]. And your example was referring to post-2016 tax reform. Hence the connection that I have mentioned.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;what-the-20...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialism_for_the_rich_and_capitalism_for_the_poor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialism_for_the_rich_and_cap...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trickle-down_economics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trickle-down_economics</a>')
