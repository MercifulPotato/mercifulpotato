In my understanding, Robin Hood is allowing purchases to close a short position, so there exist quoted prices, they just don&#x27;t want people expanding a long position.<p>If this is coming from Robin Hood, they could make the (very weak) argument that they are protecting their retail customers from themselves, but if it&#x27;s coming from Citadel, it just looks like market manipulation to me.')
