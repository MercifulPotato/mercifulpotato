There are use cases where you absolutely have to use it, those are currently Home Screen widgets and WatchOS Apps + complications. I would not be surprised if more SwiftUI-only use cases were progressively added.<p>SwiftUI is also cross-platform, in Apple ecosystem. That is, you can develop all of your components and have them work on iOS and macOS. Then glue them together with platform specific main view.<p>SwiftUI will also always have all of the native features whereas cross-platform tools always lag behind. This is important for smaller developers as releasing before others can be what makes or breaks your app&#x27;s success.')
