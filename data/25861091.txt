Maybe social media is making it hard for government to remind people that it has certain powers.<p>It&#x27;s a dangerous trend if you ask me, that people are not periodically reminded that they <i>do</i> have obligations that the state can hold them to, and it is not just a voluntary, toothless government.  Any action by government becomes a burden that you can choose to opt out of?<p>Maybe it takes a real crisis that people want the government to flex its muscle, and maybe this doesn&#x27;t seem to some to rise to that level.  I don&#x27;t know why.<p>Mandate that everyone gets the vaccine, or has a civil penalty.  Or is not allowed to participate in public life and infect others.<p>Government is not a &quot;please if you can try&quot; entity, in case people forgot.')
