Roads suck. Public education sucks. Tent cities everywhere. Then COVID-19 hit and you could tell, early on, that it was going to be mismanaged, similar to our tax money. So glad I bailed back in May. No Texas for me. Arkansas instead!<p>I think the last new tax I voted for was in 2004. Back when I was 25 and didnâ€™t fully understand how terribly mismanaged the funds were.')
