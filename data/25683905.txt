Item(by='Normille', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610108397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25682981, text='<p><pre><code>  &gt;If the subject software had a concept of priority, these articles would explain how to set priority using &#x27;configure&#x27; but not whether priority=2 was higher or lower than priority=1.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s amazing how often this is done. Two favourite examples of mine are:<p>1: Those text-base Captchas which NEVER tell you whether the letters are case sensitive or not.<p>2: I get a monthly report from  Yandex Webmaster which gives me some basic info on visits to my sites. It also gives my sites a &#x27;score&#x27; which varies up or down a bit. Sometimes it&#x27;s 10. Sometimes it&#x27;s 8.<p>Not one single time in the several years I&#x27;ve been receiving these reports has Yandex ever thought to enlighten me as what this score means; whether it&#x27;s good when the score goes up... or when it goes down... or what the score is out of. Is my site occasionally scoring 10&#x2F;10?... or is it scoring 10&#x2F;100 or &#x2F;1000?')
