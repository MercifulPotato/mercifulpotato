They don&#x27;t feel &quot;tremendous shame and grief about it&quot;, you&#x27;re just projecting. They wouldn&#x27;t be doing it in the first place if that was the case, at least for the middle-class ones that I&#x27;m talking about.<p>2. The &quot;significant harm later in life&quot; does not stem from the (imaginary) shame &amp; grief, it comes from the discovery when they inevitably hit The Wall that no high-quality mate wants to marry them, and that they have tarnished their reputation forever for a short-lived boost in income and attention that is guaranteed to fade one day. The progressive culture and their friends will tell them about &quot;sex positivity&quot; and that prostitution is just &quot;sex work&quot; like any other work, which it isn&#x27;t. You will not agree to that of course, &quot;I don&#x27;t own her body haha&quot;.<p>If there is one thing to take away, let it be this: look at the people around you and their relationships, and observe what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t theorize, don&#x27;t moralize, don&#x27;t judge, just observe and make up your own mind.')
