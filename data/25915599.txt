It&#x27;s really the only &quot;social&quot; thing I use.<p>I know Fleets is a Twitter thing... I remember seeing it someplace, maybe a story on Hacker News or something? Was it something like a replacement for Vine maybe? Or was it something with threaded conversations? Am I seeing Fleets in my feed? What do they look like? Are they being used at all?<p>I really have no idea what Fleets is and I use Twitter all the time. Whatever Fleets is I agree with pboutros, don&#x27;t put that same team in charge of anything else, this rollout didn&#x27;t work.<p>(I may be missing something totally obvious and awesome here! Maybe Fleets is the greatest thing since Google+ and I&#x27;m to set in my ways to notice or care? This could very well be another &quot;It&#x27;s not you, it&#x27;s me&quot; thing and I&#x27;m too dense to see it.)')
