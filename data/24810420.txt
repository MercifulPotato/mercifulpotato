The number I came up with was ~30 million deaths (1% fatality rate, with 40% of the world infected).<p>While that sounds like a lot, that&#x27;s still less than half the number of people who die every year normally (~1%). My reaction to that number was &quot;tragic, but civilization will survive this just fine&quot;. Since then things have only improved, at least from a medical perspective.')
