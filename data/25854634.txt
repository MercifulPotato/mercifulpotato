Item(by='analog31', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611196459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25853157, text='I started a business to make a gadget for a niche market, while also working another sideline as a part time musician.<p>One thing is that my day job did not demand heroic hours, and I have a very short commute. I live in a cheap region, so I have plenty of space in my house for all operations.<p>Another factor is that the market itself is such that my business will never grow beyond a certain size. I make and ship a few gadgets a week. I&#x27;m successful inasmuch as the business adds a few thousand dollars per year to the kitty. Playing music has also produced a net income if you don&#x27;t count what my parents paid for lessons. ;-)<p>An interesting nuance is that my product contains no Code. My market doesn&#x27;t judge my credibility by the sophistication of my web page. It is not technically passive income, but semi-passive in the sense that the baseline attention it demands is utterly predictable from month to month.<p>The lack of Code is by intent, to provide a contrast with what I do all day.')
