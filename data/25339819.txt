Probably not a whole lot.<p>Eventually once the software is more refined, there are definitely some features worth adopting for. The kill-switches are a decent feature, and I would love to have something like that on every phone (especially the cam &amp; mic one, since I don&#x27;t tend to put tape over my phone cameras!).<p>For the Pinephone, the hope is that one day you&#x27;ll be able to buy one (or some successor) and be able to load whatever distro you want on it. It&#x27;s vastly easier to work with than installing a custom bootloader, and then flashing a new version of Android. So as far as that goes, there&#x27;s a lot to be desired.')
