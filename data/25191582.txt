Please cite your source if so.<p>&gt; Just because it&#x27;s a protection racket doesn&#x27;t mean that it needs to at all times 100% conform to a sentence that you found on wikipedia.<p>No but going off an existing definition is better than throwing around a concept with any real connection to reality.<p>&gt; The core of a racket is to respond with disproportionate violence. For example, sending your army to harass the entire country that some of your attackers were part of.<p>What does that have to do with CIA?<p>&gt; Drone strikes on schools that are known to be full of children.<p>So a drone strike on country B is payback for them not ponying up protection money to the intel agency of country A. Did I get that right?<p>That is nonsensical.')
