Witness how they made a point of demonstrating a Linux VM running on Apple silicon during the M1 introductory keynote, and how they continue to remove dev-oriented tooling, allowing third-party setups like homebrew to fill it in.<p>It seems their goal is increasingly to focus on their end-user platform only, which for dev tooling means only focusing on XCode&#x2F;etc. and not the Mac&#x27;s capabilities for other deployment targets.<p>... which leaves an obvious gap for Linux to fill. In fact, given how large and capable Apple is these days, I think there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll put a bit more effort into helping Linux integration along (especially Linux in VMs on macOS -- that&#x27;s probably the main plan at the moment). They realize they only stand to gain from such efforts.')
