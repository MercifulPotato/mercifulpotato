It&#x27;s mainly about making it so that car manufacturers can&#x27;t design car computers in a way that in a way that impedes independent shops from doing repairs without paying the manufacturers for access (think like custom data access protocols, or obfuscation that&#x27;s only readable after paying Honda a monthly massive fee). This is the battle that farmers are fighting against john deere.<p>Actually, if the data is only accessible to a few authorized shops, that&#x27;s when the data is especially likely to be sold. Data is really only valuable in aggregate - if more shops can service cars, then each shop really gets less access to aggregated car data. More choice means less centralization of the data which means it&#x27;s more difficult to collect enough data for it to be sold.<p>I think the car manufacturers are the ones who are hoping to monetize the data, and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re trying to restrict access.')
