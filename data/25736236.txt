Trump.<p>And I know that most people have such a distorted view of his actions that someone could probably write an accurate biography with a fake name, and he would not be recognized by the left or the right.<p>But, please. He was the president, and he did a tremendous amount of things by all counts. He changed the world&#x27;s attitude towards China and towards the Middle East.<p>Any other president would probably have used Covid to become dictator (see other countries), he instead boosted the States&#x27; power.<p>You may think that he made changes for the better, you may think for the worse. But he is commander in chief and he is leaving by all counts in another week.<p>A little respect looks a lot better and is much more manly than acting like a big baby and sore winner.')
