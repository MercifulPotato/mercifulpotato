To me personally, a “mature” language that’s not really being used isn’t the goal. And if developers truly believed standardization was valuable, you’d expect this property to give them a significant leg up against the sorts of languages like Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, TypeScript, etc.<p>That being said, I do think, considering it longer, there are languages that I am missing, like SQL, and ones that have a spec, even if it’s not under an ECMA&#x2F;ISO process, like Java and Go, that I was forgetting.<p>I still think that using this as a necessary condition for “maturity” is misguided.')
