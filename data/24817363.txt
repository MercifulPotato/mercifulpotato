I tried to document as much as possible.<p>I agree, but then those should not be mentioned in the readme as &quot;Features&quot;. Are there any things mentioned in the readme in present tense that are not currently implemented?<p>&gt; Please don&#x27;t confuse a Browser with a Browser Engine. I never claimed to replace WebKit, Blink and neither Gecko.<p>In <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tholian-network&#x2F;stealth&#x2F;blob&#x2F;X0&#x2F;browser&#x2F;browser.mjs#L197" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tholian-network&#x2F;stealth&#x2F;blob&#x2F;X0&#x2F;browser&#x2F;b...</a> you spawn chromium (or other browsers). Chromium is a browser.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that you have to fork or implement a browser, I&#x27;m just saying that if you wrap an existing browser it&#x27;s best to be upfront about it and not make it sound like you have implemented a browser. I wouldn&#x27;t have objected if the readme said something like &quot;It uses chromium&#x2F;electron or other browsers under the hood&quot; at the beginning.<p>This is especially critical if you claim improved privacy or security.<p>&gt; For now, I, as a single person working on the project<p>I&#x27;m not complaining about the quality or the scope of the work. I&#x27;m saying that what the readme presents as the current status of the project does not match reality.')
