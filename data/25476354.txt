Probably around 1-2 in their entire career, otherwise there is a glut of PhD&#x27;s with no faculty. But with so many faculty members adding 1-3 new PhD&#x27;s _per-year_ there will be so many PhD&#x27;s with nowhere to go.<p>(Excluding fields with a good route to industry, of course, since there&#x27;s plenty of &quot;sterile&quot; industry positions where the researcher is no longer spawning new researchers).')
