Like, it&#x27;s an unquestioned assumption that you need &quot;entertainment&quot; in the form of consuming attention-eating stuff all your free time. That you need to be &quot;doing something&quot;, and that in some strange way getting through media is some kind of accomplishment, at least you didn&#x27;t just do nothing.<p>I think this doesn&#x27;t go without saying... People have always entertained themselves in various ways, like having rituals, singing together, playing, fixing stuff (clothes, stuff around the house), creating things like tools and clothes etc. But these tended to be more active &quot;hobbies&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m taking issue with the template&#x2F;implicit model whereby work sucks your energy out, and then you need to regenerate by sitting in front of some media device and consume some subscription content or some media item that has a title, author etc. As if unstructured time were scary. That you just go for a walk without having a podcast in your ears. That you just cook dinner without the TV on. That you eat without watching Youtube. It somehow feels non-productive and &quot;cheating&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think these are the best way to unwind or regenerate for the next day, as opposed to actually letting your brain just be without &quot;content&quot; being fed into it. Also a lot of content, like news and podcasts just work us up instead of relaxing and &quot;entertaining&quot;, unless you consider &quot;outrage&quot; entertainment.')
