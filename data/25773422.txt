I may agree with it or disagree, I don&#x27;t know where I stand.<p>But the argument &quot;because Republicans&quot; should not be acceptable.<p>&gt; The argument that an elected majority, elected by free and fair elections, should not be able to implement the platform they ran on seems fundamentally anti-democratic in itself.<p>It is more complicated than that.<p>In the real world the democratic system should also protect against &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Many checks and balances exists in particular to avoid that tyranny, not just three branches you mentioned.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying filibuster is good or bad.')
