User-research based product development, pair programming, short iterations, deploying daily, all that jazz. Just a variation on the same sort of thing I&#x27;ve seen in the tech-first &#x2F; software-product-company gigs I had in the past, but I&#x27;ve mostly worked for smaller indie or niche companies.<p>That is, I get to work in a way and with people and tools (Rails + React at the moment) that makes sense to me. How far outside the norm are we and where could I go to learn more about the whole system?')
