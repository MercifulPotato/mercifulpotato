If agent A interacts with a system and can learn causal relationships, how could agent B who observes all of agent A&#x27;s experiments not be capable of drawing the same conclusions?<p>It seems that any theorem that rules out learning causality from observational data alone would also rule out learning causality from any kind of interactions.<p>Unless you&#x27;re assuming that agent A &quot;knows&quot; it has free will so its own actions have no cause, while agent B can&#x27;t tell whether the environment caused agent A&#x27;s actions or vice-versa. But if that&#x27;s what the proof hinges on, it&#x27;s pretty shallow, because agent A has no such guarantee that its own choices have no root cause.')
