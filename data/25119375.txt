It’s a matter of preference though, if you love the kubernetes abstractions and APIs you’re probably better off with k3s&#x2F;k0s. I personally very much prefer Nomads less obfuscating abstraction layers. This is coming from 2-3 years of managed k8s at work.<p>It does take a bit of effort to set up <i>”properly“</i> - ideally each of vault&#x2F;consul&#x2F;nomad server should run on 3 separate instance for HA quorum, for a total of 9 machines apart from the server (“client”) you’re actually running stuff on. For a casual homelab this is obviously severe overkill. You don’t need to. You can run everything perfectly fine as single instance on the same machine.<p>Personally I went a bit nuts with HA so I have 9 single-board-computers apart from my workload runners. You really don’t need to if OK with downtime in event of server restarts and maintenance, though.')
