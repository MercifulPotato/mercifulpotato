Which is different to the US quite substantially.<p>Germany you are right it has a similar framework to the US.<p>UK doesn&#x27;t have this as a right outside of parliament (parliamentary speech is protected). So not sure why you raise this as a counter example.<p>France is a weird one to bring up... where they have banned certain kinds of expression in different settings (i.e no religious symbols). Extremely different from the US.<p>India similar to Canada has so many provisions (and willingness) in which to revoke this right, it&#x27;s definitely not as strong as a constitutional right that the US gives.<p>Italy again its freedom of expression is tempered by a host of restrictions on that freedom.<p>I could go on... none of them are like the US having a constitutional right for freedom of expression that quite literally supersedes other laws.')
