You can&#x27;t judge people on competitive coding profiles.<p>&gt; Much of this can be attributed to us having 1&#x2F;6 of world&#x27;s population (more if you just count English speaking populance), but that doesn&#x27;t excuse people&#x27;s bad behaviour.<p>This is mostly better attributed to the rat race mentality that is so common among Indians. Everything wrong with education in India stems from this. The rote learning based education, high competition for entering CS degrees despite lack of interest, low quality work in indian outsourcing firms, and company politics to become manager ASAP.')
