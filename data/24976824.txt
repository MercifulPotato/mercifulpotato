The red line before the pandemic was packed full of people during my morning commute, transporting 130,000 people a day. Standing room only for the entire subway train. That being said, you&#x27;d never have people waiting on the mezzanines at these stations. The platform is already big enough to hold like 3-4 trains worth of people, and a train comes every 10 mins (every 5 mins where the line is staggered with another subway line downtown) and it is cleared out of people waiting when the train comes (sardines squeeze well).<p>To expand capacity beyond that would require reengineering the tunnels themselves. They go as fast as they can turn around and vent air as it is. You&#x27;d have to bore parallel tunnels to increase capacity, which would just mean adding more platforms and still wouldn&#x27;t require a mezzanine.')
