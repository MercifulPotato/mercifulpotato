Will I do some comparison shopping for a $100 item? Sure. I do order from other online sources as well but it&#x27;s probably easiest to have a default whether that&#x27;s Amazon or someone else.<p>To the parent point, even with 2-day delivery, most of the things I order aren&#x27;t stuff I need <i>right now</i>. And the reality is that, normally, they&#x27;d have gone on a list where they&#x27;d have rattled around before I got around to going to the store with a shopping list. But, now, generally minimizing or at least reducing store trips, has reinforced the notion that a lot of in-person errands are pretty unnecessary given online options.')
