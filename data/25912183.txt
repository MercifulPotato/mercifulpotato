If you think you can go out into a high-trust society and do just fine, then leaving that religious community your parents raised you in seems low-cost.<p>Also, if high trust drives economic growth, and wealthier societies become less religious, you would get that same pattern.  I think to determine which is driving which, you would need to look at the relation between religion now and trust levels in the past, and vice versa.')
