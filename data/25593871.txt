People are one upping each other, try being contrarian without actual expertise, Dunning Kruger etc.<p>To really appreciate if progress is more or less than expected, you need to have a good intuition for what is expected. Knowledge of the history of the field, knowing what and why is hard or easy, which may not be in line with laypeople&#x27;s intuition.<p>Yes, some people oversell it. On the other hand there is real progress. Sure, this is a very uninformative summary.<p>But it&#x27;s just ridiculous to see over and over this &quot;where is my flying car, you damn lying researchers&quot; attitude. And equally the Star Trek fan, Tesla fan, Bitcoin fan &quot;how do I start hacking&quot;, ifl science cheering crowd who never get their hands dirty. Okay I guess I found a way to feel superior to both.<p>There&#x27;s just so much noise and playing telephone through popular press and lay discussions, posturing etc.<p>The more I do and hear from others about real world AI (through university study and industry) the more I see the disconnect between online blogosphere + confident comments vs reality. I used to be so naive...')
