Not traditional storytelling practice, like e.g. Nancy Mellon&#x27;s books on the subject. So I have to conclude that literally everyone making these blogposts is just copypasting from the self-help playbook and has no original  contribution to make.<p>...once upon a time there was a man named Dale Carnegie and he solved the problem of how to be successful in life&#x27;s ambitions so thoroughly that nobody could surpass his teachings. And yet, somehow, there still existed people who were not successful. It turned out in each instance that they had simply not taken the advice heartily enough, as they told each other in meetings of the Friendless and Uninfluential Society. &quot;If at first you do not succeed, try, try again.&quot;<p>Gradually each learned that the true secret to success was to tell someone else of these teachings and sell them products. And so the world turned, the message growing seemingly more and more inevitable and omnipresent, until one day, a fisherman in a small village was invited to join a seminar for the Friendless and Influential, raise his wealth and standing and buy a fleet of boats, and he responded:<p>&quot;Ah, I could do all of these things you suggest and retire to a small fishing village, or I could go home.&quot;')
