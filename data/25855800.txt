You (an alien in the new timeline) can then watch a world develop in that alternate reality where your grandfather died.<p>If time travel were in fact possible, this would be the only way my puny brain could conceive of it actually working.<p>If there’s only strictly one path that reality takes even from the perspective of an outside observer (God) then I can’t see how time travel could be possible in such a construct. If it is possible it seems you must implicitly admit that there is not in fact a singular thread of reality&#x2F;time.<p>Just because we define some equations where <i>t</i> can flow in reverse and fit them into the standard model doesn’t seem to me to be persuasive evidence one way or another.')
