The combination of all this is heartbreakingly difficult to observe.<p>Honestly this stuff is easy.<p>A lockdown means only essential workers who actually keep the lights on and provide food go to work, and they do with ridiculous protection.<p>It means no fast food delivery, no public transport or Ubers, no leaving your residence except for exercise (maybe - some places you had to stay inside) and 1&#x2F;week shop at the supermarket (or delivery) with one person&#x2F;household.<p>It means closing the borders firmly, and government-provided and provisioned (not outsourced) quarantining every arrival for at least 14 days.<p>And it means providing plenty of funding and kindness to businesses and people to allow them to get through without fear. Including putting homeless into homes (e.g. empty hotel rooms).<p>And it needs to last long enough to know and isolate every case, which is say 6-8 weeks if done properly.<p>The US and UK failed on every one of these tests, and hundreds of thousands of people are dead.<p>Meanwhile in New Zealand we did the above almost a year ago, and are enjoying our summer break essentially normally.')
