Willfulness only requires that I intend to do what I did, not that I knew it was illegal.<p>If I somehow don&#x27;t know that killing people is illegal and I intentionally shoot someone, the excuse that I didn&#x27;t know it was illegal doesn&#x27;t get me anywhere (even assuming the court believes me).<p>If, on the other hand, I didn&#x27;t intend to kill someone, that does lessen the severity of the crime or even eliminate it if it was truly a freak accident where I couldn&#x27;t reasonably have prevented it by exercising more caution.')
