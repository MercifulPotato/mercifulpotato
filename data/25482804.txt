That seems to be consistent with what you&#x27;ve written in your article on writing the book, mentioning &quot;...we even built a Node.js framework as byproduct.&quot; If tackling DDD in Node requires so much work on something that isn&#x27;t the businesses&#x27; core domain, and there&#x27;s a lot of surface area for it to go wrong, why do it in Node?<p>As someone who writes predominantly TypeScript, static types feel like a much lower hanging fruit for alleviating <i>some</i> of the pain in tackling rich domains. As you&#x27;ve written the book in JavaScript, I&#x27;m curious whether you used plain JavaScript on the professional projects?<p>Also curious to hear from someone who has done tactical DDD in Java or C#: do you find a good supporting framework essential?')
