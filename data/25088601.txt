I&#x27;ve noticed this &#x27;singling out&#x27; behaviour on WhatsApp groups for example. I was recently on a WhatsApp group where (I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a mistake) a slight error of judgement led to the issue being way over-inflated and me being made an example of for the &#x27;benefit&#x27; of others. There&#x27;s just way too much of that on the internet these days. I&#x27;ve seen many genuine &amp; sincere apologies from people with large followings (since some people are suggesting these rules don&#x27;t apply to average Joe) and even then people don&#x27;t let it go. The world just wants someone to blame, that is the underlying problem.')
