I think that&#x27;s perfectly sensible definition. A game can have 60FPS, but be unplayable because it crashes when you switch scenes. And a game can have 5FPS, but be &quot;playable&quot;.<p>They should have another column called &quot;recommended&quot; though, since filtering by &quot;playable&quot; isn&#x27;t very usefulâ€¦')
