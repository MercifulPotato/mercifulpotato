Item(by='silicon2401', descendants=None, kids=[25363237, 25361636], score=None, time=1607537329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25361463, text='&gt; Eat less&quot; is the correct advice for weight less just like &quot;don&#x27;t drink&quot; is for alcoholics and &quot;don&#x27;t think of him&quot; is for someone going through a breakup. It&#x27;s just basically useless advice totally lacking empathy. People are different. They have different bodies, different psychological dispositions, different experiences, etc.<p>None of what you described changes the example solutions you gave. An alcoholic does need to not drink to improve their health, just like to lose weight you do need to eat fewer calories. The way to solve a problem is to find the solution, and empathy doesn&#x27;t cure being overweight or addiction. Only when you know the solution can you work backwards to find the steps to get you there from where you are today')
