Not because I think it&#x27;s anything on the part of Salesforce, but that all these different corporations believe that this is something they HAVE to do<p>It&#x27;s virtue signaling, plain and simple. It&#x27;s also free marketing for companies. Are we going to see random companies (e.g. soft drink companies) now proactively declare that they&#x27;re going to refuse to cater to RNC events?
