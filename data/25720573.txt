There would surely be lots of variation across projects and departments&#x2F;governments, as there would be across companies, though I&#x27;d guess for non-employer open source 1, 2, 3, 5 would be very high, 4, 6, 7 unclear or lacking, and for government possibly even lower than traditional companies across the board? Just speculating, again, curious about data, or more speculation. :)')
