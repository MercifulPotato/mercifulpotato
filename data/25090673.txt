But people actually from there have ways of navigating these obstacles.  There&#x27;s more potential for unpleasant surprises (for instance kidnappings) but if you know the lay of the land you can do alright.  Maybe not advance that fast, these societies are not very upwardly mobile unless you&#x27;re really REALLY acclimated and subscribed to the system, but they&#x27;re still functioning societies of humans that need to get along, and if you can be cool, you can get along too.<p>What some Americans think they&#x27;re entitled to do, which I&#x27;ve seen people try to do for instance in Small Claims court in US, is penetration test the legal system.  They want to hack the legal code, instead of obeying fuzzy norms, common sense, suasion, and avoiding hacks that are seem too good to be true, they are magnetically attracted to these hacks. They then feel cheated when a judge oversteps his power ever so slightly to protect the integrity of the system from hacking.<p>Get real, China has tons of experience with usury, which is itself an Advanced Persistent Threat of the legal system and society, and if the borrowers wanted to default, the courts and social fabric would be what made the lenders whole.  So of course the Chinese government is entitled to kill the IPO, it&#x27;s a shitty and usurious IPO, and they&#x27;ll be the ones holding the bag, so better to nip it in the bud.')
