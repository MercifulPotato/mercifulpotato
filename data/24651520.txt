If he&#x27;s full-time on both, then he&#x27;s having the taxes deducted from his wages.  In fact, he&#x27;ll get a refund at the end of the year because he&#x27;s overpaying FICA (6% up to $110k on both jobs, when his maximum contribution should just be 6% up to $110k (not exact numbers)).<p>If he&#x27;s a contractor, then he has to pay estimated taxes on both jobs, just like someone would with 1 job.<p>In either case, as long as he does proper accounting like anyone with 1 job would need to, he&#x27;ll be fine in the IRS&#x27;s eyes.')
