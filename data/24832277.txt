With Mumble, the maximum audio bitrate is set by the server, and many servers set it low to save money on bandwidth, which sometimes ends up being as low as telephone quality.  I used to run a Mumble server and had the bitrate set to maximum (I think 128 kbit&#x2F;sec?), which is absolute overkill for simple voice communications, but it&#x27;s not like a single server uses much bandwidth.  I ran it on a Raspberry Pi for a couple years.<p>As for latency, not sure how low you expect latency to be.  I haven&#x27;t measured Discord&#x27;s latency, but I can&#x27;t imagine it being much more than 100 ms.')
