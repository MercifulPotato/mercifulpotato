If it allows for painless international travel then I&#x27;ll get right away.  While covid-19 is no where near as deadly as yellow fever, in my mind it&#x27;s not much different if there&#x27;s access restrictions.  I always had to carry my yellow card but I can&#x27;t recall actually having to show it to anyone even when it&#x27;s clearly listed as an entry restriction.<p>Governments and corporations have a very good history of doing shady stuff and rushing things when they shouldn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s not wrong to be sceptical based on history.  To me it&#x27;s about evaluation of risk profile and what you want to do.')
