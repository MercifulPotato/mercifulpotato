If you can live comfortably in a region with a personal car then it is a significantly different metric than you can live comfortably without a personal car.<p>Also the way the U.S is structured living comfortably without a personal car means you must be living somewhere where you can work without that personal car, which is a rare job to have, meaning that you can be locked into your employer.
