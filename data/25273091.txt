For example, you cannot, on one hand, advertise that you have a competitive feature (Google Functions competing with AWS Lambda), but then, on the other hand, turn around and label it beta and basically use that an an excuse for inferior reliability and inferior documentation. How can you basically GA a major piece of platform functionality, call it <i>beta</i>, and then ask any enterprise (that has lower risk tolerance) to use it? Enterprises don&#x27;t want to invest into beta-labelled features, because they know it&#x27;s an excuse for bugs and half-baked support. No wonder GCP is struggling for adoption.<p>(&quot;beta release&quot; level is a conversation you have with select trusted partners that are willing to tolerate your early stuff in exchange for early access to value... it is not something that is acceptable to advertise as open enrollment to all)')
