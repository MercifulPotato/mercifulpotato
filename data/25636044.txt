Of course it might not be universal. In my experience it went as follows:<p>Union members automatically pay dues. They have the <i>option</i> of paying more dues. Someone who paid the automatic dues went to the union for help. Each time, they were urged to opt in to paying more dues. They chose not to, and were left waiting for help. When they finally chose to increase their dues, the help suddenly materialized.<p>And sure, most speech surrounding the bullying isn&#x27;t direct. Would you expect it to be explicit? That simply isn&#x27;t how any remotely intelligent person makes illegal threats. But it&#x27;s pretty easy to pick up on the tone of <i>&quot;hey it&#x27;s a nice job you have here. It would be a shame if something were to happen to it&quot;</i><p>I support unions, I think they provide a net benefit to workers, but power structures frequently attract people more interested in wielding the power than in the purpose that power is suppose to serve. I see too much of a tendency in supporters of unions to overlook this fact, with any criticism dismissed as &quot;you don&#x27;t support the workers!&quot;. (Note: I&#x27;m not accusing you of that. We appear to be having a reasonable discussion)')
