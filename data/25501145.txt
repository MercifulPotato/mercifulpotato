Historically speaking, Apple has usually made sure all their ducks are in a row before launching something, whether it&#x27;s going into processor design, audio, or launching a credit card. There&#x27;s quite a bit of chess pieces that were put into position first, and a lot of that was done via hiring, acquisitions, and partnerships.

In other words, they seem to understand when they don&#x27;t understand.<p>With BMW declining to be a partner all those years ago (allegedly), it makes sense to me that they would put their plans on the back burner. I&#x27;m still skeptical that they can (or want to) do this without a major manufacturing partner, but we&#x27;ll see.
