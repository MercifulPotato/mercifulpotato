Would love some support!<p>Before building Paraglide, I asked myself the question: why aren&#x27;t more people automating machine learning, even-though the tools exist? After talking to hundreds of users, the answer was obvious. The tools that exist right now are all the same. They force you to work completely hands off, and give their platform full control! Paraglide is different. You can customize exactly what you want, and let us handle the rest! We&#x27;ve built it in layers, the natural language grammar + custom modules, to help users of all expertise levels customize the AI pipeline.<p>At this stage, I&#x27;m primarily just looking for feedback. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve made the service so cheap compared to its competitors. Would love to have you on the API trying it out!')
