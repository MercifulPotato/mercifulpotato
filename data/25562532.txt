This workflow also upgrades the T2 chip on Mac mini to the latest BridgeOS version if needed. It may take 30-60 mins for this scrubbing workflow to complete, and up to 2-4 hours if BridgeOS update is required - during which the host shows up in &quot;pending&quot; state. We&#x27;re actively working on lowering this scrubbing duration and really appreciate your feedback here. Important to note - You are not billed for any duration(s) during which the Mac1 Dedicated Host is in &quot;pending&quot; state (or any state other than &quot;Available&quot;).<p>2. Once you have increased the size of the EBS volume on your Mac1 instance,  you can execute following commands within macOS guest to increase the size of your APFS container.<p>1.

Accept the prompt with &quot;y&quot;, then paste this command<p>sudo diskutil apfs resizeContainer $APFSCONT 0<p>Since the EBS volume was resized after boot, an instance reboot is required before the additional disk size is available for your use.')
