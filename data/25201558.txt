(on the same device)<p>I also tried being a &quot;marginally&quot; attractive woman one time and the results were stunning.  100&#x27;s of matches in the first hour.  Even creating an account with male pictures easily 5-6x as attractive as me yielded meager results at best (1-2 matches per day).<p>I will say, these apps work better in large cities.  However, the real reason I suspect my account was banned, was from me realizing you get a default &quot;boost&quot; on your account for the first 24-48hrs (seems to be the case both on Tinder and Bumble).  If you really want results, just keep deleting and re-creating your account after results start to fall off after a few days.')
