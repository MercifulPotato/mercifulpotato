Train researchers to be engineers. Not the other way around.<p>I wish you luck though. We’ll see in ten years whether programmers are as effective as researchers, or whether researchers are as effective as programmers. In 60 some years of computing, no one has achieved the latter, despite many attempts.<p>Also, I was surprised that this webpage is basically a waitlist and nothing else. No discussion of technique, no docs, no substance. Just a “you like pytorch? Pytorch rules!” type hype.<p>I do like pytorch, but I also like knowing one or two substantive points about what the proposal here is. If you want to train a model from your laptop, it’s a matter of applying to TFRC and kicking off a TPU.<p>The whole ecosystem is in need of massive overhaul. I like the ambition. But I dislike trying to pretend we aren’t programmers. ML is programming, and pretending otherwise will always cause massive, avoidable delays.')
