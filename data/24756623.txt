Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602522401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755884, text='Yeah, see, that&#x27;s kind of the point.  You censor a movement calling for genocide (or, more precisely, denying a genocide in the past).  But if you&#x27;re going to do that, do <i>all</i> of them.  Censor Turkey denying the Armenian genocide.  Censor those who sweep Stalin&#x27;s crimes under the rug.  Censor those who try to minimize the death toll of the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap forward.  Censor those who say that the Europeans&#x27; conquest of the Americas was anything other than a genocide.<p>And, if we were 50 years ago, censor the communists calling for global revolution.  That&#x27;s not a call for genocide, exactly, but it&#x27;s a call for a lot of death, and for destruction of a <i>class</i> of people, which is in the same camp.<p>But the problem is, once you do that, do you stop there?  Or do you say, well, the Soviets are behind this &quot;civil rights&quot; agitation, so we have to censor that, too?  And this &quot;gay rights&quot; stuff is corrupting the morals of our youth, so we have to censor that?<p>And even if <i>you</i> say, no, violence only, don&#x27;t censor anything else, somebody else is going to push for it to go further.  How do you know that your viewpoint (violence only) is going to win?  You don&#x27;t.<p>So be very careful about calling for censorship, even of things that you are sure are wrong.  Soon enough it will be applied to things you&#x27;re sure are right.')
