A little bit of effort to start with, but it made my personal relationship with time much more coherent.  Now I&#x27;m free to concentrate till an alarm goes off, and then I switch what I&#x27;m doing and my time is better managed.  And I can look at my home clocks and have a very good idea of where I am in the day&#x2F;night cycle that feels most natural to me.  Essentially I invented my own personal time that best suites my own requirements.')
