Item(by='kevingadd', descendants=None, kids=[24726509], score=None, time=1602214171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726424, text='It sounds like your wife doesn&#x27;t like the collective she&#x27;s a part of. Welcome to collective bargaining. You don&#x27;t get to pick and choose who is allowed to vote in your local elections, and you don&#x27;t get to pick and choose which of your coworkers are entitled to representation. If there are bad people in your employee collective, that is mostly a rebuke of the employer for hiring bad people. Or are you arguing that unions somehow turn good people into bad ones? Is a person&#x27;s only incentive for improvement in life getting an extra $1k&#x2F;yr? Personal satisfaction and desire for growth don&#x27;t exist, people don&#x27;t care about their customers?<p>While I&#x27;m happy to not hate any of my current coworkers (for once!) almost every team I&#x27;ve been on has had some bad apples. Unions have nothing to do with that, and I&#x27;d still rather my workplace be unionized if it meant the more vulnerable members of the team were protected even if my least-favorite colleagues could exploit it for their own benefit. I&#x27;ve seen too many people mistreated by employers to think that unions can&#x27;t be helpful.')
