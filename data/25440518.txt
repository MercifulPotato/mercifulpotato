Taking cash&#x2F;check isn&#x27;t possible on the web and Bitcoin poses the kind of barrier to entry that will surely lose you at least half of your customers.<p>Imagine being a rather large consumer electronics web store. You&#x27;re doing very well, with a good brand loyalty and major part of the market and pride yourself on fast delivery times. Suddenly, your credit card processor drops you because you sold an electronic sex toy that one time and that&#x27;s against Jesus or whatever. Now the only way to get paid is through bank transfers (takes up to 2 days to go through, fees, pain in the ass) or cash at delivery (huge fee, need to withdraw cash in advance). There are 3 other stores in your market that never made that fatal mistake - who do you think will still buy from you? You&#x27;re left with only a handful of business customers.
