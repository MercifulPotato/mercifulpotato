Item(by='mewse', descendants=None, kids=[25975546], score=None, time=1612061987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975307, text='&gt; Why can&#x27;t we speak figuratively anymore?<p>Because it’s less than a month since people stormed the US capital, literally erecting a guillotine and literally calling for politicians they disliked to be hanged.  How is this hard for you to understand?<p>If you want to speak figuratively, then maybe don’t do it using exactly the same speech that other people are demonstrably using and acting upon literally.<p>EDIT:  “gallows”.  I meant “gallows”, not “guillotine”.  That’s an embarrassing mistake which will now live in my comment history forever!')
