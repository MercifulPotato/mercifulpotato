It requires you to search the same query again for some reason.<p>Maybe this is an experiment of some sort, I&#x27;m not sure. \nAgain, this doesn&#x27;t happen on a VPN, but happens on my ip address.<p>And no corporate settings interfere with the browser, it&#x27;s the personal device I tried on.<p>Another thing: when you search for &quot;names database&quot; on DDG there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any results. No matter how much you try. I haven&#x27;t found another query that yielded the same results.')
