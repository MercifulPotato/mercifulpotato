Item(by='zests', descendants=None, kids=[25364501], score=None, time=1607545627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363776, text='I will come out and say I have not looked at a single court case nor do I look at Trump twitter nor do I read any social media beyond Hacker News. My interest in politics is not partisan. I am not here to debate the likelihood of any sort of fraud because internet debates about this kind of thing are pointless.<p>The rationalistic question is something along the lines of &quot;how do you adjust your priors of voter fraud based on the rhetoric of the party alleged of committing the fraud.&quot; The lazy answer is &quot;your voter fraud prior should always be zero.&quot; Is that the right answer? There&#x27;s are interesting discussions to be had here. They likely cannot be had on Hacker News.<p>Many people have beliefs about Trump where, IF I had the same beliefs I&#x27;d totally be on board with voter fraud to get him out of office.')
