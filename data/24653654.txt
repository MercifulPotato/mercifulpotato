Context is going to be everything.<p>Could someone convicted of murder be worth hiring? Yeah, sure, I&#x27;m not willing to say that that&#x27;s not the case - what if they had an untreated medical condition, just as one potential contextual element? It&#x27;s not worth discussing because it will end up with a &quot;but what if but what if but what if&quot;.<p>The point I will definitely make is the original point I made - that if I determine someone to be a racist that is important to me, and if I find that someone is a criminal I will need more context before I determine that it is important to me.')
