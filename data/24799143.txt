[0]<p>There&#x27;s an argument to be made that it should be covered by cyber-attack laws. You aren&#x27;t allowed to deliberately take control of someone else&#x27;s computer without their permission.<p>Consider a hypothetical example: an author without use of their hands, who uses text-to-speech to write books and to control their computer. Imagine if they put you on speakerphone and you read out a sequence of commands to delete their work. That certainly wouldn&#x27;t be covered under freedom of expression.<p>There&#x27;s an obvious difference in degree, as spamming someone by hijacking their smart speaker isn&#x27;t all that costly, but it&#x27;s similar in category.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Burger_King_advertising#2000s%E2%80%932010s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Burger_King_advertising#2000s%...</a>')
