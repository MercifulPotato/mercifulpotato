But a keyboard is a keyboard, same with mice and trackpads or whatever; I can get around, remind myself to hit control instead of command, use a few less shortcuts, get stuff done.<p>But when I use an Android device I&#x27;m just... lost. Nothing works the way I expect, I don&#x27;t like it and I don&#x27;t want to learn. I can&#x27;t even type on the damn things.<p>None of that is Android&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s because in the first case, the muscle memory is the input device, in the second case, the muscle memory is the operating system.')
