Who are they? This is just pure speculation. Do you have a study which quantifies the Canitillon effect?<p>Likely many people are saving a little bit of extra money because the whole COVID situation is <i>pretty nuts</i> and it&#x27;s leaving people scared. This has reduced velocity, and printing made up for it. More than likely it&#x27;s everyone who saved a little extra for the rainy day fund, and everyone got a little extra stimulus.<p>JPow didn&#x27;t just walk up to some guy on the street and hand him a check for 25% of the entire US M2 money supply, that&#x27;s not how this works, and further, concentrated wealth positions like that decrease velocity! That&#x27;s the effect the Fed is trying to counter! To increase velocity the money has to be disbursed.<p>There&#x27;s a case to be made in [1] (Sumner) that the Cantillon effect, while it exists, is irrelevant as it doesn&#x27;t really matter who gets the money first.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;note-some-recent-misinterpretations-cantillon-effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mises.org&#x2F;library&#x2F;note-some-recent-misinterpretation...</a>')
