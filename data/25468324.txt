The reason I bring this up is that I have some friends with PS4&#x2F;XB1 consoles that say it&#x27;s playable with a few bugs...nothing like the videos of potato quality graphics. I can only figure the difference between the two could just be the age of the console&#x2F;dust build up, etc. I&#x27;m not sure.')
