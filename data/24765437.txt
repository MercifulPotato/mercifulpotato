Item(by='cure', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602596303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764934, text='&gt; % The FSF, through their &quot;Respects your Freedom&quot; hardware rubber-stamping program and its absolutely broken requirements, which actively encourages reduction in user freedom, makes it much harder to detect hidden proprietary backdoors, and hurts projects that are actually aiming for maximum openness, have amply proved that they are not infallible and are not to be trusted without careful review of their policies and projects. I can go into a whole different tangent about this, but my point is, don&#x27;t treat the FSF as the good guys by default. Look at what it is they&#x27;re doing exactly and all of its consequences.<p>It sounds like you are angry with the FSF, not sure why.<p>As for your claims: RYF rubber stamping? RYF reduces user freedom? RYF makes it harder to detect hidden proprietary backdoors? None of these statements make a lot of sense. You&#x27;re going to need to provide a whole lot more information to back them up.')
