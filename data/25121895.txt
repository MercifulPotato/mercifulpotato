I actually love this idea immediately. It encapsulates something I kind of already wanted when using HTTPS Everywhere.<p>This doesn’t guarantee the transport is end-to-end secure; I’m sure plenty will strip the encryption at an LB and then possibly send it back over the internet. But, I think it’s a good addition nevertheless. Here’s to hoping for more DoH and encrypted SNI adoption as well. No good reason to leave anything unencrypted if it doesn&#x27;t have to be.<p>(I’m less happy with Firefox’s approach to DoH rollout, but I’m still glad to see DoH gaining some traction. Let’s hope the end result is worth it...)')
