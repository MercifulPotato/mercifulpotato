The comparatively archaic method of\ntwo-handed drilling was replaced by the more efficient\nbow drill (Ibid.: 62). The process of stationary drilling,\ni.e., with the help of the bow drill, did not leave signs\nof drill vibration. These progressive features have\nbeen noted on the Denisova bracelet. It constitutes\nunique evidence on an unexpectedly early employment\nof two-sided fast stationary drilling during the Early\nUpper Paleolithic. All of the other known Paleolithic\nimplements with signs of drilling bear features\nsuggesting relatively slow drilling with a considerable\ndrill vibration.&quot;')
