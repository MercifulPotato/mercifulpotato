When I was living healthy - cooking good meals, getting ample exercise and sleep, there was essentially zero free time. I was doing every group twice a week, and 2-5 hrs of cardio weekly, which might seem like a lot, but technically that&#x27;s a pretty basic routine; and what&#x27;s generally recommended.<p>I&#x27;m totally out of shape now, partially because it winds up being very unsustainable. I&#x27;m not working crazy hours at all, but I basically had to eat my meal, do chores, and immediately go to bed. I could probably swing 0.5-2 hours of leisure and that left 5-8 hrs of sleep. There&#x27;s a ton of corners that can be cut, but there&#x27;s always a penalty.<p>I love working out and work. If my body&#x2F;mind could tolerate it, I&#x27;d work for 10 hrs, exercise for 4, a few hours for relaxing with family&#x2F;friends, and 9 hrs of sleep, but that would take like 30 hrs (technically only 23-25 hrs listed there, but there&#x27;s overhead, travel, and chores)')
