The concept seems really cool. I haven&#x27;t tried it, but looking at it, my guess in reality it&#x27;s a bit awkward to use and probably ends up being more frustrating than fun.<p>Current VR just seems not quite immersive enough to feel real or worth using for most things but slightly too immersive so that it ends up being unnerving after a while.<p>The lack of tactile stimulation doesn&#x27;t help either. I think if they could come up with some kind of gloves that could simulate pressure and touch, that worked reliably as controllers, VR would become more popular.')
