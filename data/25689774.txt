Out of 40K people (some say much higher) there were some 100 or so who actually &quot;stormed&quot; the Capitol building, which is to say they walked past the barricades that the cops helpfully moved out of the way for unexplained reasons, and stood on the steps shouting &amp; taking pictures etc., and a very small subset of these people actually broke a window and entered the building.  This is all based on video footage from many witnesses.  In the end, some 50-60 people were arrested and one unarmed woman was shot dead by a cop inside the building and there are clear videos of this appalling incident.  I don&#x27;t condone or defend any of these morons for trespassing and my understanding is that 99% of the crowd were yelling at them not to trespass, not to break the window, and there are eyewitnesses now saying a handful, maybe 6-10 of them, were actually antifa agitators trying to stir up violence.<p>Anyway, regardless, yes I agree that some people were violent assholes and they deserve to be prosecuted.  However, this still doesn&#x27;t justify cutting off websites that serve millions of people.  Or even websites that serve 1 person.  You either have fair and equal treatment for all law abiding people, or you have none at all.')
