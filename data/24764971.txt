Linux, Windows and MacOS all were behind in different aspects (and of course ahead in some others) but then developed into entirely different directions. I would like to have seen the ideas of AmigaOS ca. &#x27;92 developed further (instead of just merely keeping it alive and adding a new UI skin from time to time). Instead the command line and UI drifted further apart in all surviving operating systems.')
