By 2007, the overwhelming majority of copyrights were not held by Linus and lots of the code was already licensed as GPLv2-only (not to mention that tracking down copyright holders pre-Git would&#x27;ve been basically impossible -- and that&#x27;s before you start worrying about bankrupt companies or people who&#x27;ve passed away). Switching licenses is incredibly hard, and in my view it was a mistake to make GPL upgrades opt-in (they should&#x27;ve been opt-out as is the case with the Mozilla Public License).<p>I also broadly disagree with the argument that if the Linux community (or in this case, Linus) is against something then it is not a reasonable thing to put in the GPL. A reminder that the <i>official policy</i> of the Linux Foundation and lead maintainers is to avoid GPL enforcement at all costs[+] -- meaning that by this reasoning, the GPLv2 having any enforcement provisions at all is &quot;too scary&quot;.<p>[+] GregKH has spoken on this quite a few times. I don&#x27;t disagree with their view that enforcement reduces the chance of recurring contributions (which is what they actually care about), but it does mean that Linux&#x27;s usage of the GPLv2 is more akin to MIT but with some extra public shaming if a company doesn&#x27;t provide sources.')
