The copy operation on a refcounted ref increments the refcount at the object it&#x27;s referring to. The references themselves are values. Another way of looking at this--in C++ the copy constructor of std::shared_ptr. Move semantics as generally applied across values, when applied to such references, is what gives rise to the refcount elison stuff (the move constructor of std::shared_ptr does no increment).')
