And that means only one of the two proposers can obtain the required majority of votes to start sending Accept messages, and thus only one of the two values can be accepted by any acceptor.<p>Maybe read the papers on Paxos, like the &quot;Paxos Made Simple&quot; one, it&#x27;s not too big (though it&#x27;s not all that simple either, at least to me...).')
