I don&#x27;t think this is remotely a major benefit compared to e.g. state taxes.<p>Well, while working in RTP I saw many suits filed for my coworkers for non-compete clauses.<p>If you&#x27;re ~director or above, this matters a lot and the bigco&#x27;s basically auto file the lawsuit in any jurisdiction where enforceable. At least one exec I reported to had to take a year off as a result of these lawsuits.<p>IMO it&#x27;s a huge deal for the HQ execs of many companies, similar to how tax benefits are a huge deal to the rank-and-file.')
