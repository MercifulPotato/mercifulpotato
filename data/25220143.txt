Most people can create an old-school website with a little effort using few or basic tools, but creating something that can host a community is&#x2F;was much harder. phpbb was about the limit.<p>It&#x27;s almost an inversion - instead of many community sites, there are many users together on a smaller number of community groups, which are generally built on social platforms such as reddit and Facebook which make it easy to create them. It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, except that the most invested people in the communities don&#x27;t have ownership of the platform or the data, so the communities that matter to them are vulnerable to any arbitrary changes in what the platform owners choose to do.')
