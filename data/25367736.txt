Item(by='rglover', descendants=None, kids=[25367871], score=None, time=1607560120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25366948, text='&gt; We&#x27;re expected to believe some Podunk in the middle of Podubkstan has more access to facts?<p>Certain facts, yes. A lot of great minds are disconnected from institutions and corporations (Gwern comes to mind-<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;index" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;index</a>). And when some of the things they&#x27;ve taken the time to research or present arguments on go against the preferred narrative of those institutions, now, they can be disappeared with this decision as precedent.<p>Putting that into an example: say Corporation X releases a new frozen food that triggers a rare autoimmune disease leading to death in certain people. A small-town doctor (&quot;Podunk&quot;) has experience with that disease, understands why the food triggers the response it does, and speaks out.<p>If Corporation X doesn&#x27;t like that message, with moves like this, now it will be justified (or at least, rationalized) to get rid of that doctor&#x27;s information. The argument you&#x27;re presenting here—that they&#x27;re not credentialed enough—means more people are ultimately in harm&#x27;s way.')
