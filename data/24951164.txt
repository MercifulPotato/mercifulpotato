All the way into my late 20s I never got up earlier than midday and went to sleep in the small hours. But now I don&#x27;t. I get up at the same time every day and try not to stay up too late at night. This has dramatically improved my happiness and performance. Back then I used to be depressed. It&#x27;s a lonely life when you&#x27;re nocturnal. There were days in the winter where I literally wouldn&#x27;t see any daylight for days at a time.<p>I remember reading about delayed sleep phase disorder and non-24 disorder and thinking I must have it. It made me think this was somewhat normal and even made me think I might be a victim of sorts. But really what has fixed this for me is just discipline and structure. No drugs. No therapy. No crying about my woes and how difficult it is for someone like me. Just good old-fashioned discipline.')
