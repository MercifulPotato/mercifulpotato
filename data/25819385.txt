This is the typical landscape of much of Japan, much of China, especially coastal, much of Europe.<p>It&#x27;s not much of North America, though, except a few coastal agglomerations. North America is quite sparsely populated â€” maybe not as sparsely as Siberia or Sahara, but not near European levels, to say nothing of Japan or south of China, so high-speed rail makes relatively little sense here.')
