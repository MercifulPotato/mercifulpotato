Item(by='emilecantin', descendants=None, kids=[25575591], score=None, time=1609273984, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574147, text='&gt; braking is more evenly distributed among the 4 wheels since the drive shafts are locked.<p>There is something seriously wrong about either my understanding of how cars work, or yours.<p>I have brake disks and brake pads on all 4 wheels of my (FWD) car; pretty much every car does. How would a drive-shaft help &quot;distribute&quot; braking power? The limiting factor here isn&#x27;t the force each brake can exert on their wheel (they&#x27;re pretty much always able to lock up), it&#x27;s the traction between the wheel and the ground (the tire).<p>In my mind, an &quot;ideal&quot; emergency braking scenario would be all 4 wheels braking at the maximum force they can without slipping, and that can be done much better by the ABS system when they&#x27;re all disconnected from each other. A driveshaft connecting them would be irrelevant at best, but more likely it&#x27;s a nuisance.')
