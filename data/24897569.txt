The Doc object is backed by Cython data structures, so it&#x27;s more memory efficient and faster than Python equivalents you&#x27;d likely write yourself.<p>I also think our pipeline stuff is a bit more mature than the one in transformers. The transformers pipeline class is relatively new, so I do think our Language object offers a better developer experience.<p>I think the new training config and improved train command will also be appealing to people, especially with the projects workflow.<p>The improved transformers support in v3 is very new, it&#x27;s only just released in beta form. I do hope people find it useful, but of course no library or solution is ideal for every use-case, so I definitely encourage people to pick the mix of libraries that seems right to them.')
