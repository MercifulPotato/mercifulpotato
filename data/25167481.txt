It is clear that untruncated LCGs have very predictable lower bits by the definition and don&#x27;t have &quot;perfectly good statistical properties&quot; by its own (it would have been fine if untruncated LCGs weren&#x27;t wildly popular though). One of PCG&#x27;s biggest contributions to me is a distinct name given to LCG plus tampering so that we can avoid the ambiguous &quot;LCG&quot; label.')
