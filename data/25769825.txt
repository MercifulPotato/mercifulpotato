While individual contributors earn less the social safety net also makes it much easier to found and grow a business without the threat of death and guarantees a peaceable minimum standard of living. It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that salary, especially at high seniority levels, becomes a smaller and smaller part of total compensation.')
