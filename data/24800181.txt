And we should also ask not just them but their peers on how likely they think the prediction is to come true. It&#x27;s not impressive to identify an existing trend and say that it will continue; all of Kurzweil&#x27;s peers would have been able to see that. Similarly, it&#x27;s not impressive to keep kicking the can down the road as a prediction eventually becomes truer, but only 50-100 years behind the timeline the visionary implied. Ultimately if the prediction doesn&#x27;t follow fairly rigorous criteria, it&#x27;s neither falsifiable nor impressive.')
