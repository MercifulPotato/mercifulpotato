Like even small quantities?  I used to love them, and ate lots of them. Not just Cavendish, but other varieties too when I could get them. I find they all do this to me now and it&#x27;s worsened over the years. Annoyingly when I search for information on bananas and headaches I always find articles proclaiming them as a cure for headaches, not a cause.')
