I just wanted to point out that it’s some of us on HN too, and it’s not always the ones you might expect. I have a job, friends, and supportive family. But a swirl of feelings can overwhelm me without warning, and the memory of all the times I’ve failed to reach help before can stop me from trying again. I was hospitalized this year with suicidal thoughts and a diagnosis of “Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features.” I expect to continue succeeding on the outside, but the internal battle is far from over. Again, I want to stress that most people can’t even fathom that anything is wrong with me. I have a good job, talents, people who care about me. But there’s some defect in my makeup (nature or nurture, who knows?) and your willingness here to be more aware of people like me is really heartening.<p>Note for the concerned: I am receiving treatment and a number of people in my circle are aware of the struggle, so this isn’t a cry for help. I just thought this might enrich the discussion for anyone not familiar with these things who would like to understand them better.')
