I understand there are some implementation details, such as inheriting from a Record base class, and how it handles serialization. But I mean as a user.<p>Can records implement interfaces?\nCan records be variants in a sealed class hierarchy?\nCan records have a private primary constructor?\nCan I customize the getters (to e.g., make defensive copies)?<p>For other people reading, the answers for Kotlin data classes are: Yes, Yes, Not Really, No.<p>As an aside, I understand you are an Oracle employee. When you post under this username are you acting in any kind of official capacity for Oracle? Like, is part of your job, so to speak, to have a social media presence? I&#x27;m not suggesting anything negative- it&#x27;s totally fair to invest in outreach, to answer questions, clarify things, etc. I was just curious if I&#x27;m talking to &quot;a guy who loves the project he works on&quot; or &quot;a representative of a company&quot;.')
