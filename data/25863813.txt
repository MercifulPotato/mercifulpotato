Standing and helping people get the products they needed for their project was a nice change from sitting at a desk and staring at a screen all day. Pretty soon the $10&#x2F;hr and 60hr (combined) weeks make it so it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>Now I&#x27;m a beekeeper in my spare time. I sell honey and candles. I also sell other craft items. That&#x27;s not really worth it either, but it could be good for a retirement job.')
