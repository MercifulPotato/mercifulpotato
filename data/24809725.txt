So giving them less than they say they need is the <i>normal state of affairs</i> for government agencies.<p>The only difference is that now the aggrieved bureaucrats have a receptive audience in credulous journalists who are always ready to write a story about how the current administration is &quot;ending democracy&quot; if they don&#x27;t do exactly what the bureaucrats want. So you would expect right wing media doing stories on how the military, the VA or the border patrol is underfunded or has had excessive &quot;political  interference&quot; during Democrat administrations, and left wing media (which is 95% of the &quot;mainstream&quot; media on the US) would be expected to say the same about different parts of the government with a republican administration.<p>Just normal politics at work - doesn&#x27;t mean the stories aren&#x27;t important, but let&#x27;s keep things in context.')
