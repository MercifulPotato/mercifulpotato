It&#x27;s not fixed at 16, it&#x27;s still subject to a high likelihood of change in one direction or another at that age.<p>I think the main value of IQ on a societal level, besides identifying individuals that need help, is in recognizing that people just innately have differing abilities and, without any external influence necessary, will have different outcomes. There is a narrative being pushed very hard currently that differences in outcome between groups automatically implies discrimination, and fundamentally it&#x27;s hard to argue with that logic unless you&#x27;re able to accept that there are just innate differences between people and groups that cause them to have different abilities and make different choices.')
