Dealing with a large insurer, we have no problems with being denied coverage, timely prior approvals, and while some of the copays are high, they are not unreasonable for the plan he chose. Whenever I call, the agents are pleasantly helpful. My main complaint is with providers&#x27; fraudulent billing (&quot;cost&quot;: $500, &quot;adjustment&quot;: $390, insurance: $65, copay: $45), and the worst thing I&#x27;ve had to do was sometimes wait after receiving a billing nastygram, for the claims to settle out.<p>Of course he is of Medicare age, so this is a Medicare Advantage plan that is still bound by many of the Medicare rules and copay schedules. I can&#x27;t imagine going through the same thing with my own insurance.')
