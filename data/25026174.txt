In my native language, if I make up a word and speak it out loud to 100 people, there is a 99% chance that they all write it down exactly  as I invented it.<p>This is unthinkable in english and basically force your brain to learn two languages  (spoken and written) and in spoken language &quot;you&#x27;re&quot; and &quot;your&quot; are really not that different. If you write without focusing too much, you just write down spoken english.<p>I don&#x27;t know why I wrote this down! Just my experience.')
