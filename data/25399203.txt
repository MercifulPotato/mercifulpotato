It&#x27;s about whether we trust anyone to make decisions about what is right and not right for someone to say, because whoever has that power will inevitably abuse it.<p>If you feel fine about this now because you disagree with the person being silenced, then just try to imagine being on the other side of that - calling out what you perceive to be a great injustice only for someone to have the power to take away your voice completely.<p>This is not a constitutional argument, as Twitter isn&#x27;t government and not bound by first amendment, it&#x27;s a principles argument. If you support suppression of speech that&#x27;s &quot;obviously wrong&quot; to you, you&#x27;re gonna be in a lot of pain down the road when someone finds YOU obviously wrong.<p>Having been born and lived in the USSR, this is very real. A lot of folks who were on the &quot;right side of history&quot; in 1917 when it came to suppressing&#x2F;killing &quot;the obvious enemies of the people&quot;, found themselves against the wall in the 20s and 30s. Once you create a system that&#x27;s more powerful than people, it&#x27;s just a matter of time before it decides that you&#x27;re not good enough either.')
