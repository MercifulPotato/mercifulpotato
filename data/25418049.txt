In case of the first I wonder where that&#x27;s based on? Perhaps you even have a source?<p>I assume you mean &#x27;rain&#x27; in the most direct sense, as water that falls down directly on&#x2F;near the plants (as opposed to draining from a basin of water that &#x27;used to be rain&#x27;, which perhaps is true for many H2O molecules).<p>And would you say we have enough farmland that can be irrigated by rain (with some degree of consistency also in face of climate change) to feed the every growing population?')
