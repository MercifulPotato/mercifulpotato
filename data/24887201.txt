It&#x27;s a fairly classic &quot;strawman&quot; argument that is used to &quot;dehumanize&quot; people that suffer from mental illness, and also dehumanize people trying to help them. I know <i>many</i> people that would be in very dire straits, if not for medication, therapy, and <i>many</i> years of hard work.<p>I&#x27;m pretty upset by this, and by the reactions.<p>I am not a therapist. Just someone with &quot;skin in the game.&quot;<p>These aren&#x27;t &quot;data points.&quot; These are <i>people</i>, and chances are good that we all have folks in our orbit that have mental health issues.')
