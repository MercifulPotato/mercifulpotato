Have been doing it for nearly 6 years. Apart from some abstractions on integrations( eg. Dell Boomi, Mulesoft), anything a bit more complicated requires proper development. After a year of using low code only options I was like &quot;screw this,I need to learn programming&quot;, to do all the complex stuff I want to do. There a lots of ready baked UI components that can be used to build stuff but we are nowhere close to what some less technical people may think. It&#x27;s still lots of JS, Python,or Java behind all those fancy abstractions.')
