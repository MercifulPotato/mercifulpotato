The big win from GraphQL (vs REST) is flexibility: You don&#x27;t have to define all your endpoints up front. The client(s) can make the sorts of queries they want.<p>If you&#x27;re building a single page app frontend where most of the business logic is on the client side, it makes sense to empower the client to define the types of queries it wants to make.<p>If anything, running a GraphQL architecture seems like <i>less</i> maintenance burden to me, because it makes the server side API less rigid, so the coupling between client and server becomes looser.')
