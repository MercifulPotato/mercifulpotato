I&#x27;m also sure all of these but the last do much less (if any) harm to your health than alcohol does.<p>The only drugs I know which can be considered as or more dangerous than alcohol are opioids (except kratom - it&#x27;s considered opioid but is harmless unless you consume huge amounts regularly for too long), cocaine (if taken chronically), meth (if abused, can change life for good if used properly to treat severe ADHD cases) and bromo-dragonfly. LSD probably is dangerous for people who are borderline crazy - psychos may become more violent after taking it.')
