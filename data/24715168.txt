Item(by='naniwaduni', descendants=None, kids=[24716762], score=None, time=1602125426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24714613, text='Classifying the 形容動詞 stem as a noun is kind of nice for ... not getting a very confused intuition on what they do and how they work, because they really are more like 名詞 and&#x2F;or nouns in most senses†. Choosing to classify 形容詞 as a kind of verb is a bit of an odder, best-kind-of-correct sort of take, since their conjugation paradigm is a bit removed from the usual &quot;verb&quot; paradigms, and it makes me kind of wonder whether they&#x27;d call the stems of サ変 compounds &quot;su(ru)-nouns&quot;. But it&#x27;s kind of a logical step to jump to if you&#x27;re going to call 形容動詞 &quot;na-nouns&quot;, I guess.<p>(The page gets 形容動詞 and 形容詞 mixed up, though, which isn&#x27;t a <i>great</i> sign.)<p>As for why you&#x27;d want to avoid calling them adjectives, basically, calling both &quot;adjectives&quot; would make it sound like these two groups kinds of lemmas make up a coherent lexical category. At least for anglophones, &quot;adjective&quot; is a word that only comes when discussing &quot;grammar&quot;, and that carries the implication that the &quot;adjective&quot; classification has something to do with &quot;grammar&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not. There is no morphological similarity between 形容詞 and 形容動詞; the similarity between them is purely semantic (and rather tenuous at that). The similarity between them and adjectives is likewise semantic, not morphological: they happen to be groupings of mostly descriptive words. And adjectives, likewise, happen to be a grouping of mostly descriptive words. But the word &quot;adjective&quot; reaches at a different characterizing property that makes bad abstraction: &quot;adjectives&quot; are actually almost a coherent word class.<p>Frankly, seeing the contortions people hallucinate up when they bring preconceived notions about how &quot;adjectives&quot; work, I can kind of sympathize with an attempt to drill in the point that 形容動詞 stems are basically nouns, 形容詞 are basically verbs, and avoid all the nonsense around the concept of &quot;adjectives&quot;.<p>†There are a few features where nouns that refer to descriptive traits often differ from nouns that describe concrete objects (not to mention all the grammatical nouns—to wit, every single loanword—that are harder to classify as &quot;things&quot;), but the ability to form a 連体形 with -な certainly doesn&#x27;t make a clean cut of them. There are at least fair few that prefer to take -の while being semantically descriptive, for one, and a handful of more exotic types.')
