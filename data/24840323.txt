Let&#x27;s put the timing in perspective.<p>A commercial CPU production renderer, 3Delight, has timing for the Moana asset rendered at 4k on their website.[1]<p>Time: ~34 minutes.<p>I asked them for details about the settings they used before posting this as the page only lists resolution.<p>4k resolution, 64 (shading) samples per pixel (spp), ray depths: diffuse 2, specular 2, refraction 4 (or 3, 3, 5, depending how you count ray depth).\nMachine was a contemporary 24 core server at the end of 2018.\nMind you, the image is fine with 64 spp.\nSpp are hard to compare between renderers because optimizing path tracers is a lot about sampling.\nOne renderer will converge to something useable with 1k samples while another just needs 64.<p>The 3Delight example is rendering all the geometry as subdivision surfaces with displacement (and their own Ptex implementation for texture lookups).<p>Timing comparisons of a different scene with recent 24core desktop AMD CPUs suggest that this asset would render much faster in 2020.[2]<p>The timing shows the issue with GPUs vs CPUs for this kind of assets.\n5h for a 1k (!) resolution image with &lt;= 5 bounces and 1024 spp (samples per pixel).\nThat is terrible.\nNot using the real (subdivision) geometry and not using displacement.<p>I would love to see a breakdown how much of these 5hs is owed to the fact that the data doesn&#x27;t fit on the device.<p>Using subdivision surfaces and displacement mapping make the amount of geometry grow exponentially.\nI.e. the out of core handling would predictably take an exponentially larger part of the render time.<p>Looking at the numbers I regularly get to see when counseling VFX companies on their rendering pipelines I don&#x27;t see GPU offline rendering going anywhere for complex scenes.\nAnd even for simpler scenes where GPUs have an advantage still â€“ with the CPUs AMD is putting out recently the gap is becoming very tight and if you do the math you often pay dearly for having an image a few minutes earlier (not even double digit minutes or hours earlier).\nRegardless of what Nvidia&#x27;s marketing and some vendors who IMHO wasted years optimizing their renderers for a moving hardware target may want you to believe.<p>Regarding the latter: another point to consider is that you need to spend time working with&#x2F;around the hardware limitations&#x2F;bottlenecks of GPUs for this very the &quot;scene doesn&#x27;t fit on device&quot; use case.\nSomeone writing a CPU renderer can spend that time working on the actual renderer itself. This kind of software takes years to develop. Go figure.<p>Finally, as I expect this to be downvoted because of what I just said: don&#x27;t take my word for any of the above. Just try it yourself.<p>The Moana Asset can be downloaded at [3].\nA script to convert the entire asset and launch a 3Delight render can be had at [4].\nThe unlimited core version of the renderer can be downloaded for free, after registering with your email, at [5].<p>It renders with any number of cores your box has but it adds a watermark if no license is available.<p>Or you thy their cloud rendering. You get 1,000 free 24 core server minutes. Which is plenty to run this test.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3delight.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;display&#x2F;3DLC&#x2F;Cloud+Rendering+Speed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3delight.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;display&#x2F;3DLC&#x2F;Cloud+Re...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3delight.com&#x2F;page&#x2F;features&#x2F;2020-10-06-CPUbenchmark" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3delight.com&#x2F;page&#x2F;features&#x2F;2020-10-06-CPUbenchma...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disneyanimation.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;moana-island-scene&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;disneyanimation.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;moana-island-scene&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;3Delight&#x2F;moana-to-nsi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;3Delight&#x2F;moana-to-nsi</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3delight.com&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.3delight.com&#x2F;download</a>')
