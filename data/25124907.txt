One of the things that I really liked that I ended up rewriting at home was better highlighting, eg inside-the-line level highlighting like github etc. Also maybe it had native support for vertical split? Either way my at-home added that.\nNo idea if that&#x27;s still in gitless or if anyone else feels that way, but if I&#x27;m gonna live the cli life may as well make diffs comfortable for myself.')
