In fact, Adobe actually reduced the cost of their software significantly when they moved away from perpetual licensing. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s far healthier for a business to get $50&#x2F;mo out of you rather than thousands once in a blue moon.<p>The cost of CS6 Master Collection was around $2,500 or so; whereas a CC All Apps subscription is $53&#x2F;mo. The thing is, though, that Adobe frequently updated their software to newer versions that had significant backwards compatibility problems. That $2,500 would only get you about a year or two of &quot;the latest version&quot;, upon which you&#x27;d have to spend another $900 for an upgrade.<p>So Adobe went from a pricing model of effectively $2,500 + $450-900&#x2F;yr, to one of $53&#x2F;mo. Your first &quot;year&quot; of Adobe CSwhatever cost you $208&#x2F;mo, followed by upgrades which were effectively $37-75&#x2F;mo depending on how quickly Adobe released their software. Creative Cloud was and still is a bargain if you need Adobe&#x27;s software.<p>Sure, you could have just stuck with CS2 or 3, and amortized your software cost over multiple years. However, by doing that, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to practically collaborate with anyone else in the industry. The moment someone you work with updates from CS3 to CS4, all their files are going to start throwing weird errors and not working when you load them up in your older version. And remember: Adobe Creative Suite was THE standard in a lot of industries, it wasn&#x27;t like you could just insist everyone remembered to click the save-as-old-version option (if that was even available). Not upgrading was a business disadvantage.')
