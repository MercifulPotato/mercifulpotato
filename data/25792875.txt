It&#x27;s called &quot;Starving cancer&quot; by Jane McLelland. It talks about using over the counter drugs and supplements that have been studied for their metabolic blocking properties for cancer, as well as changing the diet to reduce as much as possible the nutrients that cancer craves the most according to their metabolic phenotype. Most of the times it&#x27;s glucose or glutamine, but the trick is to block as many metabolic pathways using the drugs so that mutation is prevented. Most of these drugs have their patents expired and are quite cheap. The author had a very aggressive form of cancer with less than 5% statistic survival rate and were able to survive and go back to NED (no evidence of disease). It&#x27;s not exactly a substitute for standard therapy such as chemo, but there&#x27;s many people who also went to NED just with her protocol.\nI tried this back when I had cancer, and even though my survival rate was very high just on standard care, my tumor markers went way down almost to normal on the first cycle combined with Jane&#x27;s protocol. \nUnfortunately, the cancer industry and pharmaceutical industry won&#x27;t really invest much money on clinical trials for expired patent, or even existing drugs in their portfolio. There are a couple of independent clinical trials going on, so far, with good results AFAIC.\nAnother very controversial, but interesting treatment for cancer that will probably never see the light is Chlorine Dioxide. And don&#x27;t you dare write that on Facebook or YouTube because it&#x27;ll be outright banned or deleted for &quot;spreading misinformation&quot;. I have friends and persons I know that went to NED just on chlorine dioxide and diet. Having used it myself for many months with no negative effects, and, after chemo, I can&#x27;t help but cringe every time someone tells me that it&#x27;s &quot;very toxic&quot;. Oh lord, you should have seen what chemo was like. Now, <i>that</i> was toxic.')
