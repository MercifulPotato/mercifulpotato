This complicates your servers, for sure, but pays dividends on performance&#x2F;scale.<p>How do you do that? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphql&#x2F;dataloader" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphql&#x2F;dataloader</a><p>However, to be super efficient you need to give up on some consistency.  You simply can&#x27;t have data points which join directly in the db.  Instead, you need to make separate parallel requests for those datapoints and let the dataloader be in charge of merging them into larger batches of requests for the db to fullfill.<p>This can result in some additional latency on a request, but ultimately provides the best way to be able to scale things out.<p>The benefit of rest is that it&#x27;s easier to make a really fast on single request endpoint.  You can precisely tune your db indexes to match your queries.  For graphql to be fast and not kill your DB with a malicious query, you need to introduce that wait time&#x2F;batching.')
