If Twitter and Facebook hadn&#x27;t been moderating hate speech, Parler would not exist. Posting voices and content which is banned on Twitter and Facebook is the single unique &quot;Feature&quot; of Parler.<p>Over the months, Amazon has been in contact with Parler&#x27;s management about moderating violent content and speech.<p>Facebook and Twitter have hosted content which incites violence and hate speech, but it&#x27;s far less common and they make (often grudging and half assed) efforts to remove it. On Parler, it&#x27;s accepted, arguably encouraged.')
