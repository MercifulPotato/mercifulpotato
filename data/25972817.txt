Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25973161], score=None, time=1612039449, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972544, text='You don&#x27;t pay income tax at tax time, it gets withheld from your paycheck on an ongoing basis.<p>Suppose you make $20,000&#x2F;month, i.e. $240,000&#x2F;year if you made that the whole year.<p>In January through March you make $20,000&#x2F;month. Under a UBI you receive $1000 but then pay $6000 in taxes, a net payment to the government of $5000&#x2F;month. Under a negative income tax you pay 5% on the first $4000 ($200) and 30% on the remaining $16,000 ($4800), and expect to receive no credit because it fully phased out, so a net payment to the government of $5000&#x2F;month. It&#x27;s the same.<p>In April through December you make nothing. Then you get the $1000 UBI&#x2F;credit and there is no tax. To receive the net money from the tax credit before the end of the year you would have to be able to claim it without a job, and to set your withholding amount to a negative number that month because you have no income. Which is theoretically possible (it would be what happens to anyone making &lt;$48,000&#x2F;year), and either way you still get the same total amount at the end of the year when you file your taxes and reconcile.')
