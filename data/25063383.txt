The faster you can cool down the pasta the less the interior will overcook.<p>I see no good reason this would have better heat exchange than an unrolled plane. It has a slightly lower surface area to mass ratio (assuming equal thicknesses), and I&#x27;d expect the ridges to be more likely to trap water and air, giving the pasta a higher thermal mass and&#x2F;or reduced pasta&#x2F;water boundary area. I&#x27;m not an expert though.')
