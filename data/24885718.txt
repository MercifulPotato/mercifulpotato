It&#x27;s literally in the name.<p>Please remember that to reverse this YouTube-dl needs to go through a court. Courts are not code that can be tricked by clever wording. If anything you&#x27;ll be trying to describe what it is to some old grandma who hasn&#x27;t got a clue what GitHub is never mind convincing them this software isn&#x27;t for downloading YouTube videos.<p>By all means everyone go on with coming up with clever interpretations of the law but you&#x27;re just farting into the wind<p>P.s downvoting my comments doesn&#x27;t change the way the law works either, but if it helps you feel good have at it :)')
