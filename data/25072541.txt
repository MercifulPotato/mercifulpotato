Ultimately this is a problem of law, markets, and norms rather than code (to draw on Lessig&#x27;s four laws) or individual choice.<p>Code itself may help <i>with</i> the backing of other factors, the more so if technical protections are legally required.  A huge problem is in establishing both the harms and relationships.<p>It struck me a few weeks ago that the major ills of information technology most often discussed --- censorship, propaganda, surveillance, and manipulation --- have one common root:  monopoly.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;7bfcf170eefc013863fa002590d8e506" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;7bfcf170eefc013863fa002590d8e...</a><p>Discussed on HN:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24771470" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24771470</a><p>(Not entirely original, though I&#x27;m unaware of anyone who&#x27;s put all four together.
