Yes, people listen to them.<p>It&#x27;s abundantly clear that the entire GOP coordinates with Fox News and other sources (reddit, FB, etc) to deliver consistent messages that are curated and on-brand.  So when I say politicians, I really mean this entire machination.<p>If the entire Conservative Messaging Platform decided to tackle this problem and encourage mask wearing, we could get a critical mass of people to do so.  They could have Laura Ingram, Rush Limbaugh, Mitch McConnell, and a bunch of lesser known pundits&#x2F;politicians harping on this day-in and day-out.  While having facebook and r&#x2F;conservative bots posting pro-mask memes.<p>We know this is an effective way of influencing behavior, because we&#x27;ve seen it work numerous times throughout the past decade. Too bad it&#x27;s never used for anything good.')
