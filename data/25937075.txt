They work. A lot more than people want to believe. Ads tell you how to be a man, how to be successful and admired by your peers, how to be attractive to potential partners, how to secure your future etc. Repeat it enough times and you will start to believe it. You probably believe that you need to eat meat for protein right? And that you should drink milk for calcium right? All BS successfully programmed into you through ads.')
