This has three big benefits: re-sequestration of extracted resources&#x2F;potential energy, removal of the possibility of ecosystem harm (breaking down into micro-plastics), and isolation from any future emergence of bacteria capable of breaking the material down (in effect a massive release of additional energy to the atmosphere).<p>Aside from recycling, perhaps this enzyme could be useful in reprocessing waste plastics en-mass for re-sequestration.<p>As we transition to use sustainable materials in lieu of plastic, and until we phase out the use of fossil fuels where plastics will continue to be a byproduct whether useful or not, we’re gonna need disposal solutions for plastic for some time.')
