Fox News&#x27;s huge banner headline was that Joe Biden had &quot;a bit of a cold&quot;.  This to me indicates an extreme bias.<p>This is not to say other MSM sources aren&#x27;t rife with bias--for example, all are staunchly pro-corporate, as they are owned by corporations.  But bias does come in degrees; we must continually try to be aware of biases in our media, but we shouldn&#x27;t treat all MSM as &quot;equally biased and equally bad&quot;.')
