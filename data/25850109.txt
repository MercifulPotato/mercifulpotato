This shouldn&#x27;t be kicking fedora down. It has a place, as does stream.<p>The point is that with CentOS you expect a super stable release. Red Hat replaced that with what is clearly a less stable project. And as was said before, if you used CentOS, it&#x27;s probably precisely because you want something super stable with long term support. Those are not the sorts of users who&#x27;ll want to use Stream.')
