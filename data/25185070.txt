I do believe the data model at the heart of git has a good change at being the last VCS data model. Apart from little details like the choice of hash function, there is little wrong with it. Git&#x27;s success despite its perception of being difficult to learn and use is a testament to that.<p>But we are long overdue a better porcelain for git. The standard CLI it comes with is just not good. Its level of abstraction is too high in a few places where it tries to make things seem not-too-dissimilar to &quot;old world&quot; VCS systems. And its too low in other places, for example tags are a great, flexible tool but the vast majority of users don&#x27;t use them or need them, they just need to mark releases. The fact I need to write something like &quot;git tag --annotate --sign&quot; instead of just &quot;git release&quot; is a silly.<p>I think a concerted effort to take what git is and what we do with (and forget old VCS systems) and reinvent the interface will create the closest to a successor to git. The only porcelain that is vaguely on the right track here is magit.')
