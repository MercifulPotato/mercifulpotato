The two main one&#x27;s I&#x27;d recommend are increasing the number of embark points (in init&#x2F;world_gen.txt#EMBARK_POINTS) so you can buy more starting resources, and increasing dwarves&#x27; speed (in raw&#x2F;objects&#x2F;creature_standard.txt#CREATURE:DWARF#APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION:STANDARD_&lt;x&gt;_GAITS), which just generally makes everything much easier, including increasing your fort&#x27;s economic productivity to give you better ability to absorb any disaster that do happen.<p>Your overall point stands though; we proudly call it a learning curve^Wcliff^Woverhang for good reason.')
