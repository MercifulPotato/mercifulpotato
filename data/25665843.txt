And yet, to do so, they may have to stop contributing in their usual, assigned role, but go &quot;above and beyond&quot; - such as redesigning the system, or to make their mark on the product and be recognized as such.<p>This, i find, is probably what the fundamental problem&#x2F;friction with teams are.')
