They touch up on retrofitting parking lots but there is so much out there that will need to be changed once huge parking lots are no longer needed. If I had to guess, places like Walmart and whatnot may end up building strip malls on the empty half of their lots to take advantage of that in population dense areas. Perhaps even just extend their storefronts out another 100&#x27;.')
