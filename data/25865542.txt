We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.<p>&gt; Recently, we found more examples of what we consider to be ethically challenged behavior. We have differentiated with proprietary features, and now we see these feature designs serving as &quot;inspiration&quot; for Amazon, telling us their behavior continues and is more brazen. NOT OK.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-license-change-AWS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-license-change-AWS</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;9TIu6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;9TIu6</a>')
