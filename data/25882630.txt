The FT process depends on many different paths, some of which build up larger molecules and some of which break them down.<p>If you insist on making liquid hydrocarbons you need to be balanced on a knife edge -- HCs like to polymerize towards polyethylene (violently, blow up the container so) or break down to methane when heated.  Thus you need a big factory to make a small amount of product and you might need to shut it down when the reaction vessel gunks up with petroleum jelly.<p>With solar and carbon capture now you need to run an aniline stripper and a hydrogen factory but people dont care because of unicorns, rainbows, and all that.')
