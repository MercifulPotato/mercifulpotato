I still very occasionally read local news and a mainstream front page (say, every few days), which seems sufficient to let me know what&#x27;s going on in broad terms. Stuff leaks into the bubble (e.g., via HN) but the point is not to be totally isolated, just not to get caught in hours-long doom spirals.<p>I&#x27;ve given money to the campaigns that are going to get money from me. I voted yesterday (which answered the question, &quot;are we going to get our mail-in ballots on time?&quot;). I&#x27;m done.<p>As a consequence I&#x27;m getting more done and I&#x27;m happier. I&#x27;m reading a lot more books.')
