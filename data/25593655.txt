You mention Shockley&#x27;s inventions driving the semiconductor industry there, but make no mention on Kilby making the first integrated circuit at Texas Instruments. You ignore the PC giants who called Texas home (Dell, Compaq, AST, Tandy) or at least had massive operations in Texas such as Apple. You ignore many telecommunications giants who call Texas home (AT&amp;T, Ericsson, NTT Data, Softlayer, Fujitsu Network Communications, and historically many others) and ignore its positioning as a pretty good central hub for lots of transnational telecom. Lots of big software companies also call Texas home, such as Hotels.com, indeed, match.com, id software, travelocity, and way too many others to bother listing them all here. All the while also ignoring that many big tech companies (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, IBM, Accenture, Xerox, many others) that don&#x27;t technically HQ in Texas have pretty large offices around here as well.<p>Historically <i>many</i> tech firms have called Texas home. If Texas cannot become anything but Texas, well then I&#x27;d say Texas will continue to be a pretty good place for technology.')
