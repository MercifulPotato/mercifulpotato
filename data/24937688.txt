Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24939603], score=None, time=1604016898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24937469, text='&gt; you can always buy an Intel Mac up to and including the day the ARM machines drop.<p>You can, but when you know they&#x27;re about to switch architectures, it&#x27;s a pretty good guess that what they&#x27;re not about to do is announce a whole new slate of devices using the old architecture. So even if they still sell them in two years, they&#x27;ll probably still be the same specs, and without a price cut so as to discourage people from buying the existing one instead of the new one. So if you know you&#x27;re going to buy the existing one, there&#x27;s little reason to wait. Especially when they have a record of claiming they&#x27;ll sell them for two years and then stopping after six months.')
