Since Iran has been left with an semi-believable out, there&#x27;s enough diplomatic cover to allow Russia&#x2F;China to cover for it there (see Syrian chemical weapons for comparison). For once such a position would be understandable: If seeing enriched Uranium could eventually lead to war, and there&#x27;s a way to rationalize it, how much of a smoking gun would it be? Allowing that rationalization was an error in the deal.<p>&gt; Having a united front is good both for cross-Atlantic ties and the chances of resolving the dispute peacefully.<p>The structure of the deal made some form of renegotiation inevitable (since the main restrictions were temporary). The question is how to do it.')
