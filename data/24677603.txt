I bought a mid-2009 13” MacBook Pro which easily lasted 9 years (with an ssd upgrade and more ram added at some point) and was honestly the best laptop I’ve owned.<p>I was hooked and hyped to get the new 2016 MacBook Pro.  Talk about polar opposite experience:<p>* The keyboard is terrible (replaced 3 times already),<p>* Touchbar is meh (if you touchtype when do ever look at it - this feels like a thing that’d be more useful for entry level machines where you are likely to find hunt-and-peck typists) and it now flickers in the corner occasionally.<p>* The fan is noisy<p>* I can no longer upgrade the ram or internal storage<p>* I’ve gone almost completely usb-c but the lack of usb-a and hdmi is still annoying on occasions - especially on a pro machine<p>On the good side<p>* the speakers are amazing<p>* the “retina” display is crisp and bright<p>* it’s amazingly small and light<p>What’s really killing Macs right now is the software-side “it just works” seems like a thing of the past e.g.<p>* I used to chuckle at people on windows when waking from sleep but Macs (possibly because of FileVault) feel just as slow now<p>* As mentioned in the post general Bluetooth flakiness (tbf it does seem like the latest patch release or two of Catalina seems to have got on top of this now)<p>* Using spaces (inc animation) for full-screen and making that what happens for the maximise button - just weird and clunky<p>* General system responsiveness - it just feels sluggish<p>I really can’t believe the turn around - they’ve managed to turn a customer-for-life to now I’m seriously considering getting a Linux-based laptop instead.')
