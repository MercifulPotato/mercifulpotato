They still have to work as essential workers.<p>It is not so much as masking protocols or social distancing. They car pool or the labour contractor picks them up in a van to take them to the fields. Many live in groups with 2-4 people to a room.<p>This is reality. Outside the tech bubble. This is why I am disappointed that Agtech and tech sector has done NOTHING to help the most vulnerable. It’s just faffing around, harvesting data and twirling three times after chanting ‘blockchain..blockchain..blockchain’ in agtech. If any, it’s for commodity crops like soy or corn harvested once a year and turned into fodder sludge or ethanol.<p>But farms that grow food have laborers working there every day. This is surreal and I am beyond heartbroken that nothing is being done to alleviate the problem that is most dangerous.<p>I posted this elsewhere: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25320797" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25320797</a>')
