It&#x27;s not an either&#x2F;or proposition.<p>Researching and developing technologies to allow humans to live in space in a sustainable way seems like it would almost certainly also create applications of such technology that can benefit us on Earth.<p>Whether that&#x27;s methods to scrub the atmosphere of a space-based habitat of toxins&#x2F;pollutants, utilize waste in productive ways and a raft of other stuff would be incredibly useful on Earth.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;d point out that even if we start colonizing space habitats, other planets and&#x2F;or even planets around other stars, there are no technologies available or imagined that could transport colonists from the Earth faster than birth rates would replace them and continue population growth.')
