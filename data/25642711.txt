What we can do is look at real life examples of how contracts in other unions have turned out. That is a good baseline for what we could expect from other union contracts.<p>Ok, then.  There are <i>a lot</i> of &quot;other unions,&quot; which ones are you thinking about?  They&#x27;re pretty diverse.  I mean you have all the way from autoworkers, to the film industry, the public sector, to engineers (at Boeing for instance).<p>&gt; And the actual, real life examples of other unions, shows me that I absolutely would not want to be in a union.<p>Then go find a non-union workplace, then?  It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to get banned or anything, and they currently consist of about 100% of software engineering workplaces in the US.<p>There&#x27;s this weird vibe I get from some people that tech unions shouldn&#x27;t exist at all because they personally don&#x27;t like the idea of them.
