They make no claims about CPU performance - just integrated GPU performance from Xe (which is a big improvement from previous Iris GPUs.) Then they claim battery life (9 hours, FHD, 250-nits, etc.)<p>What that means is laptop OEMs will have to limit TDP on CPUs - probably 15W or less. Given current Intel chips being very power hungry, these are likely NOT going to be great CPU performers.<p>The only competition in CPU space to M1 will be Ryzen 5000U chips in the 15-25W thermal envelope. They should be ~19% more powerful&#x2F;efficient than Ryzen 4000U chips, but I would not expect M1 levels of cool or battery life yet.')
