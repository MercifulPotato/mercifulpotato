The Founding Fathers vested the efficiency of monarchy in the executive and its long-term orientation in the Supreme Court.<p>But there is unique strength in the union of long-term orientation and efficiency. It enables a portfolio of moonshots. Musk, Ford, Edison, Bezos and Gates each pursued long-term non-commercial (or semi-commercial) projects that benefited the public. The government <i>could</i> have done <i>some</i> of these things. But it didn’t. And it couldn’t have done all—there isn’t enough political bandwidth.<p>As long as that money doesn’t turn into military power, and its effects on our politics are checked, the existence of billionaires is a net positive.')
