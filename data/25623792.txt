A subset of cores can still boost aggressively, and you can run all-core max-boost for short intervals.<p>And the relationship between power and performance isn&#x27;t linear as processor voltages climb trying to squeeze out the last bit of performance.<p>So if you want to take a 105W CPU and ask it to operate in a 65W envelope, you&#x27;re not giving up even 1&#x2F;3rd of peak performance, and much less than that of typical performance.')
