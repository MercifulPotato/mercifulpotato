If it&#x27;s heads, I pick the lower available number; if it&#x27;s tails I pick the higher.\n    4) I peak at the die.  If it&#x27;s my number, we reveal and start over.\n    5) I (always, at this point) offer you a wager: if the die shows your number (so you would have lost if you switch), you pay me $7; if the die doesn&#x27;t show your number, I pay you $5.\n</code></pre>\nAssuming you believe the die and coin are fair, etc, would you agree to play that game 1000 times?  In those games, is there a reason you would turn down the wager?<p>Is it <i>the same game</i> if I flip the coin secretly, peek at the die, announce my number (picked algorithmically in the obvious way), and then pay out according to whether switching would win (as above)?<p>Because (assuming I&#x27;ve explained these games as I intend... it&#x27;s getting late) I would play the former with you not the latter (but I would play the latter if we switched the payments around - I chose 5 and 7 because 7&#x2F;12 is halfway between 1&#x2F;2 and 2&#x2F;3).')
