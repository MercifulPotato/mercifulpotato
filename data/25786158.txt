I also drove a tesla for a while and it didn&#x27;t impress me. The acceleration is nice but it&#x27;s not something you realistically care about in the long term (also acceleration kills your battery)<p>It seems pretty common that people compare Teslas with the car they had before. It&#x27;s like comparing an entry dell laptop with a MacBook pro.<p>I think it&#x27;s an immature car and most buyers are attracted to the brand appeal, and use it to appear next gen to their neighbors. As usual, no owner will recognize this but it&#x27;s a well known phenomenon that manufacturers use against us.')
