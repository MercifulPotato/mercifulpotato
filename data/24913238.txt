The point is there are options and your statement is not correct.<p>Some merchants, like street merchants or drivers, will simply have their code printed out. You scan it and pay them and they get a notification on their phone or tablet that you&#x27;ve paid. Other places, like at bigger restaurants, have QR screen readers that will scan the purchaser&#x27;s phone.<p>Either way, I don&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re getting at. The terminal is the phone in many cases, and other cases, there is a terminal in the sense of an integrated scanner system, but why does that matter? For the user it is much more convenient and faster. It&#x27;s essentially instant, and I have never waited for the amount of time it takes for a credit card or NFC payment method to process. Further, it allows basically anyone to have this method because, again, the terminal is your phone and can be so for both parties in the transaction.<p>&gt; And NFC works when my battery dies.<p>So what? You can charge your phone essentially anywhere in China.')
