As such, Aragorn would have little ability to set the tax policy, since he can only tax his vassals a small number of high ranking nobles who in turn set their own taxes on their vassals and so on until the lowest nobles set their taxes on the common people. Additionally since all of these nobles are running their fiefs as de-facto independent states there would be relatively few things Aragorn could even do with the taxes. Now I have read most of a coup and this is my interpretation of why the kings tax policy is a less important question. Of course I am not an expert in history and I may be incorrect.')
