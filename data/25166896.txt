Item(by='Tainnor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605919571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166766, text='&gt; I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea for a private company, to be able to decide arbitrarily what is moral and what is not.<p>You seem to be under the illusion that if Facebook banned <i>nothing</i> (or at least nothing that goes beyond what is illegal), they would not make a moral decision.<p>But that is wrong. Deciding to allow absolutely everything is a decision (e.g. by placing higher moral value on freedom of expression than on other things) just as much as deciding to disallow some other content is a decision.<p>In the end, there is no escaping morality. As a human being, it is your responsibility to make decisions according to your own moral standards (and the limits of the law) and if you&#x27;re someone with power, these decisions will affect more people and will be scrutinised more.<p>&gt; Who decides what is moral and what is not?<p>Everyone decides for themselves. And then we come together as a society and we figure out what to do about the messy differences between our positions and find some sort of compromise - that&#x27;s really the only way it goes.')
