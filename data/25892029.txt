Item(by='Hello71', descendants=None, kids=[25892370], score=None, time=1611496408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890883, text='There are two major problems with this: partitions&#x2F;device-mapper and backwards compatibility. First, partitions inherently overlap the parent block device. You would need to carefully track exactly which portions of the device are in use, or your solution is useless (it doesn&#x27;t protect &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda when &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda1 is in use) or blocks the vast majority of use cases (&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda2 cannot be used when &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda1 is in use). The same applies for device-mapper, but worse. Secondly, the Linux kernel has a very strong backwards compatibility guarantee. Any change that would break valid (or even invalid) uses will be loudly rejected by Linus. With your idea, many disk management programs will be broken.')
