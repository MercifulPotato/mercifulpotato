Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=[25231848], score=None, time=1606484465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228295, text='Putting a good $15 bottle on the table doesn&#x27;t tell your friends &quot;I really want to celebrate this. It&#x27;s a special occasion to me&quot;. The $35 champagne that might inded be worse, does. Especially if you are the kind that often drinks the $15 ones!<p>And that&#x27;s imho the selling point of (at least the lower end) champagne. I still do that occasionally. A $20 difference is a pretty small price for a &quot;signal&quot;. It&#x27;s  not stupid just because the content is indistinguishable. I pay for the label - because the label is the effect! It&#x27;s the product!<p>That&#x27;s also why such producers need to be careful with others using their name. They are selling a name while everyone else is selling wine.')
