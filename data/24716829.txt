It&#x27;s used for ridiculously large and inapprpriate thinga now. The #include is terrible but it was ok back then - things were small enough to hold in your head. No longer.<p>Compilers were simpler back when C was designed. IIRC PDPs often had just a few K of memory. A megabyte would be huge in the 80&#x27;s. A textual preprocessor can be done in a couple of K I&#x27;d guess, or less. Also a preprocessor is useful for many other things unrelated to the C language.<p>I understand your frustration but things started that way for a good reason, please don&#x27;t criticise unless you really understand that.<p>Feel free to criticise the inertia that means we have much the same stuff nearly half a century later (but also understand why).')
