The horror. Lets shut everything down. Won&#x27;t you think of the poor politicians? We must do everything possible to protect the reputation of politicians? Are you a journalist because you sound like one. So what about all the nasty things said about putin, xi, erdogan, etc? Should we also censor those? Or are you just talking about protecting politicians of your preferred political party?<p>&gt; Otherwise, anyone with enough influence to generate these echo chambers can use them to influence large swaths of the public into believing things that have no basis in reality.<p>So should facebook, youtube, twitter, instagram, etc also shutdown every news organization on their site? For all the talk about &quot;Qanon&quot;, the biggest conspiracies peddled are by traditional media. And why stop at social media? Should telephone companies, ISPs, Office Depot, CDNs, etc censor &quot;disinformation&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s amazing to shallow logic of authoritarian types. Just because they think &quot;big tech&quot; is on their side.')
