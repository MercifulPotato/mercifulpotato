Solaris didn&#x27;t do anything weird, so it was maybe the only non-other. HP-UX had something really weird with linking and I feel like it was lacking some shell commands that were fairly standard. AIX did something strange with shared libraries and their error messages were decidedly non-standard, although they all had unique code at the beginning so at least it was easy to search for problems. I think AIX was the only one for which malloc(0) = 0, all the others at least produced a valid pointer. I can&#x27;t remember what the problems with Irix were, I think it was just that by 2008 Irix was just old so getting an up to date compiler was troublesome. Linux was just as &quot;other&quot; compared to the rest, but it was increasingly full-featured. Solaris kept up for a while.<p>And admining them was definitely very different aside from the basic shell commands.')
