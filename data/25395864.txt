It will turn into a battle for the centrists eyeballs to come to their sides platform or straddle both.<p>The analogy of Reddit banning toxic subs only holds if everyone is ACTUALLY on reddit, most simply left. There is already talk among conservatives of alternative Reddits and Facebooks, alternatives Netflix&#x2F;Hollywood companies, alternative Fox News even. Many will say &quot;but those will be subject to the same problems of early Twitter and Reddit, how to excise the toxic elements and keep the real discussion.&quot; I would say that can EASILY be done without going down the censorship rabbit hole by simply knowing where to stop. Get rid of the illegal stuff, the spam and pornography, and leave the rest regardless of how distasteful it is. Its an Overton Window problem, you just need slightly looser boundary condition on discourse. Stop pretending to be platforms and admit you are indeed publishers to an extent. Give users the ability to filter what they don&#x27;t want to see and pledge to never bias your algorithms. The cries of the left will be largely irrelevant, they will simply tell you to &quot;go back to Twitter if you don&#x27;t like it&quot;. Once the public loses faith and trust in your company or institution due to your sacrifices in credibility in the name of censorship of one sides information, there wont be any coming back from that loss of face. I&#x27;m not saying this is a good or healthy thing for public discourse, but I do think it will come to pass.')
