The documentation is compelling.<p>I sleep at night by writing stoic bash.  If I encounter anything unexpected in a script I don’t try to handle it, I just report it and then crash.<p>Most of the bash contortions I’ve seen in my life happen when people (myself included) have tried to handle error conditions or ill specified inputs, gracefully.<p>A bash script is like a pre-flight checklist: a list of things that should work to get something going.  Most bash scripts are like this: in general they are sequences of commands to change the system from one good state to another, not to recover it from a bad state.<p>In the analogy: if something is not ok with your aircraft it’s beyond the scope of the pre flight check to fix it.  Don’t use the checklist as a way of trying to automatically detect what the error is in order to fix it.')
