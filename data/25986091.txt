It closed at 28K last week. Peak was like 38K. Unless you stopped investing completely after the peak you&#x27;d still have done alright in the Nikkei. Not anywhere near as good as US stocks, but it would still be better than sitting in cash... especially after dividends.<p>It&#x27;s now above any point through 1991-2020. Yes still down from the absolute peak, but if you consistently invested throughout those years you&#x27;d be well up at this point.<p>But I do think it shows the importance of being diversified. It is recommended to allocate a certain percentage to international stocks. We shouldn&#x27;t assume the US will continue being the leading market.')
