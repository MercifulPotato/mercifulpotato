What you call &quot;feel a bit human&quot; I call &quot;office politics.&quot; Forced superfluous off the cuff interaction sounds terrible to me. You say most employees are like you (not robots), I say it depends.<p>The real answer here is there is no universal answer. Your guiding function is not the same as mine as we have different tolerances and wishes for interaction. Yours is not more right nor more creative in every case, just as mine is not more efficient nor more productive in all instances.<p>You&#x27;re right companies are collections of people, and there is no singular method to organizing them that makes sense in all cases as personalities are different. Usually though, autonomy is important to satisfaction. Letting your people choose their environment rather than forcing your own personality on them is more likely to help them, and in turn the organization, succeed.')
