If you hand the same object to multiple functions in this case, they&#x27;ll all see each other&#x27;s changes and if this wasn&#x27;t intentional then voila, you&#x27;ve got a bug. This is one motivation for immutable data structures: you don&#x27;t have to worry about whether an object might get mutated so you don&#x27;t have to eagerly clone it. But in an existing codebase it may not be a trivial thing to simply introduce immutability. This is why, instead, I suggested making that defensive cloning explicit and decoupled from the rest of the logic.')
