I love your live demo, really slick introduction and tutorial - and answered some questions I had about E2E! I&#x27;ve got a couple of other questions though.<p>&gt; 12 full stack preview environments per commit with up to 16GB of memory and 6 CPUs<p>Quote from your pricing. If we had a monorepo with over 12 small test&#x2F;integration jobs, but not 12 full preview environments, is this usable? Are they one and the same, or can we have eg. a suite of unit tests that don&#x27;t count toward this full preview limit? Do some teams keep some unit tests off Layer and just use you for the more interesting pieces?<p>Second, do you have any documentation about which databases you support? Concretely can you restore a MongoDB snapshot super-fast?<p>Third, do you have any story around secrets if we want the staging server to hold some secret API keys? Currently we can do this with AWS (own account) CI machines in Gitlab deploying to ECS with AWS secrets - they stay end-to-end encrypted and nobody sees them. Is there any similar way we can get secrets onto a staging server without you having access to them? I suspect this would be a deal breaker for the staging use case for my team.<p>Similar to above, our database snapshots are stored in non-public S3 buckets, how would that work? Again currently it&#x27;s a case of giving the CI AWS role permission to access them, not sure what an equivalent would look like.<p>One more, is it possible to access the built docker images? We deploy Docker images to ECS, and currently they&#x27;re the exact same ones built and tested in CI which is a nice reassurance. Do your customers have an out-of-band process for building + deploying to production outside of Layer?<p>Aside, I think this may be a typo on your pricing page? &quot;We&#x27;ll never increase your the terms of your bill once you start your subscription.&quot;')
