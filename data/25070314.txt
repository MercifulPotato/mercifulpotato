It&#x27;s happened to me, but, thankfully, before being flown out (if it&#x27;s a contract application, then we&#x27;re on the hook for the cost), and revealing the age.<p>It happens with highly qualified older white guys, so I&#x27;m sure that it will happen with other distinguishing characteristics.<p>The simple fact of the matter is, is that people have certain traits they are looking for, and the final call is <i>always</i> a &quot;gut feeling.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve learned to just avoid all the agita by making it clear that I&#x27;m &quot;of a certain age,&quot; right up front. I don&#x27;t get many offers, but at least I don&#x27;t have those blasted recruiters, gushing about my résumé, only to shred my contact card, as soon as they find out I&#x27;m old (I guess the industry is crawling with 32-year-olds with 30 years&#x27; experience).<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to have AIs do the selection (as has been suggested numerous times -usually by folks in the AI business). Humans need to work with humans. If an AI puts someone into a situation where they are treated like garbage by their managers and&#x2F;or co-workers, then they will be miserable (and unproductive); especially if they have done something like uproot their lives to move somewhere (I have also heard <i>many</i> stories from people that have uprooted their lives to go to &quot;the perfect&quot; job, only to come back, a few months later, broken and cynical).<p>If the people involved don&#x27;t want to work with someone like me, then I don&#x27;t want to work with them. That&#x27;s easy for me to say, though. It can really stink, when you&#x27;re hungry and need the work.')
