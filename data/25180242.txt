Some of those prices you&#x27;re paying from those European outlets are less than the local retailer can buy it wholesale. So you&#x27;re asking your local retailer to lose money to make the sale.<p>I owned a bike shop and sporting goods store in a past life (I&#x27;ve written about it here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencerocketry.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;great-work-and-new-beginnings" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencerocketry.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;great-work-and-new-begin...</a>) and the effects of Shimano&#x27;s inability (or really, refusal) to control pricing from its European distribution was catastrophic to my business and my peers. And not only that, I found that many of those sellers would defraud customs on expensive items by declaring the value just under thresholds that would result in them paying import taxes and tariffs. It was a profit destroyer for us but Shimano moved units, and that&#x27;s all that mattered to them.<p>When some of those parts customers purchased from Chain Reaction or Wiggle or whatever didn&#x27;t work, the customers who bought those parts overseas would come into our shop asking us to handle the warranty process. We were a Shimano dealer, after all! If we politely refused or tried to collect a handling charge, we were the ones that would face the customer&#x27;s outrage.<p>The end result is that there is less sales tax in your community because of the absence of that brick and mortar retailer. There are fewer jobs. There are fewer local communities built around hobbies, crafts, trades, or whatever. But you can get products cheaper and your dollars have greater purchasing power. Maybe that&#x27;s a worthwhile trade-off - YMMV.')
