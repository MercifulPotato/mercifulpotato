(People in apartment buildings I have access to who have moved out of state, but still got sent ballots, which were just setting in the foyer; I&#x27;m sure there are gazillions of other ways to get ballots.)<p>If you&#x27;re not even going to require the signatures to match, it seems like committing vote fraud would be ridiculously easy.<p>(Of course, if you really want to have a secure election, make people vote in person and have a continuous chain of custody of those votes; use the ink-on-your-finger trick to prevent double-voting.)')
