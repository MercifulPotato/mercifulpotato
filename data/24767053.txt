The dirty little secret is this IS American democracy at work. It has ALWAYS been rife with voter suppression tacts, and disenfranchisement at scale. The Internet and the current political chaos allows the world to see it all in its ugly glory, but there are many people alive who lived in a country with LAWS that prevented minorities from voting. If we were once the beacon of democracy, by those standards, we still are. It&#x27;s just a pretty low bar.')
