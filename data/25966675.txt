Such a high quality repo, and only 28 stars.<p>The viewer is really cool. I wonder if it&#x27;d be possible to modify it to display a folder of PNGs in a nice streamable way...<p>(It looks like it only supports slicing a single png, whereas we usually have tens of thousands of pngs. I&#x27;ve been thinking of ways of letting people view lots of ML images better than e.g. how tensorboard does it.)')
