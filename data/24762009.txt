Each room will have its own thermostat. There will be no cold spots, it will just feel cozy. No air is being cycled around the room keeping dust down.<p>Ventilation: indoor pollution is usually many multiples of outdoor. You want a an MVHR (or MEV) system to exchange the air in the house for fresh air with low heat (energy) loss.<p>AC: You need to move cold air around for this unfortunately. Pumping chilled water through your under floor heating pipes risks condensation in crawl spaces, and even if it doesn’t it simply doesn’t work very well. (Source: I had ‘radiant cooling’ ceiling panels in my last house.) I would look into a mini-duct or ductless AC system so you can control each room individually.<p>In climates that require heat and cooling, it is far more cost effective to go with a standard HVAC system, unfortunately, as you’ll be putting ducts throughout the house for AC. (Why put a separate system in for heating when you could just move hot air around?) But if you want the best, not cheapest, solution you really want under floor heating.')
