At a certain point whether the leadership of Coinbase is racist or not doesn&#x27;t matter.  What matters is their actions. The article says &quot;roughly three-quarters of the Black employees&quot; left the company over a 6 month span due to feelings of being discriminated against.  That isn&#x27;t an accusation.  It is a fact.  It also isn&#x27;t something that will just happen accidentally.  That alone is a problem that demands urgent attention regardless of what is in the hearts of Coinbase&#x27;s leadership team.')
