When this Mac dies, I&#x27;ll be replacing it with something running Debian.<p>It is too bad - the Mac hit this sweet-spot where it was pretty much my perfect machine for several years - a kickass Unix workstation in a decently built laptop, with a decent GUI, with access to consumer apps, too. It was great while it lasted.<p>Thing is, this is a reasonable thing for Apple to do. Back when they weren&#x27;t enormous, it made sense for them to at least make token gestures to the Unix-weenie&#x2F;developer market - we threw a lot of money at them and made them hip when they were down and out. Now we&#x27;re in rounding-error territory, and that we got what we wanted for a while was sort of a happy accident, anyway. Building developer dream-machines was never Apple&#x27;s thing.<p>I bought my first Mac in 1991, and this one will last a while longer. Can&#x27;t really complain too much about 30 years of decent-to-awesome tools.')
