I first used wayland about 4 years ago and immediately switched back to X.  It just wasn&#x27;t ready.<p>About a year and a half back, I got a new laptop and installed arch&#x2F;gnome&#x2F;wayland on it again, and was very pleasantly surprised.<p>At this point, my only remaining issue is that screen sharing is hit or miss.  Pipewire has landed and most electron apps support screen sharing now (including slack, which didn&#x27;t as recently as 2 months ago). But it&#x27;s still not perfect.  For example - I can share a full desktop screen in zoom or hangouts, but only an application window in slack.<p>---<p>Outside of screen sharing?  I&#x27;ll never go back to X. My touchpad feels as good as the touchpad on my work macbook.  I&#x27;m typing this while using two displays - one at 1080p and one at 4k, and scaling mostly &quot;just works&quot; between them.  Applications that depend on x-wayland won&#x27;t auto adjust when moved between screens, but native wayland apps do - and I&#x27;m using native wayland apps everywhere I can at this point (including a chromium-ozone build in AUR: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ozone_overview.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs...</a>)<p>I absolutely love that I can&#x27;t remember the last time I saw a screen tear.  I also haven&#x27;t touched a HID or Display config file on this machine <i>ever</i>. No more xorg config file headaches.<p>Overall - if you&#x27;re setting up a new machine with the intent to use a graphical desktop - I&#x27;d suggest starting with Wayland.')
