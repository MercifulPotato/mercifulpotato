Steel on steel is efficient, thus energy lost on braking is on the order of 50% of that used for acceleration. This is moderated by the top speed, grade etc and gain&#x2F;loss in height. So the cases are complex.\nI do not have data on the mass of the train as well as the live load, or the HP of the motors and what acceleration in fractional g is involved. In any event to move more people&#x2F;unit time, higher acceleration, top speed and braking all increase the passengers&#x2F;hour.\nIt may well be the major culprit is this move to more people&#x2F;hour via higher speed&#x2F;acceleration&#x2F;deceleration&#x2F;efficiency etc, all of which are additive.')
