I don&#x27;t know how. I delete my account about once a year to try and limit my breadcrumb trail, so I can&#x27;t really look backwards and say how long I&#x27;ve been here, or what may have gotten me here. IIRC, it was probably due to chasing articles on startups&#x2F;entrepreneurship, as I seem to think that was over-represented in my early HN reading. But it&#x27;s probably been about a decade, so take that with a grain of salt.')
