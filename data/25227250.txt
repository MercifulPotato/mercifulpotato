I saw memes with it, but I dont&#x27;t find it funny because in Czech it actually means just &quot;Upper Shelf&quot;. (But I understand what does it mean for english speaking ppl.)<p>But what I found more fascinating is that there is bus line number 666 going from Debki to Hel in Poland (Debki sounds bit like &quot;depky&quot; which is diminutive for depressions in Czech).')
