There was no textual matter copied.<p>In Oracle vs. Google I believe the source-code of the APIs was copied.<p>Even if one would consider a way to do accounting an &quot;API&quot; an explanation and illustration of an API is not the same as the &quot;API&quot;.<p>Explaining or illustrating a &quot;structure&quot; is not the same as copying that structure. Note that copyright applies to actual &quot;works of art&quot;, not to abstract &quot;methods&quot;. An API (as referred to in this case) is not an explanation of a way of doing things but an actual constructed artifact, source-code.<p>Think about books. Their content is copyrighted. You can not copy their content. But nothing prevents you from explaining and &quot;illustrating&quot; the content of a book, as long as you don&#x27;t copy significant portions of the structure and ordering of its verbatim words.')
