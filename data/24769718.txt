The person you were responding to said we didn&#x27;t need lockdown, but we did need some restrictions to nonsesential businesses.<p>But you replied that closing down nonsessential businesses was in fact &quot;lockdown&quot;.<p>If that&#x27;s lockdown, do you think Sweden&#x27;s restrictions of gatherings over 50 people (with criminal penalties for violating) is also &quot;lockdown&quot;? If so, contrary to popular conception, it would turn out that Sweden actually engaged in &quot;lockdown&quot; all along after all, I guess?  And do you think even Sweden basically over-reacted?')
