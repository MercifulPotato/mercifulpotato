The problem for your (our) part of the world is coverage, and that needs to be dealt with using more cell towers. A 5g transition will possibly compound this problem, by needing more towers for the same coverage area, and by making those towers and the infrastructure for data transport to them more expensive.<p>IMHO 5G is a great idea for cities, ideally mini building-as-a-city size projects, where you can provide coverage to a lot of people really fast. But for penetrating and providing reliable coverage for wider areas, 5g isn&#x27;t the right thing. Hopefully the next iteration works towards that.<p>It&#x27;s also been interesting to see Kerala change over the last decade - I see things change as snapshots everytime I&#x27;m there, so I feel it more keenly. Speeds are a lot faster when they&#x27;re available, but tower-to-tower and carrier-to-carrier handover is still a massive problem. Part of it&#x27;s hardware, with the signal just not reaching you. The other part is still software, where some towers just won&#x27;t let you go, or refuse to upgrade you. I&#x27;ve sat next to people who were getting 4g on the same carrier, same phone, while I was getting 3g and had to restart.')
