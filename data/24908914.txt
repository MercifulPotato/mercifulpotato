No wonder I was being downvoted.<p>In fairness, the context was uploading the brain, and whether the whole body was needed, so it was a semi-reasonable misread.<p>Still... there&#x27;s a large distance from &quot;I can have a heart transplant and still be considered the same person (even though 1% of my body now has different DNA)&quot; to &quot;I can have no body at all and still be the same person&quot;.  The claim was that a body is a significant part of who we are as people, which is not a claim that a heart transplant addresses at all.')
