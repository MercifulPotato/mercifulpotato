Google and Microsoft have both had established reseller channels for a long time, but there are still major vendors who only recently (or still haven&#x27;t..) established this.<p>Slack is a great example - they only sell direct. And companies who use Slack have a tendency to &quot;sprawl&quot; into other SaaS apps that may not have a reseller channel, creating a bit of a snowball effect. Contrast this with companies &quot;bought in&quot; to Microsoft where it&#x27;s much more common to see them adopt Microsoft Teams and other technologies to avoid that sprawl - and they typically buy via Microsoft partners who can bill them on a single invoice.<p>While we can&#x27;t force SaaS vendors to acknowledge that customers want a single bill&#x2F;distributor, we are working on the problem further upstream by creating a marketplace [1] backed by a network of connectivity agents who are expanding into the SaaS world. One point of purchase&#x2F;bill for connectivity + SaaS (and IaaS) with additional benefits such as management, etc. Even more interestingly, we&#x27;re covering the developer, distributor, reseller, and customer channels on a single platform.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appsmart.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appsmart.com</a>')
