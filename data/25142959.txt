That&#x27;s how you can get your semantic tags.<p>...and it&#x27;s also how you should write Websites anyways - this has little to do with Tailwind. Tailwind can be seen as just a more powerful way of writing inline styles.<p>If you rely on CSS for reusable components, you may be in for a bad time as soon as you need to make even a tiny change in your design.')
