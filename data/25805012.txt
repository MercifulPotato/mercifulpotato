There is nothing wrong with using Erlang here, it&#x27;s a perfectly capable language for systems like this. But there is nothing magical about erlang either. I have first hand experience seeing erlang systems choke and croak on 30k connections, and I&#x27;ve seen jvm systems and C++ systems and go systems capably handling north of 1M connections. The difference isn&#x27;t the language, it is the architecture of the app.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe me, I dare you to create an alternative. I&#x27;d easily take bets that Signal&#x27;s current system could easily outperform your cargo cult alternative written in erlang.')
