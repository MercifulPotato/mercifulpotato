Taskcat is a great tool for testing if your Cloudformation Template is deployable in certain regions of AWS. Unfortunately testing if the deployed resources are working as intended is a bit complicated when using Taskcat.<p>I created Cloud-Radar over the last week to extend the capabilities of Taskcat so that it&#x27;s easier to test if the deployed resources have the desired behavior.<p>If you are using Taskcat already then moving to Cloud-Radar is pretty simple, you just need to pass it the path to your .taskcat.yml config file.<p>If your not familiar with Taskcat Cloud-Radar will accept a taskcat config file in the form of a python dictionary. The config file is pretty simple, a barebones one will declare the path to the Cloudformation template, the regions you want to deploy it to and the parameters you want to use.')
