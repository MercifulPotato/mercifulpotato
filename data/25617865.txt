The naive solution leads to writing the whole file to memory before serving (thus memory inflation).<p>This library just looks like a pretty straightforward way to implement the same idea, but with chunking to bound memory usage. At the bottom, it&#x27;s doing the same thing, but using generators to yield chunks at a time.<p>It&#x27;s a useful utility for that context. Nothing groundbreaking, it&#x27;s something that most intermediate and higher developers could stitch together in probably a few days (especially if they had to brush on on DEFLATE and generator protocol), but it&#x27;s nice to not have to.')
