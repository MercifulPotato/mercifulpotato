Can you imagine a better way? We at Arena not only imagine a better way, we are working toward making it a reality.<p>Resumes, pedigree, assessments, and personal connections have proven time and again to be ineffective at predicting actual job performance. These age-old processes reinforce bias. They burden the applicant and the employer with administrative tasks. And they contribute little insight and information to guide either party in determining if they are a good match.<p>At Arena, you can help replace these outdated processes, one client at a time.<p>- Help organizations increase retention by putting the right people in the right jobs.<p>- Remove Bias from the hiring process. Sure, lots of products say it, but ask us how we do it.<p>- Be a part of a stable, fast growing company where we recognize that creativity, openness, and opportunity are what lead to achieving our mission.<p>==========<p>SOFTWARE&#x2F;CLOJURE DEVELOPER<p>As a developer, you will handle the full software lifecycle: design, implement, deploy and monitor.
