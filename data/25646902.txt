I believe that if I had more bitcoins on a phone, and told people about it, there&#x27;s a good chance a targeted exploit would steal those keys.  Even if I had them encrypted, at some point I have to type a password in to decrypt, and that would be the point they&#x27;d be stolen.<p>However, on an iOS device (which is more robustly locked down), I&#x27;d probably happily store 10 bitcoins.  (if I had them, hah!)<p>On dedicated hardware (like a trezor wallet), i&#x27;d also be confident up to about 10 bitcoins (far less attack surface, but also a less competent security team than Apple can afford).<p>On an outdated android, it would be more like 0.1 bitcoins - there are trivial ways to root them from the web browser and any old website can do it!<p>Considering that for many people, access to all the private data on their phone could ruin their job, relationships, and even put them in prison, I&#x27;m sure a lot of people value the security of their phone at multiple years salary.  If I have to choose between that and the ability to run an emulated game slightly faster, I&#x27;m totally choosing security!')
