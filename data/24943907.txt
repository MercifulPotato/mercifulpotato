He had nothing to do with that story, it&#x27;s editing and saw it for the first time when it was published.<p>&gt;The Pulitzer-winning journalist supported the 2nd Iraq War.<p>Huh? I don&#x27;t believe he was a journalist or a writer at all at the time of the Iraq war. You can&#x27;t commit a failure of journalism when you&#x27;re not publishing anything, surely. Maybe he supported it silently? Maybe he had a private opinion before following such stories closely as his calling? I dunno, I give up. It&#x27;s still an utterly garbage claim however you look at it.<p>&gt;The Pulitzer-winning journalist has quit his publication because he could not provide a fact check on his assertions, a rather basic journalistic standard.<p>The Pulitzer-winning journalist invited the editors to point out any factual error after they claimed factual errors existed without identifying them and the editors could not do so in any single way. They didn&#x27;t even attempt it. [1]<p>Maybe Glenn hadn&#x27;t yet published the correspondence with the editors so you didn&#x27;t know your characterisation of who failed in fact checking was garbage. Reality Winner? yeah, The Intercept really didn&#x27;t speak up about Glenn not being involved in that story in any way at all but if you followed it even a little bit you&#x27;d have known that. Maybe you didn&#x27;t, which is fine, so being this forthright when you didn&#x27;t, maybe not?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-editors-showing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;emails-with-intercept-edito...</a><p>Glenn&#x27;s point is this is just a bit of the usual Democrat sleaze. It&#x27;s not &quot;Worse than ...&quot; $whatever, it may be a bit weak as a corruption story but it is definitely corruption involving Joe&#x27;s family, and that isn&#x27;t nothing and should be reported and Joe questioned. Forthrightly.<p>The difference comes from whether you think Trump is evil incarnate and all lines must be crossed to defeat him (the common liberal view) or whether you think he&#x27;s a symptom of the ongoing unending corruption that must be stood up to, reported and condemned whenever it arises. Glenn takes the latter view. He&#x27;s been explicit that the failure to report the story is a much bigger scandal than Hunter Biden being as bent as a banana, which he obviously is (You get paid that much a month while being a drug addict, for doing nothing ever in your life?) And he was obviously Joe&#x27;s single biggest liability as a candidate. Yeah there&#x27;s others, and all of those liablilites appear to be dwarfed by Trumps but Trump didn&#x27;t lose with all those last time. It&#x27;s hard to imagine Joe is more corrupt than Trump. Or even in the same ballpark.<p>So do you report it because it&#x27;s a story or bury it and pretend it&#x27;s a russian conspiracy because Trump is worse? Why are the likes of Brennan and Clapper getting involved on one side of that? Once you tell the lies it never stops. Glenn has amazing credibility for being principled including with people who have very different politics to himself. There&#x27;s quite a few journalists who hate that he never compromised and due to his unusual path to it, never had to, was always his own master at times exactly like this.<p>I wish he wasn&#x27;t a socialist but I&#x27;ll stick up for Glenn anytime, he makes it really easy to do.')
