This intuitively makes sense: `there-is` is a restriction on a variable (the restriction is that there is at least one value for that variable). Meanwhile, the absence of restrictions implies universal quantification.<p>Specifying universal quantification like this is quite common in math proofs, and it&#x27;s not too bad to get used to.')
