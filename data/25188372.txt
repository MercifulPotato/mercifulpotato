So far, they have failed.<p>Is it such a crime for a corporation to try and prioritize their users&#x27; identities safety and produce a variant that tries to compromise between monopoly and convenience?<p>I fully recognize the possible dystopian futures here, mind you, and I am as distrustful towards corporations as most techies. But after being a commercial programmer for 19 years, I can&#x27;t seem to find other agents who did better than Microsoft and Apple in this area. We all know the memes about them and I&#x27;ll concede that 90% of them are true.<p>But could somebody -- or something -- else do better? So far the answer seems to be &quot;no&quot;, and that&#x27;s the reality we are living in. What does it say about us if we are denying it?<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong. Give me the same (or little less) performance on a 100% libre hardware and software and I&#x27;ll switch tomorrow, even if a mere 13&quot; laptop with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD costs $5000. I will, I kid you not. But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any choices that come close to Apple&#x27;s laptop ergonomics, quality of screens, and (mostly) integrated and polished experience. And don&#x27;t get me started with &quot;if you do this bucket list of 37 tasks then Brand+Model laptop is very close to a MacBook&quot;. Truth is, there is nothing like a MacBook. I wish there was, but especially with release of the M1, there really isn&#x27;t.<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;')
