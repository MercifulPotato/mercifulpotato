In May, DC was literally on fire from the BLM riots, and we didn&#x27;t see this type of DoubleSpeak.<p>Not really when you consider that the protests in may were for the correct side with the media and elites fully on board. They were for all intents and purposes sanctioned events. The 6th mob was absolutely terrifying for the media and elite since they had zero control over it. What looks like just another mob riot to a common peasant appears to be an actual threat to those which never see threats.')
