Fighting (an office of) City Hall is a painful experience.<p>You must have some idea of why they are obstructing though, right? An electrical permit is an indirect block, so I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ve fought other battles with the office in the past?<p>In any case, you have a right to file the permit. The office might make your life hell through documented denials or overzealous inspections, but getting the permit filed should be non-controversial. Once filed, they must approve or deny. If denied, there is a formal appeals process which can run through different people&#x2F;departments. If you have the time and energy for it, of course.<p>Anyway, I know you are not here soliciting advice, but my next step would be to bring a lawyer to the filing office to ensure that the application is filed, and that no further assault occurs. Good luck.')
