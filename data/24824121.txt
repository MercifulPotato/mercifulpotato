I know of some homes where 4-5 people live together and all their salaries are put on the same bank account. Doesn&#x27;t matter if someone&#x27;s a student or working full time.<p>It&#x27;s obviously an alternative lifestyle and I don&#x27;t know if I could do it. But saying that having kids, being married and having room-mates is impossible is not a fact, but an opinion.<p>I wonder if there are people living together in the some home and in a polyamorous relationship and simultaneously have kids, also living in the same home. Basically a whole community living together.')
