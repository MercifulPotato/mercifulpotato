Software is complex and that complexity can cause all kinds of problems, as can the fact that the networks linking computers are unreliable, but software is <i>fundamentally deterministic</i>. If you write a piece of code that returns a temporary failure when it can&#x27;t look up whether a user exists, that code will not mysteriously change itself to start returning permanent user does not exist errors. (Now, if your overall stack is designed in such a way that you can&#x27;t reliably tell the difference between lookup failures and users that don&#x27;t exist, you have a problem - but the problem is with the design of the system, not some inherent problem with software.)<p>Note that this is rather different from physical, mechanical systems which can fail in all kinds of exciting and unpredictable ways due to physical wear and tear, things getting jammed in places, component failure, etc.')
