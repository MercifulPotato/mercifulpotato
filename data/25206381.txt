I’m also willing to bet that your tall mute friend is more attractive than you probably realize. Being tall for all I care could be the male version of having big boobs. This doesn’t change anything about what I said.<p>Please imagine how much worse your friend would have it if he were overweight and boring.<p>Also, you should build yourself irregardless of women. Reading is good for you. Exercise is good for you. Having a passion is good for you. Coincidentally, these are all signifiers of someone who would be a good dad.<p>Most guys are clueless how women approach men and often don’t even realize when women are coming onto them. It’s never (or rarely) as crass as “hey let’s fuck”. It’s more like they take initiative to say hi first and ask follow up questions.<p>Maybe your fit friend is too passive??')
