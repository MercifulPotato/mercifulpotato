Driver AI in a video game isn&#x27;t nearly as complex as self driving cars in the real world.  Plenty of games have been able to create a more realistic driver AI.<p>For example take a look at this video[1], specifically the part in which the user shoots at AI driven cars.  The AI in GTA 5 responds in a much more realistic fashion.  This has a huge impact on immersion and creating a lifelike world.  GTA 5 came out 7 years ago.  There is no technical reason for Cyberpunk&#x27;s AI being this bad.  CDPR simply didn&#x27;t want to invest the time in making it better.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=O9VMTk13wfo&amp;t=390" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=O9VMTk13wfo&amp;t=390</a>')
