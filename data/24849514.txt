They were terrible. I&#x27;d love to see why Google should be punished for making a good product. I&#x27;m open to a good explanation.<p>Same for Youtube. I cut my cable because we now get all our entertainment from Netflix and Youtube. We dont get locked into 2yr cable agreements, dont get magical regulatory recovery fees, $100 of charges, and stations that disappear (e.g., Disney on Fios). I&#x27;d hate to lose it just because the product is <i>too good</i>')
