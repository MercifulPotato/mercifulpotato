Item(by='lavp', descendants=None, kids=[25081100], score=None, time=1605264419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25076714, text='&gt; The HN crowd may seem fringe, but they are living in the future.<p>I really don’t think the HN community is at all representative of what the masses think about. Just like in any online community, it is easy to think that the thoughts of that community somewhat resemble that of most people when that simply isn’t true. HN’s base consists highly of developers who are up to date with most things in the technology industry.<p>The rest of the world doesn’t really care enough to compromise the comfort and reliability of Google’s suite, which lets be honest, outperforms its competition by a size-able margin, and does so with a “free” price tag.<p>People on HN have talked about de-googling for years and I have yet to see someone outside of the computer development scene do it (or even talk about it for that manner).')
