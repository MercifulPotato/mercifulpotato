Especially if you were driving the automobile in &quot;normal&quot; fashion. They are very thirsty mashines with 90 L tank - the official 13L &#x2F; 100 km consumprion is a very &#x27;idealistic&#x27; information, you can easily double the fuel consumption.<p>That is why the V8&#x2F;V8S got so popular and had far more then 50% share when I quit. The range (and more sportive driving characteristic) in comparison to the W12&#x2F;W12 attracted more clients. That might have changed with the Gen3 GTs, since they use a different platform.<p>Source: I sold Bentley&#x27;s as a side job for quite a while (Gen1-Gen2, quit when Gen3 came up).')
