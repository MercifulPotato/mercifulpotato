Or just lack of internal credibility and authority, managers panicking, cutting losses short, internal politics, or whatever disagreement was not resolved.<p>Making it <i>all about</i> ethnicity, seems the wrong way to go about it, if one wants to avoid racism. Then it seems inevitable, any roadblock can be suggested as racism as anchor. Which ends up the entirely wrong attitude to be smart about it. Now, it&#x27;s impossible to <i>prescribe</i> how to be smart at anything..<p>I would separate between the actions in that workplace, and the research itself. The latter is highly interesting as it&#x27;s widely known data and parameters from data, may be highly biased and difficult to neutralize. Even to detect all kinds of biases and separate them from knowledge of the world. Actions from such data can have deeply unfair and repressing consequences, so it&#x27;s important.')
