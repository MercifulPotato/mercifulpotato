She&#x27;s brilliant.  She&#x27;s a very good manager when it comes to taking a successful business and making it a lot more successful.<p>She&#x27;s not so good at taking something that is new or failing and making it good.  She definitely made eBay much bigger than it would have been without her, but it was already successful and growing when she joined. She ran HPE into the ground because it was already failing.<p>She didn&#x27;t succeed with Quibi because she doesn&#x27;t know about how to find market fit.')
