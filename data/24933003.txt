It&#x27;ll take you 30,000 years to reach the <i>nearest</i> star at the rate of the fastest moving object ever constructed by man. If anything any of us are talking about are <i>able</i> to be out-of-date in a mere decade, the whole premise of this discussion is flawed beyond measure.<p>All of the resiliency that you&#x27;ve seen in life is due to the fact that the environments to which we&#x27;re adapted are <i>uniform.</i> Oceans everywhere are nontoxic and water. Air everywhere is mostly clean and breathable. There is no example of life being resilient under conditions as varied as other planets. We are only able to adapt within the confines of our clean-room Earth. We can&#x27;t even adapt to the bottom of the ocean or Antarctica.<p>Optimism isn&#x27;t going to overcome 6 orders of magnitude of error.')
