Good for me that I have cameras in my yard because they jumped me to pay double at the end of the job quoting some bs numbers that we didn&#x27;t discuss. 4 of them getting in my face at night. I already knew how it is going to go down from the moment I saw that the car of workers is made entirely of gypsies so I had someone recording and ready to call the cops. Nice tango there. I hope you don&#x27;t get to dance it. As I said, it&#x27;s easy to speak from the side when you don&#x27;t know the situation - everyone seems to have an opinion but completely disregards what an entire nation thinks.')
