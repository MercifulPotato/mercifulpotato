I doubt it is legal in many places to donate money to support an active terrorist organization.<p>If you believe that money=speech, the law is inconsistent in this matter. Assuming you want the law to be consistent, there are really only two ways to resolve the inconsistency:<p>1. Speaking in support of terrorist organizations should be illegal, or\n2. Donating money to terrorist organizations should be legal.<p>I disagree with both these statements, so to me, money &#x2F;= speech.')
