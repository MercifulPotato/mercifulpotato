But there is a purpose to it: the story of Mrs. Rodríguez took place around 2014-2017, whereas Luciano Garza&#x27;s was July of this year. It&#x27;s rare that the news department (i.e. as opposed to the New York Times Magazine) will run a feature closely detailing a years-old event, not without an obvious hook to why the story is being told now. Likewise, Luciano&#x27;s kidnapping and murder, sadly, wouldn&#x27;t merit such an indepth feature without an obvious tie to broader events.<p>Writing about both murders in this article made sense, IMHO, even if the transitions between narratives weren&#x27;t always completely clear. Part of the reporter&#x27;s angle was that Mrs. Rodríguez&#x27;s highly publicized fight impacted how people reacted to Luciano&#x27;s kidnapping, for better or worse.')
