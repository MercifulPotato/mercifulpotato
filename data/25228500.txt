The underlying idea would be that interfaces, like words, communicate at two levels, with both denotative (explicit) meaning, and connotative (associative, emotional, implicit) meaning. So, the argument here is that UI language should serve the user experience at both levels. I thought the Slack example was a good illustration of the point, though personally I avoid using interfaces like that. I took the bits about listening to be really about finding ways to understand your user&#x27;s emotions in relation to the tasks your interface supports. It&#x27;s for me easier to think about connotative language in ad copy and in rewards for completing actions than in other parts of interaction, but that&#x27;s why I found the article worthwhile. I have no idea what a &quot;ghost note&quot; might be in an interaction, but it&#x27;s an interesting question.')
