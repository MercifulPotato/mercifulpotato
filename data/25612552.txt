I have access to anonymized salary information.<p>Problem is - I can easily deanonymize at least 15 - 25% of all people working at our company. It isn&#x27;t easy. Also in Germany we have a law in place that allows to query your employer for average salary data in some specific cases (there have to be at least 6 comparable coworkers of the other gender).<p>Bu I agree - I would love for a more transparent approach. Even if this can come with it&#x27;s own problems.')
