The population density of Denmark would only be 2 people&#x2F;km^2 if Greenland was included. The urbanization is, however, pretty similar, but Stockholm is still much larger than Copenhagen.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there are not more similarities between the countries. Both drive on the right side of the road, and have flags with crosses, for example. But you still can&#x27;t just make a list of similarities and then say that they are identical except for the strategy, since the difference could be something not on your list, including just simple random chance.<p>The report states that there is a correlation between population spread and the spread in the elderly care. They have not made any comment on how the strategy impacted the population spread. I saw the press conference, I know what they said. They refused to answer any question from journalists regarding the over-all strategy. You should understand articles before posting them.')
