Sometimes there are no other options, or they have significant tradeoffs (in ways that aren&#x27;t due to that clause in the EULA).<p>I think a better phrasing would be something like, &quot;fighting against the ability of EULAs to restrict the buyer&#x27;s right to repair&quot;.<p>Drawing a parallel to an extreme, to show where the argument comes from: we also don&#x27;t allow people to sign themselves into slavery, even though in some circumstances people will &quot;happily&quot; do just that.')
