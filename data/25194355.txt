Quoting my answer to your reply&#x27;s parent:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nIt depends on the scope of the functionality. For example, right now, authentication and token generation are in the core, but it&#x27;s okay right now because authentication spans across the whole product.<p>We eventually will extract it out, so we could use it as a component in another product, but for now, it&#x27;s not inappropriate to leave it in the core.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;')
