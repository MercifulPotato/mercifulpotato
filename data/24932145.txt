Evolution has geared us for <i>this</i> world. We might be able to cobble together a survival elsewhere, but I doubt we could ever thrive.<p>Beyond that: space exploration and research obviously still has value. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s a very long-term and theoretical value, and at this particular moment in history there are much more pressing concerns.')
