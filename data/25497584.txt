Everytime I contact support with a question or suggestions they respond in a day or two and with a real, live person. I&#x27;ve never had an outage that I&#x27;ve personnally noticed in 4 years, not that there haven&#x27;t been any but I haven&#x27;t noticed them at least. I also host my DNS with them so i can get email on all my domains and it works well, no automation API but the web UI is easy enough i don&#x27;t need that for my tiny sites.')
