I think the definition of fat shaming I was working from was more on the &quot;Omg, look at [insert c list female celebrity], she&#x27;s (gained|lost) 10lbs!&quot; end of the scale.<p>There is also a problem on the low side of body weight. A lot of the models we see are unhealthily thin and&#x2F;or are photoshopped to look that way. While a lot of attention has been given to how this affects body image for people who end up with eating disorders like anorexia, I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised to find that the same images contribute to people feeling like they will never look like that and going the opposite direction.')
