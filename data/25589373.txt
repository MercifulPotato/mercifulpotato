It is going to depend on how we assign blame. Today if a human causes an accident that kills someone, the family can sue the human and get some from their insurance company, but most insurance policies have a relatively low limit on what they will pay. As far as the individual goes, the median net worth of someone in the US is less than $100,000. You can sue, but there really isn&#x27;t that much money to get.<p>However, with self-driving vehicles, if you sue the manufacture of the vehicle, they have significantly deeper pockets. This is going to effectively keep us stuck in the place where no matter how good self driving cars become, the responsibility remains with the driver.')
