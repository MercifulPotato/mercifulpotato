Item(by='epistasis', descendants=None, kids=[25501498], score=None, time=1608595700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499410, text='&gt; Unfortunately Core Web Vitals takes a pretty hard stance against bleeding edge technology like (Vue&#x2F;React) server side rendering with client hydration. Anything beyond a todo app starts to see considerable main thread time during hydration which obliterates the Core Web Vitals scores. I predict with continued focus on CWV we will see: much greater focus on startup times for client side apps (including better hydration strategies)...<p>To me, this doesn&#x27;t sound unfortunate, it sounds great! I&#x27;m so tired of the drag that these frameworks cause when they are applied in situations which don&#x27;t help. There are definitely use cases for such heavy and slow frameworks, but they should not be used for standard web pages, and should pay the penalty in search results when a web page with similar information is more responsive.')
