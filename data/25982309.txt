Experiencing a lot of the same things. WFH has made it worse. I have no supervision, and no work assignments. I&#x27;ve done little more than keep up with email since March. I get paid salary so I&#x27;m not complaining. Spent about a month playing with a new web framework. Got bored with it. Yet another way to do things that I&#x27;ve been doing for 20 years. Yawn.<p>Started going to the gym about a year ago. I go every other day and rarely miss. It gets me out of the house. Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s fun but it&#x27;s something to do and I like the effects on my body.<p>I&#x27;m losing faith that rationality and normal will return. We seem to double down on insanity instead of pulling back to some optimal minimum. I&#x27;m forseeing a future where every flu season is going to be 6 months at home and masks and all the rest of it. I&#x27;m astounded that so many people are so accepting of it all and seem to like being told what they can and can&#x27;t do and where they can and can&#x27;t go like they are 5 years old.')
