There is a view that, basically, there is no such thing as knowledge, just language (or, at least, there is no distinction between knowledge and language).  In this view, all there really is is language, which is mostly composed of metaphors and, ultimately, metaphors only refer to other metaphors, i.e. language is circular.  In this view, not only is the ultimate, physical, concrete world beyond us but also <i>we can&#x27;t even talk about it</i>.  From this perspective, GPT-3 is not substantively different than what our minds are doing.<p>That view makes some strong claims (I don&#x27;t find it convincing), but it&#x27;s out there.  A slightly different claim, though, is that &quot;knowledge of how (we think) the world actually works&quot; is encoded in language.  To me, that seems trivially true.  So, again, how you take this quote from LeCun depends on what you think knowledge is and your view of the relationship between knowledge and language.')
