Instead of esoteric international standards, and huge modern software packages, we have a lot of old machines, a lot of old code, and a lot more tendency towards 80s-style strategies: Post a sign stating &quot;Do not dumb here!&quot; and leave it all up to the operator to get it right.<p>There&#x27;s nothing like telling your 6-figure CNC or multi-axis robot to make a piece of carbide occupy some space where you currently have precision-ground hardened steel because someone left a G92 somewhere you didn&#x27;t expect it to be. Though I suppose that errors can be at least that expensive in GIS if you&#x27;re quoting civil engineering or real estate...')
