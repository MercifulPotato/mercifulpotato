I&#x27;ve quit to start my own company. We&#x27;re &gt;1k MRR, my salary is $0&#x2F;mo.<p>First, making money from your product&#x2F;service is much more difficult than making money selling your time. So, I would agree that 1k MRR is an amazing achievement. Moreover, I hardly doubt that even 80% of top notch devs from SV can achieve 1k MRR working on a product from 0.<p>Second, I do realize that every day that I do not work for FAANG I lose money (by not being paid a salary). Still, I also understand that I have a chance to build 1B$ ARR company. I have a chance to start making much more than what I could working for someone. This chance is tiny but it exists.<p>Third, product&#x27;s MRR and salary are different things. You might read this text having a $250k&#x2F;mo salary while your company is doing bad. You&#x27;re still paid your salary while your company is loosing millions every month. Does this mean you are a bad employe? Of course not.<p>Salary is not MRR.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25036526\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25047838')
