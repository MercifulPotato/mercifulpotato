Because you tend to work on tiny parts of a massive whole, there is no tolerance for cowboy-coding and not following best-practices. IMO the interviews test that you can fall in line and follow the patterns that have been in place for decades.<p>With regards to using API design as something that is not assessed: System design questions do test this. Also at a company like FB, there&#x27;s a handful of people designing APIs that are at the top of the pyramid, and even then long-standing conventions around API design at those companies will short-circuit the need for most devs to think about how to organize and name their endpoints.<p>At my small startup where most of us write an API endpoint, it&#x27;s important to know. For a UI dev or someone optimizing DB lookups at massive software companies, API design is not something that needs to be tested.<p>Personally I can admit to feeling frustrated that passing these types of interviews is not my forte. It sucks that I would have to study for weeks to not flop these interviews even though I consider myself a good software engineer. But that doesn&#x27;t 100% invalidate their interview process.')
