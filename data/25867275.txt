I just found another article that mentions her other remarks today:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.finance.senate.gov&#x2F;imo&#x2F;media&#x2F;doc&#x2F;Dr%20Janet%20Yellen%20Senate%20Finance%20Committee%20QFRs%2001%2021%202021.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.finance.senate.gov&#x2F;imo&#x2F;media&#x2F;doc&#x2F;Dr%20Janet%20Ye...</a><p>In those comments today she also said:<p>&quot;Bitcoin and other digital and cryptocurrencies are providing financial transactions around the globe. Like many technological developments, this offers potential benefits for the U.S. and our allies.&quot;<p>So she said multiple things and does have at least an idea about the potential benefits.  If I hadn&#x27;t been mislead by this arstechnica.com article then I would not have made the other comment.')
