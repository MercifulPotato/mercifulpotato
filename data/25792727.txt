After that, sub moderators established stronger anti-brigading rules. In 2020, t_d was either banned or made private, I forget which.<p>- A lot of the highly charged flash points of 2016 were no longer that relevant in 2020: Syrian refugees, trans bathrooms, &#x27;identity politics&#x27;<p>- 2016 also had 2 polarizing candidates. In 2020 only one was still looked at that way.')
