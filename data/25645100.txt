I&#x27;m talking about the actual read-eval-print loop, the runtime feature that reads input, evaluates it, and presents results. I&#x27;m talking about a language and runtime that is designed to be modified while it runs by evaluating incremental changes offered interactively by the user.<p>It&#x27;s not about a prompt in a terminal. It&#x27;s about a software-construction system that is designed to be modified interactively as it runs. Smalltalk is quintessentially that.<p>It seems like some folks have encountered a repl UI with a prompt in a terminal and jumped to the conclusion that this specific kind of UI <i>is</i> the repl. It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s one particular kind of UI for a repl. There are others, and there have been others since forever. For heaven&#x27;s sake, Smalltalk 76 had other kinds of UI for its repl in, well, 1976.')
