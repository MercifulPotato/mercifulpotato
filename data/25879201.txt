Now Facebook scale and quality UI isn’t good enough to demonstrate that React is a strong front end tool&quot;<p>Not the whole truth.  It was a big job.  &quot;Enterprise level&quot; has no clearly defined meaning, but I assume millions of dollars.  A large team of C# programmers doin the system.<p>So it is worth doing sustainably.  There is no evidence that react, which judging from the &quot;I have N years experience of React...&quot; N &lt;= 5 is about five years old, can be a sustainable solution for anything.  It might look good now, but can it be maintained in twelve years when all the script kiddies are off on the next Best Thing<p>Whichrelates to your rude and sweary comment about:  &quot;... is serving a industry, not the industry itself&quot;  it is not complexity but sustainability.  Facebook is the software.  Your bank is <i>not</i> its banking software.  The bank <i>needs</i> to know that in a decade they will still be able to maintain the software.  If they use React, or Angular or goodness knows what else the bountiful world of JS frameworks will throw up for us, they cannot guarantee that.<p>I can reasonably say that  Facebook doesn’t show React scales for sustainability: It does not.')
