If you do a lump sum payment you might end up joining the market at the top of a bubble where the value of Bitcoin is 12x times its long term value. Sure it will not crash 12x down but going 70% down after the bubble could be enough to cause a panic sale and thus lose your money.<p>&gt;If you divide it and invest over a period of time, you are (1) letting the un-invested money be idle<p>No, that&#x27;s not always true. For example. When you earn $5000 in excess income per year you can decide to invest it monthly. That&#x27;s dollar cost averaging and you didn&#x27;t let your uninvested money sit idle.<p>You can save up $5000 until the end of the year and then invest it. That&#x27;s a lumpsum and you did let your uninvested money sit idle.')
