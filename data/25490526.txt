Item(by='0xbadcafebee', descendants=None, kids=[25490932, 25491620, 25490870, 25490960], score=None, time=1608506210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25489879, text='&gt; it is really simple to create the basic &quot;database&quot;. You can start by using the dictionary data structure that comes with whatever programming language you&#x27;re using and slap a web API on top of it.<p>Better yet: do it in C. There&#x27;s no &quot;dictionary&quot; object type so you have to make it yourself. You&#x27;ll soon learn a whole bunch of fallacies about how those &quot;dictionaries&quot; actually work. After you spent a good deal of time doing that, you can switch to authentication&#x2F;authorization, logging, storage, tracing, API management, resource quotas, and a raft of distributed computing issues.<p>I recommend basing it on Consul, it has a better general model than etcd.')
