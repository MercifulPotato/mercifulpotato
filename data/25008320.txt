Then you ensure that the loop exits once the variable reaches zero or less.<p>ATS has this kind of proof built into the language, so that the type system helps you prove that a loop will always exit, and if it can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a compile error.<p>It&#x27;s not entirely clear how useful this is in practice. While you may be able to prove that a loop always exits, it can prove nothing about how long it will take before it does. A loop never terminating, and one that terminates some time after the Milky Way has merged with Andromeda is pretty much equivalent from a practical standpoint.')
