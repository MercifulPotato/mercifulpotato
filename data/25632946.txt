You could also write a version of (for example) Prolog or Forth or Lisp using OCaml that would compile to OCaml for execution. Doesn&#x27;t mean any of those are OCaml. Coq isn&#x27;t OCaml. Haxe isn&#x27;t OCaml. The fact that F* is written in, uses a subset of the syntax of and can be compiled to F# (or OCaml) is an implementation detail, the language and the purpose of the language aren&#x27;t to be OCaml&#x2F;F#.')
