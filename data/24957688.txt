After a negligent lane-changing sedan spun my car 360 degrees and into the rail guard, the responding police officer ordered a tow truck for me without my knowledge. When the truck arrived, the driver told me he could either take my car to his body shop or the city impound lot, in which case I would need to pay later for a second tow to the body shop of my choosing plus any storage fees.<p>I did not appreciate this strong arm sales tactic and told him he wasn&#x27;t touching my vehicle. The cop insisted that I allow the tow. She apparently was required to stay at the scene until the disabled vehicles were removed and did not want to wait for a tow truck of my choosing. I held firm. After several minutes of back and forth, the cop begrudgingly allowed me to drive my heavily damaged vehicle a few hundred yards to an exit ramp and park it on a side street.<p>An accident report was never filed, so my insurance company wasn&#x27;t able to collect damages from the other party&#x27;s insurance on my behalf. Perhaps there was a clerical error or perhaps the cop wanted to punish my assertiveness.')
