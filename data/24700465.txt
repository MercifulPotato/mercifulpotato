What they fail to understand is that the rate you experienced discrimination is higher in these areas than in others. It&#x27;s a probability, it&#x27;s clear to me from the context that surely not every interaction of yours in the south is bad, but given drawing a random interaction out of a hat, you are more likely to have a bad one living in Virginia than in New York. Given this reality, I wouldn&#x27;t want to live in the American South either.<p>There must be some sort of logical block that prevents people from understanding the nuance in these comments, and rushing to defend against absolutes that no one implied existed. I blame a lack of understanding of statistics and probability.')
