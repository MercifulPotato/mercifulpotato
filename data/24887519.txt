You shouldn&#x27;t expect equal absolute predictive power for events two sigma from the mean in opposite directions if the random variable doesn&#x27;t have a normal distribution. IQ is normally distributed, but many obvious and conventional measures of success are clearly not.<p><i>&gt; Your second argument essentially states that &quot;measures that don&#x27;t take time into account ... don&#x27;t take time into account&quot;.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m intending my argument to &quot;essentially state&quot;. My second argument is just that drawing conclusions from &quot;top line&quot; statistics like R^2 is dangerous and potentially misleading.')
