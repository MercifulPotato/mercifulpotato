Item(by='anjc', descendants=None, kids=[24688560], score=None, time=1601850219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680154, text='Although I sympathize with the author, I believe most academics are aware of&#x2F;experienced all these issues after their first year of PhD. Becoming a professor these days is hyper competitive, you don&#x27;t accidentally become a prof, or become one by default. So it&#x27;s a pity that this person would quit over issues that they were aware of from early on.<p>Regarding papers that shouldn&#x27;t be papers because it&#x27;s a waste of resources, I think it&#x27;s unkind&#x2F;elitist for someone who rose to a prof position via these resources to then propagate such a sentiment. Only experts and geniuses should attempt to publish? Only people from certain institutions? Why should an author self-censor their own work because one person who <i>chose</i> to be a PC member, to pad their CV (which OP also criticises), doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worthy?<p>In general if people are making poor contributions, their careers in academia will be short-lived, and their individual draining of resources will be minimal. If they get published then it&#x27;s likely on merit.')
