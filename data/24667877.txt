Beyond even showing it, there&#x27;s zero reason for a password reset API to respond to the request with the secret at all.  If it needs to return anything identifying about the request, it should be some identifier that is NOT the secret, which can be used to pull up general info about the request later if needed (time generated, whether it was used, is it expired, etc).  Extra points if the access credentials to any back-end API the request page uses <i>can&#x27;t</i> even request the secret key from a request.<p>A sane API makes it very hard for something like this to happen.  Often that takes an inversion of thinking, so instead of making an API as useful as possible and return as much data as efficiently as possible, you make to make it as secure as possible, which means returning as little data as possible to satisfy the specific needs of the use case, and different locked down credentials for specific use cases.')
