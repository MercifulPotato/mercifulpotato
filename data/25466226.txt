Besides, Windowing is a laughably trivial part of a game and audio isn&#x27;t that much more complex when it comes to the OS interface.<p>The decision to port&#x2F;not port to desktop Linux is not a technical one when the renderer has already been ported to Vulkan and the rest of the game already compiles on a POSIX-like platform.')
