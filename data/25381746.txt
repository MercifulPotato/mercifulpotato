Unless you are working in a complicated, abstruse line of work, you stand most to benefit from this if you are <i>bad</i> at programming.<p>Hence, the most clamorous Lisp zealots tend to be terrible programmers in their own right. The &quot;wise&quot; programmers jeep plugging along in Java, because it&#x27;s well-supported by a bigcorp and has a HUGE candidate pool when you need to hire developers who work in it.')
