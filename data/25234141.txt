While these vary in controversiality, relevancy, and apolitical nature, it&#x27;s not at all uncommon to see companies working in these areas (and others unlisted). Often companies grow into them along with size and profits, so I don&#x27;t know if Coinbase historically can be taken as sign of consistency either. What Coinbase did was effectively say &quot;well now that BLM has entered mainstream politics and other companies are taking stances, we no longer feel that the mainstream politics of the industry are agreeable to us.&quot;<p>The George Floyd spark very much &quot;outed&quot; Coinbase here, because it became an issue you couldn&#x27;t avoid taking a side on. That&#x27;s just the state of the world and you&#x27;re right that they couldn&#x27;t have anticipated it, but they chose to make a clear stance rather than trying to ride the thin line, and they became less diverse for it. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would be surprised their prior actions match that recent stance.<p>Again, I&#x27;m trying to avoid the philosophical &quot;Should companies be political&quot; debate that&#x27;s already been hashed, but simply stating how their actions translate in the current landscape.')
