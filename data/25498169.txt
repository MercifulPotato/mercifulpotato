Here in the US they are community colleges. No reason to do your intro Sociology or Calculus for Business Majors general ed class at Harvard or Stanford; the content is exactly the same as at Podunk U.<p>Instead, students should go to community college for the first two years and transfer into University upper-division majors (or, just get a 2 year cert rather than &quot;dropping out&quot; if you decide you don&#x27;t really like college after all!). You can spend two+ years mucking around in Community College for the tuition cost of half a single semester at a private university -- my local community college credit-hour cost is literally 10x less than out of state tuition at a private school: $41 vs $441. It might even allow for some sort of internship or apprenticeship program in the interim period to let kids have some experience before they settle in on a major program.<p>All of this sort of assumes though, that the system actually cares about student success, rather than laundering privilege, credentialism, and the student-loan fleecing described elsewhere in this thread.')
