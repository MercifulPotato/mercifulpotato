Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606240144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200631, text='&gt; There literally are no valid use-cases (other than buying heroin) in crypto today.<p>Even as a hyperbole, this seems odd. The various decentralized name resolution blockchains seem to be a valid use case, for instance. Sure, it&#x27;s still <i>possible</i> for project politics to cause issues (like the hard fork), it&#x27;s just significantly costlier.<p>Crypto has been overhyped, but I think it&#x27;s a mistake to say that there are &quot;literally no valid use-cases,&quot; especially in a world where FAANGs seem to want to exert ever-greater control over what we can do with their systems. Crypto has a horrible UX at the moment (&quot;first, you need to set up your wallet...&quot;) and it has an underdeveloped infrastructure, resulting in awkward centralized single points of failure (e.g. crypto exchanges). On top of that, no one has developed a &quot;killer app&quot; that could appeal to the mainstream computer user. As a consequence, the prices of crypto vary wildly, since the &quot;real economy&quot; seems to be dwarfed by simple speculation. The whole space right now is filled with criminals and ideologues and scalawags. (I imagine most of the ICO fraudsters have run out of coin.)')
