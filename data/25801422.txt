But I have also seen some detrimental long term effect of this.<p>I have seen developpers &quot;coding to the test&quot;. By that I mean they are modifying a piece of code they do not know well, and assume that if test pass, that must be good. Without understanding that test will never cover all possible inputs&#x2F;states of the system.\nThis &quot;coding to the test&quot; can appear very fast with a quick feedback loop, making possible to &quot;monkey code&quot; something until it passes.\nIf you do not have careful review, by people knowing the system, this will end badly, with race conditions only appearing in production, integration failing randomly.')
