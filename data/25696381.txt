He is also removed from Mastodon[1] too<p>For some reason, I thought that Mastadon was supposed to be free from censorship (for the sake of discussion, let&#x27;s just call it that) because you could run your own servers.<p>Did Trump get removed from a specific server or from Mastadon in general?\nOr did everyone else choose not to link (not sure of the terminology) with him?\nAnd if it&#x27;s possible to get removed from Mastadon, what makes it different than an ad-free clone of Twitter?')
