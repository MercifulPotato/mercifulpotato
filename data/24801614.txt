It&#x27;s getting up to 10 calls a day now, where as 3 years ago I would get maybe 1 spam phone call a week.<p>This seems like a problem with misaligned incentives. The profit from scammers successfully deceiving people is higher than the operational cost of cycling through phone lines, labor costs, etc. Is there something we can collectively do to change these incentives? How about individual efforts? Or is this a technological arms race? Are there other countries that have solved this problem?')
