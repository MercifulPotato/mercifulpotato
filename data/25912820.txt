But I hadn’t even touched the account in months, and before that I ran it for years without issues. Never did anything remotely fishy or against the guidelines, never got any warnings either. The only time I can even remember having issues with an ad was because we inadvertently changed the url of a landing page, hence producing a 404 on the link in the ad, which we quickly corrected after being notified.<p>And of course Google won’t even tell me the exact reason why they made a decision, so I can’t do anything about it. Their policies are super vague and broad, so in some sense almost anything could be interpreted to be against their guidelines as well. And they told me to not even try creating another account with either another name or email, because they’ll find them and block them as well.<p>Given there isn’t really a true alternative to google ads (no other company is allowed to run ads on Google results), and they dominate 80%+ of the search market. Actions like what happened to me, especially without a clear explanation, definitely feels like an abuse.<p>Being a bit cynic, if I had to guess the real reason behind the suspension of my account, I would say it’s because I didn’t implement almost any of their BS “enhancement” recommendations, which really were just thinly disguised efforts to get me to increase my spend.')
