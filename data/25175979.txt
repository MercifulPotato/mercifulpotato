Property prices are about the same in Zurich and SF, but rent is about half in Zurich as in SF. So the effect of rent control is that everyone&#x27;s rent is about doubled. I&#x27;d rather take my chances and move if my landlord doubles the rate after 2 years than be forced to pay double from the start as I&#x27;d have to in SF.')
