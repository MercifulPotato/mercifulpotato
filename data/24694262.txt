Item(by='jsjohnst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601951811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24692555, text='&gt; Pick pretty much any random 100 mile stretch of I-70 or I-80 between the Appalachians and the Rockies<p>Having recently (and historically many times before that) drove both I-70 and I-80 in the area indicated, I feel you’re being a bit hyperbolic. I’d agree both are as described for <i>some</i> 100 mile stretches (I-70 between Hays &#x2F; Salina KS and I-80 between Lincoln &#x2F; Grand Island NE as two examples), but not <i>any random</i> section.')
