I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of well-meaning people just participating in the banter and picking up the 4chan lexicon, but I&#x27;m also sure there are a lot of people that use these words with no irony or awareness. It&#x27;s like being scared to make an ironic offensive joke with your family because you feel like your cousin might laugh just a little too much. I&#x27;d be very cautious about assuming lack of explicitly-lgbt sentiment is the same as pro-lgbt-sentiment, especially given the culture wsb has branched from.')
