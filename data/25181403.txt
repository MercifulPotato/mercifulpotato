Next best thing is paying for youtube premium.</i><p>Of course, I also don&#x27;t like ads but of the choices of :  Youtube ads - vs - Youtube Premium - vs -subscription&#x2F;Patreon&#x2F;Paypal&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;etc ... <i>I prefer the ads</i>.  The other options of paid subscription are more anti-consumer to me personally.<p>I follow about ~30 Youtube channels but the churn rate is high so I&#x27;d rather not manage ~30 separate subscriptions&#x2F;Patreons and then <i>cancelling ~30 paid subscriptions</i> when the quality goes down or I&#x27;m not interested anymore.<p><i>&gt;Imagine two youtubes, one ran by ads only and one exclusively for paid subscribers. [...] In which case the interest of the platform is aligned with the interest of the user?</i><p>Netflix&#x2F;HBO&#x2F;Disney+ are subscriptions but they don&#x27;t have any videos I&#x27;m interested in. (I&#x27;m not interested in tv shows.)<p>Instead, I need quick hits of <i>topical</i> information to learn from and Youtube videos <i>with ads</i> happens to be more aligned with me than the subscription services.  I also don&#x27;t bother with paying extra for Youtube Premium to avoid ads.  I just manually skip them if they&#x27;re not relevant.<p><i>&gt;In no way ads help democratize the access to valuable information.</i><p>I disagree on this.  For me, ads work better because I mostly engage with random <i>topic</i> first more so than a particular <i>person</i>.  When a new Youtuber with no reputation creates brand new content, an ad-driven model (with algorithmic recommendations) can put that in front of me to consume.  Subscription makes no sense in this case because <i>I have no idea if this new person is worth subscribing to</i>.  Ads are <i>less friction</i> and thus, more consumer friendly.<p>E.g. My Samsung clothes dryer broke and I needed to replace a heating element. Instead of paying $300 for service, I just went to Youtube and several people happen to upload videos of how to disassemble the dryer and fix it.  It was a timely <i>topic</i> that I needed and ads were the best way for me to &quot;pay&quot; for that content.  I&#x27;m not interested in subscribing to anything!  I just wanted some visual guidance to help me fix my dryer.  Thanks Youtube for the ads and helping me save $300.<p>Another circumstance that reinforced my preference for ad-supported content creation was dealing with a family tragedy in my life.  I had stopped watching Youtube for months and when I finally came back, I noticed I didn&#x27;t have to &quot;suspend&quot; any paid subscriptions while I was gone.  Again, I <i>don&#x27;t want to watch ads</i> but I have to admit that the <i>ad-supported business model</i> is what gives me flexibility to dip in and out of Youtube without a lot of commitment.<p>To summarize...<p>Subscriptions&#x2F;Patreon:  more aligned with supporting particular <i>creators</i><p>ads : more aligned with consumers to support a wide <i>variety of topics</i> that can come from any creators, especially unknown ones')
