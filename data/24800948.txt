If you made the average person in the 1920 10X richer, they&#x27;d have behaved much like the &quot;leisure class&quot; of the time.<p>If you ask the average person &quot;why don&#x27;t you work 65% less and chill?&quot; most people would look at you funny. It&#x27;s not a choice. I have rent, etc. A solution that relies exclusively on choice fails the smell test.<p>I have my own ideas about the solution, but that&#x27;s besides the point. My point was that Keynes, not knowing the future, gave a more intellectually honest projection of what the theories predict than any post facto economist would have.<p>note: no reason to downvote a respectful, on topic comment. Asking &quot;why not&quot; is the whole point of discussions.')
