A router needs its own subnet, ergo everyone gets their own 64-bit address range. ISPs cannot give each customer a single IPv6 address because that would require each customer to have a single device connected directly to their router with no router in the CPE - basically like how dial-up used to work. There&#x27;s no demand for a service like that.<p>[1] See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ripe.net&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;press-centre&#x2F;understanding-ip-addressing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ripe.net&#x2F;about-us&#x2F;press-centre&#x2F;understanding-ip-...</a> . I note that there is a lot of misinformation and badly-informed blog posts in the top search results for &quot;ipv6 subnet size&quot; like this one, ugh: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crucial.com.au&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;ipv6-subnet-cheat-sheet-and-ipv6-cheat-sheet-reference&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crucial.com.au&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2011&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;ipv6-subnet-cheat...</a> - which is wrong because IPv6 simply doesn&#x27;t have 128-bit-sized subnet option (whereas you can have a 32-bit sized subnet in IPv4, which is how most residential ISPs&#x2F;CPEs are configured).')
