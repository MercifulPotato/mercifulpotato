Currently it is more of a side gig for mental balance, but I vividly remember the period I worked as a full time brush cutter and tree planter. It pays poorly in my country (though this somewhat depends on the season). But having spent an entire year almost exclusively outdoors in any weather, I really hesitate going back to a full time white collar &#x2F; indoors job.<p>Forestry jobs can be really demanding physically, but it sure is an eye-opening (and lung-opening) experience. I would probably still do this full time, but I found out that I have a low tolerance for brush cutter noise and vibrations and, well, now I suffer from tinnitus.<p>But, again, it was still worth it.<p>I estimate that in our epidemic of white collar burnouts, people will start looking into trades more seriously again. No &quot;teach yourself framework X in 24 hours&quot; in these fields, but slowly, gradually, over the years, you may evolve into a true master of a chosen skill. It just takes time and patience.<p>And, as a tradesman, your work involves using and coordinating your entire body all day long. As compared to the world of desk jobs - what luxury!')
