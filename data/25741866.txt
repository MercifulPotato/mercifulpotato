The clients are behind either a bridged AP or a switch, i.e. all on the same subnet, all getting their DHCP addresses from the UDM-Pro, all in the UDM-Pro&#x27;s ARP table.  There is NO double NAT happening here.<p>Furthermore I didn&#x27;t say they were invincible.  I just said they were invisible to the UDM-Pro&#x27;s UI.  Unless you have a blanket ban on outgoing LAN traffic, which would be absurd, there&#x27;s no way to block access for a particular client or a particular destination address for that client.<p>In the case I gave, a Chinese robot vacuum with no on-device interface, please tell me how to find the IP of this robot, then block outgoing traffic from it, without SSH&#x27;ing into the UDM and running scripts.  That&#x27;s right, you can&#x27;t, because the UDM-Pro doesn&#x27;t support it.')
