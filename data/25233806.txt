Item(by='wnoise', descendants=None, kids=[25234414], score=None, time=1606522283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229778, text='A point is the intersection of two &quot;generic&quot; lines in an ambient 2-d space.  But you can have coincident lines which intersect in a line, or parallel non-coincident lines which have no intersection.  Further, in 3-d, the majority of lines are &quot;skew&quot;, and neither parallel nor intersecting.<p>Similarly in an ambient 3-d space, 2 generic planes intersect to give a line.  But the planes can also be coincident or parallel.  And in higher ambient spaces can intersect at only a point, rather than a line, or even fail to intersect in a non-parallel way.<p>In 4-d space, the intersection of two generic 3-d spaces does indeed give a plane, with exactly similar caveats.<p>The standard GA doesn&#x27;t directly represent general lines or planes, however.  The elements are the equivalent of &quot;vectors&quot; rather than &quot;points&quot;, and always go through 0.  The obvious way to handle these are parameterizing the lines and surfaces, but you&#x27;re essentially working with equations for the surfaces, and keeping track of the variables.<p>The slick way of handling it is with _projective_ geometric algebra, and intersections turn into &quot;meets&quot;.  The meet of two parallel lines (planes) is now a &quot;point (line) at infinity&quot;, and of a (line, plane) with itself is the line (plane) again.  Skew lines have a meet of 0 (not the point 0, the number 0).')
