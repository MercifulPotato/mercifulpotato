I still wonder about this, though. Relevant section (c)(1) says:<p>&gt;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.<p>I&#x27;m hung up on the words &quot;provided by&quot;. Facebook&#x27;s algorithm controls what is presented to each user. They are providing a view of some posts, and not others. Facebook is creating the wall for each user, right?<p>Or would all this still considered moderation, allowing them to do what they want? Section (c)(2)(B) mentions not being liable for allowing users to control what content is accessed, but doesn&#x27;t mention when the provider makes decisions like this.<p>At an extreme, could facebook use their secret algorithm to promote all posts saying &quot;stolen election&quot; to all republicans, demote contrary posts, and still claim claim section 230 protection because they didn&#x27;t create the posts even though they could choose whatever they want to go viral amongst millions of various posts?')
