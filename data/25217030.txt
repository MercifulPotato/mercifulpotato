I actually turned off my AdBlock for Facebook as when setting up a new computer, I saw ads which I was actually interested in seeing (I do innovation contests and they showed me ads for those). And to this point I have left it off for Facebook as they continue to show ads for things I am interested in learning, purchasing, or doing. I probably click 1 in 3 Facebook ads now.<p>YouTube doesnâ€™t do this and should be targeting the ads better based on video topic.')
