At the very least, it would prompt a discussion about the code and how we are managing it.  Maybe we need some process changes or tools to prevent junk code from accumulating.<p>Edit:  if you&#x27;re talking about the math, I think &quot;changed&quot; includes added and deleted.  So, it&#x27;s the ratio of added and deleted to the total change.')
