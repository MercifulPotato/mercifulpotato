Well, you can, but you can’t. Take a look at schema.org to see where that rabbit hole will take you. So instead we use more primitive tools that allow us to model our domain without needing a tool that magically knows how to do it for us. My domain has unique nouns that differ from someone else’s.<p>JSON offers building blocks of primitive types like integers and strings and can be used to build more sophisticated types like “timezone aware datetime”. We use ISO8601 for this. We can use that <i>inside</i> JSON. Now you and I can agree on what a date is.<p>We could build this into the language itself - but many would argue the beauty of JSON is in the fact that it is very naive and can be used quite literally to model any scenario.')
