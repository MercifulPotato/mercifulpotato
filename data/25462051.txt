Lex Fridman interviewed him as well and that was pretty detailed. Its an interesting case as you had radar data(unsure if that was released) along with pilot eyewitnesses from both Fravor and the other fighter jet pilot that saw it. What Fravor said about the craft was if it was US based why have it be in an active area where fighter jets are training(this could lead to collisions etc).')
