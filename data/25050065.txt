That is not an unreasonable request.  I was able to implement the signin without too much difficulty. However, when it came to doing a server-side validation of the signin via the Apple API; it was an absolute POS blackbox.<p>Their documentation and server responses provided no indication of why the validation failed.  I searched the docs and forums; it was clear that a ton of other people had the same problem with absolutely no clues into resolving the issue.  So I just gave up on it.  Total waste of time.')
