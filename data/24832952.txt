Perhaps that is a bit too far fetched, but imagine if Google could use location tracking to know who came to your house when you weren&#x27;t there. Say you got robbed on a Friday night a 10pm.<p>They got footage of the guy, but it&#x27;s dark outside and he&#x27;s waring a hoodie, but their software knows WHO was there at that time. Some device (from ADT or Google Nest) could also have BLE trackers as well.<p>Mixed with camera footage and something like Nest Aware applying machine learning to the footage, this deal starts to make sense.')
