A whole M1-Mac is $1000, which is 825eur, not such a huge stop from 600eur and delivers a ton more.<p>The iPad hardware is perfectly capable of running full MacOS, and when apple figures out the market segmentation that extracts the maximum revenue, they likely WILL introduce a cheaper Mac to take any money they are currently leaving on the table.<p>It makes sense to me that it will actually be marketed as an &quot;iPad with keyboard that can run Mac apps&quot;, rather tnan a Mac, for the purposes of market segmentation and support (People expect <i>more</i> support from Apple for Macs than they do for iPads, and that factors into the price).<p>Prediction is hard, especially about the future. But Apple has proved (with iPhone SE, the new M1 Macs, and in other cases) that they are willing to attack any market segment currently held by others.<p>When they do it, if they do it - they&#x27;ll do it by cannibalizing sales from others, not from themselves.')
