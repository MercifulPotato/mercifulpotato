However, usually a few thoughts come to my mind...<p>1. The most obvious is that I shouldn&#x27;t exist and I&#x27;m incredibly lucky to be here. It&#x27;s a good time to be alive in history. I&#x27;m a person that can enjoy life, appreciate music and art, freely pursue my passions, and travel and see the world. Yes, I want to live longer or see what&#x27;s happening in a million years. However, I need to remind myself that I basically won the lottery a trillion times over to be here, and asking for more at that point is just absurd. I should appreciate what I&#x27;ve been given.<p>2. There are lots of people I admire in the world today. Sometimes I&#x27;m watching a YouTube video or I&#x27;m talking with someone and I can&#x27;t help but think it&#x27;s cool that I live at the same time as this person, and how they can be a part of my life.<p>3. As for death, I think about the people I know that have died: family members, good friends, personal heroes or notable people in history. They died, so I find some comfort in going where they went. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m above them, so if death was their end, it&#x27;s an acceptable fate for me too.<p>4. We don&#x27;t understand the universe. What are the odds a big bang creates a universe with the forces and elements required to enable life that can ask this very question? It shouldn&#x27;t happen. I feel like we have such a primitive understanding of the universe and beyond, and that we truly don&#x27;t understand life, and therefore death. I get a bit of comfort there, because the mysteries of the universe mean I can&#x27;t be certain what death even means. Yes, my life as I know it will end. But, maybe I&#x27;ve already died millions of times before? Maybe there is an afterlife? Maybe this is a simulation? Maybe I&#x27;ll live this life again? Maybe I&#x27;ll live an even better version of this life? We don&#x27;t know, so perhaps I shouldn&#x27;t be so pessimistic about what it means to die.')
