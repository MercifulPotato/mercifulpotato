I haven&#x27;t been watching that closely.<p>Altera is doing about the same before Intel&#x27;s acquisition. Or may be losing to Xilinx a little ( within margin of error )<p>But one thing for certain is that it hasn&#x27;t <i>grow</i>. ( At least on paper )<p>So it depends how you define well. Considering the performance of Intel&#x27;s past acquisition ( Look at Infineon ) and the total failure of Intel Custom Foundry I think it is doing quite well.')
