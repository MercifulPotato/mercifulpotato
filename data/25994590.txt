A year ago I &quot;swapped&quot; role to a team lead &#x2F; manager position.\nWhat I like most at my job is to guide co workers, help them, talk and discus new requierements with product management to get the best result we can get.\nAs a coder I like to make existing code better.<p>A great fit would be a rather small team with focused but also easy people who care about quality and longevity. \nIf you or your team (and your management) cares about that stuff I would like to get in touch with you.')
