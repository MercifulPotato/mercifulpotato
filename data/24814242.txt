The car does have &quot;speed sensitive steering&quot; though, which means that at low speeds there is almost zero resistance on the steering wheel, but quite a lot more at higher speeds.<p>Edit:\nWell, looking at the manual apparently it is possible, but only in the individual drive mode:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volvocars.com&#x2F;en-sa&#x2F;support&#x2F;manuals&#x2F;xc60&#x2F;2018w46&#x2F;seats-and-steering-wheel&#x2F;steering-wheel&#x2F;speed-dependent-steering-force" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volvocars.com&#x2F;en-sa&#x2F;support&#x2F;manuals&#x2F;xc60&#x2F;2018w46...</a><p>Which....is less than ideal, I frequently switch between Hybrid&#x2F;Pure&#x2F;Power, so having to stay in one of them just to have a tighter steering response is not acceptable.')
