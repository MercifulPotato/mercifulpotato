I assume autostash is disabled by default because the post-merge&#x2F;rebase unstash could result merge conflicts and be a pain to unwind if you change your mind.  If you just blindly set this option based on someone else&#x27;s recommendation without knowing what the stash is, and things go wrong, you&#x27;ll require a mental model of the steps involved to fix it, which you won&#x27;t have.')
