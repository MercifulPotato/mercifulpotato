Yes, there is some. But it&#x27;s a tiny fraction of the overall amount of digital ink that has been spilled over this during the past year.<p>The potential cost of a new virus is so enormous that measures reducing the probability of its occurrence, even marginally, are ridiculously cheap bargains even if they&#x27;re expensive in absolute terms. But we need to know what really happened in order to take the right measures.<p>I admit that I do find the lab-escape hypothesis plausible. I&#x27;m not certain of it, but there&#x27;s a lot of circumstantial evidence that points in that direction. Perhaps one reason this hypothesis hasn&#x27;t been publicized more is that those most qualified to assess it aren&#x27;t eager to learn that some of the research they do is insanely dangerous, and that members of their profession may have committed a screwup of world-historical proportions.')
