Item(by='quelltext', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611469661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25889636, text='&gt; A PM will make it their job to make sure it gets done, if there is no PM the unimportant stuff will fall by the wayside.<p>You will always need to spend some time project managing your project even when things are not as process heavy.<p>You still need to make sure that timelines are met or flag if they are not. Keep dependencies informed, push&#x2F;remind other teams you depend on to fix a bug, add the feature they promised. Communicate with management to get more resources, etc.<p>A PM can do all of those things with a bit of input once in a while from engineers.<p>These things only aren&#x27;t  important if you neither have timelines to meet, have no dependencies, and aren&#x27;t accountable for the success of your project. Outside a hobby project outside work I&#x27;m not sure we ever have that luxury.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t talk about other roles, so maybe where OP worked these things would have been assisted by other roles, e.g. the product manager.\nMaybe from that perspective it&#x27;s not clear to the engineer what value project managers provide but I feel it&#x27;s a bit of a limited perspective to say a role that can dedicate their time to tasks of type X isn&#x27;t of benefit to those who&#x27;d otherwise need to do these tasks.<p>I mean would you say the same about customer support? About getting clarity on compliance&#x2F;legal&#x2F;finance (via asking external council)? About internal developer tooling? There&#x27;s a point where an engineer working on a product may need to do all these things in addition to the building. But you cannot claim that it&#x27;d make no difference to the engineer&#x27;s efficiency if they could delegate those things to others.')
