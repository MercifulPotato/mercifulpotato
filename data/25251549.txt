They’re just stupid. Just eat a balanced diet with less calories and do exercise. It works. If it doesn’t it’s because you’re cheating.<p>231lb to 157lb here this year doing just that. 1600 calorie cap and regular exercise, mostly walking. After weight was gone, calories back up to normal and maintain the exercise.<p>I should note that this was achieved by eating less potatoes and fruit and eating more broccoli and cabbage. 99% of it was replacing my broken relationship with food with a healthy one, not an even more broken one.')
