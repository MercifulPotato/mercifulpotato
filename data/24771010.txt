I&#x27;m pretty sure that when I hear &quot;slab allocation&quot;, I imagine multiple sizes supported.<p>In the case of &quot;fixed-size&quot; allocations, you support all &quot;smaller sizes&quot; by returning a large size. Ex: malloc(4) returns a 64-byte block. malloc(20) returns a 64-byte block. malloc(64) returns a 64-byte block. malloc(65) causes assert( size &lt; 64) fails, and your program exits.<p>malloc(65) would probably create a &quot;new slab&quot;, supporting 128-byte blocks under a slab allocator. At least, based on how I normally hear the term used. malloc(34) may return a 64-byte block, but malloc(31) may return 32-byte block (supporting true sizes as power-of-2).<p>-------------<p>The &quot;slab allocator&quot; discussed in the blogpost seems to be a fixed-size slab allocator though. So the blogpost&#x27;s terminology doesn&#x27;t match my own.')
