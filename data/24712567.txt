There will always be a goat door to open, who cares if it gets opened prior to the choice? The choice you are being given is &quot;keep one door&quot; or &quot;choose both of the other doors.&quot; That is functionally the choice because Monty always opens a goat door. The chance of the other two doors containing a car is not affected.')
