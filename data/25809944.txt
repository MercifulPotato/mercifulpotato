Most non-native speaker which are not reading certain political news outlets likely have never heard about this word before (like me). It&#x27;s definitely not part of the vocabulary thought in (non native) english school courses.<p>Lastly, where would we end up if we have negative sentiment, every time a wrongly pronounced word happened to sound similar to a word in another language which has negative sentiment attached with it.  At that point we probably would need to remove a non small part of names and the english language because wrongly pronouncing it makes it sound like a bad word in some other language...')
