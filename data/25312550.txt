In Persia, where opium is sold without control in opium shops, 70 per cent of the adult population is addicted. So we should psychoanalyze several million Persians to find out what deep conflicts and anxieties have driven them to the use of opium? I think not.&quot;<p>Similarly, historical opium addiction in China was largely a function of supply.<p>I think there&#x27;s a bit from column A, a bit from column B, and WSB&#x27;s scoffing at the idea of &quot;psychoanalyzing Persians&quot; does seem a bit... dated (what a concept, that a large number of people might have anxieties and deep conflicts). And I whole-heartedly agree with you about the &quot;health problem not a crime&quot; issue.<p>However, I often think about that remark of WSB&#x27;s in connection with some of the more radical ideas about legalization (as opposed to decriminalization&#x2F;depenalization).')
