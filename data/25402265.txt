You can be a professional driver even if you don&#x27;t know how to write the chemical formula for the combustion in your motor.  You <i>can not</i> be a good professional driver if you don&#x27;t know how to change a flat tyre or check your oil.  No matter how good your driving is, if you cannot change the oil you are an incompetent driver.  Maybe in the future, cars will not need oil.  So good, but today they do and you need to deal with it.<p>Likewise, today&#x27;s computer systems rely on the shell.  If you are shell-illiterate, you are an incompetent programmer, no matter how good your programs are.')
