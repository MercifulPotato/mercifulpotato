Item(by='jgwil2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610804195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799980, text='&gt; To answer the question about what happens if the U.S. were to ban guns, I&#x27;d say that we would lose one of the core freedoms that made us great.<p>And how exactly has this &quot;core freedom&quot; made us great? All you&#x27;ve talked about in this thread is this abstract notion of freedom and how it&#x27;s an unqualified good. But obviously people cannot have complete freedom; that&#x27;s why we live in a society of laws. So please make an argument to why this specific freedom is so important to the flourishing of the human condition.')
