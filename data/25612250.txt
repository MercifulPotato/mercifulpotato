I&#x27;ve seen countless attempts to implement three-byte records via custom Uint24 classes that overload operators and abstract endianness (in various buggy ways) instead of just reading three damn bytes in a uint32_t. Supposedly in the name of readability (&quot;I want to be explicit that this stores a 24-bit variable, not a 32-bit variable, so I&#x27;m going to copy-paste these 200 lines of either template magic or line noise, I&#x27;m not sure, <i>but see how readable it is now</i>? Oh yeah it&#x27;s still 32-bit underneath, yeah, I&#x27;m not sure what happens if you write a 32-bit variable there, I think it breaks. This is way better than a typedef though, &#x27;cause, uh, C++-17?)')
