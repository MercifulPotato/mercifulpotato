These universities have only one thing of value and that is their exclusivity.<p>If they lose that they are no diffent than any other school. I&#x27;m torn on this issue, not because of any injustice against Asians or whites... I couldn&#x27;t care less about them on this issue, most of them have been groomed since children with tutors, classes and activities to &quot;look good&quot; to these universities.<p>I&#x27;m torn because this might be a step towards these places losing their precious exclusivity and become just like any other but I doubt they will let that happen and if this does not happen then whatever happens will not be any good for society.')
