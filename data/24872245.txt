Item(by='pwinnski', descendants=None, kids=[24880205, 24872712], score=None, time=1603476933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871030, text='That&#x27;s a lot of words that could be replaced with &quot;I don&#x27;t understand the phrase &#x27;contrary to all evidence.&#x27;&quot;<p>Although I suspect you know that, the rules around here say I should assume the most gracious possible explanation, so:<p>My long sentence did <i>not</i> in fact suggest any coordinated behavior at all, nor is there any known evidence to suggest any part of the sentence is wrong.<p>That&#x27;s the difference between something being proven false, like racist birtherism, and a lack of evidence to support your misreading of my assertion. Do I need to provide links for &quot;shots fired in a pizza parlor&quot; or &quot;protesters murdered by car&quot; or &quot;protestors murdered by gun&quot; or &quot;illegal voter intimidation&quot; or &quot;not quite ruling out the possibility that a huge chunk of elected officials and others are part of a cabal of devil-worshipping pederasts who drink the blood of children,&quot; really?<p>You go on a bit suggesting that the only reason any of the above might possibly be considered bad is that it&#x27;s labeled a certain way, but I think you&#x27;ve got that very, very backward. All of the above are considered bad, and it turns out that all of them seem to be linked to a somewhat popular and growing source which happens to fall into a category popularly known as a conspiracy theory. Call it that, or call it harmful garbage, I don&#x27;t care.<p>This sentence is the one that would give away your game, by the way:<p>&gt; If truth and rationality is truly on the side of the &quot;anti-conspiracy&quot; side of the divide, you&#x27;d think it would be child&#x27;s play to &quot;destroy conspiracy theorists with facts and logic&quot;. And yet, what accompanies the heuristic seems to be an inoculation to any epistemic challenges: circling of the wagons, typically via insubstantial&#x2F;rhetorical dismissals (ad hominen character attacks), appeals to ends justifying the means, or simply downvoting + silence.<p>That&#x27;s a doozy, and wrong both in fact and in what I think is its clear intent.')
