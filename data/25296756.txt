I&#x27;m very much an Apple person myself. I wouldn&#x27;t call him a shill, but I do have to agree that he&#x27;s become lazy about some of his opinions. He often bashes Facebook (which certainly deserves criticism) without ever using it. Many of his Apple reviews are very long-winded love letters to Apple about how great their products are. Every once in a while he will call out blatant Apple mistakes, but they have to be pretty bad.')
