IANAL but I’ve worked on redlining legal contract terms commercially.<p>Almost every legal (or otherwise collaborative) document has “track changes” enabled on its source document for the last 25+ years, which captures every keystroke in Word or WordPerfect.<p>I cannot recall there’s ever been a subpoena for the track changes source.  It’s generally immaterial.  Negotiation proceedings are not the contract, the contract is what was signed and both parties have a copy as paper, image, or PDF.<p>Computer forensics are often about determining whether a  final image was altered after mutual acceptance.  This is also why important documents get notarized.')
