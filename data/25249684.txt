The fact that that’s the best option practically seems good to me, as I think it’s the best option architecturally. I don’t think it’s great to have a file committed to an upstream repo that is too particular about the machine being used when shared among multiple people. It’s better to make it so you can share it with people on different machines, and put those changes in the repo so others aren’t repeating that same work on their local machines. If you have an unresponsive upstream repo maintainer, that’s a whole problem in and of itself. Seems better to fork it in that kind of a situation rather than have a local bandaid.<p>In the case of editor config files already tracked in the repo, I think it makes sense to remove those from being tracked, add to the gitignore, and push that upstream. Unless dealing with a team that agrees to use the same editor and wants to share settings, having editor settings committed to the repo seems like a mistake that should be corrected upstream. Same thing applies as in previous situation if the upstream maintainer is unresponsive.')
