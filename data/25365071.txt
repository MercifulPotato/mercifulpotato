I think my wife and I have a very trusting relationship; the way that she criticizes me would possibly be inappropriate in a professional setting, and definitely raises eyebrows when overheard by others.<p>She is <i>able</i> to not beat around the bush with criticism because of the relationship we have, and it&#x27;s <i>good</i> that she doesn&#x27;t because with kids, household &amp;c. there&#x27;s a lot to communicate and often not a lot of time to do it (plus any time we spend on necessary communication eats into our leisure time together).<p>With my boss of many years, the conversation is a bit less intimate and frank, but still fairly to the point: &quot;[foo] sucked.  You need to figure out how to make it suck less.  If you need resources to make it suck less next time, let me know.  [Peer A] is quite good at [foo] so maybe you can reach out to [him&#x2F;her] for some tips.&quot;<p>If it&#x27;s in the context of a periodic review, there will probably be lots of positive comments too, but that&#x27;s more natural because (hopefully) no period of work goes buy without both good and bad things happening.<p>When I got a new manager, the relationship was newer so there was a bit more beating around the bush for things just because the relationship is not as sussed out.
