The level, and degree of planning, of genocide in conquered territories was historically _very_ unusual. Medieval armies, say, were not generally followed by specialist murder units. Even in, say, the Reconquista, there was no real equivalent of the Einsatzgruppen, nevermind what came after occupation.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say previous wars were clean; lots and lots of civilians died, but there was rarely an organ of the military whose explicit purpose was in massacring civilians until WW2.<p>I think there&#x27;s a reasonable case that the Nazi military really did have a special, virtually unique brand of evil.')
