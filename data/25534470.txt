Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[25538943], score=None, time=1608874634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25534339, text='&gt; I won’t dispute that most constitutional courts around the world are conservative or ideologically neutral, since they are aware that they can interpret the law as written, and not act as a pressure release valve against the dead hand of their “Founders” as they know that their populations can amend their constitutions if there is a pressing need.<p>The difficulty of amending the constitution is a theoretical problem. It takes a 2&#x2F;3 majority of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat in Germany to amend the Basic Law. And for most of the issues where there is a disconnect between what the people want and the constitution, there wouldn’t be sufficient public support for an amendment even under the lower standard. Take gun control: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slowboring.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;national-democrats-misguided-re-embrace" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slowboring.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;national-democrats-misguided-re...</a><p>Could you get a 2&#x2F;3 majority of the House and Senate to repeal the second amendment? No way. Maybe you could get a 2&#x2F;3 majority of both houses to overturn <i>Citizens United.</i><p>But note also that 2&#x2F;3 of Americans still oppose the Supreme Court decision banning school prayer. So it works both ways.<p>Obamacare is a bad example. The ACA case wasn’t a liberal versus conservative thing. It was simply a matter of the law as drafted failing to respect federalism. Courts in other countries aggressively enforce the structural protections of their constitutions, more so than the Supreme Court. Legislatures in those countries just deal with it. For example, Canada’s health system is largely administered by the provinces, with the federal government mainly setting standards and paying block grants to even out funding inequalities between the provinces. Has the ACA been modeled on Canada’s system (and in fact Medicaid is pretty similar) it would easily have passed muster in the Supreme Court.<p>The FDR era is the best example of where the Supreme Court really did strike down the will of the people to adhere to a conservative reading of the constitution. But the Supreme Court folded like a cheap suit when FDR threatened it, and now we have a nationwide minimum wage and executive administrative agencies that act like legislatures in issuing rules that have the force of law and like the judiciary in adjudicating regulatory violations before administrative judges. I don’t think say the German constitutional court would have allowed an entire new branch of government to be created without a constitutional amendment. While some conservatives might say the entire administrative state is unconstitutional, the public got its way ultimately. And you’re right I think it was the Supreme Court acting as a pressure release valve.<p>But overall I think it’s rare for conservatives on the Supreme Court to be out of step with the public on a legal issue where there is enough public consensus that an amendment would be possible under a lower 2&#x2F;3 standard. Generally, conservatives are in the position of resisting change in areas where liberals might have a narrow majority or not even a majority.')
