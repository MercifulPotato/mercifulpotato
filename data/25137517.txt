Forget the require bit. Say it&#x27;s an option.<p>You&#x27;re employed with a salary of $X at location Y.<p>Your employer wants you to move to location Z with higher cost-of-living. You can either stay at location Y or move to location Z. You feel it&#x27;s right that your employer increase your salary because of the higher cost of living if you move to Z.<p>The company is asking you to make a concession: do the same work, but in a different location.<p>When you ask to move to a lower-cost area, aren&#x27;t you asking for the same concession? Why is that concession expected to be gratuitous vs the same concession from the company which is expected to be compensated?')
