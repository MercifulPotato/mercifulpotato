Intrinsic geometry was not a seemingly &quot;useless&quot; generalization; it was motivated by concrete and specific problems about surfaces and mathematical physics. For example, one of Riemann&#x27;s papers was literally titled &quot;A mathematical work that seeks to answer the question posed by the most distinguished academy of Paris.&quot; (Perhaps not literally, given that&#x27;s a translation, but you get the point.)<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about ZX calculus, but if people are using it to solve real-world problems, that sounds good to me. What I object to is pure mathematicians giving &quot;applications&quot; of their work that aren&#x27;t useful or real. And when the authors allude to applications in chemistry and biology, and no chemists or biologists are doing anything with category-theoretical analyses of Petri nets, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to point this out.')
