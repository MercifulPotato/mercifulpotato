We handle the data warehouse, data pipelines (SaaS tools + DBs), and syncing so everything stays up to date.<p>We are thinking ahead to our next hire and looking for a hybrid designer&#x2F;developer; person no.5 on our team. Likely start date would be in February.<p>You would be Sourcetable&#x27;s first designer and responsible making data accessible to everyone. There are plenty of design challenges including an easy-to-use Joins GUI (it&#x27;s the &quot;easy&quot; part that&#x27;s hard), data documentation, collaboration, visualizations, business templates, general branding, and more!<p>When not engaged in creating designs, you will be required to implement them. This requires strong React.js skills, and modest backend experience including SQL, database and API work.<p>Note: to succeed in this role it is imperative that you are a hybrid designer&#x2F;developer. We are a small team, and everybody has to wear many hats. Design discussions often extend to the database-schema level, so designers with programming experience will have an advantage here.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in learning more, we&#x27;d love to meet you! Email eoin@sourcetable.com (co-founder &#x2F; hiring manager).<p>p.s. Bonus points if you have been part of an early-stage or founding team. Please mention it in your email!')
