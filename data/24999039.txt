Incidentally &quot;this is a problem of people, not language&quot; is one of my pet peeve statements (not that I&#x27;m mad at you, of course!) specifically because I&#x27;ve had it used against me enough to defend choosing, imo, bad tools. Everyone thinks they have developers that are good enough that they don&#x27;t need the bumpers up when they bowl. But honestly, it&#x27;s just almost never true (and if it is, it won&#x27;t be for long as your company grows).<p>One company I worked at had &quot;we hire the best!&quot; as its slogan, and they used it to justify so much bad practice. No code reviews (we just don&#x27;t hire people who write bad code), no unit testing (same reason), python used for huge sprawling 10+ year old codebases that&#x27;s on its third or fourth generation of maintainers, and no documentation anywhere. Everything is a spelunking expedition, and there&#x27;s no type safety or anything to help you figure it out. There are more than a few thousand-plus line functions that make PyCharm chug every time your touch a character.<p>On the flip side, the Java and C++ codebases were similarly abused (no tests, no docs, four generations of maintainers&#x2F;oral tradition, no code reviews ever) but are at least two orders of magnitude easier to traverse because the type system keeps everyone honest across decades in a way that dynamic languages just do not.')
