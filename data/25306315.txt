But surely you can see this is necessarily a minority of the population. Necessarily, most people who are part or the world economy will not experience labor this way.<p>It&#x27;s a strange line of reasoning! Every time there&#x27;s talk of reigning in employer surveillance, reducing working hours or generally speaking any measure that seeks to leverage up workers&#x27; power against their employers, there&#x27;s a comfy tech worker ready to comment about how, well, I&#x27;m actually an exception, I actually like my job, etc...<p>And good for you, truly, if that&#x27;s you! It feels wonderful to have employment that you really enjoy and look forward to. Keep working on the weekend if you really want to (a real danger of burnout though). But we are the <i>exception</i> here, and it makes no sense to govern based only on exceptions.')
