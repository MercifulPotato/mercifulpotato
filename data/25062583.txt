No commitment to anyone or anything, not even his own family or sense of identity.<p>I doubt he &quot;enjoyed&quot; messing with others; more like he could not fathom what impact his actions had on them. Narcissists and cult leaders are the ones who &quot;enjoy&quot; messing with others-- and tend to stay in place until the bitter end.<p>This guy was probably just mentally ill but high-functioning. Despite his egregious behavior, I&#x27;d bet he never saw this coming.')
