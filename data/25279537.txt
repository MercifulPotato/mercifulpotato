Its &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;. The visuals are gorgeous, the premise of the anime is super interesting (A girl was saved by a prince when she was small and then decided to become like him while she waits for him to return by wearing male clothes and acting like a hero) and the whole story is super trippy in general.\nAlso it has many references to art and religion[1][2].\nI&#x27;m at around the half point right now, but can definitely recommend!<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ohtori_nu&#x2F;status&#x2F;1068525697713356804" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ohtori_nu&#x2F;status&#x2F;1068525697713356804</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohtori.nu&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;01_meike_disciples_of_abraxas_4.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohtori.nu&#x2F;analysis&#x2F;01_meike_disciples_of_abraxas_4.h...</a> (The anime quotes from the famous german author Herman Hesse)')
