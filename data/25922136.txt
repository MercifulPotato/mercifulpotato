My advice here, having seen dozens of hopelessly over-engineered &#x2F; oversized solutions as a database consultant over the last 5 years, is short and blunt: Don’t overthink, and keep it simple on the database side! Instead of getting fancy with the database, focus on your application. Turn your microscope to the database only when the need actually arises, m’kay! When that day comes, first of all, try all the common vertical scale-up approaches and tricks. Try to avoid using derivative Postgres products, or employing distributed approaches, or home-brewed sharding at all costs – until you have, say, less than 1 year of breathing room available.&quot;')
