It is inconvenient, you can&#x27;t make a playlist and it gets damaged.<p>I can buy downloadable MP3s from Amazon, if I wanted to own the music.<p>Thing is, I don&#x27;t. I want a streaming service that has all the music ever produced, that I can hook into the player of my choice, and one that works on my phone when I am driving, and at my computer at work when I am working and at my home computer when I am at home.<p>CDs wouldn&#x27;t do any of that and they are a pain to rip and I don&#x27;t want the music on different devices.<p>I can&#x27;t hear the difference between a 256+ MP3 and neither can most people. I won&#x27;t argue that nobody can, but most people who have thousands of dollars in audio equipment probably weren&#x27;t streaming to begin with.')
