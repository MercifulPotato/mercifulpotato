But I have never felt the need to &quot;run&quot; a website in a separate &quot;app&quot;.<p>If you use these, and can see their use case, please help me understand. Is the point that the web browser opens a new window and hides its toolbar to give you more screen real estate? Changes icon to match the favicon, so it is easier to switch to that window later?<p>What usability features am I missing out on if I just go to the website in my regular browser window, like the caveperson I suppose I am? :)')
