Your expectation is that EVERY burger must be made perfectly and if it&#x27;s not its fixed RIGHT away.<p>Even at a moderately busy McDonalds there will be errors in your order. You can always go back and tell them to fix it and then you will wait... because they are busy filling new orders. And even after you waited there is a chance that they forgot about your fix, they remade it and it is still wrong, or something else happens.<p>This kind of stuff happens all the time in the real world. In fact, restaurants and food safety scores are the epitome of &quot;try Olympics.&quot; You can have a rat in a kitchen in San Francisco and still not be immediately closed. But if you are making conscious efforts to remedy that, you can stay open and often have a long time to fix it.')
