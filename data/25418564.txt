What came first, empirical philosophers or the recognition that mundane experiential stuff is useful?<p>I&#x27;m just arguing against a sort of waterfall model of philosophers sitting on top of the totem pole and passing down to us what to do. Perhaps that&#x27;s a straw man though, but some people do seem to think that before Aristotle gave us logic we couldn&#x27;t follow complex arguments. Indeed, I think it&#x27;s rather that they formalized already existing argument structures they observed in the agora etc. For sure the abstract tools also turned out to be useful and abstraction is how we got to the moon, not through taller ladders etc.<p>I think it&#x27;s hard to deny there is a bitter elitist tinge to philosophers that they don&#x27;t get enough credit, but it&#x27;s definitely a larger topic than what fits in a comment.')
