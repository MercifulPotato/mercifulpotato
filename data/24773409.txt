Wealthy families, care about school. So even if the school is crappy, they will make sure their kids learn what they need to. In impoverished school districts, teachers can&#x27;t concentrate on teaching, because they have to act as both teachers and social workers and advocates for their students.<p>So even if you increased the funding of schools, if you did not address the poverty in the surrounding community, it will mostly be a waste of money and political capital.')
