Here is a dilemma - you have 10 million dollars<p>It&#x27;s not a dilemma. At all. If you have 10 million dollars just lying around, chances are, uo already know what to do with your money.<p>So your entire premise is based on a combination of assumptions that make it entirely laughable:<p>- that if you have 10 million dollars, you have a problem with storing them<p>- that in order to defend bitcoin you have to come up with an example involving no less than 10 million dollars<p>&gt; Do you buy gold? Gold is useless. Buy stocks? How do you pick them? Of course USD is going to deflate.<p>Ah, I feel so sad for people who have 10 million dollars which they have to just &quot;park&quot;. How did they ever manage to do that in the past?<p>Oh, right. Stocks, property, securities, bonds, investments, diversified portfolios.')
