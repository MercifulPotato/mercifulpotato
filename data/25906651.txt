Typically the early users are geographically distant. This distance means that users are unlikely to find anyone nearby. Considered as a marketplace it is illiquid.<p>It works on Facebook because Facebook&#x27;s user graph is not sparse. People looking to connect can find other people nearby with similar interests.<p>Another factor with Facebook is moderation which reduces the risk from bad actors. This is also possible due to scale.<p>Good luck.')
