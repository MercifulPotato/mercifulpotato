The don&#x27;t stick with Google search out of lazyness, but because all alternatives suck llamas balls (Bing, DDG, etc.)<p>But consider how fast, and how many times, people switched browsers, first leaving behind the de-facto market leader (Netscape to IE), then leaving behind the OS-bundled one (IE to Firefox), then again leaving behind the current leader to a new faster engine (Firefox to Chrome).<p>With Google Maps deteriorating and the discomfort of change much smaller than changing than changing browsers, it&#x27;s all too easy to switch to another map website.<p>Heck, that has happened in the past, Google Maps wasn&#x27;t the first always.
