So in the great scheme of programming languages, its still rather low level (since you&#x27;re manually handling memory).<p>Indeed: ISPC provides constructs to provide structure-of-arrays, and other low-level memory layout details. This is a good thing: these details have significant implications on the speed of your program.<p>Nonetheless, any language which wrangles with manual details of memory layout, or new&#x2F;delete based memory allocation, is inevitably going to be classified as low level in my books.<p>&gt; ISPC among others provides a great interface to SIMD model for CPUs that simply isnâ€™t available in Julia.<p>If Julia can compile into GPU-assembly (which is innately SIMD), I&#x27;m sure an AVX-based compile could work eventually.<p>They may have to target AVX512 (since most GPU-assembly requires per-thread exec-masks), but the general concept is being proven as Julia can now compile down into PTX or AMDGPU assembly.<p>Julia&#x27;s compile down to GPU-assembly &#x2F; SIMD code is not supported in the &quot;general case&quot;, only in select circumstances. But that&#x27;s still an incredible boon for a high-level language.')
