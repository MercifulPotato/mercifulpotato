I think, however, that there&#x27;s something of a false equivalence: It is not the case that the tweets which are inciting violence are coming from all political believers in equal share.<p>We don&#x27;t get &quot;longstanding liberal principles&quot; by publishing our speech on a private corporate platform. Freedom of speech and due process are merits of the law and not of Twitter&#x27;s terms of service. Twitter is free to ban all incitements to violence without banning all hyperbolic political speech.')
