Things are looking good with the reception from agencies we&#x27;ve reached out to. But it&#x27;s clear we&#x27;ll need to hire an awesome product person as soon as funds allow. So curious on advice as to how one even starts this process much less finding the right fit? Any help here is appreciated!')
