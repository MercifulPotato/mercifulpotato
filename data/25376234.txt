Conspiring with the Russians and then lying about it to the FBI when they are investigating Russian election interference is indeed a crime and it&#x27;s precisely what Flynn says he is guilty of. Keep in mind too that this was meant to be a plea <i>down</i> from more major crimes. Flynn was getting off easy by only admitting to those crimes.')
