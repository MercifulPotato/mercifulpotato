In my opinion the swap is useless and it is better to just install enough physical memory.<p>I reboot that system just once a year or so, for a kernel update or a hardware upgrade.<p>I run on it a large number of services, mostly Internet related, e.g. firewall, router, NTP server, DNS server for outside, DNS resolver for the internal network, e-mail server, Web server, Web proxy, file server.')
