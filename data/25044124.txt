From the ESTA application website, appropriate use includes &quot;You plan to travel to the United States for business or pleasure.&quot;<p>Meetings are fine. You&#x27;ll note the visa he was approved for is a tourist visa. Which is also fine for the same use - given it was approved with the use of an invitation letter from his employer.<p>You need to say something very dumb to a border guard to get denied on the basis of exceeding the allowed use of the visa waiver, but if you do, you&#x27;d get turned away <i>then and there</i>, not rejected at the airport the next time.<p>&quot;Something&quot; certainly got triggered, but it&#x27;s highly unlikely to have been about going for business meetings.<p>My <i>guess</i> would be that something got messed up with his previous <i>departure</i>, such as e.g. failing to register that he left on time, as that is one of the things that would pretty much instantly disqualify you from future visa free travel. I almost got into trouble for that myself with visa waivers (though pre-ESTA). The main reason I wasn&#x27;t denied re-entry was that I was still within the 90 day window of the previous entry, so I provably hadn&#x27;t overstayed, and they could see I had about a dozen or so short stays that made it very obvious it was a mistake. But that was in person, with someone manually looking through my passport stamps - I&#x27;m not at all sure it&#x27;d have gone as well today with automated pre-flight checks.')
