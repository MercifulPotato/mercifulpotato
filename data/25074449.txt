They will move Apple Silicon to the rest of their MacBooks, and into their iMacs. 16 gb RAM and two ports ain’t going to cut it for them.<p>Where I can be wrong is that Apple could release two chips. First an upgraded M1, let’s call it M1x that supports a bit more on chip ram (24 or 32 Gb) and four ports. It would be only for high end MacBook Pros and again optimized for battery life.<p>And they would release a M1d for desktops that has more cores, but moves RAM off chip.  That would improve multicore performance, but I don’t know how it much it would hurt single core with slower memory fetches. Probably they could compensate with higher clock speeds, power budgets, and more active cooling.')
