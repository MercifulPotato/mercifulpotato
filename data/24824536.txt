It is not backed by anything.<p>This is only true of fiat currencies. Not all currencies are fiat.<p>&gt; A critical piece of information is missing from our education system. A clear definition of money.<p>That&#x27;s because the notion of what money is has changed over time and, quite often, people can&#x27;t agree on a proper definition.<p>&gt; Because governments are incentivised to inflate the money supply and make debt easier to pay back, the critical “trust” component of the money has a non-zero probability of erosion. That means it’s just a matter of time until the currency fails.<p>This is definitely not a widely held view.<p>The main insight the author claims is:<p>&gt; If money is trust, what are we trusting? We are trusting that a dollar maintains purchasing power. Purchasing Power is what you can buy for each of your dollars when you spend them.<p>Again, not a widely held view, and it&#x27;s not clear that&#x27;s where the value of a currency comes from.<p>With the risk of being too harsh, the author is clearly not an economist, doesn&#x27;t have any deep insight into what money (more precisely dollars, in this case) is, and also comes off as biased (he works in crypto, which usually has an agenda against &quot;mainstream&quot; currencies).')
