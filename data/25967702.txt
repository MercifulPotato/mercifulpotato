But why is this such a big issue? I mean, a lot of universities do not have a pure-math faculty because they are dedicated to other faculties. I guess it depends on what the Uni wants to be. My Uni didn&#x27;t have a physics department, or a medical one, or arts, or music... All of these faculties were however available in other Unis.')
