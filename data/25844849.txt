For ordinals, “1st” is the natural starring point. But we don&#x27;t write “1st” in programming, even when we used 1-based indexing to try to match an ordinal intuition, we just write “1”. If we distiguished ordinals and allowed both cardinal offsets and ordinal indexes to be used, I think we’d be fine.')
