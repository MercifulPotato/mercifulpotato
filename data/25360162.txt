There are constantly clients bringing their demands for additional features or major fixes, very rarely are they &quot;please optimize the UI&quot;. For consumer facing products, that&#x27;s not really the case, unless some massive features are missing, they would rather things be snappy as they tend to be extremely distracted at all times so dropping your app&#x2F;site&#x2F;whatever is no big deal.<p>During work, what else are you going to do if Cloud UI is slow besides just wait? Go through the entire process of trying to convince management to make a switch because UI is a little clunky? Good luck with that!')
