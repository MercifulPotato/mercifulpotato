Every video of his mentions he studied at Cambridge and is a Doctor. Clearly it works quite well for the audience he is targeting as he has over 1.2 million subscribers on YouTube with an highly engaged subscriber base.<p>His content isn&#x27;t anything special when you look at it and he plays <i>a lot</i> on his &quot;socially awkward&quot; personality which seems to work well with people seeking out self-improvement advice.<p>These people sure are excellent at marketing so I guess fair play to them. Ali isn&#x27;t hurting anyone with his generic advice, probably quite the opposite in fact so I fair enough to him.')
