But I don’t right now, so I’m going to use the option that gives me a time series DB with three or four clicks, gets the job done, and charges me for deployment and maintenance amortised across thousands of other customers.<p>Having these arguments purely on cost of service terms is a very slippery slope. Yes, it’s less dollars paid in hardware if I put my life on hold and learn how to configure this. Or pay someone else to do it. Yes, it’s cheaper if I order parts on newegg, build a server, drive to a colo and install it in the rack, and then drive there again each time something breaks. And yes, it’s even cheaper if I run it off a Raspberry Pi duct taped under my desk. No one is disputing these things.<p>AWS and other cloud providers sell peace of mind, acquisition and procurement speed, professional maintenance and remediation, deep integration, faster development and testing, and infrastructure management - with servers thrown in for free. Timescale sells time series database software. This is not a valid comparison.')
