Every single HexagonalKitten comment so far has been about how <i>others</i> get all upset about things, and, of course, &#x27;immigration issues&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s not that I have an issue discussing these topics, but at some point I do feel I have to use some quick heuristics to weed out the trolls or &#x27;culture wars&#x27; group-thinkers.')
