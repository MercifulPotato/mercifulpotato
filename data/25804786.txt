Personally, I have three important characteristics for a feedback.<p>Point 1 : &quot;Be Specific&quot;. I can not stress this enough. Please point out specific observable behaviour.<p>Point 2 : Frame feedback in terms of team&#x2F;organisational goals. Every team has a purpose within the organisation. It&#x27;s a team game and every team member should know the feedback in context of the team game. Individual feedback, team context.<p>Point 3 : Cite the past but look for future changes in behaviour. You can not change the past but you can influence the future.<p>For example, &quot;Hey John! When you do X, it helps the team achieve Y. Please continue doing so!&quot; or &quot;Hey John! When you do Z, it lets the team down. What can you do differently?&quot;.')
