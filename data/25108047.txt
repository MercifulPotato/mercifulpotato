Last quarter (July–September) the Mac grossed more than it ever has in one quarter: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-reports-fourth-...</a><p>Think about it.<p>During a global pandemic, countries shutting down and the global economy not doing so well to say the least, the Mac at 36-years old grossed a little over $9 billion. That&#x27;s more than either the iPad or the Apple Watch.<p>It seems that people working from home for the foreseeable future bought a lot of Macs.<p>Should be interesting now that M1 Mac laptops are reported to have blow away performance and last as long as 20 hours on a single charge.<p>And these Macs come with a BSD-derived development environment and will likely run Linux in a VM faster than comparable Intel machines can run it natively.')
