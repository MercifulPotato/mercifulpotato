Auto gig workers typically rent or lease the cars, then work to pay them off, living on precarious margins.  Sure, they&#x27;re responsible for maintenance, but at the end of the day, the cars will vanish if they don&#x27;t make their payments.  Most of us rent our houses or have mortgages on them, but they&#x27;re not paid off.<p>Which is why people are working so much in the first place!  There are payments to be made, on a strict schedule.  You could lose your home and burn bridges if you don&#x27;t keep up.  Quite a few people actually do lose their homes and burn bridges.  It&#x27;s common to think of this as being their fault for being lazy.<p>But this whole arrangement is unsustainable for the people and for the planet.<p>And this is the whole point of Thomas Piketty&#x27;s famous book a few years back that caused a big stir but is all but ignored by political and economic leaders in the US.<p>There are very good reasons why cultures before banned usury.  Sure, rent and debt are powerful economic tools, but with great power comes great responsibility, and I&#x27;m still waiting for the lawmakers and business leaders where I live (the US) to go ahead and exercise that responsibility by creating sensible countermeasures to protect people from exploitation.')
