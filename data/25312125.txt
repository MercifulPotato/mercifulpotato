And even if you did, it&#x27;s incredibly unrelated to the matter at hand.<p>No one has even claimed she was fired for bad performance and dozens of Google employees have said in no part of their process was academic rigor taken into account.<p>What you&#x27;re doing is the literal definition of concern trolling.')
