Soon every new character is running around with the third-best hat on, and the fourth best sword. With such a compressed distance between typical and exceptional, everyone becomes muted. What&#x27;s there to hope for? Why do I even bother to try, when good enough takes no effort at all?<p>There were several points where my decision to play a game came down to my read of the game economy. If they had no coherent solution to the deflation problem, thanks but no thanks.<p>I don&#x27;t know how directly these motivators translate to the real world, but people are people and I can see things getting pretty bad.')
