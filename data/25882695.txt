It&#x27;s just not realistic to do so for every platform.  Postgres is developed by a small number of people, isn&#x27;t VC backed etc. The amount of resources we can throw at something is fairly limited.  I&#x27;m hoping to work on adding linux DIO support to pg, but I&#x27;m sure as hell not going to do be able to do the same on windows (solaris, hpux, aix, ...) etc.')
