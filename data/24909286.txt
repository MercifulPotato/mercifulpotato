If nothing else, they&#x27;ve been getting it right on the first try more often than the cmake &amp;&amp; make projects.  That may be biased though, with newer&#x2F;more active projects using newer build systems supporting newer hardware.<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s been enough that I&#x27;m looking into it, but still working (hacking? copy&#x2F;pasting?) in make')
