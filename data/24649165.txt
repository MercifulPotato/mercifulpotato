There are really two audiences for C++, those writing generic libraries, and those using them.<p>If you&#x27;re in the former group you&#x27;ll be delving into all the template nitty gritty. If you&#x27;re in the latter group you&#x27;ll rarely need them (I think our 200k+ LOC C++ codebase uses std::enable_if three times).<p>I still like the language though. There&#x27;s no obligation on any C++ dev to use all the new features.<p>Personally, I find Rust&#x27;s syntax to be quite ugly compared to C++&#x27;s; horses for courses I suppose.')
