You built a service available on say <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;service.huge.example&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;service.huge.example&#x2F;</a> and it has a bunch of users who are thus HugeCorp customers. Maybe they are prisons, or fast food restaurants, or whatever, it doesn&#x27;t matter, except these are clearly not humans. (Client certificate management UX is awful for humans)<p>Ordinarily sooner or later HugeCorp IT will decide you need a fancy middlebox - from say Cisco, or Fortinet, or dozens of other companies - to tick a box on some executive&#x27;s list. Ordinarily they just impose the middlebox and, since it can&#x27;t do its job otherwise, they insist your private keys and certificates get copied to the middlebox. Now it&#x27;s impersonating your <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;service.huge.example&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;service.huge.example&#x2F;</a> site and every bug in that middlebox is now a bug in your service. Does it offer any benefits? Probably not really unless you did a very poor job of building the service, but it did tick a box on a list, and the manufacturer got paid. Good luck, have fun.<p>But with mutual authentication that can&#x27;t work. They <i>could</i> reach out to every single user of the service and agree that all these users will actually now be separately authenticating to the middlebox. If any of them don&#x27;t want to, you can&#x27;t offer the service to them any more. So this won&#x27;t end up happening, although feel free to propose it in meetings if you want the executives to explode.<p>Instead they&#x27;ll have to except your service from the stupid middlebox, and you are freed from wasting your time chasing bugs that are in somebody else&#x27;s product. Remember to send pity donuts to the teams trying to &quot;fix&quot; such problems in other services that weren&#x27;t as lucky.<p>Finally TLS 1.3 makes client certificates work a little better, because it allows a server to give more sophisticated guidance on what sort of certificates it actually wants. In prior versions the only guidance the server is permitted to give is, &quot;I trust these CAs, show me a client certificate they signed&quot;.<p>Still never use this for humans though, the human facing UX is not at all good. Good for machines talking to machines.')
