It makes claims that he&#x27;s hindered &quot;serious&quot; academic research regarding ESP but doesn&#x27;t really back that up with any kind of evidence that shows the research is serious (how serious can it be if it hasn&#x27;t produced any evidence?).<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that Randi wasn&#x27;t flawless or perfect but this kind of hit piece is both silly and pointless.')
