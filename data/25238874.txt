We were defending ourselves against their original attack.<p>That happened in 41, the bombs were dropped in 45.<p>Hardly any civilians died at Pearl Harbor, it was a military target. Hundreds of thousands civilians died after U.S. launched the bombs.<p>This was not a proportional response to Pearl Harbor or any other attack by the Japanese. There was no need for nukes to &quot;defend&quot; yourselves. In fact the U.S. was one of the <i>least</i> impacted countries of WWII among the major powers.<p>Statements at the time by U.S. officials indicate this was deliberate aggression to show the power of the bomb to the world as not to challenge U.S. dominance.')
