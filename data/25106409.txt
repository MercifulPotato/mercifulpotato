Is it primarily thanks to their business strategy?&quot;<p>Basically they are riding the new wave of cheap devices that outnumber the x86 devices by 10x 20x.<p>Basically everything uses an ARM CPU these days, not just tablets and phones, but microwaves, TVs, projectors, refrigerators, ovens, 3D printers...<p>That makes those devices extremely cheap on volume and make innovations to happen faster than o a single company like Intel, that was not interested on those low margin products.<p>Intel is far from incompetent, they just decided to get advantage of their monopoly position to reap as big profits and margins as they could get for the longest possible time, instead of cannibalizing themselves with lower margins.<p>And it was great for them. Their executives have done great. They have just ruled the semiconductor industry and wanted to enjoy it.')
