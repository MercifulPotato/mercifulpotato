My partner got the device, I&#x27;m responsible for its running.<p>Had issues and tried to interface with their tech support.  Unless you email with the person&#x27;s email that bought it - nothing.  Then when you email them with that person&#x27;s email - nothing.<p>There are a number of systemic issues that I think can be fixed either in firmware (which I guess they don&#x27;t believe in updating) and&#x2F;or a hardware upgrade kit (which I&#x27;m willing to buy - if I felt that they understood the issues.)<p>In this day and age, not allowing easy community access to root out issues is just not excusable.  They need to spend more on updating their site for honest feedback and less on the advertising that they have been up to of late.')
