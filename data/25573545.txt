At OrgPad.com (a tool for basically doing first _useful_ mindmaps which you can actually work&#x2F; learn with) we have a few tens of thousands of lines of code in ClojureScript (front end) and Clojure (back end) and pretty much all performance problems I can think of were naive algorithms or bad usage of components (which, usually, a better wrapper solves quite well). You can watch a bit about how we use Clojure in this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4UoIfeb31UU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4UoIfeb31UU</a><p>Otherwise, we use IntelliJ Idea + Cursive but I keep an eye on emacs and vim Clojure&#x2F; ClojureScript capabilities.')
