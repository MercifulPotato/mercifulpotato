I spent energy where I think others will actually benefit.<p>&gt; Among the people I know closely enough, I see almost no one who has changed their minds ever since these discussions started circa 2015.<p>You&#x27;ve pointed this out yourself, why in the world would I keep beating the dead horse here? Do you think people haven&#x27;t tried different ways? Why should I expend that effort to people who are clearly dug in to the other side permanently? I look for good-will first to engage with people who appear to be open in some way, like in this thread: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25234798" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25234798</a><p>The thing you&#x27;re missing here is that the purpose of this type of response is not for you or OP.
