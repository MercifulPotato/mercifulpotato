Item(by='throwahtbfest', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601703993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669043, text='I created an issue on one of my repos. It&#x27;s a really simple set of scripts that manipulate some muni data. I asked for an update from stale data sources&#x2F;scripts to more recent stuff. Exactly the sort of thing that&#x27;s great for a first-time contributor -- zero dependencies, small code base, well-scoped issue. I could do it myself in ~10 minutes of work, but figured it&#x27;d be a nice chance for someone else to get a first experience working with GH and maybe get a free shirt.<p>I got one PR that did exactly what I asked. Great, merged! Good experience all around -- exactly what I expected!<p>Then I marked a PR &quot;invalid&quot; because they made changes to a README that weren&#x27;t helpful (in fact, actively misleading!). Clearly low-effort PR spam. BTW, the same low-effort PR spam I&#x27;m also getting on a bunch of other repos where I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> solicit help.<p>And now, because I marked unsolicited incorrect changes to a README file as &quot;invalid&quot;, I&#x27;m getting new pull requests calling me an asshole.<p>So... that&#x27;s my experience with Hacktoberfest. I guess it&#x27;s my fault for assuming the outcome would be anything else in the month after the Eternal September. Especially with free t-shirts on the line.')
