Item(by='plugger', descendants=None, kids=[25868640], score=None, time=1611288540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25867995, text='&gt; So the percentage of &#x27;terrorist&#x27; attacks that occurred have shifted towards right wing extremist groups... of course that either requires that we don&#x27;t classify certain destructive behaviors by certain groups of people as terrorism (because they aren&#x27;t convenient), or we are misclassifying right wing behaviors as terrorism (because it is convenient).<p>Or maybe you&#x27;re conflating terrorism and protest?  I expect statistically there&#x27;s been an increase in right wing extremist attacks in the past year so the shift is most likely real. Case in point, Nashville. I can&#x27;t think of any other group that&#x27;s executed an domestic attack as destructive as that one was since 9&#x2F;11. And I don&#x27;t think it wrong to classify that as right wing terrorism.')
