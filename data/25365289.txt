Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607549094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363366, text='The problem with these recent FAANG antitrust cases is that action is pretty narrow.<p>Google lost its Adwords case in the EU: using data gathered via the adwords advertising monopoly to support its search monopoly. $1.5bn fine. Google will happily pay this for <i>anything</i> that meaningfully strengthens their position in this market.<p>Besides the fine, all they have to do is stop doing the specific, narrow &quot;monopolistic behaviour&quot; that prosecutors were able to prove. This just isn&#x27;t how monopoly works, and modifying some specific behaviour doesn&#x27;t affect much.<p>Whack-a-mole is almost pointless. Antitrust is about structure, inherently. If antitrust action doesn&#x27;t lead to structural changes, I don&#x27;t see any point in it.<p>Similar cases will likely be prosecuted against Amazon (and google) in multiple jurisdictions with the adwords case serving as a (very narrow) template for prosecuting data&#x2F;marketplace monopolism. Hence amazon. We can probably expect a similar result. A cost-of-doing-business fine and some updated policies about sharing data between the marketplace and retail arms.<p>If prosecutors prove both a monopoly position and monopolistic abuses (it did, and will), this needs to be deemed proof of a broad problem. Other monopolistic abuses need to be assumed. The fix needs to address the problems, known and unknown broadly. For example, by separating the marketplace and participant (adwords &amp; search; amazon marketplace &amp; retail) into seperate businesses.<p>In this FB case, it&#x27;s about buying all the competition: whatsapp, instagram, etc. A fine or a policy update don&#x27;t fix this. Force a sale of these companies. Ban FB from acquiring companies entirely, or social media companies at least.<p>Ultimately, the regulator has already failed here. Those acquisitions should not have been allowed in the first place.<p>Antitrust isn&#x27;t about punishing bad behaviour. It&#x27;s about dealing with bad structures.<p>That said, it does feel like antitrust cops are working up to it, gradually.')
