The flipping happens on the Z-axis.<p>Your reflection is a translation of yourself across the Z-axis into the mirror then a flip along the depth axis so that your reflection faces you.<p>When you look at your face, both your left eye and your reflected left eye are still to your left relative to you.<p>Same with your right eye.<p>Your chin is the same. Your chin is below your actual nose and your reflected chin is still below your actual nose. All positions are PRESERVED along the xy plane.<p>What flipped is the Z axis. Imagine you wearing face as a mask then flipping it inside out along the z-axis so that the face mask is now looking at you. That is the flipping that is going on... all other positional coordinates are preserved.<p>People who say there is no &quot;flipping&quot; going on are completely wrong. There is a flip: on the z-axis.')
