Item(by='Buttons840', descendants=None, kids=[25154111], score=None, time=1605816206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25152975, text='&gt; The rural-urban divide comes down to the understanding that death is the price for life, which has vanished in the urban millieu, but it&#x27;s still visceral to those living closer to nature and its ubiquitous birth-life-death cycle.<p>This is a thought provoking viewpoint that could be explored better.<p>Beyond that though, the point of the first paragraph seems to be that &quot;everybody is going to get it... those that will die will die&quot;. I disagree.<p>You anticipate one of the most concrete rebuttals to the first paragraph, vaccines, and then proceed to argue that vaccines are bad because they disrupt natural selection. This is an absurd argument. Are you opposed to children&#x27;s hospitals because they disrupt natural selection? Your rebuttal is not relevant. What you have argued is a small and theoretical downside to vaccines, but it is not a rebuttal. Vaccines have completely eliminated multiple diseases. They will help with Covid and save lives, and the fact that they have a small downside by disrupting natural selection does not change the fact that they will help and save lives.<p>You only address vaccines while ignoring other counterpoints: I live in an area where our hospitals are at capacity. There are dozens (dozens!) of ICU bed available for millions of people. Only a couple dozen ICU beds for the entire state, and these beds need to serve not only the worst Covid cases but all other patients who have had heart attacks or any other health issues. I strongly disagree that &quot;those that will die will die&quot;, but instead say that &quot;those that don&#x27;t have to die will die&quot; if we don&#x27;t wear masks and follow community guidelines.<p>You then close by asking for more charity. After having said &quot;everybody is going to get it... those that will die will die... life goes on&quot; you ask for others to have more charity...')
