Don&#x27;t be a deer caught in the spotlight, forge your own path and take these things seriously your life may depend on it (even if its 1% chance that that alarm is a real one).<p>Problem with things like fire alarms is they go off _so_ often, yet are almost never a true alarm.<p>In my experience, it&#x27;s not even 1%. I&#x27;ve heard fire alarms tested monthly or quarterly for years. My own smoke detector at home used to go off regularly. I&#x27;ve heard literally hundred of &quot;THE BUILDING IS ON FIRE EVACUATE OH SHIT&quot; alarms, and never once seen even a small fire.<p>Well, that&#x27;s a lie, I lit a reasonably-sized oil fire on my stove top one day (left some good scorch marks on the ceiling and stuff). No alarm went off.<p>Hell, one time the small apartment building I lived in had the building-wide alarm go off which did convince everyone to vacate--probably because it had never gone off before. I ran a roll-call out on the front lawn and accounted for every unit and had every single person reporting that there was no fire in their unit. The only common areas were the hallways people&#x27;d just exited through. The fire department cleared it in about two minutes and told us we could re-enter with the alarms blaring.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised to find someone that, through school fire drills, random smoke detectors, testing and malfunctioning of building alarms, etc have not been totally desensitized to these alerts.<p>If you get an alert every day from your intrusion detection system saying &quot;SOMEONE&#x27;S IN YOUR NETWORK STEALING YOUR FILES!&quot; and never once find that to be the case, eventually you&#x27;re going to start ignoring the alerts.<p>That said, yes -- if I smell smoke&#x2F;see fire, if I&#x27;m on a boat and water is coming up around my ankles, I&#x27;m not gonna just sit there and die because someone says it&#x27;s okay.')
