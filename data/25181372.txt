This article had one point that probably assists in the poor contrast choices that are so common. As I type in black on white in this text box I have trouble understanding why design professionals would call &quot;black&quot; on white unnatural. It is not. Unnatural isn&#x27;t even an appropriate word to use for images and text displayed on a screen unless you are describing the entire experience. Do yourself ( and us) a favor and throw that whole idea out the window and start at #333 to pure black on white as your minimum contrast unless something particularly important in the overall aesthetic changes that priority.<p>In at least 100 examples where one of the audit fixes was &quot;change font to #000&quot; was the follow up feedback by a client or user tester saying that the gray was better or that &quot;its unnatural&quot; or &quot;way too legible&quot; nor a single case of analytics showing less dwell or read time ( or conversions) from users.<p>Complete design myth and it should die')
