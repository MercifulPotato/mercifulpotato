Did he show that in the THEORY of general relativity, singularity has to exist given our observation of the universe? Or there are something more to it.<p>Would it be possible or plausible that singularity actually does not exist, but just that the theory of general relativity is not a correct description of space&#x2F;time&#x2F;matter in small scale? I am thinking in classical theory, when things were treated as point mass&#x2F;charges, infinity exist in the solution of point sources.')
