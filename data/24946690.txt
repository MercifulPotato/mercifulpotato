I look forward to 2026 or so when I expect things like PCIe over Thunderbolt to start becoming more semi-standard, integrated on to more and more SoC. Already, a TB4 port can do 80Gbps of DisplayPort connectivity. With that kind of oomph, it makes sense to also start considering how we might also use those same transcievers &amp; cables to do more data-oriented tasks.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24945361" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24945361</a>')
