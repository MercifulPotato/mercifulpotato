I wish there was a RPi with 16GB or 32GB of storage soldered to the board.  Where I work we&#x27;re using Raspberry Pi devices for industrial use and corruption of&#x2F;wearing out the microSD card has been something we&#x27;ve wondered about.  We could just buy premium microSD cards but having a &quot;proper&quot; SSD soldered to the board would be very helpful as well.')
