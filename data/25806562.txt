The existing theory explained some things, but not others. The superseding theory explained the previous observations, and made new falsifiable predictions that could not be refuted at the time.<p>The conflicting claims about fats and carbs is an example of that excuse not holding water. We&#x27;re talking about a new claim, that is completely incompatible with the prior one. We&#x27;re taking the old claims that were supposedly evidence-supported, and tossing them in the dumpster. At the very least, this means that overly strong conclusions were drawn from previous experiments.<p>I think it&#x27;s a mistake to dismiss such situations as the general public being confused about how science works. Undoubtedly many are, but the reason for that is certainly in large part due to the abuse of &quot;scientific&quot; claims about their everyday life.')
