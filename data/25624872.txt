It’s simply easier to get proportions that we are most used to (IE average proportions of facial features across everyone we’ve met) when you go abstract, and when a lot of proportions look slightly off, it’s uncanny. And I bet it is close to the disgust reaction caused by a fear of disease as he states. I know he’s arguing uncanny valley isn’t a thing but my take away is that it’s more complex than how it’s usually stated')
