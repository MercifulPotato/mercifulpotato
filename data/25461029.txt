Seller reviews are for the seller, not the product. Not rocket science.<p>The post title seems needlessly inflammatory and definitive. The content of the blog really is a whinge about an isolated incident, not any real assertions convincing me that Amazon is silencing anything on purpose in the reviews section.<p>No doubt Amazon has much to answer for, but not this. When half the reviews are something like &quot;I don&#x27;t know what this is&quot; because of Amazon&#x27;s confusing email language, it seems to me that properly enforcing the use of a review section would be ideal, no?')
