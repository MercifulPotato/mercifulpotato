Disks are getting large, and the rebuild time for RAID-Z[1] is dependent on the fragmentation. In combination it means it can take ages.<p>I just had to replace a failing WD Red 3TB[2] in an old 4xRAID-Z1 pool, and it took 9 hours. That was a single 3TB disk. The disks in my new pool are 14TB and 16TB.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Efl0Kv_hXwY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Efl0Kv_hXwY</a><p>[2]: power-on hours in SMART showed over 7 years')
