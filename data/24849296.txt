Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603297246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849042, text='Original title: <i>Jeff Bezos Uses the Disagree and Commit Rule to Overcome an Uncomfortable Truth About Teamwork.</i><p>The rule (which I tend to apply myself, though I didn&#x27;t have a name for it) works pretty well for me <i>as long as I have had a chance to express my objections, and feel they were understood</i>. That caveat is critically important to me. It&#x27;s okay if my concerns are dismissed, it&#x27;s okay if I don&#x27;t agree with the reason they were dismissed, but there has to <i>be</i> a reason (even if it&#x27;s just &quot;my gut tells me you&#x27;re wrong&quot; or &quot;we don&#x27;t have time to discuss this&quot;).<p>Some people have accused me in the past of just wanting to be able to say &quot;I told you so&quot;, and I must admit that there is some element of truth in that (it&#x27;s not a good look, but I&#x27;ll own that I am a flawed human trying to become a better one), but mostly it&#x27;s so if a bad decision is made, we have some data on <i>why</i> we made a bad decision (eg. &quot;we consistently underestimate the work involved in building an in-house solution&quot;, or &quot;most of our decisions made under time pressure are wrong&quot;). And anyway, often being <i>able</i> to say &quot;I told you so&quot; is more than enough, I don&#x27;t actually need to say it.<p>Anyway. If my objections are heard, I can and do happily &quot;Disagree and Commit&quot; all day long, because <i>I</i> might be wrong. That&#x27;s how I&#x27;m wired.')
