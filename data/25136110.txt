Is it the tech youtubers&#x2F;influencers like Linus to blame for this madness where everything needs to be run at 4k 300Hz ULTRA settings to count as PC gaming?<p>PC gaming hardware for a good experience is more affordable than people think.<p>A 850-900 Euro PC (for us over the channel) with an RTX 2060 will definitely play all AAA titles very smoothly. Sure, not in native 4K, but consoles games(even next gen) are also not native 4K&#x2F;ultra settings but rendered in lower fidelity then upscaled to whatever your TV output is.<p><i>&gt;never mind releases in 7 years.</i><p>That PC will most definitely play games 7 years from now but on lower settings which will still match the visual fidelity of the 7 year old console as the game developers will have to lower game details to make the game playable on the then outdated console hardware.')
