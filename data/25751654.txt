I don&#x27;t think mailing lists do this. If someone comes by in 20 years to your &quot;birdwatching&quot; mailing list, for example, all they can do is sign up or ask for someone to copy them messages.<p>Do you mean an online web system for sharing emails? If so, it&#x27;s not really a mailing list. It&#x27;s just an ad-hoc webserver system with poor standards for finding or doing anything. These systems are a joke imo, but to their credit, few web folks have come along to help them turn their loose jumbles of text into anything well structured &amp; responsible. Even still, almost every one of these mailing lists would be well served by having an RSS feed of the activity, which is fairly direct to do.<p>Not sure what you are talking about, would like some clarity, but feels like a non-answer to me.')
