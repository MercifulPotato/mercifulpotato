And they are happening to address the legitimate grievances of the farmers.<p>Farming in India is done by millions of small farmers. That is why the broker system thrives (along with highly regulated market places) as it is easier to deal with brokers than with so many millions of farmers to procure in large-scale. Ofcourse, like in any economic system some people do find ways to abuse the system, but the regulated marketplace do ensure that farmers can get by (not thrive, but barely survive - the current system does need reforms and the farmers have been demanding changes for a long time too).<p>The new farm laws dismantle this regulated marketplaces, in the guise of &quot;fixing&quot; the broker system, but cleverly replaces them with corporates instead (by advocating and strengthening laws for contract farming in the favour corporate).<p>This makes the whole thing even more worse for the farmers, as their bargaining powers are further reduced. Many indian farmers are poor and uneducated but the government thinks it&#x27;s completely ok to let them get into contract farming with corporates without any safety net or support.<p>This is why the farmers are demanding the repeal of the farm laws.<p>The government is hamstrung and chooses to be arrogant out of fear of appearing to be &quot;weak&quot; against the opposition, and so doesn&#x27;t even engage with them. Matters have reached this level because the farm laws were undemocratically pushed through using the government&#x27;s brute majority, without any proper discussions in public or parliamentary committee or even in Parliament.<p>In both the US and Europe, contract farming has seen the consolidation of farms under few corporates. Many political parties understandably do not want that to happen in \nindia too.<p>- 1% of farms operate 70% of world&#x27;s farmland: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2020&#x2F;nov&#x2F;24&#x2F;farmland-inequality-is-rising-around-the-world-finds-report" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2020&#x2F;nov&#x2F;24&#x2F;farmland...</a><p>- Contract farming as a means of ushering in corporatisation in agriculture: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frontline.thehindu.com&#x2F;the-nation&#x2F;fast-forward-to-corporatisation&#x2F;article32880281.ece" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frontline.thehindu.com&#x2F;the-nation&#x2F;fast-forward-to-co...</a>')
