Item(by='studius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611058118, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821810, text='&gt; itâ€™s not about me, but about ways to improve the code<p>This is true for me, but I also would admit that it&#x27;s not all altruistic.<p>Specifically, I will report problems that may be rare for others and unlikely to be reproducible by the maintainer. I often provide information about the operating system, version, etc. in those cases to put a reasonable amount of effort into it, but I don&#x27;t always expect it to be fixed by the maintainer.<p>However, if I determine later that the bug was caused by something else, I&#x27;ll go find the bug I created and add a comment indicating that it was fixed or related to another problem, if it&#x27;s simple.')
