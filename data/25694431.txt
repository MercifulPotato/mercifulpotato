I support the cause, not the way they&#x27;re sending the message.<p>Study Gandhi, MLK, John Lewis, Mandela - I understand BLM is a decentralized movement, but that&#x27;s the problem. There is no leader and leadership. It has no coherency. It&#x27;s dividing the society even more instead of pulling the entire populace behind it.<p>Social movement has a singular goal - to change the minds of people that oppose their views. BLM has managed to just bring out people who were already supporting them, it hasn&#x27;t quite changed the hearts of people that were previously racists.<p>This is not how you make progress in the society. It is &quot;pull&quot;, not &quot;push&quot;.')
