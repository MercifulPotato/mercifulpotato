But more importantly, the reality is that nuclear isn&#x27;t competing against renewables it&#x27;s competing against a fossil fuel grid that&#x27;s supplemented by renewables. Germany, the poster child for renewables, still emits 10x the carbon dioxide per watt of electricity as France.<p>Let me put it more bluntly. Renewables are indeed cheaper on a per-watt hour basis. But that&#x27;s more than offset by the need to deal with intermittency. Batteries are great for cars, but they exist at nowhere near the scale required to decarbonize with a wind and solar generation base. More exotic proposals like thermal storage, hydrogen, or the Sabatier process remain in prototyping and academic stage. The cost of storage is a non-answer, because there&#x27;s no real plan to build this storage.<p>Renewables make in a stopgap mitigation plan but we have no feasible way of building a grid that&#x27;s powered completely or even mostly by renewables. If our plan is to decarbonize the energy sector, renewables do not offer a solution. Hydroelectricity, and geothermal power do, but those are geographically limited. Nuclear energy is the only source that can feasibly replace fossil fuels as a consistent, geographically independence, and carbon-free energy source.<p>TL;DR:<p>* Industrialization happened because we figured out we could heat water and push a piston (and later, spin a turbine). Modern society is built off the ability to produce mechanical and electrical energy from thermal energy.<p>* It&#x27;s a lot easier to heat water and spin a turbine with a carbon-free source of heat, than to try and capture energy from sun and wind and store massive amounts of energy to overcome intermittency.')
