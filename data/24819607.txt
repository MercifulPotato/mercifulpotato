There&#x27;s no web standard that says what a browser must do about autoplay requests, and Chrome permits a large number of sites to autoplay with sound on.<p>Web browsers are also capable of determining that autoplay on technically-not-load-but-automatic counts as autoplay. (There&#x27;s even text in the spec about it.) In particular, they can tell whether it is in response to a user action&#x2F;gesture on the site or not.')
