How thick, roughly, is the atmosphere?  What, roughly, is the composition of the atmosphere?  What is the median temperature of the planet?  List all species capable of metabolizing pollution back into harmless compounds.  What are their lifespans?  How do they reproduce?<p>...hopefully my point is made, now.  I can&#x27;t give details because they don&#x27;t exist.<p>If a species produces sufficient pollution that it kills that species, it is a reasonable assumption that it was also produced at a rate far higher than the planets natural ecosystem could absorb it. It is also reasonable that the pollution also kills one or more species which were consuming or absorbing the pollution, slowing the rate at which it can be removed, or maybe even stopping that process completely. \nPollution does not disappear at the same time pollutants stop being introduced into the atmosphere.<p>There will be a time after which no pollutants are produced and before no pollutants are detectable.  That is a non-zero amount of time.  That is why I say that pollution could one day be detected on a planet that has not had a living civilization for &quot;a long time.&quot; &quot;A long time&quot; being &quot;more than five minutes&quot; if you really want me to nail it down.')
