That act of organization likely implies that the Java API (taken as a whole) constitutes a copyrightable work, even if the individual method signatures are not.<p>As an IP-minimalist, I&#x27;m surprised anyone can look at the mental gymnastics that people go through in order to draw some arbitrary line between acceptable and unacceptable copying, and come to any other conclusion than &quot;this whole system is ludicrous&quot;.')
