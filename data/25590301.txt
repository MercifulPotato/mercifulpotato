A community might stand in to judge the relative merits of mostly at least somewhat meritorious content to help the cream rise to the top but they aren&#x27;t going to want to hang out and be a human spam filter.<p>&gt;…the First Law of Kipple (is that) ‘Kipple drives out nonkipple’… (one) can roll the kipple-factor back… No one can win against kipple, except temporarily and maybe in one spot, like in my apartment I’ve sort of created a stasis between the pressure of kipple and nonkipple, for the time being. But eventually I’ll die or go away, and then the kipple will take over. It’s a universal principal operating throughout the universe; the entire universe is moving towards a final state of total, absolute kippleization.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zinzin.com&#x2F;observations&#x2F;2012&#x2F;kipple-drives-out-nonkipple&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zinzin.com&#x2F;observations&#x2F;2012&#x2F;kipple-drives-out-n...</a><p>Automation is a logical way to deal with things that lack merit which would otherwise destroy the utility of the community without an unrealistic amount of unfun labor which neither unpaid moderators nor users are willing to provide to maintain a subreddit.<p>There are 330M reddit users and for most modest communities most others are on average are undesirables whose communities stand to muddy up yours and ruin it for the people that enjoy it because the average net value of a human being is debatable.<p>You are asking for people to do more manual labor they are unwilling to do in order to make it easy for you to contribute while ignoring the fact that the average redditor would be a net negative if they joined an average decent community. In fact let me go further. The value of the very person who wont read the conventions of a subreddit before posting is probably on average much worse than average.<p>This isn&#x27;t a value judgment on you. Averages don&#x27;t speak to individuals but what you are asking is illogical on net.')
