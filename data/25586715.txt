I think it&#x27;s fair to say that most customers then were unaware of the alternatives and the decision was made by the manufacturers of those home computers.<p>BASIC might very well have been the best choice for those casually interested in computers.  Educators would have preferred others though (Pascal, Scheme and COMAL come to mind).  FORTH would have scared away most customers, but amazed and inspired others (I sadly discovered it only after its prime).<p>Turbo Pascal didn&#x27;t require (much) more memory than elaborate BASIC implementations and ran at reasonable speed even on a Z80.  Not quite the same interactivity of an interpreter perhaps, but not much behind.  It came late to the scene though.')
