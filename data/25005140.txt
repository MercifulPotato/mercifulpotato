If Alice has IPv6 and Bob has IPv4, Alice can send Bob a packet to either 1.2.3.4 or ::01:02:03:04, but if Alice&#x27;s IPv6 number isn&#x27;t in the IPv4 range (ex: ::10:11:12:13:14), then her IPv6 number won&#x27;t have a corresponding IPv4 number that she can put in the IPv4 IP header (because the IPv4 header only allocates enough bytes to exactly fit 1 IPv4 header in the from field and 1 IPv4 header in the to field).<p>This means she&#x27;ll have to either send an IPv6 header or an IPv4 header with a false or blank IPv4 from address. If she sends an IPv6 packet, Bob&#x27;s IPv4 network stack won&#x27;t be able to understand it and drop the packet. If she sends an IPv4 packet with a blank or false IPv4 from address, Bob will receive the packet, but won&#x27;t be able to send a response.')
