The problem of mapping a business domain to computing structures isn&#x27;t unique to OOP.<p>In this case, I&#x27;m slightly gobsmacked that no-one pointed out that <i>an employee is not their job</i>.  The contract of employment is a <i>separate domain concept</i>.  So is the invocation of the clauses of that contract.  Termination involves invoking a particular contract clause.<p>The job is to model a) the contract, b) the invocation of a specific clause, c) the record of that invocation (including its authorisations and so forth), and d) the consequential processing in other systems.<p>Whether you&#x27;re working in FP, or Kay-style OOP, or Java-style OOP or, heck, SQL stored procedures, these are separate concerns, separate concepts, separate units of code, separate records, hopefully loosely coupled by whatever idiomatic form is at hand.')
