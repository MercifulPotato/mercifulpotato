I’ve been reading a lot of comments here and it seems like most of them aren’t even critical or touch on the point of NOT allowing certain kind of speech or false information sharing. In Germany nazi related sympathizing, propaganda is banned from social media. But some how it’s ok in USA? I honestly fail to understand how little criticism there is of unfettered free speech, as if it’s universally a good thing. Same with guns, given overwhelming evidence to the contrary yet still USA sticks to these strange “rights”.')
