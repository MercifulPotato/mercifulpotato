Item(by='satysin', descendants=None, kids=[25454685], score=None, time=1608141628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440915, text='I am still on macOS but I totally agree with your post. macOS and iOS are seriously locked down and it can be very frustrating.<p>Like you I used Magnet but wanting to get something more tiling window manager-like I switched to Amethyst[1] which while not as powerful is pretty good for what it is.<p>Sadly macOS has frustratingly laggy window resizing for a lot of things. Finder and Safari are usually fine but pretty much everything else feels laggy to resize and generally macOS just has absolutely terrible window manager so a tiling window manager is a god send.<p>I mostly use macOS because I have been doing iOS and macOS development and so what else you gonna use but I have to admit I want to move away from the platform. It is all &#x27;very exciting&#x27; right now with all the Apple Silicon hype and yeah it genuinely is impressive but for me I kinda want to get back to something more open even if it doesn&#x27;t have a lovely highly efficient and performant custom SoC driving it.<p>I am like 90% there in convincing myself to build a nice AMD desktop next year and moving away from macOS as my main OS. Luckily I am not dependent on any Apple services so switching shouldn&#x27;t be that bad.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ianyh&#x2F;Amethyst" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ianyh&#x2F;Amethyst</a>')
