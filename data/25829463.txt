Why were there so few police present? (so far I&#x27;ve read that Congress didn&#x27;t want the optics of armed guards). Why weren&#x27;t more barricades up? There are a dozen plus failures here, throughout many offices.<p>Conspiracy theorists would say it was less security to allow for chaos, which in turn gives further justification to pushing legislation &#x2F; controls that take away freedoms.<p>All of us will say that it&#x27;s horrible and just like the rioters, looters, murderers and general agents of chaos of the past year, they made a deliberate and reasoned choice to be a part of the chaos.<p>What I don&#x27;t like is that statement that all protestors were part of the incident. Just as all of the BLM protesters weren&#x27;t a part of the riots, evidence shows the same is true for those that rallied.<p>The bottom line is based on votes, the U.S. is clearly split on perspectives and each side sees things in a near opposite viewpoint.')
