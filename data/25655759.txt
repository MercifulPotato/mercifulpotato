Probably will not happen in my life time but the US should simply implement a health care system the well developed EU nations.\nCancer and sickness are realities of life but paying 10s of thousands for hospital bills is simply out of scope for the vast majority of people.

Medical aid should not be granted put of pity or mercy in this age. We have covid and that is affecting all, suddenly vaccines and rollouts are approved in record times.

The loud mouths who used to shout &quot;not my problem&quot; are much less noisy these days(bar the ones with questionable mental stability who think the virus is fake etc).
