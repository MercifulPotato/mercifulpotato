I&#x27;d say that APLs are harder to get started with, but easier to use right. With things such as Numpy, you need to know lots of things about the API that might change without warning. With APL, you learn the primitives and you&#x27;re off to the races. The downside is that less popularity means far fewer library efforts.')
