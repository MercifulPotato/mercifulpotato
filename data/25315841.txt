I used PHP 4 and it was okey, albeit pretty inconsistent. However, programming languages are a very competitive space. It is extremely expensive to keep them and their ecosystem alive. My sense is that, unless a language keeps up, it will go down. Not in the sense that it will disappear overnight, just less favoured every time a Greenfield project starts.<p>My subjective analysis is that each language has a niche that if fills nicely:\n- C - no BS, no runtime, close to hardware.\n- C++ - a bit further from the hardware, a bit closer to the developer.\n- Python - glue the two above with few lines of code. Go-to language for &quot;data pipelines&quot;.\n- NodeJS - one code, can run both in the browser and on the server. Go-to language for web development.\n- Java - one syntax, runs both on Android and on servers.<p>- C# and Go - vendor-evangelised languages. Supported by huge vendors and their network of partners.\n- COBOL - too big to fail :))<p>I honestly don&#x27;t get what niche PHP fills. Why would anyone <i>choose</i> PHP over another language? Developer pool? Ecosystem of libraries? Evangelized by a vendor? Front-runner in new concepts? Too big to fail?')
