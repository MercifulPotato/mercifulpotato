Item(by='skye-adaire', descendants=None, kids=[25954155, 25954801], score=None, time=1611891051, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952638, text='&gt;Why are SDFs useful at all?<p>Meshes and bezier patches are boundary representations with no information of the volume they enclose. Imagine you&#x27;d like to cut an object out of smoke or clouds. SDFs enable you to cut out arbitrary volumes from any material. This is more realistic than skinning a mesh object with textures, especially with translucent objects.<p>&gt; So why do we need neural nets to represent them?<p>You don&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t notice render times, but &quot;interactive frame rates&quot; would be lacking.<p>Most SDF primitives and their compositions are not analytic (from use of abs, fract, etc). Differentiation by finite differences is most common. Few are using automatic differentiation. I don&#x27;t quite follow how back prop would produce the surface gradient, but I doubt it would be faster than these methods.')
