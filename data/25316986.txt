My LG has replaced almost every other thing that used to be in my media room. It is my streaming music box (I can target it for casting from my favorite iOS app, and I can use the interface on it for browsing my home network storage if I want). It has Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, Hulu, Disney, Vudu, Google TV, and every other damn thing on it. It has voice search, so I just say the name of the show I want to watch and it finds and displays which apps have that in their catalog. It also has a web browser so I can just watch anything I want. I can start a video on YouTube on my phone and later transfer it to the TV (I can do this from either device). I can cast any tab from Chrome to my TV.<p>I say these TVs are just the right amount of smart. Maybe there are worse ones (I imagine, having once owned a Sony Playstation, that the software on a Sony TV is atrocious) but LG WebOS is brilliant.')
