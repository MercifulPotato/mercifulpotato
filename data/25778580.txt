I think it shows the stagnation of the laptop market (and DDR4) that LPDDR4 is really catching up (and then some). Or maybe... because cell phones are more widespread these days, cell phones just naturally get the better tech?<p>On the other hand, M1 is pretty wide. Apple clearly is tackling the memory bottleneck very strongly in its design.<p>DDR5 is going to be the next major step forward for desktops&#x2F;laptops.<p>&gt; 2. But in this case I believe they are talking about the CPU and GPU both being able to freely access the same ram, as compared to a setup where you have a discrete GPU with it&#x27;s own ram, where data must first be copied to the GPU ram for the GPU to do something with it. In some workloads this can be an inferior approach, in others it can be superior, as the GPU&#x27;s ram is faster. The M1 model again isn&#x27;t unique, as its similar to how game consoles work, I believe.<p>More than just the &quot;same RAM&quot;, but probably even shares the same last-level cache. Both AMD&#x27;s chips and Intel&#x27;s iGPUs share the cache with its CPU&#x2F;GPU hybrid architectures.<p>However: it seems like on-core SIMD units (aka: AVX or ARM NEON &#x2F; SVE) are even lower latency, since those share L1 cache.<p>Any situation where you need low latency but SIMD, it makes more sense to use AVX &#x2F; SVE than even waiting for L3 cache to talk to the iGPU. Any situation where you need massive parallelism, a dedicated 3090 is more useful.<p>Its going to be tough to figure out a good use of iGPUs: they&#x27;re being squeezed on the latency front (by things like A64Fx: 512-bit ARM SIMD, as well as AVX512 on the Intel side), and also squeezed by the bandwidth front (by classic GPUs)')
