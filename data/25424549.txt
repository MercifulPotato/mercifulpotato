I was appalled by the simplistic portrayal that the entire older generation had of my habits, because although they were unhealthy, they were a far cry from addiction. There are several very different categories of long-playtime games popular today and they are associated with very different motivation structures. To the layman league of legends is in the same category as skyrim, but one is a single player campaign that you&#x27;ll eventually grow tired of, even if it takes a thousand hours, and the other is an eternal online competition in which you will be just as likely to hit &#x27;play again&#x27; after your 500th hour as your 20,000th. There are 3 categories of game that can rack up truly problematic playtimes in the tens of thousands of hours and extract great opportunity costs on the players:<p>1) Grindfests - e.g. Old school runescape, black desert online, korean mmos, classic wow, destiny 2, warframe. Motivation is collection of perfect sets of equipment and special items that prove account status.<p>2) Social Simulators - World of Warcraft (shadowlands), most mmos,Eve Online, roblox, vrchat. Motivation is that &quot;people are doing something and I want to be a part of it.&quot;<p>3) Competitive Loops - Pubg, Apex legends, fortnite, overwatch, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Starcraft 2 ladder, most shooters and arena games. Motivation is competitive instinct, satisfaction if you win&#x2F;get kills, frustration if you don&#x27;t and resolve to play another and turn it around.<p>(Disclaimer: there&#x27;s a lot of overlap between groups, most mmos are both social simulators and grindfests, many arena competitive loops are social games sometimes. I tried to categorize by primary motivator.)<p>Grindfests and competitive loops are fundamentally wastes of time, but they will always give you what you&#x27;re looking for. Bored on a Wednesday night? Might as queue up mid or farm zulrah. There is obvious gender disparity between each category and the general population, and disparity between categories as well- women play social simulators, but competitive loops are usually over 90% men. Often closer to 99%. Social Simulators are only <i></i>usually<i></i> wastes of time, because the expectation of anonymity on the internet means you&#x27;ll usually never leverage those social networks you&#x27;re building for real value. In the case of people still building social skills, or isolated and looking for camraderie, these games do add value.<p>This is all to say that problematic video games are successful because they scratch behavioral itches many people want scratched. In that way, I&#x27;m almost uncomfortable calling them problematic. Sure, a 22y&#x2F;o would ideally be spending his evenings on side projects. What fraction of his spare time is that a realistic expectation if he could  be doing virtual competitions with friends or strangers? I wouldn&#x27;t begrudge a retiree to play a competitive loops 6 hours a day, I look forward to doing that myself in the old folks home, but I&#x27;m much more comfortable condemning someone in the prime of their life because of higher opp. cost. Bear in mind that HN is not a representative sample, and the majority of humans waste all their free time anyway, if &#x27;waste&#x27; means &#x27;suboptimal use carrying nonzero opportunity cost&#x27;. Is this different from any other generation&#x27;s opiate of the masses? My friends don&#x27;t watch football but they do talk about doublelift retiring.')
