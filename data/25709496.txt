Item(by='DaiPlusPlus', descendants=None, kids=[25710670], score=None, time=1610250413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708706, text='&gt; Parler is like a video game with all the cheat codes on; it will entertain them at first, but they&#x27;ll get bored quickly.<p>When I was much younger - like, 8-9-10yo, PC games were hard for me: younger age, smaller-mind. I’d use my limited time on my 28.8 dialup to get cheat codes and burn hours of my life <i>having fun</i> in the single-player skirmish&#x2F;instant-action-mode (as opposed to campaign&#x2F;story mode - this was before always-on internet and built-in matchmaking, ofc) - and I never got bored of it. I didn’t get tired of winning. Not that “winning” was the objective, but just blowing stuff up in Streets-of-SimCity or spamming the easter-egg nuke-troopers in Age of Empires was enough to entertain me.<p>I didn’t stop cheating at single-player PC games until after I was old enough to understand how to actually play the game and started to appreciate the challenge and enjoy the satisfaction of overcoming that challenge.<p>As a comparison - I see similarities with the types of people on Parler: there’s no appreciation of &#x2F;the system&#x2F; - just a desire to be-on-top, stay-on-top, and have fun blowing shit up. They either don’t enjoy “the game” or they’re unable to play it, so they’ve invented their own game. Hence, the “like playing chess with a pigeon” idiom: shitting on the chessboard is more fun for them than playing by the rules.')
