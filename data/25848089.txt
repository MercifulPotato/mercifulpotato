Item(by='wutbrodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611158905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25845787, text='&gt; If you arenâ€™t wallowing in a post-truth groupthink bubble, the world of today is really uncomfortable and lonely sometimes.<p>I dunno... For the most part, my close friends are too intelligent to have this tendency (likely not a coincidence, but implicit assortative matching), but I have a couple close friends and many less-close friends who aren&#x27;t. It seems to bring them a lot of emotional pain and frustration.<p>If your worldview is effectively religious, the heretics who blaspheme against the One True Flawless Way by disagreeing with you are reduced to actively-evil monsters. If you happen to live in a modern, pluralistic society instead of Reconquista Spain, this is a recipe for constant frothing fury at the tens of millions of people who don&#x27;t share any given viewpoint you may hold. To my eyes, this is wayyy more uncomfortable than always being the person disagreeing,even if minorly, with the groupthink session.<p>Regarding loneliness, the part of my brain that enjoys the seduction of blind, rabid group membership seems to be missing (eg I&#x27;ve never been a pro sports fan either, despite being a fairly avid sportsman in the past). I can understand how this would be lonely for many, but... I dunno, being a bad person is fun, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s much of an excuse for doing it.')
