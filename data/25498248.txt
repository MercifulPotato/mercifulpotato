That&#x27;s authoritarian control - governments have no business in regulating the speech of private entities. By giving government power to &quot;prevent censorship&quot; you also give them power to create and enforce censorship. That&#x27;s how powers work. If you have the power to tell private companies they can&#x27;t remove content they pay for, then you also have the power to tell them to remove content. Don&#x27;t advocate for authoritarian governments.')
