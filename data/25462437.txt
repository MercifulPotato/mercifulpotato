Other photography stores are probably as good.<p>Professional photographers buy from them, even if there&#x27;s a premium, because they trust B&amp;H. That&#x27;s B&amp;H competitive advantage; trust. If they screw that up they&#x27;ll wither away.<p>I used to buy on Newegg, but when I bought my most recent computer build I realized most of it was from third party resellers. They screwed the order up, and it was a mess to get my return. Newegg used to be so good!<p>My wife recently bought something from Macy&#x27;s, again, 3rd party without realizing it. They screwed up royally. They sold her something they don&#x27;t have in stock, but sent her a &quot;Package Delivered&quot; message. Days later the item is still for sale, even though the person on the phone said that the item will not be available until Jan.<p>Well my wife has already bought a replacement and she wants her money back. The Macy&#x27;s  rep said that it&#x27;s not Macy&#x27;s problem since she purchased from a third party. My wife snapped back that she bought an item from Macy&#x27;s on the Macy&#x27;s website.<p>Man I hate modern shopping.')
