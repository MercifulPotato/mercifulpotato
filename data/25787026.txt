The author(s) set up an experiment without a hypothesis, threw in 100 candidate variables such as &#x27;were they exposed to blue light&#x27;, &#x27;was the roof on fire&#x27;, etc etc.  They calculated P-values on all 100 and with a threshold of P &lt; 0.05, they predictably rejected the null hypothesis 5 times. Then they conveniently left out 90 or so variables that failed the test.')
