You actually don&#x27;t exist, because there is no space in your culture&#x27;s stories for you.<p>What brings the predominantly white male audience at Cambridge Union to their feet for a standing ovation, beyond Baldwin&#x27;s faultless elocution, is his mastery of white American experience.  He speaks about racism from inside out, considering that what has happened to white Americans who have succumbed to the disease of racism is worse than what has happened to black Americans who suffer it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5Tek9h3a5wQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5Tek9h3a5wQ</a>')
