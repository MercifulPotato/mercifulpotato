Claiming it is because of possible violence seems unbelievable, seeing as it is arms manufacturers and so on still have a voice on these platforms, like Raytheon and what have you, who are killing more people every day through their actions than what this political upheaving has done.<p>To me, it seems that some parties are ready to stomp on freedom of speech as a basic right in order to make sure that this information does not get to spread. Why, I ask ?<p>Why would they be so interested in this fact ? Is it a threat to them ? Why suddenly all platforms are stopping the spreading of this information.<p>I just ask this, to me it seems like they have a lot to lose perhaps in this game personally, the owners of these platforms.<p>Maybe we should just ban everything, I mean, look at Uganda for example what they are doing before the elections: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techjaja.com&#x2F;govt-blocks-google-playstore-apple-appstore-and-youtube&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techjaja.com&#x2F;govt-blocks-google-playstore-apple-apps...</a>. Banning all play store, app store and youtube :D<p>Is this the next step then? Sounds like those who own these platforms are starting to show their true nature.')
