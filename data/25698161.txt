President Trump (and several of his allies) has been stoking this flame for _weeks_ explicitly and to the day. He gave a speech the morning of the attack, explicitly pointing them to the Capitol.<p>He seems to have also, behind the scenes, disuaded the usual defense mechanisms that would have prevented this from being even as effictive as it was. I&#x27;d expect much more information will be coming out about that as this is investigated further. I&#x27;m not seeing how you&#x27;re saying this wasn&#x27;t coordinated though.')
