Actually just one big long two-decade headache, it&#x27;s never gone away and nothing, including painkillers, really helps.<p>Three things that I do to deal with this:<p>- ignore: most of the time it&#x27;s not top of mind; I can feel it always but don&#x27;t think about it always.<p>- keep up some hope: every few years, I go through the usual rounds with my GP and other specialists to see if there&#x27;s anything new that can be tried to mitigate it. This is something of a double-edged sword though, as it is eventually paired with another crushing disappointment.<p>- remember there is a natural end to this: one day I&#x27;ll be dead and it won&#x27;t matter any more, it&#x27;s temporary in the same way that everything is temporary. And if I get fed up with it all and want to leave early, it&#x27;s doable as a last resort. A literal last resort, really.<p>I&#x27;ve also developed chronic lower back pain and tinnitus in the past 5 years and deal with those in the same way.')
