I don&#x27;t know if this is something that&#x27;s peculiar to the author, or genuinely universal among therapists. But it sounds nuts and... kind of creepy? I&#x27;m happy to believe in a culture of professional detachment among therapists and doctors, but to believe that you are a blank slate seems kind of delusional.<p>The therapist has some perceived race, gender, and age. They dress a certain way. They have a certain accent when speaking. Patients may prefer a male or female therapist, or a therapist who shares some other background with them. Patients probably want the confidence that their therapist will not dismiss their concerns and will actually help them make progress.<p>At this point calling the relationship a &quot;blank slate&quot; seems delusional. Sure, maybe the therapist is such a perfect mimic that they&#x27;re not actually female, middle-aged, Black, or have experience working with trans patients. Maybe this is all just a mirage projected by their professionalism. Maybe there is no therapist, and I&#x27;m just sitting on a couch alone, in an empty room.')
