The real customers of FB (aka advertisers) that I&#x27;ve asked all claim to get their money&#x27;s worth from their ad spends and obviously they keep going back to the well rather than switching to somewhere else. Fake users and bots can&#x27;t be spending fake money. So even if the claims about the raw number of users are grossly exaggerated, the performance metrics which actually matter (eg conversions per ad dollar) can&#x27;t be fake. Therefore the company can&#x27;t just be an elaborate scam.')
