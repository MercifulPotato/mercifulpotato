Non-fiat coins trade slightly above the value of their weight for a few reasons, primarily the convenience they offer. And there certainly is a theory that minted coins could be expected to contain a standardised weight and metal mixture.<p>But they couldn&#x27;t really. Just look at that extract -- the Tang dynasty published laws detailing the metal mixture its coins contained. It did not bother to follow or even approximate those laws.<p>Here&#x27;s a description of the bronze currency of Seleucid Persia:<p>&gt; coin weights were not controlled to nearly the same extent as for gold and silver. An analysis of the bronze coinage of Seleukos I from Seleukia-Tigris in Newell shows weights ranging from 2.08-4.55 grams for one-unit pieces, 5.17-9.24 grams for two-unit pieces, and 8.94-16.72 grams for four-unit pieces.<p>&gt; The very wide range of weights, on average more than 25 per cent about a mean, cannot be due to wear. Thus, when a bronze coin circulated, its value was probably known by its <i>approximate</i> size and not by its weight.<p>Here&#x27;s the much more strictly controlled silver:<p>&gt; Under Antiochos IV, a reduction of tetradrachm weight is noted between the first and second Antioch series from mainly in the region of 16.90-17.19 grams to mainly in the region of 16.50-16.79 grams, a reduction of about 2 per cent, which can only have been due to an administrative decision. This came at a time when competing coinages had also experienced weight reductions<p>&gt; There was, of course, not only a question of weight, since, in order to achieve a greater profit, one might also reduce the silver content. Until Antiochos IV, purity of 94-95 per cent silver was still maintained in tetradrachms, but a debasement commenced slowly with Alexander Balas (91 per cent purity) and reached quite low levels of silver by the first century BC (65 per cent purity).<p>Why did the subjects of the Seleucids tolerate this? They weren&#x27;t given a choice, and we have a record of their complaints:<p>&gt; Now one can perhaps understand a passage in the <i>Astronomical Diary</i> of 274 BC. After reference had been made to the collection of &#x27;silver, cloth, goods, and utensils [?]&#x27; by the satrap of Babylon to help the king (Antiochos I) pursue the war against the Ptolemies in northern Syria, the <i>Diary</i> continues: &#x27;That year, purchases in Babylon and the [other] cities were made with copper coins of Ionia.&#x27;<p>&gt; The small-silver coinage had apparently been collected by the authorities to help finance the war [because Greek mercenaries required payment in silver], probably in exchange for bronze, and the inhabitants were now compelled to use the distasteful (to them) bronze coinage, distasteful because it was a purely token currency introduced into an area which had possessed a long tradition of exchange based on the value of precious metal<p>(all quotes from <i>The Seleukid Royal Economy: Finances and Financial Administration of the Seleukid Empire</i>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0521117763&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0521117763&#x2F;</a> )<p>We may also observe that Chinese coins fill the same economic role as Seleucid bronze coins, being used to transact in small amounts. Large-scale commerce in China was done in unminted silver.')
