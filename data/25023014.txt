I&#x27;ve always heard people say Pepsi is sweeter than Coke. Apparently that was one of the main drivers of &quot;New&quot; Coke back in the 80s, to make a sweeter version of Coke to compete with Pepsi, especially the Pepsi Challenge, which rewarded sweetness due to the small sipping size.<p>The person you&#x27;re responding to may have had a similar lifetime experience and that&#x27;s why they commented on it. Likely not nefarious, simply an observation on something unexpected.')
