The burden of proof is on the accuser.<p>No, the burden of proof is on the claimant.<p>&gt; You cited this guy to say that the election was fraudulent.<p>I cited him to say that fraud was <i>possible.</i><p>&gt; I proved he doesn&#x27;t agree.<p>He claims the election wasn&#x27;t stolen, without offering any proof. Thats a claim, with no evidence.<p>&gt; Now you&#x27;re saying he can&#x27;t know that it WASN&#x27;T fraudulent<p>I&#x27;m asking how he would know that it wasn&#x27;t fraudulent. What are his ground for contradicting people who say there was fraud and changed votes? Surely he has reasons for making claims.<p>&gt; Now you&#x27;re saying he can&#x27;t know that it WASN&#x27;T fraudulent... so therefore... it is? Surely you see that this logic doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Thats not what I said. I said he disputed claims of fraud without any evidence, where 2 years ago he demonstrated that fraud was easy to achieve. Whether fraud actually occurred is unknown. But there&#x27;s a difference between saying &quot;these people who allege fraud has occurred have offered no proof&quot; and &quot;these people who say fraud has occurred are wrong.&quot; And there&#x27;s a difference between saying &quot;its possible that fraud occurred, and witnesses who were present say fraud occurred, so we should be open to the possibility that fraud occurred&quot; and saying &quot;these people say fraud occurred therefore fraud occurred&quot;, and saying &quot;These people say they witnessed fraud but a pentester says they&#x27;re wrong so no fraud occurred.&quot; Does that make sense to you?<p>&gt; By that logic you&#x27;re accusing literally the whole world of being cannibals!<p>That is a bizarre misreading of my statement. I&#x27;m saying I have not seen something that I wasn&#x27;t in a position to see, so my lack of evidence is not evidence for anything. It would seem that enough evidence of dahmer&#x27;s cannibalism was presented that my lack of eyewitness evidence is just as irrelevant as Halderman&#x27;s lack of evidence of fraud in 2020.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t good faith. You don&#x27;t believe any of this.<p>dude, can you maybe focus on the arguments that are being presented and perhaps contemplate the difference between making a statement about the evidentiary status of a claim and making a claim yourself? This is basic stuff when it comes to epistemology and at this point I can&#x27;t tell whether you understand this and are arguing in bad faith, or actually don&#x27;t understand it and think I am arguing in bad faith.<p>I might be wrong (it has happened before) but I&#x27;m quite sure there is a difference between observing the lack of evidence for someone else&#x27;s claim and making a claim yourself.')
