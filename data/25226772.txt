Modern processors have way more specialized hardware for common tasks that weren&#x27;t common a decade ago.<p>Yes, the compute cores are going at the same speed. But you aren&#x27;t getting the significant advantage of other hardware optimizations.<p>Just look at the M1 benchmarks for goodness sake. (A bit unfair because it&#x27;s RISC-V based, but even x86 hardware has improved enormously in the last decade.)')
