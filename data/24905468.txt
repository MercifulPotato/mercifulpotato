The communication seems to be at #bluez on freenode, but I didn&#x27;t jump in yet. I don&#x27;t know the ethics here and there were no messages in the channel. I think contributions on this level will in the end impact the most people. Anyone wants to join as well? I was planning on first describing (for myself or online) the last bug fixes and contributions to get a feeling for the code.')
