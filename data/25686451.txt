I was saying this won&#x27;t be nice for a long time.<p>Example: my house, a 1954 built semi-detached - the official average unit in England - has a single phase 100A main cutout.<p>Hob 32A, 2x sockets circuits 2x16A, 2x light circuits 2x6A, oven 16A. That&#x27;s already 92A at total theoretical capacity.<p>If I was to add FIR panels, that&#x27;s bare minimum +32A, plus water heating - let&#x27;s play it down, +32A, car charger +32A again.<p>This means I&#x27;d need a 3 phase extension. If everyone in the area were to do this we&#x27;d literally burn down the system on day one.')
