One of the pastimes of the Washington news media when they have nothing better to do is to talk about &quot;THE IMPENDING BIG ONE&quot; (earthquake). My mom interprets the &quot;IMPENDING&quot; part very literally. The overall paranoia spills into any other stupid petty crime that gets reported (which in the local news broadcast is a lot). Everyone wants to steal our mail, everyone wants to hijack the signal from our car keys, everyone is camped out waiting to steal our Amazon packages.<p>I don&#x27;t find that to be a healthy way to live at all, but she&#x27;s always been like that, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an answer.')
