It might turn out to still be more expensive in the end. Then there&#x27;s the problem of less certainty about price changes if you have to wait longer for the product to be delivered which leads to inefficiency (over&#x2F;under-supply if mispredicted). There&#x27;s also the opportunity cost of money being tied up for longer in the delay between production and consumption.')
