USC in contrast has been online since march and has maintained that this will be the status quo since July. Their announcement to have spring 2021 be online came as no surprise in mid november, on anticipation of the inevitable thanksgiving surge.<p>It strikes me as very odd that the admins at Stanford weren&#x27;t looking around at what the rest of California was doing. It also surprised me to read that Bay Area schools were reopening as early as November. Mindboggling, really. LAUSD is remote this year.')
