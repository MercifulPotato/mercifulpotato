The web-based gallery UI isn&#x27;t great, and the phone UI isn&#x27;t great, but if you&#x27;re looking for a way to self-host everything, share with family, etc. it&#x27;s a good solution. You can always run a better self-hosted gallery on the web side, and mount the Nextcloud storage right into it. Nextcloud&#x27;s Android client, while minimalist, has some surprising and useful features. It integrates well with the rest of Android, so you can browse and select photos from Nextcloud to e.g. upload to Facebook, and most-surprisingly, you can have your phone automatically upload photos and videos to Nextcloud when you take them, so that you don&#x27;t have to do anything manually. Overall, Nextcloud is surprisingly good for photos.')
