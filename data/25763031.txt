I don&#x27;t believe it is the case, the most sensible metric is not always the number of users.<p>Here&#x27;s an answer to your question (what is one usecase that Beaker does that existing solutions can&#x27;t) : Beaker is the easiest way to publish content without forfeiting control. No account to create, no giving away my data, no server to install and sleepless nights to maintain it, no need to remain always up and running for my content to be accessible. The few solutions that exist in this space still rely on some form of hackish UI, if they even have one. With Beaker all you have to do is launch it and use the microblogging app.<p>On thr contrary, Beaker may not be a product in the nkw usual meaning but that&#x27;s because it is not an honest comparison: Beaker is a platform to help build products easily, as can be seen by the microblogging &quot;example&quot;')
