It&#x27;s not designed to work with a planned economy, or with a completely capitalist economy, or with an agrarian economy, but explicitly with State Capitalism (see: NEP).<p>Secondly, <i>it&#x27;s not actually supposed to last</i>. This kind of government was designed to last more or less 70 years under the correct economic system, it wasn&#x27;t designed to last forever.<p>China happens to be a case of the government system operating in exactly the correst economic system during the period where its supposed to work.<p>The rest of it is just typical &quot;democratic&quot; centralism, self-criticism, a strong ideological backing, and the ability for flexibility and reactivity at the local level, as well as a good dose of fear.')
