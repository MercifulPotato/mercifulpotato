But, Iâ€™ve been hearing about how good 1Password is from lots of sources. Seems like you know and have experience on both sides. Would you mind sharing why 1Password is better (or even have better experience) compared to LastPass? I use it personally and not in an enterprise setting. Your comment might just push me to use 1Password :)')
