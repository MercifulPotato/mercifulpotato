Should it be?<p>How are we defining sedition though? Rebelling against society is one thing. I&#x27;m an old punk rocker. Did I break laws I didn&#x27;t agree with? Yes, repeatedly. But I also accepted that, right or wrong, it was my personal choice, I made those decisions myself   and if I faced consequences for it they were my consequences to face, not someone else&#x27;s. There&#x27;s a difference between sending a message and killing the messenger. I get the over all point you&#x27;re making but damn what do we call it? This is way past protesting or rebelling against the government and society. We poked the bear but we didn&#x27;t burn down the entire forest just to spite the bear.')
