However, window&#x27;s cloud storage is REALLY good.  Far better than dropbox IMO.<p>It actually surprised me how seamless it worked on my new laptop.  Everything just worked out of the box, the only thing I had to do was provide my windows credentials (benefits of that sort of integration).<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve not tried to access those same files from my phone.
