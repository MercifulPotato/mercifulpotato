Sometimes I can get away with learning only Y, but most of the time not spending all that time learning Z means I&#x27;ve only thought I&#x27;ve learned Y, and as soon as something doesn&#x27;t work as expected, I&#x27;m stuck.<p>What I miss is what I (almost) had in college: the chance to learn in depth not tied to a particular instrumental outcome.')
