That means that multi-code-host (&quot;universal&quot;) code search is going to address a much bigger market than code search that&#x27;s tied to a single code host. Also, big companies (which is where most of the money comes from) all have their code scattered among a ton of different systems, and code search across all their code (not a semi-arbitrary subset) is way more valuable.<p>So, Sourcegraph will remain independent.
