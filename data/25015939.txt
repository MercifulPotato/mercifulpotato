It may reduce the sale price, if concrete block has no value to a purchaser, but only by the amount that it would take to remove the concrete block. And if the land is so valueless that concrete removal significantly impacts pricing, the land wouldn&#x27;t have been valuable enough to instal wind turbines in the first place!<p>So this sort of FUD seems to be extremely weak. Wind power is a massively profitable business, the amount of money that can be made dwarfs the capital costs of the construction, which in turn dwarfs the cost decommissioning of non-toxic materials.')
