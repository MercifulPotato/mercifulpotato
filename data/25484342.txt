It&#x27;s doable, but still requires maintenance. For instance, even running a simple blog off of a VPS requires you to worry about setting up an SSL certificate and keeping it renewed, staying on top of security updates, and putting together some kind of scaling solution assuming you ever want to write a post which gets to the front page of hacker news.<p>I think there&#x27;s definitely an argument at a certain scale to just outsourcing that complexity so you can actually work on what contributes to your unique value proposition.')
