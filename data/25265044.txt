Overall productivity is probably the same, but costs have gone down and morale up, as s&#x2F;he moves towards retirement.<p>Or take a smart developer. Instead of haggling over 20% time, unofficial side projects, conference talks etc, sell him an extra off-day that is paid as a half-day.<p>Amateur athletes? HR people? etc etc... I mean, modern offices have people dedicated almost exclusively to organizing silly group activities; there is plenty of spare time that can be cut, to everyone&#x27;s benefit.<p>I would sign tomorrow.')
