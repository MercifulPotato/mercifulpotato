Think of it like tech debt. Working around a bug can be useful if there&#x27;s genuine time pressure. If you&#x27;re doing it because you don&#x27;t think you can fix it, or worse, haven&#x27;t convinced other people there&#x27;s any bug at all, then it is inadvisable to keep doing that in the long run.<p>There are good reasons why the rules for people are different to those for goods and capital. However, you may note that Trump specifically is also in favour of tariffs i.e. impeding the flow of goods. Via FATCA the USA also practices an obscure form of capital controls.<p>I don&#x27;t know if getting into a debate about the merits of borders is a great idea for this thread, but, consider at least the following things:<p>1. Historically people have fought and died for the rights to create borders (or a nation, as they saw it). The world in 1800 was a world of sprawling empires. Passports didn&#x27;t really exist in their modern form. Borders were weak or non-existent. In the past 200 years the number of countries has gone up drastically, often because people fought against those empires for the rights to create a smaller, more localised nation that would be better attuned to their local needs and cultures.<p>Are you <i>sure</i> all those people were <i>that</i> wrong that they sacrificed so much, for something they shouldn&#x27;t have wanted?<p>2. The world at the time of the Statue of Liberty was rather different to the world of today. For one, relatively few people could actually reach the US to do that sort of immigration. The arrival of cheap air travel fundamentally changes the equation for borders and immigration rules, as the flows of people involved are so much larger.<p>3. Culture is a real thing, a describable thing. The left exhalts it and upholds the benefits of a diversity of cultures. But in practice, cultures don&#x27;t always co-exist peacefully. In Europe countries are resurrecting internal borders (e.g. Sweden did this just a few days ago) in the wake of yet more Islamist terror attacks, including the beheading of a school teacher that was trying to teach French values of tolerance and freedom of expression. Presumably you&#x27;re aware of this story. As a consequence <i>even Macron</i>, who is as global-elite-anti-borders as they come, has had a sudden &#x27;conversion&#x27;. The left has no coherent answer to how to sustain the values of &#x27;enlightenment liberalism&#x27; that they hold dear in the face of large-scale immigration from cultures that doesn&#x27;t share those values, nor tolerate them.<p>The left is losing this argument despite that borders seem retrograde, are inconvenient, and so on, because it hasn&#x27;t yet found any coherent tradeoffs or solutions for the problems that prompted them in the first place. Indeed nobody has: the right doesn&#x27;t even try. But the left is simply ignoring them and campaigning against the infrastructure of enforcement, which is a childish approach. A similar problem can be seen in the USA with respect to the police: campaigning against the existence of a thing that creates problems, without any answer to how to address the problems lack of that thing would create. It&#x27;s this kind of anti-tradeoff thinking that eventually led me to abandon the left. It&#x27;s OK to recognise that a situation is unsatisfactory, yet also recognise that you don&#x27;t know of an alternative tradeoff that&#x27;s clearly better.')
