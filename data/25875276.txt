Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611343812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873858, text='&gt;The Southern States were underrepresented in the Senate compared to the House by the initial apportionment in the Constitution, represented at very close to the same ratio in each House in the apportionment for the 1790 Census (largely reflecting that they had been overrepresented relative to population, in the House, in the Constitutional apportionment), and substantially overrepresented in the Senate compared to the House after the 1800 Census.<p>That&#x27;s orthogonal to the concerns of small population states, in 1787, when the Connecticut Compromise was adopted.<p>What&#x27;s more, the results of 1790 and 1800 Censuses didn&#x27;t impact support or opposition to that compromise, as they hadn&#x27;t been performed yet.<p>&gt;by-State representation in the Senate was contrary to, rather than designed to serve, their regional interest.‚Äù<p>Which is the flip-side of the coin to what I said.')
