They understand their tools &quot;all the way down to the metal&quot; and all the way &quot;up to the esthetics&quot;. You can see great people in all crafts (like woodworking).<p>Do people like this exist today? I mean, the complexity at every level in the stack seems to have grown exponentially(maybe?) for decades. Are there engineers who are experts covering every layer across modern hardware architecture, CPU instruction sets, modern operating system architecture, cybersecurity, networking protocols, web technology, database systems, file systems, cloud infrastructure, quality control, Data Science, AI, AR, VR, Machine learning, UI framework design, wireless interfaces, etc. And that&#x27;s all before you even consider the non-technical skills of software engineering. The bar moves higher every day and I&#x27;m not sure this level of expertise is achievable&#x2F;maintainable.')
