Run those things directly as OS packages or sometimes AppImages or just precompiled binaries.<p>2. Run them via flatpak.<p>3. Don&#x27;t run them<p>I don&#x27;t think 1 is more secure than 2, and 3 is not really something I care for.<p>So sure, Flatpak has it&#x27;s issues, however I still appreciate it and IMO it is better than snap and AppImage. I also use AppImage for some things where the sandboxing of flatpak gets in the way too much, but snap never worked for anything that I tired it with.')
