There is historical value to everything, but it must be weighed against the need for modern facilities.  Sure there were some historic launches from MLP-2, but IMHO that does not justify turning it into a museum.  There&#x27;s a nice museum (and rocket garden) just a few miles away at the Visitor Center.')
