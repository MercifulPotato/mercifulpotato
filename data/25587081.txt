When I got to university I found it hard to unlearn line numbers.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t learning BASIC, it&#x27;s learning it (or anything else) exclusively for a long time. I learned 8-bit microcomputer BASIC first, too (several different dialects). And then, within a handful of years of being exposed to BASIC, I also learned some Logo, quite a lot of Turbo Pascal, DOS batch programming, and probably one or two other things I&#x27;m forgetting at the moment. None of them were really hard transitions, but I was learning them when I had a concept of programming but not a completely ossified one from long and exclusive exposure to a single language family.<p>&gt; Any talk of BASIC being useful is nonsense.<p>Of all the many languages I learned before learning assembly, unstructured BASIC did the most to prepare me for assembly, so I think it was quite useful.')
