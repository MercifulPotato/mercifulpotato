The PGBC&#x27;s website itself specifies:<p>&gt; PBGC is a federal agency created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to protect pension benefits *in private-sector defined-benefit plans*<p>Which means by implication that there are pensions in non-defined-benefit plans (ie defined-contribution, like 401ks). Also note that this quote indicates the PGBC doesn&#x27;t protect public-sector pension plans, which means your logic leads to the ludicrous conclusion that public-sector pensions are somehow not pensions.<p>This level of confidence combined with this level of ignorance is not a good look.')
