I just skimmed the &#x27;about&#x27; and did nothing jumped out at me saying &#x27;vc backed&#x27; - but maybe there are other clues I should look for &#x27;vc backed&#x27; with things in the future.<p>This has made me consider more about vc backed things - they mostly have to go for certain business models and it limits things I guess.<p>my comment was saying I would buy the code to run on our servers, not asking to give it away. I do this with some local software and some server software. It&#x27;s a fine choice to not make it available that way.<p>I was merely offering a different view point some may want to consider - not suggesting that their current model was flawed.<p>No matter how many VCs want to be the next adobe, I only use software I don&#x27;t have to subscribe to, and try to only user services where I have easy export of data. Certainly I am not the majority of users in the world.<p>I wonder how many more will start to shift after getting burned by vendor lockin though, certainly I&#x27;m not the only one that has spend time and money with other people&#x27;s platforms and had them change a business model or terms of content and then lost all of that time and content.<p>I imagine the number of people with that bad taste in their mouth will continue to grow. This is not to say that I expect the youtube&#x2F;adobe etc biz models to fail because if it. Just offering a glance at a market that may not be considered.')
