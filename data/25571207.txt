I disagree that Bitcoins have no inherent value. There&#x27;s a lot of history surrounding Bitcoin, so the argument that they have value purely from a collector&#x27;s standpoint is valid.<p>However, it does not follow that <i>therefore</i> a valuation of thousands of dollars per unit of Bitcoin may be justified and not just due to speculative frenzy. I&#x27;m picking the NES game because it has roughly the same amount of units available and most people own them as a collectible, not to actually play it.')
