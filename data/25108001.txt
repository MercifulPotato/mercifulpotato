Item(by='hanklazard', descendants=None, kids=[25109133], score=None, time=1605500737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107799, text='re: linux laptops, I&#x27;m writing this from one of the new Lenovo Carbon X1 models that comes pre-installed with Ubuntu. I prefer pop!_os (except for the name) so I installed that when I first got the machine, and it&#x27;s worked with no issues. I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks and zero complaints. The fingerprint reader even works with linux, which wasn&#x27;t the case on my previous gen CX1 laptops.<p>Let me also just say that I am basically at the point where I may soon recommend a pop!_os machine to my parents (who are in their late 60&#x27;s and have limited abilities on computers). Given that I&#x27;ll personally be on the hook for any and all tech support, take that as a strong vote of confidence!')
