This trend has been gradually solidifying ever since the dot-com bubble, and has reached its logical conclusion today. The only IPOs happen when companies reach 100-billion dollar valuations, and sometimes not even then. IPOs seem more likely for private companies that have lost their growth potential.<p>There&#x27;s certainly some potential for growth and returns still available when companies reach this stage, but the lion&#x27;s share is taken out already. The index funds are also often at the ass end of this phenomenon, buying in only at very high valuations. The most absurd example happening a week ago, with Tesla entering the S&amp;P500 as the sixth biggest company.<p>I&#x27;d like the possibility of investing in a fund of unlisted companies. The growth sector that&#x27;s not represented in the major indexes is far too big to ignore. I try to compensate by having a portion of my wealth in &quot;small cap&quot; companies, but there is still a very significant sector that&#x27;s completely missing.')
