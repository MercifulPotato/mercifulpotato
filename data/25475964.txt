It&#x27;s buggy too, but not unplayably buggy. The autosave is good enough to be okay on a crash and it crashes infrequently enough to still be enjoyable.<p>I&#x27;m still happy I bought it and it&#x27;s been fun, I think it&#x27;ll get more stable over time.<p>On a related note, it sucks that GTA has been ruined by GTA online. 7yrs, three console generations. All the creativity that used to go into a new really great GTA game every couple years has been sucked into the boring money maker of GTA online. It&#x27;s the console equivalent of in-app purchases ruining mobile games.<p>It&#x27;s a shame low effort stuff like that makes so much money - I don&#x27;t really understand what people see in it.')
