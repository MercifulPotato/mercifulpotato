As the next comment pointed out, that change is not coming on the desktop PC again. It has to be something that really shifted the paradigm on computing and I think the iPhone did that. I owned a PocketPC and a Palm Treo, but those were both productivity tools and the iPhone was something entirely different in the same way Amgiga was a shift away from the PC as a business tool.<p>What the I think the &quot;next big thing&quot; will lack is the second part of the question: &quot;and somehow preserving some of its identity.&quot; I don&#x27;t see another plucky upstart shifting the hardware paradigm of computing. Though that might be because I lack the creativity, skill or vision to see what that might be.')
