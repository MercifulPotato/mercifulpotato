This finding makes it unnecessary to even argue the point.<p>- &quot;we need to be rethinking our approach to engineering design [...] new methods and theories of technological innovation and change&quot;<p>...is their suggestion. If that sounds vague and unrealistic, that&#x27;s because it is. But, specifically, we get:<p>&quot; if more components of the plant, or even the entire plant, could be built offsite [...]&quot;<p>I have no idea if this is possible. But I&#x27;m reasonably certain that the idea isn&#x27;t entirely new. Since it wasn&#x27;t done, it&#x27;s likely to not actually be worth it. Indeed, the next suggestion is to:<p>&quot;substitut[e] some new kinds of concrete in the massive structures&quot;<p>Gee, thanks! Now we know a yet-to-be-invented miracle material might be useful. And if the sheer amount of concrete is a major factor in construction costs, we now also have a better idea wrt feasibility of off-site construction and subsequent transport.<p>Meanwhile, in the alternative SF universe that is reality, photovoltaics and batteries have come done in costs per unit of energy (-storage) by an order of magnitude every three or four years.')
