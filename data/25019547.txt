Scientists? Public health? Esp. during a pandemic? I do! Have a look at their data. [1]<p>Also, from the Lancet [2]<p>We wear masks partly to &#x27;not propagate&#x27; an actual disease - some forms of drug addiction are the same thing a social disease that is communicated by the actions we take. It&#x27;s not a big deal to &#x27;wear a mask&#x27; and it&#x27;s not a big deal to &#x27;not do crack&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;drugoverdose&#x2F;data&#x2F;statedeaths&#x2F;drug-overdose-death-rate-increase-2013-2017.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;drugoverdose&#x2F;data&#x2F;statedeaths&#x2F;drug-overd...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)32113-9&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a>')
