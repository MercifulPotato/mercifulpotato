If we tried to detect and treat them all, we&#x27;d kill everyone with side effects long before we prevented a fatal cancer.&quot;<p>I suppose it would help, if this would be more common knowledge. That cancer cells are very common and nothing to be afraid of.\n Just that when things go very wrong, it becomes a problem. And that is mainly, when the immune system fails?<p>So I suspect the stress for the fear of getting cancer, might in some people lead to actual cancer, by lowering their immune system.<p>Could you agree to such a statement, or do you think it is far off?')
