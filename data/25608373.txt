It didn&#x27;t address the concern.<p>&gt; I know of people who suffered after they left, and a cursory internet search will turn up many more stories.<p>All outliers. How many people leave a company in frustration? And then how many does the company go after? A tiny fraction! Not even 0.1%, which would be huge. I don&#x27;t think I can find even one case for the company I worked for. It&#x27;s not a small company - definitely makes more net revenue than Amazon, and comparable to at least one other FAANG.<p>&gt; There is no contradiction in what I said, if spending 100 units on a legal battle for a single employee would save them &gt;100 units on the next employee (or as a consequence of an unfavorable legal outcome), then it would be worth the cost.<p>The conclusion follows the premise, but the premise is extremely rarely true.<p>&gt; You were generating revenues which financed the project even if you didn&#x27;t directly work on it.<p>I never understood the desire to compartmentalize and draw boundaries only where it is convenient for you. Just because it is <i>within</i> my company makes it no different from a medium sized company providing services to another company who is involved in evil, even if those services are not directly related. If you work for a payment processor and provide services to my company, then your own logic would make you as complicit as I am. Your service is helping my company in its business, which raises our revenue, which is funding evil. Why am I complicit just because I am an employee, and not you because your company is providing us a service?  We&#x27;re both providing services to my company. Why draw the boundary only to within the company?<p>And at the end of the day, this is a hypothetical. I do <i>not</i> know what that technology was being used for. Surveillance was merely something I could <i>imagine</i> it&#x27;s used for. I chose not to get into the business, but the decision was the equivalent of &quot;Do not go work for any company that makes video cameras, or components for video cameras.&quot; I would never suggest anyone follow such standards.<p>Regarding my 4 points, you missed the point of me listing them. I didn&#x27;t say all medium companies follow those - I said they usually are some combination of those.<p>I&#x27;d happily work for a medium company that has the positive attributes you speak of. I just have trouble finding them, let alone getting hired by them. I&#x27;m not at all anti-medium size company or pro-megacorp. When I apply to companies, I generally get a higher response rate with megacorps than with medium sized companies.')
