The kids are better off at home staring at a blank wall 8 hours a day than being exposed to that level of incompetence.<p>Banning books to deal with teachers who can&#x27;t teach is like sticking a &quot;0 Trans Fat&quot; sticker on an improperly stored barrel of radioactive waste - it is worse than not even addressing the problem.')
