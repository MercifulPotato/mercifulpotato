How does the keyboard fare etc.. The specs are nice and how it performs is decent but the real tradeoffs here aren&#x27;t in the specs.<p>Though I suppose most people buying these will dock it most of the time.<p>I think personally I&#x27;d prefer an ultralight 11&quot; with an excellent keyboard. Like a Thinkpad X270 but much thinner and lighter. Below that the keyboard starts getting smallish.')
