Yeah it&#x27;s 33% more cores for 45% more money, but in for a penny.. The 5900x is already split across 2 core complexes and the 5950 will just add 2 more cores to each. Cinebench multi-core does shows exactly what you would hope adding the extra cores: 5900x is 75% the score with 75% the cores vs the 5950.')
