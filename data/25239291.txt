IP addresses are personal data per GDPR, and by serving TCP connections you are collecting IP addresses of your clients. In the case of DNS, your DNS query is also likely personal data in some cases, and it definitely is personal data when linked to a timestamp and an IP address.<p>There is a huge distinction to be made in collecting vs. storing. The 8888 privacy policy also calls out that some personal information is stored, for how long, and for what purpose. But most people who claim that they&#x27;re not <i>collecting</i> personal information are just not being accurate in their privacy statements.<p>Disclaimer: googler, opinion is my own and not my employer&#x27;s.')
