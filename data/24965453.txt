Maps are always going to be contextual, and a mark of a &quot;good&quot; map in my mind has always been if, after a certain amount of time using it, you no longer have to rely on it. Having spent a lot of time in New York, traveling there when I was younger and now for business but never living there for longer than a summer, the &quot;old&quot; map served this purpose pretty well. Maybe it was a little hostile to the user, but this sort of encourages you to just straight up memorize things. This isn&#x27;t to say the maps <i>should</i> be hostile as a means to makes people memorize its contents, rather that this one was maybe &quot;just usable enough that tourists can get around&quot; and &quot;just hostile enough that people who use the subway a lot would just memorize things&quot;. Traveling from JFK to Grand Central and then up to Columbia became muscle memory after the second trip.')
