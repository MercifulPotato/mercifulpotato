What&#x27;s left for us? Floating? :-)<p>Alternating could be the answer :) I have a DIY treadmill desk, and I try to walk for at least an hour every work day, while working. Usually I get to 1.5 hours, in 2-3 sessions. It&#x27;s been great - I sleep much better than when I don&#x27;t walk, and it&#x27;s easier for me to keep my weight in check. I&#x27;ve been doing it for 3 years now. I know this isn&#x27;t possible for everyone, but it was easy to setup and, in the scheme of things, some of the best money I&#x27;ve spent.')
