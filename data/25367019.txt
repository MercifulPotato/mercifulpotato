Trump still lost Georgia by about 13,000.<p>The banana republic part of this is a man who lost the election by more than 7 million votes trying to steal the election. Trump didn&#x27;t come close to winning. Trump got straight up thumped, and he is still trying to sue to get millions of votes thrown out. Millions of American votes.<p>If you are concerned with why voting isn&#x27;t smoother in this country with less errors, you need to support creating national standards and funding to help make voting easier and more modern. This is an artifact of an incredibly balkanized voting processes. A lot of Americans would support easy, modern, universal voting.<p>The election is long since past, and Trump lost. The reason you don&#x27;t see national news orgs covering small-scale election issues in individual counties is that they aren&#x27;t national news stories. It&#x27;s really that simple.<p>The fact that a recount found additional votes -- the point of a recount -- and that the additional votes didn&#x27;t impact the election is not news. It&#x27;s just not news.')
