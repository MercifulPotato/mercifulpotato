I assume you mean legalese as is used in Law -- modeling reality of law is hard, but modeling reality for computers is not hard, we&#x27;ve worked hard to make things <i>very</i> deterministic and demonstrably so.<p>All we do is send instructions to computers all day that are mostly executed perfectly, changing the <i>language</i> you use to speak to the computers is the point of higher level languages, and I strongly consider english to be just another frontend (in the LLVM sense), just one that is a lot harder to encode the semantics of fully. But the thing is, you don&#x27;t need to encode the semantics fully -- just make paths one at a time for certain functionality (ex. `read_file(path: string): string` can have it&#x27;s first &quot;call sentence&quot; be &quot;read file from &lt;path on disk: var&gt; and store the contents in &lt;new const var&gt;&quot;)')
