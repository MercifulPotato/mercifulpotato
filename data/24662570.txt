Not as quickly as in the 1990&#x27;s -- but not slowly enough to warrant blanket certification bureaucracy that will just have to change in 5-10 years.<p>Software changes, fundamentals do not.<p>The people who complain about credentialism are the same people whose answer to &quot;my code is slow&quot; is &quot;just add more hardware&quot;.
