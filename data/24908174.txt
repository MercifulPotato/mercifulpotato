Item(by='sergeykish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603811607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907466, text='wegs reminded me experience with Ubuntu. I&#x27;ve started with GNOME, tried XFCE, Openbox, system become brittle and it raised questions like &quot;How to configure WiFi without DE?&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve switched to Arch Linux, base install covers network configuration. It gave me stable platform, I can grow my knowledge, I can fix my system.<p>Void Linux and Alpine Linux are just examples of what could match voiced concerns. I lot of people recommend Manjaro, looks like a simple way to try Arch based distro. Some problems stem from upgrading release, Debian Testing could help. But I have not tried them.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Ubuntu, I don&#x27;t like distribution upgrades, default theme, constant experiments on users. Gentoo is my first distro, as C++ dev at that time, compilation was fascinating. I still enjoy 3 commands joke [1], looks like it is possible to install binary packages these days. I&#x27;ve tried Alpine, I don&#x27;t like apk, systemd and glibc are good enough for me. I&#x27;ve tried OpenBSD, hardware support was not as good as on Linux. I&#x27;m playing with NixOS but I am so used to Arch.<p>And I want to stress, each of these system has something I enjoy. It is just me who is driven by minimizing negative points.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bash.org&#x2F;?464385" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bash.org&#x2F;?464385</a>')
