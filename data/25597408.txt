You get all of the benefits of a button&#x27;s accessibility, focus, click events, normal tabbing, etc, and can use them for things like toggling an accordion of content or showing&#x2F;hiding a mobile menu. Better than a div because you don&#x27;t need aria-role, and better than a link because it is not taking you anywhere.<p>As pointed out up thread, developers and designers often skip using &lt;button&gt; because it is hard to style just right. Using appearance:none resets the style but not the accessibility behavior.')
