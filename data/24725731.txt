Uber is worth $65 billion and they have to give 80% of their revenue to their drivers.<p>If Waymo can get a 60% gross margin instead of a 20% gross margin, their profits could be an order of magnitude higher.<p>This is a trillion dollar opportunity, and its the first thing Alphabet is seriously pursuing that can rival search.<p>Aftermarket conversion kits are a rounding error and there&#x27;s no long term moat. And that&#x27;s before you start to get in to issues like improper installation and use, aftermarket modification, accidents causing bad PR when the gear isn&#x27;t even running etc.<p>Remember that AEB demo a decade back where the car just slammed in to the object it was meant to stop for and it turned out they hadn&#x27;t turned it on?
