The difficult driving experiences where just so rare that I would be surprised if a self-driving vehicle would know what to do.<p>* I once had a car driving way above the speed limit approach me from the rear, it passed me by jumping the curb driving on grass and sidewalk and swerving back onto the street in front of me.<p>* Another time I was driving back to a rental house in the Aspen area and the snowstorm had gotten bad enough to completely cover and obscure the road on the hillside I was driving on. My wheels went off the road, fortunately on the side away from the drop off and I was driving slowly, but then I couldn&#x27;t get back on the road without using enough power that I feared I would swerve off the road on down the hill. This required a bit of puzzle solving before I could safely get back on the road.<p>* I&#x27;ve had bad GPS data that kept me circling my destination without every getting me there.<p>I just think that such unusual situations are going to be difficult for autonomous cars to understand very soon.')
