Walmart’s profit margin is less than 3%, most fast food restaurant franchisees probably don’t have margins much above 5% and Uber is yet to have any profits... So there isn’t much room for them there. They either can increase their prices or increase their worker productivity by hiring less people and investing more into increasing efficiency&#x2F;automation. Both of which would not be beneficial to consumers and unqualified workers in the short term.<p>And this is not something that hasn&#x27;t been tried in practice yet. Just look at European countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Spain etc. They have significantly higher minimum wages (relatively to their GDP or median household income) than the US and consumer goods and services are in general much more expensive (relatively) there than in the US.')
