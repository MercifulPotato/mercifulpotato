People do move to avoid taxes all the time, but it’s nowhere near as simple as saying that people will quickly move to wherever taxes are the lowest; people will tolerate some level of higher tax if they feel that it’s worth it for whatever reason.<p>At the low income end, that’s been CA for decades. CA is a higher tax state than other places, but they could get away with it because <i>people wanted to live in CA, and were willing to pay for it</i>. It helps that the really desirable areas of CA are a long way away from other states, making leaving the state kind of a pain in the butt. It’ll be interesting to see how Covid changes that around.<p>Even at the higher level, we don’t see a ton of millionaires and billionaires renouncing their citizenship and moving to wherever the taxes are the lowest. Some do, but a lot stay in the US because living in the US is a really nice place to be if you’re rich. They might move to the lower tax states, but that’s as far as they’re willing to go.<p>The issue for SF specifically is a bit like the issue for NYC; it’s relatively small and really close to a bunch of places within commuting distance that have lower tax rates. Compared to leaving even CA, leaving SF specifically is <i>really</i> easy.<p>And FWIW, I think that the tax thing is a bit overblown; I think housing costs are the real problem. I’m leaving CA (Los Angeles) next month for another state, and while I’ll save a bit on taxes, it’s nothing compared to what I’ll save on housing costs. Four months of owning a home will save me enough over my 2bd LA apartment to obliterate any difference in income taxes for the year.')
