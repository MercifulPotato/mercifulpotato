Most dealers selling a handful of cars took the GM buyout in 2008.  Perhaps they spent the couple of hundred thousand dollars back then and things didn&#x27;t turn out as well as they hoped?<p>Spoke with my local Ford dealer who knows that I am interested in one of the Mustang EV&#x27;s.  He showed my the two chargers and shop tools they were required to buy to sell the Mustang EV.  I think he said it was around $40K plus the cost of a week or two training off site.  I wonder what GM is doing that triples that cost?')
