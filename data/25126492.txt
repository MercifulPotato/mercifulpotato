The algo is returning the index at which the array contains the search value; returning -1 is a pretty normal way of indicating that there is no such index. She could of course change the search function to return a Maybe Int, then return Nothing in the case where the array does not contain it. Either way makes sense to me. The -1 value is actually warming on me more and more because if the returned index is later used to access the array, it will definitely return Nothing. But using Maybe.andThen to monadically deal with a Maybe wrapped return value that would also be cool.<p>Float division by zero works the way IEEE floats work: it becomes +&#x2F;- Infinity. For Integers it actually becomes zero. This makes sense because to me you probably should have handled the case where the denominator was 0 before you got to the point of doing division. Like are you taking the mean of an empty list? What&#x27;s going on?')
