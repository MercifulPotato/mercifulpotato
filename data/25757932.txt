That is why, the troops are always gauged and defended on the basis of the orders and their faithful execution of the orders, no matter how horrific they are. Troops are punished for not following orders.<p>Those in the administrative side of the army, they are punished for orders <i>and</i> decisions.<p>So, to subvert the military, you don&#x27;t have to control the whole of it, just the leadership.<p>In the present case of America, the military is under the full command of trump. He holds all power and that power is absolute.<p>Unfortunately, he is a fascist moron with dreams of authoritarian rule.<p>These statements from the military are essentially telling him, the military will take a <i>decision</i> when push comes to shove, and that <i>decision</i> by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be on the understanding of law, and their oath to the constitution, even though <i>they are bound to follow the orders of the president</i>')
