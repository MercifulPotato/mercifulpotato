We diverted traffic and then analyzed with wireshark. We found one particular bit was being pulled low (i.e. 0 -&gt; 0 and 1 -&gt; 0). HTTP connections didn&#x27;t notice but TLS checksum verifications would randomly fail. Had a hell of a time convincing the cloud provider they had a hardware fault- turned out to be a bug which disabled ECC on some of their hardware.<p>Aside: I&#x27;m surprised you got a TPMS programming tool instead of a set of steelies. Big wheels? Multiple winter vehicles?')
