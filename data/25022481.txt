I don&#x27;t trust them, and I don&#x27;t know who they contract under. They often ask leading questions, regardless. If I ran into an exit pollster, I would&#x27;ve told them I wrote in Ross Perot.<p>I started doing this a couple years ago, when I was called up, and asked to take a survey. The young woman on the other end was very polite, and the questions at first seemed reasonable. The further I went into the survey, the more nakedly leading its questions became, clearly meant to support Republican talking points. I told her I was done, hung up,and since then I&#x27;ve only given false answers to political survey calls.<p>If my representative wants my opinion, they can host a town hall, or reach out to me directly. I&#x27;ll send an email or call their office if there&#x27;s an issue I care about.<p>If our politicians know nothing, and receive bad data, then they&#x27;ll either cross their fingers and be more straight about their convictions, or be badly disappointed whenever they try to pander.')
