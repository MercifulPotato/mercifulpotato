I didn&#x27;t get a refund. I didn&#x27;t get a replacement booking  (well, I was offered one leaving after my return flight). I got exactly nothing.<p>The court simply threw out my case because it was &quot;overloaded&quot;.<p>I think Easyjet might be exploiting this loophole to avoid paying customers whom they&#x27;ve fucked over.<p>I had another case against a different business which I launched and got thrown out because the courts were overloaded too.<p>The UK courts system appears to be <i>horrendously</i> underautomated. It was a mess of scanned written forms and calling up people to read credit card numbers over the phone. They really should deduct a <i>ton</i> of points on those &quot;ease of doing business&quot; metrics for this mess.')
