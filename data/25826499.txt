Cython compiles a C-style superset of Python into C.  Then a C compiler compiles that to a Python-importable DLL&#x2F;.so.  So, the overhead to call a C function is no more than declaring its types (programmer person overhead) and then, in the generated C, the native C-linkage function can be called like any other.  Now, just one C function calling another from another translation unit (i.e. object file or shared lib) can be &quot;high&quot; overhead (nothing like Py FFI), but you may also be able to eliminate that with modern compilers with link-time-optimization with some build environment care.')
