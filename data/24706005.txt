Spotless every time.<p>The plates etc. first go through a larger machine that looks like a carwash, then go to the dishwasher. Comes out hot and ready for use just as quick as with the glasses.<p>I asked if they use any chemicals and the manager said yes but it was not immediately obvious where they put it and I did not notice any smell, just how water.')
