And redirecting the resources that currently flow to HEP to climate science wouldn’t make much difference, as it’s not a particularly large amount of resources in the grand scheme of things. HEP has a lot of people who work there for a lot less than they could make elsewhere because they like being physicists. If the field is gutted in favor of some other discipline they will move to finance or industry, not other scientific fields. We can approximate where they would end up be looking at where PhD graduates who don’t go into physics research end up.')
