Often enough that when I was using a Scheme that compiles to the JVM, I wound up in extended conversations with the compiler&#x27;s author about how to add such features to his compiler. It was <i>possible</i> to do, and he was interested in doing it, but it was really too much work to be practical.<p>The context matters, though. I&#x27;ve been working with Lisp systems (and occasionally with Smalltalk systems) for over thirty years, and the way I normally work is to start with some simple sketch of a model and some simple interactions with it, and build it up gradually, interactively. While my program runs, of course.<p>That means making a lot of incremental changes to the model as I go, which, in a class-based system, means a lot of changes to classes. And since I prefer to modify my work while it runs, that means a lot cases of the environment saying, &quot;hey, this definition changed; what do you want to do about it?&quot;<p>If you typically work in an environment that doesn&#x27;t support those kinds of incremental changes to a running system, then of course you&#x27;re going to learn a way of working where such situations don&#x27;t come up, because they can&#x27;t.')
