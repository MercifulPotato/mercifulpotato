You need to have a browser to use this SaaS. You do not necessarily have to install anything to convert a single file in a prehistoric format. It also depends on what you mean by install. Download a portable version of a program that does it for you? Technically no installation required there. Using your already existing package manager? Anyways, this is besides my point. See below. Plus why stop after a single file?<p>If you cannot see the absurdity of using SaaS for something like this, or for something like tar, I am sorry. Keep using SaaS to archive files, too. Why install tar when you can just install a browser and visit a website where you can upload your stuff to just to have it archived on and by their server and then downloaded by you? I brought up tar because it is pretty similar.<p>What does an online converter beat and why exactly? Just because it is something you may rarely do, does not mean that doing online is a good idea. I rarely edit photos. I am not going to use an online photo editor for my photos for obvious privacy reasons, for example. If it is more comfortable for you and you do not care about privacy, do it for all I care. I am free to form my opinion about the absurdity of SaaS for everything that is trending. Online text editor!<p>&gt; So an online converter beats an installable utility hands down in virtually all aspects that matter.<p>This is just your opinion. I shared mine. You may not want to install tar either and use a website for archiving and extracting tar files, or tar.gz files, or whatever else. I have no problem typing &quot;pacman -S tar&quot; in this case. It is a bit of an unfair comparison because I personally often use tar, but I also often use my browser, so might as well use an online tool, especially if I spend lots of time in the browser.')
