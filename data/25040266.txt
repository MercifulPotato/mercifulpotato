Many people object to this sort of thing, and say &quot;if it&#x27;s such a good idea, a private business should be willing to do it.&quot; Strangely they tend to not make this argument about things like public transport, even though it&#x27;s exactly the same thing.<p>The arguement is that these arenas, convention centers, transit systems, etc. enable more economic activity and generate more tax revenue than they cost. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s always (or ever) the case but that&#x27;s the rationale and it&#x27;s not insane.')
