The x-axis isn&#x27;t labeled, I don&#x27;t know from a glance how much time each bar encapsulates and not least the sentiment color axis is unlabeled.<p>To make it better, I&#x27;d want a line graph of sentiment over time, as well as a smoothed average. Any major events with a spike in sentiment could be labeled on the graph. Ideally the sentiment scores would be places in some context that is a good reference.')
