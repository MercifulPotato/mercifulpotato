(n -&gt; 2 n) is the same function as (x -&gt; 2 x).<p>When you write O(k log n) what you really mean is O((k, n) -&gt; k log n)<p>And you can indeed take it apart:<p>O((k, n) -&gt; k) * O((k, n) -&gt; log n) == O((k, n) -&gt; n log n)<p>(For some suitable definition of what multiplication of sets of functions means.)<p>That&#x27;s very different from functions with single arguments like in your example.<p>(And, yes, your example works.  It&#x27;s just a different thing.)')
