Donald Trump’s approval rating rarely if ever dipped below ~43% (with the usual and huge error bars) and consequently republicans reported they couldn’t go against him ever because of the polls. “Spending political capital” is a concept where a ruling party takes unpopular actions&#x2F;enacts unpopular law because it’ll only push their approvals toward their long run averages.<p>I think this needs to be a serious topic of discussion. After this administration, “governing by polling firm” seems disingenuous at best and outright detrimental to all involved.')
