If you say group all conflicts between Britain and opponents from continental Europe into a single conflict, surely you get a more protracted conflict than &quot;West vs Islam&quot;, since you have at least 2000 years of conflict.<p>The &quot;West vs Islam&quot; is just a particular inane categorization since you are contrasting a geographic area with a religion. You could categorize the Reconquista as Christianity against Islam (and Judaism), and this is how it was framed at the time, but how can it be &quot;the West&quot; against Islam? It is a post-cold war construct to justify a certain ideology, not a meaningful way of understanding history.')
