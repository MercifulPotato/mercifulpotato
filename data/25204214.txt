I think TurboTax is famous for this, where they just toss in fake progress bars to indicate that they are crunching some numbers, which really just take milliseconds, if that. The goal is just to convey that &quot;heavy work is happening&quot;.<p>I ended up using this strategy recently because I wanted to convey that my app was &quot;doing work on your behalf&quot;, so I tossed in a super quick progress bar like TurboTax does and then did a slick transition animation to show the results. It&#x27;s &quot;unnecessary&quot; in that I could&#x27;ve just showed you the results, but I really wanted to convey that there was a sort of cause-and-effect in the system. Without that little bit of animation, it felt like that would&#x27;ve been lost.')
