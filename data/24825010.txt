A California democrat could have more in common with a Missouri republican than his same-party counterpart. The democratic platform this year includes a number of promises that the <i>presidential candidate</i> does not agree with. The republicans did not publish a platform this year. It&#x27;s essentially a directional signal more than any concrete unifying measure, a party-for-all-people-except-the-ones-we&#x27;re-against.<p>If the democrats and the republicans are supposedly holding the union together, they&#x27;re doing an absolutely awful job at it.')
