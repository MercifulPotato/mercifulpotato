Originally it would shade and then hide because of memory constraints and displacement of micropolygons happening in the surface shader and not in a separate displacement shader. Eventually the architecture shifted to try to do as much hiding as possible and split out displacement shaders into a separate type.<p>Another thing that can be done with g-buffers is using mip-mapping and filtering of the g-buffer to do some sampling or effects on lower resolutions.  Pixels can also be combined into distributions instead of just averages, though I&#x27;m not sure how much this is done currently.')
