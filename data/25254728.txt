Now people just have to stay inside alone, the impact on standard of living is much lower.<p>If the average person has had a life quality reduction of 1&#x2F;3 during the pandemic, that&#x27;s equal to 23m quality-adjusted life years (QALY), or 287,500 lifetimes. Even with way more conservative estimates, death has been massively outweighed by other areas of impact of the pandemic.<p>I speak to more people now who say &quot;I can&#x27;t just stay inside for the rest of my life&quot;, particularly younger people where the social&#x2F;life impact of lockdown is higher. It&#x27;s different being a 22 year old guy locked down on their own in a flat and being asked to see nobody, compared to being a 48 year old guy locked down with their wife and family in a cottage.')
