Google no longer has their users&#x27; best interests at heart when it comes to ranking search results.<p>Users want relevant content. <i>Content</i> is the key word. Ads, pay&#x2F;login walls and other &quot;engagement&quot; crap is not what users want.<p>Google absolutely could rank websites based on these factors and downrank websites with ads, etc. However, this would be at odds with their own business model, as unless they want to risk opening themselves up to antitrust actions they&#x27;d have to treat all ads equally, which means also downranking websites with <i>Google</i> ads and hurting their own bottom line.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t have this problem, and has the advantage of a &quot;cult following&quot; which means they&#x27;ll get lots of users even if the product isn&#x27;t that good (yet?) just like with Apple Maps, which in turn would encourage websites to comply with Apple&#x27;s rules if they want to rank high and not miss out on those users.')
