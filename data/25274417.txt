Item(by='ryan29', descendants=None, kids=[25287678, 25275993], score=None, time=1606898112, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25273999, text='Maybe ticketing systems have gotten better, but I&#x27;ve never used one where I didn&#x27;t feel like I was &quot;spending time&quot; dealing with the ticket system.  As of right now, I end up with discussions spread across email, SMS, phone, and an issue tracking system (Redmine).<p>I think the main reason that happens is that I get delegated work and it often starts via email; &quot;Please deal with this.&quot;, &quot;Can we do this?&quot;, etc..  Based on my experience, that type of delegation is common for owner operated small businesses.  Most of those small business owners don&#x27;t want to create a ticket, assign it, set a due date, and track it when they&#x27;re used to something as efficient as forwarding an email and expecting the recipient to understand the implied &quot;do this&quot; that comes along with it.<p>Plus, a forwarded email saying &quot;Can we do this?&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense as a ticket when sometimes the answer is going to be a 15 second &quot;No.&quot;  Other times it might be &quot;Yes, but...&quot; after 30 minutes of research and additional conversation.  That warrants some type of tracking or ticket because you&#x27;re going to need that info if it turns into a billable job.<p>So as the delegate, I want to be able to decide an <i>existing</i> thread of communication warrants conversion to a trackable conversation or issue.  In addition to that, I want to be able to take future out-of-band communication and move it in-band by associating it with an existing conversation, ticket, topic, or whatever you want to call it.  For example, if a customer emails someone with extra info or questions, it would be useful to forward the whole thread into an existing Teams Channel.<p>I mostly deal with small businesses and very often it&#x27;s the owner interacting with a customer and delegating to employees via whatever means is appropriate.  It usually doesn&#x27;t make sense for the business owner to manage a ticket tracking system because that&#x27;s extra work they don&#x27;t want to &#x2F; can&#x27;t waste time on.  It makes way more sense for the delegate to manage tasks &#x2F; communication instead of the delegator IMO.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at Trello, Asana, Basecamp, etc. and I&#x27;m <i>always</i> left with the feeling &quot;now you&#x27;re going to have 2 jobs.&quot;  They&#x27;re designed for 100% buy-in, <i>someone</i> has to be the person that manages that stuff, and any out-of-band communication is a pain to bring in-band so you spend your time copying conversations into the system.')
