Item(by='na85', descendants=None, kids=[25294681, 25294409], score=None, time=1607027290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294174, text='&gt;No, for technical analysis to work, EMH needs to be false.<p>The way it was explained to me is that if the EMH is true, then looking at fundamentals is pointless because all the fundamentals are already priced-in, which leaves nothing but price and volume data left to analyze.<p>How could EMH be anything other than true in that case?<p>I&#x27;ll note that investopedia is often not a good source.  Here&#x27;s an investopedia article that explicitly supports my position, for example:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;t&#x2F;technicalanalysis.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;t&#x2F;technicalanalysis.asp</a>')
