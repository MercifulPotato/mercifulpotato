For example, a coworker applied some arcane number theory to one of our hashing algorithms, saving the company millions and was just recently awarded a patent for it. You can find many other, more specific examples in our Engineering blog. We&#x27;re a mature product operating at scale so small, but meaningful statistically-significant % metrics gains are actually quite large when it comes to real business impact, and so chasing these gains actually requires a serious academic toolbox.')
