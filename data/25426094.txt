Google dropped Project Eddystone, that sucked; totally straightforward sensible way to broadcast a url to the world about you. Apple has their file sharing AirDrop, which Google continues to make floundering attempts at (Beam, then Fast Share&#x2F;Nearby Share), &amp; never via any open protocols or specs. amazing personal communicators... totally reliant on completely centralized infrastructure.
