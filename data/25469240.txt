Older people I know, without inheritance, who don&#x27;t come from money (this makes a big difference), tend to have families and took on expensive mortgages, sometimes even a house in the suburbs, so they just put up with huge amounts of toxicity and overtime for the sake of providing a high standard of living for their families, while younger single people have nothing tying them down, often living frugally in shared accommodations, so if you shit on them, they can just pack up and leave whenever, whereever.<p>On the other side of the spectrum, people I know with any real estate inheritance, tend to not take part in the rat race and just take any chill (governmet)job they can find, as having their housing already covered, means they only need some money for food and bills so they can focus on enjoying life.')
