But you have to <i>convince</i> someone to buy your product.<p>Not only that, but there&#x27;s much more to advertising than goods. We have advertisements for political campaigns that try to persuade voters, pubic service announcements that try to persuade people to take certain actions, religious marketing, prescription ads that tell you to ask your doctor, etc. Ads have never been about awareness but persuasion. This is even more clear when you investigate why Coke has ads or car commercials. Coke already has the market. They advertise to make you feel like you&#x27;re choice was good, and you to feel good. Car companies advertise to build prestige and years later when you buy a car you have brand prestige.<p>It&#x27;s never been about awareness, it&#x27;s about selling you an idea as much as it is selling you a product.')
