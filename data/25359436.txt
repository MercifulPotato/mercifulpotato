I got a Rasberry PI 400 and that seems to be the perfect dev environment for me.  It also has the side effect of making me much more conscious of the technology and dependencies that I use to create a product with.<p>I use my own beefy server for creating builds and have a decent dev-build-test setup for myself where the dev experience is still pretty fast despite the hardware I&#x27;m using as a client - but when it comes to actually testing out my work I love using it on the PI because I know that most users will have an experience very similar to what I get on the PI.')
