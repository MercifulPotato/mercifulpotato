From the activity log to displaying commit information in file listings.  They\nall worked in the past, and at some point became dependent on JavaScript with no recourse.<p>I had to make do with these lapses in quality, always hoping for a reversal, but GitHub poor design values persist.  Come their latest\nmanifestation: the menu you got when you clicked on the little avatar icon on the top right of the page is now replaced by a useless &quot;Sorry, something went wrong.&quot; message.<p>This blow hits hard and therefore I feel the need to write about this long-standing issue.  It also troubles me that few people, presumably none working for GitHub, seem to care about it.  Since the issue is likely to exacerbate, I am considering further action.')
