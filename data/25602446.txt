Romans didn&#x27;t have any way to know the dangers of lead. Early 20th century people had very limited knowledge on radioactivity.<p>Now you can read up about non-ionizing radiation as much as you like, for free, and discover that despite hundreds of studies done on it non-ionizing radiation does not cause cancer. Not to mention that the frequencies used by 5G have been used by other things for years and clearly never caused much controversy. Same about GMO - you can read up on it and educate yourself, you can discover real things you should be upset about(like GMO crops which can resist glycophosphates so that farmers can use roundup to dessicate plants before harvest - the problem isn&#x27;t the plants, the problem is the farming practice).<p>So sure, we have the right to be wary - but that right should be followed by research, not by indulging in conspiracy theories about Billy Gates trying to control everyone with vaccines. That&#x27;s just dumb.')
