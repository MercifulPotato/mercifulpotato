The one that I use when at my desktop, Guitarix, is very conservative with its latency, defaulting to like 500 milliseconds, I turn it down to 20-30 or so and it still functions on my hardware and you can&#x27;t tell the difference: it&#x27;s the same time delay as playing through a speaker 20 feet away.')
