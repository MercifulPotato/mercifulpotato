And personal spending goes through a credit card set up by their own personal offshore bank, which effectively makes it loan. Etc.<p>If there are enough shell companies you can decide your own tax payments, because you can hide everything you choose to hide. It&#x27;s not that these networks can&#x27;t be disassembled, it&#x27;s that they can&#x27;t be disassembled <i>efficiently</i>. It can literally take months or years of full-time auditing effort to trace all the relationships.')
