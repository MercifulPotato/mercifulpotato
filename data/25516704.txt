MIT lied and covered up. Whatever dynamics apply to MIT certainly apply to Harvard.<p>That culture extends way beyond Epstein. If a well-connected researcher fakes research, everyone signs an NDA and moves on too. That has no national level dynamics.<p>I&#x27;d just like an honest MIT back. And I&#x27;d like to be able to trust all the elite schools. Yes, once in a while, man in black suits might sweep in and classify something, but that shouldn&#x27;t be the modus operandi.<p>And in this case, I don&#x27;t think MIT was nearly important enough to have been bullied by anyone. As far as I know, MIT was protecting its senior officials, not anyone else.')
