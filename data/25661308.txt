So to answer the gp question, it has around a precision in the few nanoseconds range. Accuracy is a different question, IE compare numbers from the same die, but be a little more suspicious across dies.<p>No clue how this is implemented on the M1, or if the M1 has the same modern tsc guarantees that x86 has grown over the last few generations of chips.')
