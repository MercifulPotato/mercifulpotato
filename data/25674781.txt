Those are just the output.</i><p>You know, HTML is rooted in SGML and digital humanism. The entire point of it is that you use it as a <i>simple</i> means for self-publishing of digital text (and HTML 5 &quot;standards&quot; portray it in that role, in case you&#x27;ve never had a look).<p>Granted, that isn&#x27;t quite apparent when looking at the trainwreck that is HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS. The solution (with SGML at least) is that you use your own custom markup vocabulary, including custom Wiki syntax for markdown and other short form syntax, and then convert that into result markup for delivery. The idea being that nothing can be as lasting for your specific purpose than your own text format.<p>But the self-proclaimed web heads didn&#x27;t get it. They made CSS so absurdly powerful and &quot;meta&quot; to cater for the historic shortcomings of HTML, which is just a format for casual academic publishing locked in 1991. Not considering that you can, in fact, define your own elements and meta rules. Or at least, I don&#x27;t have another explanation for the fact that everything around HTML has to change ad absurdum while HTML has to stay the same while it quite obviously isn&#x27;t a good fit for the vast majority of content on the web. And that for some reason you absolutely have to send the same HTML to your mobile that you send to your desktop, and that CSS absolutely has to be the place to shift, re-layout and hide content for these different purposes.')
