Repos and scripts have to be updated with the new branch name.  The default behavior of Git is changing in a way that&#x27;s not completely backward compatible, which means things that rely on it might break.<p>There&#x27;s a definite cost to changing technical language, especially in the context of names in computer software that are part of the software&#x27;s interface and might be relied on by other software that interfaces with it.<p>Changing perfectly passable names unnecessarily is just creating work for no purpose.')
