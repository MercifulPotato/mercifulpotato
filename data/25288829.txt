If Apple decides to stick a 5000+ mah battery in an iPhone - Android phones would have no way of catching up to its battery life.<p>Another big thing being the latest screen tech - Apple can&#x27;t afford to do an OLED screen on the iPad, since Samsung and LG can&#x27;t possibly manufacture enough OLED screens to meet demand. Where Samsung is perfectly fine doing it, when they won&#x27;t sell enough tablets to matter.<p>In the end it&#x27;s not that the iPhone is clearly inferior to Androids, it&#x27;s mostly that Apple has some numbers in mind that they consider optimal and going beyond those won&#x27;t increase their sales (certain amount of battery, certain screens, etc).')
