It is common to have them be macros containing a clearly separate datapath and control logic.<p>On the other hand, the fact that the prototyping was done on an FPGA makes this less surprising. Sea of cells is certainly easier to update, and less work than any form of manual datapath when migrating from FPGA to ASIC.')
