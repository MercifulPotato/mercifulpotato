India should also temporarily ban google, facebook, microsoft, apple, intel, etc until their local software companies are strong enough to compete. India, like china, is sufficiently large and important enough to create their own tech ecosystem. But given their track record, I really don&#x27;t have much confidence in india to get it right. Hope I am wrong though as the world needs genuine competition the tech space.<p>Now maybe the EU should get their act together? The EU was able to create airbus to compete with boeing, why can&#x27;t they do the same for their own version of microsoft, google, apple, facebook, etc? They are certainly wealthy enough and given their large population, they certainly could produce the talent to drive such an initiative.<p>If the EU thinks their private sector is going to compete against state-backed corporations like google, facebook, microsoft, apple, intel, etc, then they really have drunk the kool-aid. The EU&#x27;s private sector can no more create a competitor to these tech giants as it could have created an aerospace company to compete with boeing. These companies are fundamentally &quot;private&quot; state companies.<p>If india, EU, etc succeed, then perhaps ASEAN, Africa, etc will follow their examples and create their tech ecosystem within their economic bloc.')
