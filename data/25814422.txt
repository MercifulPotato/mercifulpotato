Item(by='Rotdhizon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610914037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813728, text='Haven&#x27;t commented in an extremely long time but I&#x27;m popping into voice my opinion here on two specific certs in that list: eJPT and eCPPT<p>Those certs are for self study only, the applicable value for them in the hiring process is non existent. No one knows who they are or what they do. Used to be a huge advocate of those certs until I actually bought them, then I immediately regretted it. It&#x27;s been a few years now but I had an awful time with the latter; buggy, filled with errors, typos, non working software. Back then at least, you had to spend hours fiddling with with the settings just to get it to work at a base level. The eJPT itself is extremely basic, it&#x27;s just using like 5-10 basic techniques to retrieve a few flags worth of info. Really didn&#x27;t like how the modules were set up. The main resources are powerpoint slides to cover all the text info, then you may have a few minute video occasionally that explains 1 topic barely. The labs would come with lab guides that were all but useless. The authors are Italian so typos and grammatical errors are rampant.<p>Curiously enough back when I bought them, they sold their courses individually and they were insanely expensive. Looking at them now, it seems they went away from that and now offer a one for all subscription of 2k&#x2F;year. The eCPPT alone cost me almost that back much when :&#x2F;<p>Since then it seems the company has kind of given up. They used to be pretty active on social media trying to advertise themselves, now they barely ever post. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;ve given up and are just maintaining the content they have until the ship sinks.<p>If you can get your company to pay for the subscription, go for it. If for nothing else, just the collection of powerpoints and curated information. Other than that, I&#x27;d stay away.')
