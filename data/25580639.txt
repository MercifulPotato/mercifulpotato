The problem is, if you ignore ethics, which of course says a lot about your priorities, still two fold.<p>First, you have development. That was arguably the fastest vaccine development in history. Not sure what could have been done faster here.<p>Second, you have production and distribution. Ramping up these two doesn&#x27;t make much sense before you know whether or not the vaccines work. Now they are ramped up really fast. Going &quot;fast and breaking&quot; things may have resulted in more people being vaccinated early on. But this small benefit would have caused tremendous issues in a couple of weeks &#x2F; months. The goal is to get millions vaccinated, not just a few elderly so that some people can go out partying again without feeling bad.')
