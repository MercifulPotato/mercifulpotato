They are just a part of something much bigger, and they are not really enabling new markets.<p>Second, they didn&#x27;t invent anything new, they just made the process a easier. There are plenty of non-Stripe solutions you can use today.<p>To a teenage software developer without business exposure or experience, who thinks &#x27;opening a merchant account&#x27; is a big deal, or that &#x27;incorporating&#x27; is a big deal, Stripe seems like some kind of magic.<p>But none of that is hard. People do it all the time. Your plumber, hairdresser and local cafe probably have some kind of incorporation and collect&#x2F;pay a VAT and business tax. It&#x27;s not rocket science. You can usually do it online in a few minutes.<p>&#x27;Dealing with banks&#x27; is not a problem with scale. 2% of every transaction however, and the underlying power structures that want to keep it that way ... that&#x27;s a problem.')
