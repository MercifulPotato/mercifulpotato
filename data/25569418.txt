And that is, unfortunately, pretty much impossible. Even if IPv6 hits 99% penetration, that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;ll be rid of IPv4.<p>This bout of pessimism seems unfounded in the article. Of course most services and networks will get rid of v4 when a sufficiently high percentage of users and devices have moved, just like they do with other protocols. It won&#x27;t disappear off the face of the earth, just like other old protocols didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll just find that you can&#x27;t use it on most networks.')
