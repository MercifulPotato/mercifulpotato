But look at the incredible sums of money wasted on contracts with borderline useless consulting shops. You can&#x27;t tell me that money wouldn&#x27;t be better spent on hiring smart developers and project managers and just <i>getting stuff done</i>.<p>I know it&#x27;ll never happen, but a developer can dream. There&#x27;s no actual reason why it couldn&#x27;t.')
