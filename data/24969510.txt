E.g.:<p>&gt; It should be illegal.<p>&gt; How is this not regulated?<p>No one forces you to use these services.  They&#x27;re voluntary.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re looking for storage for some stuff.<p>One company advertises a storage service, which is free, but there&#x27;s a clause in the contract that says, &quot;We can take your stuff at any time, for any reason, no backsies.&quot;<p>Would you trust your stuff to that storage company?<p>No, you wouldn&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s insane.<p>But somehow you rub a computer on it and everybody loses their common sense.<p>- - - -<p>Folks are naive (in re: computers) so you can either: 1) educate them, or 2) exploit them.  FAANG et. al. choose to exploit their users, quite ruthlessly too IMO.  A few companies actually try to educate their users (a very few.  Adafruit, Wolfram, ... who else?  I&#x27;m sure there are more but I&#x27;m drawing a blank right now.  Basically any company that&#x27;s built around teaching people what computers are and how to use computers, rather than <i>farming</i> &quot;lusers&quot;.)<p>- - - -<p>To me the weird thing is how many people choose to be exploited peasants rather than educated Users.<p>It&#x27;s extra-weird to me when the peasants start jumping up and down shouting &quot;Rabble rabble!&quot; instead of just using some other non-exploitative system.<p>(But then most folks&#x27; behaviour has never made sense to me, come to think of it.  So what do I know?  &quot;Nationalize FAANG!&quot;  &quot;Rabble rabble!&quot;)')
