But most things are morally neutral. I think the DMCA is morally bad, but here he can use it for a moral good. But even when you use a morally bad thing for good it is still slightly bad, as in people could point at his usage here (if he chose to use it) and say &quot;see the DMCA isn&#x27;t bad&quot; and the benefit for the bad solution his good usage promotes would taint his good usage ever so slightly.<p>As I tend to be more of a pragmatist I would say use the DMCA takedown if possible, but I can understand someone else feeling that would be bad.')
