Hand-waving words are not going to solve the hard problems of where to allocate limited dollars.<p>Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) are a widely used tool for measuring and reasoning about health care trade offs. They let you make utilitarian estimations on welfare to evaluate outcomes.<p>There are plenty of objections to this system; I’d hope for a recounting of some of these longstanding arguments, eg see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quality-adjusted_life_year#Debate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quality-adjusted_life_year#D...</a> for links to papers from the last few decades on this subject.<p>The author is basically using a sentiment-driven “think of the children!” style argument, without making any attempt to weigh or quantify harms on either branch of the decision tree. That isn’t a particularly helpful approach in public health policy in my opinion.<p>To be fair they seem to be responding to opinion pieces (not data driven arguments) from the other side of the argument so maybe I’m setting too high a bar. But I feel the QALY based approach is not the mainstream idea, particularly in the USA, so it warrants a bit more defending.')
