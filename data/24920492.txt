The new Nvidia cards not only consume far more power and space making 4-GPU workstations on normal power supplies and household power impractical but they are also far worse for memory constrained processes. Clearly they are trying to force researchers to buy much more expensive &quot;enterprise&quot; cards for no good reason.')
