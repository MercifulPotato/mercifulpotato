This is not like &quot;doxxing&quot; anonymous Internet trolls or forum users or whatever.<p>&gt; Apple says it didnâ€™t require any channels to be removed. But they demanded to immediately remove any information<p>If they don&#x27;t like published information, they are welcome to sue the people who published it. That is, if they are in cahoots with the US government&#x27;s foreign meddling initiatives.<p>&gt; that discloses someone&#x27;s data on the Internet without the consent of these persons, as well as content aimed at specific people in accordance with the rules of the App Store.<p>Can&#x27;t break the rules of the all-powerful Apple app store, now can we? Tsk tsk tsk.<p>&gt; This refers to the efforts of the Belorussian opposition to &#x27;unmask&#x27; members of the riot police by posting their personal details online.<p>&gt; So what do you do if you are Apple?<p>Exploit my users, perform mass surveillance for the US government, breath down the neck of app makers, produce cheaply with poor employment conditions in China, and manipulate the media to fawn over me. That is, if I were Apple.<p>Luckily I&#x27;m not Apple and neither are you, so don&#x27;t think about what you would do in a place in which you should never get to.')
