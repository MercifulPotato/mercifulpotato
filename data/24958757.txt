The world without IP laws might not look like the FLOSS dream world where everything is free, but more like a world where source code is treated like a major trade secret, where the engineers can&#x27;t even access code they wrote themselves outside of specially designated rooms. Something that Google has, giving most proper engineer employees access to petabytes of source code would be unthinkable.<p>If no IP laws existed, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to build many software businesses. Yes, people would still want folks to build custom software for them, manage computers, etc, and you could still charge hourly rates, because it&#x27;d still be work. But overall the demand for software engineers would be lower I think, which would mean less money for them.')
