Or pass through to RHEL&#x27;s with epol disabled? Or RHEL 8 with docker repos disconnected so they can push their podman alternative?&quot;). Losing centos hurts. As soon as you get into basics like drivers or build tools, RHEL quickly goes off the rails, and centos gave a semi-predictable escape hatch.<p>GPU land is directly on this path, so I feel awful for enterprise IT admins we work with who just want to do a good job for their client hospitals, schools, businesses, etc. We help shield them most of the way by reducing the install to just a gpu driver + docker, but those deps still need basic pinned version ranges. RHEL makes getting those hard, and worse, as life happens, make it hard to get the right diagnostic tool versions (gcc 7, ...). It&#x27;s a bad look for a 2020 infra vendor to charge an enterprise for reliable and predictable rollout sw&#x2F;support when RHEL makes it a marathon to get the right major release of base layers like docker&#x2F;gcc&#x2F;drivers. Contrast this to our cloud users, who one-click launch, or our self-managed cloud&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F;etc. ones, who can generally get the right drivers + docker stack up in 10-15 provided commands.<p>Watching the chaos spread into centos makes me even more nervous about critical software relying on RHEL, and we already had to have The Talk with enterprises wanting HPC&#x2F;ML on RHEL before this..')
