For a basic keyboard&#x2F;mouse, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to pay $30 more for the &quot;official&quot; product. I wouldn&#x27;t pay $100 more, but for it seems like there&#x27;s a huge opportunity:<p>* Most mice on Aliexpress sell for $3 or so. I don&#x27;t know the margin, but it&#x27;s less than $3.<p>* I can&#x27;t imaging anyone would hesitate to pay $5 more, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind $30 more.<p>So yeah, off-brand could compete, and I&#x27;m sure students might buy it, but I think on-brand would do better.<p>And in either case, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt. The $3 Aliexpress mouse vendors don&#x27;t have any real IP moat. This is commodity tech.')
