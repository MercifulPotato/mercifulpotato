Item(by='useragent86', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608364597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475665, text='I&#x27;ve mostly given up on HN as a forum for free discussion, because the mods&#x27; endorsement of downvote-for-disagreement results in comments like yours (reasonable, historically informed, advocating liberty and actual human rights) being downvoted to obscurity, while the comments full of manipulative, Orwellian word games (&quot;You don&#x27;t want to take a vaccine?  You&#x27;re refusing basic precautions and infringing upon my human rights!&quot;) are prized.<p>So, while I used to write comments like yours, myself, I don&#x27;t bother anymore.  I&#x27;d have to spend years toeing the line to build up enough karma to not get shadowbanned for it.<p>Anyway, I sign in here to say that I&#x27;m with you.  I think it&#x27;s important to show that this point of view is <i>not</i> the minority view in this country, and maybe even the world, despite all the media does to make it look like it is.<p>It looks like China&#x27;s already started World War 3 in terms of &quot;Unrestricted Warfare&quot; (China&#x27;s term, not mine): financial, biological, psychological, political.  We have to wake up before it&#x27;s too late.')
