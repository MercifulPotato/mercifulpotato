Item(by='useragent86', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608364597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475665, text='I&#x27;ve mostly given up on HN as a forum for free discussion, because the mods&#x27; endorsement of downvote-for-disagreement results in comments like yours (reasonable, historically informed, advocating liberty and actual human rights) being downvoted to obscurity, while the comments full of manipulative, Orwellian word games (&quot;You don&#x27;t want to take a vaccine?  You&#x27;re refusing basic precautions and infringing upon my human rights!&quot;) are prized.<p>So, while I used to write comments like yours, myself, I don&#x27;t bother anymore.  I&#x27;d have to spend years toeing the line to build up enough karma to not get shadowbanned for it.<p>Anyway, I sign in here to say that I&#x27;m with you.  I think it&#x27;s important to show that this point of view is <i>not</i> the minority view in this country, and maybe even the world, despite all the media does to make it look like it is.<p>It looks like China&#x27;s already started World War 3 in terms of &quot;Unrestricted Warfare&quot; (China&#x27;s term, not mine): financial, biological, psychological, political.  Just regarding COVID, they told the world COVID wasn&#x27;t infectious between people, they held a 40,000-person potluck dinner in Wuhan while the virus was spreading and then let people travel out of the city, they threatened to turn ships around and withhold masks and medicine produced in China...how can anyone look at what China&#x27;s done and not recognize their malicious intent?  At the same time, they&#x27;re building up their military around the world, indebting poor African nations, pushing their troops into Nepal and India (and actually killing Indian soldiers)...the list goes on and on.  We have to wake up before it&#x27;s too late.<p>[Of course, the 50 Cent Army is active on HN.  Watch my comment fade away...]')
