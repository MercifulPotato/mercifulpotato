Her natural inclination was to point to where it should go, so I first taught her that the walrus doesn&#x27;t understand pointing or the word &quot;here&quot;, just the directions.<p>Then we started &quot;programming each other&quot; by telling each other where to go, and I introduced doing multiple steps at once (like &quot;step forward 5 times&quot;).<p>My goal wasn&#x27;t literally to teach her to program, but just to introduce that way of thinking, which is pretty different from how we normally think in day-to-day life.<p>She was excited about it, so I got her the Osmo programming kit for iPad. You program a little monster walking around, using physical, scratch-style code blocks. She&#x27;s been excited about programming the monster every day, and is able to (sometimes) do some short programs of a couple blocks.<p>If she learns a bit more, my plan is to show her how to program a simple lego robot with scratch, like one that spins a flag when it sees something pink. I love that idea because with 2 lines of code you can make something really happen in the world, plus she&#x27;ll be able to come up with new ideas for the robot on her own, and learn about the constraints, sensors, and eventually more basic programming logic.')
