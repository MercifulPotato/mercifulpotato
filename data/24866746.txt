The only way to stop a battery fire, which is actually a metal fire, is to permanently suffocate it - usually by dumping heaps of salt, cement or salt on it which melts and so removes oxygen from the fault area - and then, at least for electric cars, to dump the car in a container full of water and keep it there until dismantling, so that the water acts as a thermal buffer to prevent reignition.')
