Because when there is a need to talk synced, we can do it and have just a 15 minute meeting and that&#x27;s all.<p>IRL, it seems like people are reluctant to schedule any block shorter than half an hour and typically go 10-15 minutes longer than scheduled, combined with working in a large area where I might have to walk 10 minutes back and forth to the meeting location.<p>Rarely would any meeting eat less than 1.5 hours of my time.
