If the items were well accepted there, then they were rolled out to the rest of the country.  It&#x27;s where the expression, &quot;But will it play in Peoria?&quot; comes from.<p>This still happens.  Back when Starbucks was still cool, it would roll out new drinks in Chicago and a couple of other cities as test markets, and then later in the rest of the nation if they were successful.')
