If my display is big enough, and the formatting has any importance, I probably want that.<p>Other times, my screen is smaller (phone) or the wrong shape (small laptop), and I&#x27;d rather the text confirm to the device rather than vice versa.<p>Also, sometimes I use my arrow keys to scroll as I read to keep my place (like a line-oriented instead of page-oriented bookmark). So just because the device is capable of it, I don&#x27;t necessarily always want page-oriented original formatting because it might have two-column text to deal with or top&#x2F;bottom margins that serve no purpose for me.')
