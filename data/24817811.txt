Adding it last means it won&#x27;t be used unless other DNS servers are broken.<p>Overall, this behaviour seems like the simplest and most logical fix Samsung could put in place to enable their users to use phones in China.<p>They <i>could</i> have run their own servers (but that would also have privacy issues), or they could have removed captive portal&#x2F;bad network detection, but that probably would have broken some apps and led to unhappy users.<p>I can&#x27;t see any other real fix in this case, and I certainly don&#x27;t see any malicious intent in any of their actions.')
