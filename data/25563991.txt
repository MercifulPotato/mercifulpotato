For one, it&#x27;s conceptually simpler in my mind; you don&#x27;t have to understand Git internals to get this working. Secondly, this lets you pick and choose which config files you want to &quot;install&quot; on a machine.<p>I feel obligated to share my Bash script, dotfiles.sh[1], that accomplishes what Stow does, but with a few tweaks that I found particularly useful:<p>dotfiles.sh targets the user&#x27;s home directory by default (i.e. stow -t $HOME).<p>dotfiles.sh never symlinks directories, only files (i.e. stow --no-folding). (This was the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back and made me roll my own script in the first place.)<p>dotfiles.sh makes backups of local config files and can restore them if you remove your symlinked version.<p>My script is quite old now, and I use it so seldomly I&#x27;m not convinced there aren&#x27;t bugs. YMMV.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevin-hanselman&#x2F;dotfiles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kevin-hanselman&#x2F;dotfiles</a>')
