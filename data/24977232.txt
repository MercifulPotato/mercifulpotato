Too bad they did not care about their host country.<p>Do you have the same expectation of self-sacrificing patriotism from, say, a non-immigrant millionaire (there&#x27;s a lot of those around, especially in booming real estate markets), who sits on a mountain of wealth instead of &#x27;helping their host country&#x27;?
