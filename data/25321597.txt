A global, non-inflationary reserve currency will force nation-states to alter their primary funding mechanism from inflation to direct taxation, which is far less politically palatable.<p>Isn&#x27;t this all backwards? In the past, when it was politically inconvenient not to be able to inflate money, governments abandoned gold-backed money and went to fiat. Wouldn&#x27;t one assume then that the possibility of such profound geopolitical consequences is precisely the reason why governments will not let it become so important?')
