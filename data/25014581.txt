Intel is still the thing to buy if you want minimum glitches.<p>This is kind of a big one, and why I prefer Intel. I can&#x27;t see it continuing, though. Intel will feel pressure to:<p>* spin products to seem even somewhat competitive<p>* reduce their margins on clock speed (historically, they overclocked well because of conservative margins), and run a little too fast&#x2F;too hot<p>* push things out the door before they&#x27;re ready<p>I don&#x27;t care very much about a 50% performance difference, but I do care a lot about stability. If Intel can maintain a quality lead, I&#x27;m likely to keep buying Intel.<p>Few executive teams have that long-term discipline.')
