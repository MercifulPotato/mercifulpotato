Achieving short term gains by shipping jobs offshore was just a necessary thing to &quot;get theirs&quot;.<p>Boeing was once one of many, and now it&#x27;s one of the last.<p>The US will be unable to rebuild that industrial base for the foreseeable future, because the unique combination of the post war boom, the government sponsored head start in the war, and the emergence of new technologies just don&#x27;t exist any more.<p>Jobs going overseas aren&#x27;t the problem, really, so them coming back makes little difference.   The problem is that our huge head start after World War II is gone because it&#x27;s eaten itself, and now we need to start over.')
