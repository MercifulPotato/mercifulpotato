It hoists your original check to the calling function’s signature.<p>I agree with you that this doesn’t really solve the flow problem though: someone still has to decide that the function only receives AuthenticatedUser and not Guest.  That’s not a net gain, it’s just shuffling responsibility around, and it could be a net loss if the calling function does “a bunch of identical things for any user type” and then “this one extra thing if user is authenticated.”  But I’m not a Typescript user or a big fan of complex type systems either.')
