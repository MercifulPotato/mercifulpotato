The only person using the word &quot;defund&quot; is the author. Though interestingly, there is a mention of conservative attacks on programs like sociology, anthropology, minority studies, and gender studies. I assure you that many conservatives really do want to <i>abolish</i> funding for those programs.<p>The second article is a single person using the word &quot;defund&quot; to describe Obama&#x27;s reduction of military spending. Again, somebody using the word to describe somebody else&#x27;s actions.<p>Interestingly, both of those articles are by people who <i>oppose</i> defunding. Perhaps they used that word precisely because it implies &quot;remove funding entirely&quot;, which has an exaggerated emotional impact?<p>In any case, neither example is the same thing as a large social movement using it as a slogan, especially when that movement publishes things like &quot;Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;sunday&#x2F;floyd-abolish-defund-police.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;12&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;sunday&#x2F;floyd-abol...</a><p>When things like that appear in the New York Times, is it so unreasonable for people to take their word for it? Or should we keep insisting that they don&#x27;t really mean it?<p>And before you tell me that that&#x27;s just one person&#x27;s opinion, I&#x27;ll just point out that so were both of your references, and those are the opinions of people who aren&#x27;t even supporters of those movements. The &quot;defund the police&quot; movement has its own people using the term and saying &quot;yes, we mean literally abolish the police&quot;.')
