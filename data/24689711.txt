They take public land who belongs to all and redevelop it into their &quot;dream&quot; whatever it may be, and they do not care at all how it impact other people who previously used that public land or people who live nearby.\nI am not a big fan of these rewilding policies. There are only a few open spaces left where one could previously take a relaxing hike (in Germany). I do not want to have to worry about wolves and bears and bison when I go for a hike in these places. \nI really don&#x27;t see how the benefits outweigh the costs.')
