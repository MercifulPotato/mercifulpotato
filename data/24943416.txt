For example, you can control your desktop with a connected controller on X11, while controllers only work in-game and in Big Picture Mode on Wayland. Xbox One controllers also didn’t work on Wayland last time I checked. I wouldn’t be surprised if features like Remote Play didn’t work yet either because of Wayland protocols’ security model. Controller hotplugging is also a mess. Hopefully Valve gets to these issues in the future, but since Xwayland doesn’t even work with Nvidia GPU’s (more Nvidia’s fault than Wayland’s as I understand it), it could be a while. In any case, I’m quite thankful to Valve for making Linux viable for gaming, and the occasional game I buy now is always purchased through Steam to support their work.')
