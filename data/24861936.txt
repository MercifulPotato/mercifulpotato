I appreciate the kind words.<p>About two dozen people have bought it so far and will get the updates as I build it out. I also gave access for free (at least up through the beta version) to all the people who bought annual Alchemist Camp memberships at the end of last year.<p>That said, if you&#x27;ve watched all my tutorials there will be nothing new in it except the front-end components that still aren&#x27;t done.')
