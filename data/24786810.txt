Smaller companies have their own rendition of this. Which is to say, we have a specific stack on a specific cloud provider and we use a specific developer workflow with a specific language and framework. And because of this we&#x27;re all highly productive because we don&#x27;t have to think about the tooling, we don&#x27;t argue over design decisions or new things and when we see limitations we start to investigate the next dependency.<p>Pragmatically companies form opinions which differ very much to the &quot;developers need choice&quot; mantra of the industry itself. Choice is the enemy of productivity. Google maintained a single platform called Borg that ran self contained binaries and required you to use the Google-3; c++, java or python. Internally the majority of systems looked the same and everything was consumed with RPC apis using Stubby that&#x27;s now open source as gRPC.<p>Explicit decisions and doing less makes us all more productive. The iPhone did that for mobile. Cloud is waiting for an industry standard.')
