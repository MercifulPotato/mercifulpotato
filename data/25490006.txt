I started out paying them $30&#x2F;mo for 10 mbps and now pay $25&#x2F;mo for 25 mbps. Their &#x27;regular prices&#x27; are ridiculous, but I just call them once a year and ask for a discount (and sometimes say I&#x27;ll leave) and they find a discount if I commit to a year. There isn&#x27;t any competition where I live, so I don&#x27;t mind.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to know if others in SV (or elsewhere) have seen effective prices (not just nominal rack rates) increasing.<p>For the record, I don&#x27;t love Comcast and have even written blog posts about how much I dislike them. But in terms of pricing, I&#x27;ve had an OK experience over a long period of time.')
