People have stopped reading traditional forms of interpersonal communication, so my only way to get messages out to friends is through platforms like Facebook.<p>Unfortunately, Facebook themselves like to play gatekeeper on what my friends see and don&#x27;t see, which I personally think is unethical. For example, if I post something about the election, its visibility may be restricted among my friends, so I need to do all kinds of Unicode upside-down tricks to prevent Facebook from even knowing my post is about the election. If I post a Youtube link instead of a Facebook video, Facebook downranks it because Youtube is a competitor, and downranks it to the point that friends don&#x27;t actually see it. Sometimes they downrank text only posts to the point that I need to include e.g. a cat picture to get Facebook to give it the proper visibility.<p>I once posted to my feed something about donating to a particular disaster relief NGO, only to be censored out by Facebook because they mostly censor external links (only a small fraction of friends actually see them). No friends saw it in the first hour in their feed. I asked several and they didn&#x27;t see it in their feed. Fishy, eh? I delete the post and re-post the same thing saying &quot;Google for XYZ to find the donation website&quot; instead of an actual link and BAM 40+ likes in the first hour and several friends donated.<p>Personally I think this corporate censorship is unethical. It&#x27;s okay for Facebook to play the ranking game with business-sponsored media but definitely NOT okay with them doing that between friends who have mutually agreed to follow each other. I&#x27;m okay with a &quot;popular posts&quot; section on top of everything else, but the &quot;everything else&quot; really must include <i>every single post</i> of all of the people I have chosen to be friends with unless I specifically tell them to mute a particular person&#x27;s content.<p>Ironically, WeChat doesn&#x27;t engage in <i>this</i> type of censorship. They obey government censorship, but besides that, I can guarantee on WeChat that a post that I make that passes the government test will be seen by every single contact if they happen to be looking at the feed. I much prefer that model, rather than Facebook&#x27;s sporadic random non-transparent censoring.')
