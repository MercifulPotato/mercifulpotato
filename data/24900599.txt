The capability for broad, fast, collective action has been all-but wiped out, even in the supposedly enlightened and well-run countries of Western Europe. The nations that defeated fascism are crippled by a far weaker threat.<p>I can&#x27;t think of another liberal democracy besides NZ that has handled COVID well, and they are a small island country.
