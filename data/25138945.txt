That she&#x27;s returning home from school at 6:30! The author didn&#x27;t give their daughter&#x27;s age, but we can assume it&#x27;s right before 14, so maybe 12-13. I&#x27;m in high school, and I take a couple HL IB classes, school always gets out for me at 3, and then I do cross country until 5. That is already a long day. Then I go home, eat, do homework, and depending on the workload it could be anywhere between 8:00-12:00. Finally I&#x27;m able to go to bed, and redo the whole thing. I am a high schooler, and I&#x27;m taking high level classes for credits in college. The author&#x27;s daughter is probably a middle schooler.<p>The issue is the daughter doesn&#x27;t have time to be creative. I program, edit videos, etc., but all of that I have to save for the weekends. The daughter probably doesn&#x27;t have the energy to be creative and just uses their phone during some downtime.<p>With my generation we are not always on our phones like many would believe. Pre-covid we would gather and talk after school, during lunch, in class. If I went with my friends to lunch it is acceptable to check your phone but we would never find it acceptable to be on your phone the whole time.<p>The issue is probably not the daughter, but the workload.')
