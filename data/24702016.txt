A warrant authorizes <i>law enforcement</i> to search for and&#x2F;or seize evidence (i.e. physical property) without regard for the owner&#x27;s property rights. The owner doesn&#x27;t have to give them anything or aid the search in any way beyond simply not interfering. Standing back and leaving them to break into the safe on their own does not violate any law. You might open it anyway just to show goodwill and avoid damage to the safe, but there is no obligation to do so, and unnecessarily demonstrating that you have the <i>ability</i> to open the safe may, in certain situations, amount to testifying against yourself.')
