(I&#x27;m not convinced that no-code is a great thing just yet...but not because of the tools, rather the mindset...so we&#x27;ll see how the next generation adopt these no-code tools...or not).  Within these transformations, the premise of &quot;no code&quot; is becoming bigger and more popular...so if you&#x27;re not seeing it yet, you will soon enough more and more. Not that my following note is a large representation, but when i was applying for a new job during latter 2019&#x2F;early 2020, over 90% of the jobs that i applied to made mention of some sort of &quot;digital transformation&quot;, and no-code&#x2F;low-code goes part and parcel with those types of efforts.  Again, low volume of data, and biased towards mid- and large-sized enterprises...but, it is a thing for sure.')
