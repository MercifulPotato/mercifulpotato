Item(by='VikingCoder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610140733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25689149, text='It&#x27;s honestly worth going through election monitoring training in your state to find the answers to these questions.<p>&gt; And, is this process identical (in design, and confirmed practice) for all states<p>No, of course not.  The elections are run, independently, by each State.  By design, the rules are different.  Because we are a Federal government, made of multiple States.  This is on purpose.<p>&gt; Reality itself, and human measurements&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;&quot;facts&quot; about reality, are distinct entities. Related, but different.<p>Yes, and it is only rational to have beliefs based on evidence.  And we live in a system of laws expressing how that evidence is to be gathered, evaluated, and decided upon.<p>This week, a ton of people rejected that process, because they FEEL like they can&#x27;t trust it, proposing nothing to replace it instead.<p>&gt; It may be &quot;possible&quot;, but is it practical?<p>Voting irregularities are investigated, yes.<p>&gt; Is the current approach perfectly optimal, or could it be improved?<p>Perfect is the enemy of good.<p>And we&#x27;re discussing THIS election.  I welcome a different discussion about improving the process for future elections.<p>&gt; Did we spot check any ballots?<p>Yes.  Please inform yourself.  The information is available.<p>&gt; How much evidence do we have that demonstrates or suggests that there precisely zero anomalies anywhere in the system<p>You can&#x27;t prove a negative.  Literally, you cannot.<p>We mitigate the risks.  We look for evidence of wrong-doing.  And when we can&#x27;t find it, we look harder.  We think about designing a process that is as good as possible, we enact laws, and we move on.<p>&gt; Only if your premises are flawless.<p>I propose a method to gather evidence and evaluate it.  A system of laws.  We have that.  We do that.  It is not flawless.  It is what we have.  Improving that system by proposing better processes and laws is wonderful.  Rejecting that process by violently storming the Capitol building, smearing feces on the wall, and murdering a police officer, is not wonderful.<p>&gt; The above questions.<p>I don&#x27;t think you asked any interesting questions.  You asked questions that indicate you have not invested much time in researching them, and you asked epistemological questions.  Neither were very constructive, for the current election, in my opinion.<p>&gt; Also, it&#x27;s probably worth pointing out that neither of us (or a combination of us) are guaranteed to have 100% comprehensive knowledge of all possible points of failure.<p>I don&#x27;t propose that I do.  I propose that we have a system of laws, and courts, and checks and balances, and a Fourth Estate (the media), to helps us evaluate possible points of failure and prosecute wrong-doing.<p>&gt; Do any comprehensive conclusions logically (and inevitably) follow from this event,<p>She doesn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s talking about.  That is a logical conclusion.<p>&gt; I would expect that someone was assemble a FAQ or Wiki of some sort that laid out the details<p>There are literally hundreds of books, hundreds of web pages, hundreds of explanations, millions of hours of explanation.<p>Here&#x27;s a 31 minute long video from Georgia alone:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;04&#x2F;953321408&#x2F;georgia-election-official-dont-let-misinformation-suppress-your-own-vote" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;04&#x2F;953321408&#x2F;georgia-election-of...</a>')
