I recall one trip where the only chicken products available was party wings. Other times, other staples were missing. There were always substitute goods available (other than TP, I think bidets sold out, too), but with a little imagination, it could have been a lot worse.<p>I imagine people who experinced delays in their staple foods (or TP) that impacted them negatively are going to build a larger buffer for the future.')
