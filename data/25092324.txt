But after reading reviews I think it is just not ready and will not be an alternative to Android and iOS any time soon. There are just too many bugs.<p>Linux for mobile is also not an alternative. Since there are so many apps missing it can&#x27;t be compared with Android and iOS. Well at least for me this includes some banking apps that make my life just so much easier.<p>The only real options right now are the Android forks like LineageOS I think.')
