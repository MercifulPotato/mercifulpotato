I&#x27;m cooking, coding, reading, watching youtube. This year has been &quot;great&quot; for me. Of course I would have liked more comfort, some foods I can&#x27;t affort but, but I&#x27;ve got a good bed, a good chair, an excellent desk, good cooking knives, an ereader with a practically infinite supply of free books, computers and hard drives (hidden) everywhere in my 20m². I write the kind of code I like to write, I&#x27;m not accountable to anyone. (not anonymous you can try to name search me to cross check)<p>I estimate I&#x27;d need about 30k€&#x2F;y to be able to not skip on anything I&#x27;d want to do.
