I think &quot;successor ideology&quot; is an apt if awkward stand-in term, because it focuses on the project as an attempt to ideologically present &quot;the next stage&quot; or replacement for liberalism:<p><i>No one has yet decided on the name for the force that has come to unseat liberalism. Some say it’s “Social Justice.” The author Rod Dreher has called it “therapeutic totalitarianism.” The writer Wesley Yang refers to it as “the successor ideology” — as in, the successor to liberalism.</i><p><i>At some point, it will have a formal name, one that properly describes its mixture of postmodernism, postcolonialism, identity politics, neo-Marxism, critical race theory, intersectionality, and the therapeutic mentality. Until then, it is up to each of us to see it plainly. We need to look past the hashtags and slogans and the jargon to assess it honestly — and then to explain it to others.</i><p><i>The new creed’s premise goes something like this: We are in a war in which the forces of justice and progress are arrayed against the forces of backwardness and oppression. And in a war, the normal rules of the game — due process; political compromise; the presumption of innocence; free speech; even reason itself — must be suspended. Indeed, those rules themselves were corrupt to begin with — designed, as they were, by dead white males in order to uphold their own power.</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tabletmag.com&#x2F;sections&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;stop-being-shocked" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tabletmag.com&#x2F;sections&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;stop-being-...</a>')
