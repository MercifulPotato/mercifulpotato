We are part of the universe. So to say people are subjective or that imagination is imaginary or that reality is an illusion for the purpose of dismissing them from reality is all wrong. You need a model that is more inclusive that describes it all with physics as the premise. For example, a dream requires a sleeping biological brain full of memories drawn from physical experiences.<p>Truth isn&#x27;t reality itself in the physical sense. But the word &quot;apple&quot; isn&#x27;t an actual apple either in the physical sense. Yet, for the purposes of language, it is. And that is the exact extent to which truth is reality in language. When we claim truth, we claim to be making a statement of reality. If that statement includes God, then your reality includes God. If it includes only physical evidence, then your reality is based on physical evidence. We can align our realities scientifically by aligning them with science. But again, based on your life, your work, and your beliefs, your reality will deviate. That&#x27;s just part of what makes us all unique.<p>But as you say, our unique realities are still valuable and real. Though error prone as they may be, they are real reality drawn from a real life. It&#x27;s not separate just because they contradict. That&#x27;s why our ability to communicate our truths is cital, and Free Speech is sacrosanct.')
