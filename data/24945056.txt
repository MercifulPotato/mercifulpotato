Was it heads or tails? Two photons escape the black hole, both spin-up* with 50% probability -- they each appear to carry no information about the coin. But suppose that if they are the &#x2F;same&#x2F; spin, then the coin was heads, and if they are &#x2F;different&#x2F; spin then the coin was tails. In this way the coin&#x27;s information is not destroyed, but is also not carried by any individual photon.<p>* I have no idea if spin is actually the property of the radiation that carries the information.<p>I also get the impression that it is later photons that must somehow be entangled with earlier ones. That -- referring to that V-shaped curve -- the black hole is storing up information about what went in up to about the halfway point in time, which it later radiates away during the second half.<p>Waiting for an actual physisict to chime in, as, disclaimer, I don&#x27;t actually know anything about this.')
