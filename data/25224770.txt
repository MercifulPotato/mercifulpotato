The distinction between the 3 brains is not necessarily supported by physical evidence, other than the fact that avoidance nets tend to stay in the lower brain, while approach start there and end up in the upper brain<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;&gt; decisions are mostly taken by the subconscious, our conscious mind is mostly a witness with some influence.<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;&gt; spot on the counselling - the goal is to move from avoidance schemas to approach schemas.<p>Happy to provide further info')
