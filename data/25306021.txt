I have zero background in medicine or biology after high school. I barely understand the difference between virus and bacteria.<p>I read a lot of articles which dismiss anti-vaxxers as morons and anti-science, I have first hand seen the immense benefits a vaccine like polio vaccine has brought to India so I am all for more vaccines.<p>But what is the standard of evidence that X vaccine won&#x27;t cause some harm to me ? Is is more formal proof but looking at the molecular structure of he virus, vaccines human biology and proving that only possible effect is on new anti-bodies and it won&#x27;t bring any harm ? Or this is more about just ensuring vaccine meets FDA&#x27;s guidance ?<p>I have lot more faith in science but next to no faith in FDA, CDC and other government bodies.')
