There was a brief bold attempt with the Samsung Galaxy Camera[1] to mate a decent camera with the Android OS &amp; bring the well-known development environment, but it didn&#x27;t take off. I still think this is the best chance camera folks have to be relevant, but there needs to be a bigger base of developer know-how incubated &amp; grown. Starting expert communities is hard.<p>Meanwhile, it turns out Sony&#x27;s modern cameras actually do run Android, they just don&#x27;t expose it. There are some really neat apps, for time lapse, for uploading to photo services, for a bunch of random itch-scratch wants&#x2F;needs built atop this. It&#x27;s all unofficial apps. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much work done with video &amp; video streaming, which is where, I think a lot of the ubicomp&#x2F;ubiquotous &amp; pervasive computing currents wants &amp; needs are. But this is, from what I can see, one of the most interesting &amp; open places for playing with media, short of buying an Android phone &amp; relying on it&#x27;s sensors.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samsung_Galaxy_Camera" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Samsung_Galaxy_Camera</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ma1co&#x2F;Sony-PMCA-RE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ma1co&#x2F;Sony-PMCA-RE</a>')
