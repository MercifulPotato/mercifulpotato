The performance of a turbine Beaver is also not as much of an improvement as a converted Otter.<p>Margins on transportation flights are thin.  Margins on flightseeing are not.  The company I worked for chartered a Beaver between $600-$700 an hour and a turbine Otter at double that.  Seats for 45-minute flightseeing (through a national monument) were priced at $185-$250.  6 pax in an Beaver and 10 in an Otter.')
