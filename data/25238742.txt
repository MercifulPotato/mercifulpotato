And I have been in the tech industry for a long time. So keep beating that dead horse, or beat it in a different way.<p>&gt; Not to mention that no one is getting &quot;cancelled&quot; here.<p>Some people are trying very hard. NYT article seems like a smear campaign as part of that overall effort.<p>&gt; cancel culture doesn&#x27;t exist as you describe even.<p>In my experience, it does. I personally know many other people for whom it does. Maybe your bubble is very thick? Maybe people are not honest and open with you because you are highly opinionated and based on this comment, not open to an open dialog?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m simply tired of this.<p>If you keep communicating the same way as in this comment, you will keep getting tired. I don&#x27;t think cancel culture, SJWs or suppression of uncomfortable viewpoints are going to stop anytime soon, nor the secret revulsion of these trends.')
