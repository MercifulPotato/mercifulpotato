However that&#x27;s a different event to the occasional lower but prolonged packet loss which occurs infrequently and usually on a more idle line; which I believe to almost certainly be caused by something beyond my equipment. Knowing how OpenReach operate (who manage our largest internet infrastructure) it&#x27;s a fairly safe assumption that it&#x27;s a fault they&#x27;ve introduced somewhere.')
