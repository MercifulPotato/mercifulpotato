Very attached and at the same time detached character. I like the noir style desperation in these book. Also like to drop Lew Archer here. &#x27;The Ivory Grin&#x27; is so depressing it is sometimes hard to stand. But I like this somehow. Makes my own little world seem very colorful and cheerful. I&#x27;m not into the lofty superiority of Holmes and other. Not as a book. As a movie I find it quite entertaining, though.')
