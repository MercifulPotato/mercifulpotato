I&#x27;d work on reducing stress on the job. If there are specific causes, a decent manager should be able to help. If that doesn&#x27;t work, try something else! If you&#x27;ve worked in tech for 8 years, you&#x27;re pretty hireable, so there are lots of other opportunities. Part-time work is also an option.<p>It&#x27;s also not the best time to retire like that. Interest rates are historically low, stock prices are nominally high, the way covid plays out is up in the air, and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on the value of the dollar isn&#x27;t clear.')
