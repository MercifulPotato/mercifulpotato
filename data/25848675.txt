The only ones I&#x27;ve seen written up have been:<p>1. Instructions to change the memory ordering mode, which allows Rosetta2 to skip some expensive memory fences when translating x86 binaries to ARM.<p>2. Some instructions for matrix math.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t expect either of these to affect typical usage or battery life much, unless your workflow involves running things that do a ton of matrix math.')
