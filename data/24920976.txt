Think about a RESTful frontend providing UI to a (mutable) database holding the state, the database conceptually <i>is</i> the &quot;core&quot; of the program, but in parlance of the architectures discussed here it would be in the &quot;shell&quot;.<p>It is a bit confusing, unfortunately, and it&#x27;s one of the things I dislike about this classification scheme.')
