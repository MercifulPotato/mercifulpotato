It alters election results; look at the Georgia governor&#x27;s race in 2018 for a recent egregious example. The US is continuing a proud tradition of disenfranchisement â€” from only giving voting rights to white men at the country&#x27;s inception, to poll taxes, Jim Crow laws, felon disenfranchisement, gerrymandering, voter IDs.<p>This is an important issue, and I can&#x27;t fathom dismissing an article about it as &quot;sensationalism&quot;.')
