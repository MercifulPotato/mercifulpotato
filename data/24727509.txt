If you&#x27;re incompetent, you are still afforded a vote. And you sleep on the bed you make.<p>and in any case, the incompetence voter implies that they could be voting &quot;wrong&quot;. This is a deep and insidious implication because implying something can be wrong also implies the other &quot;competent&quot; voters are &quot;right&quot;. The very notion that one side is &quot;right&quot; is very anti-democratic.')
