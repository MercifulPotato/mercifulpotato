Most code what they write doesn&#x27;t even work or they don&#x27;t know yet how to approach problems.<p>- Normal &#x2F; mid-level: developers who can easily find working solutions to problems, but not always the best or easy to understand. Should be able to handle edge cases and errors properly.<p>- Senior: How to solve problems is not even a question for them, they can come up with multiple ways solving the same problem, but their chosen solution will be flexible, easy to understand (even for Juniors) and maintainable in the long term. When they make a technical debt, it is a conscious decision and not a fatal mistake.')
