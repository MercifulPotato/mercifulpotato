It&#x27;s not clear to me that his &quot;hypergraph&quot; imposes <i>any</i> constraints on what can be encoded. This at once makes it intriguing from a mathematical perspective, and completely useless as a physics theory, in the same way that epicycles can model a planet with an orbit shaped like Homer Simpson&#x27;s head.<p>I am not surprised that Wolfram thinks FTL is possible - the real question is, is there anything he thinks is <i>impossible</i>?')
