At that point, the main system&#x27;s protection was still in place.<p>- Hotz, after seeing the spotlight on Sony for removing &quot;Other OS&quot;, was able to breach the main system&#x27;s protection without any hardware modification.<p>- Sony went after Hotz for breaching their OS.<p>The bottom line was business -- providing full hardware support of &quot;Other OS&quot; would let you distribute Linux games without Sony&#x27;s blessing (and cut of revenues or developer kits), which ultimately wouldn&#x27;t be as successful without the absolutely massive marketing and deal-making abilities of one of these platform holders.  On the other hand, breaking the main system OS allowed things like pirated games and unsigned code (game hacks) to run on the system, which is hugely problematic for a console that had most of its security on the client machines.  The big PSN hack in 2011 followed shortly after Hotz broke the system, and while I&#x27;ve never seen it 100% confirmed, there were rumors at the time that the hack revealed enough of a vector inside the network that the hackers were basically unstoppable.')
