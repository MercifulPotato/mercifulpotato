The vast majority of open source projects seem to be by one person. How many zero-star projects are there on GitHub? Half the libraries I use on a regular basis are authored by one person.<p>I think you are conflating <i>contribution</i> with <i>direction</i>. I&#x27;d argue most successful OSS projects have strong direction led by a small team. Postgres core. Python&#x27;s BDFL, while it lasted. Even projects like Git have people like Junio, who are wonderful and knowledgeable and without which the project wouldn&#x27;t even be remotely the same.<p>&gt; These games had very specific artistic visions, and I’m not sure how you’d execute that.<p>There is no requirement for consensus-driven democratic decision making for a project, so I really don&#x27;t get why you feel this way.<p>One of the first projects I contributed to was BZFlag, a game.<p>What about Colossal Cave Adventure? Rogue? Nethack? Hell I spent probably a few dozen hours playing Tux Racer since it&#x27;s release.')
