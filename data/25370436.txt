Yeah seems close.<p>There is something seriously wrong with the republican party watching the destruction of core values -- I for one will never vote for them again.  But I guess folks like me who were life long republicans until Trump are just silly dems.<p>The fact that Trump has the party on a leash is just insane.   Republicans watching idly as he actively subverts all norms of transfer of power and millions choosing to grasp at theories that would be espoused by drunkards on city corners 5 or 6 years ago is insane.')
