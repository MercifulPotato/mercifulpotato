It was a cool idea targeted at high school and college football teams.<p>He wanted to stay in DC, and had the talent he wanted there.  His app was high-quality, and he ended up getting an investment from a VC.  The VC was based in SF.  My buddy didn&#x27;t want to move there, but the VC made the investment contingent on him relocating to SF, because that&#x27;s where the VC lived.<p>He made the move.  He immediately noticed that he had to pay far more for people who weren&#x27;t any more productive or talented than what he had in DC.  His biggest gripe was that the turnover was a lot higher, and he was often getting people who seemed to have lower aptitude for their roles.<p>Apparently, VC&#x27;s requiring relocation to SF is a common thing, and I suspect that it&#x27;s part of the reason so much is concentrated there.')
