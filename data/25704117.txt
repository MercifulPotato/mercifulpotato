While gross margin is useful in some industries, it isn&#x27;t useful for many companies discussed on HN, and you can&#x27;t compare gross margins across industries. When people say &quot;Walmart has a thin profit margin&quot;, they&#x27;re not referring to Walmart&#x27;s ~25% gross margin, they&#x27;re referring to their ~3% net margin. (Apple&#x27;s net margin is ~18%, gross margin ~38%)<p>If you&#x27;re looking deeper into a business&#x27;s financials, gross margin can be a useful metric, but for the layman gross margins are usually used for misleading purposes. For example, gross margins can be easily Tweeted to make the point that &quot;this evil business is making money hand over fist by selling xyz&quot;, or to indicate that a business is doing better than it actually is (Uber and WeWork, for example, have positive gross margins.)<p>If you want to know the number representing how much Walmart paid for that chair vs how much you paid, you want to know the &quot;markup&quot;. Markup is the difference between the cost of something and the price it is sold for. Confusingly enough, this is represented in different ways in different industries: some represent it as a fixed amount, some as a percentage of the total cost, and some as a percentage of the selling price. If you buy widgets for $4 and sell them for $8, your markup is $4: either (8-4)&#x2F;8 = 50% of selling price, or (8-4)&#x2F;4 = 100% of cost.<p>Markup as a percentage of cost can range from several hundreds of percent (luxury goods) to ~15% (grocery stores.) Restaurants usually mark up food around 60% and drinks around 75%-400% (markup 300% of cost = $6 beer that cost $1.50.) &quot;Keystone&quot; pricing is when the markup is equal to the cost (meaning the ring on sale for $10k cost them $5k) - and is common in many industries including the jewelry industry, although fancier jewelers charge far more and budget sources charge less. Car dealerships, funny enough, have a lower markup than people might expect, between 2 and 5% of cost for economy base-model cars and 15% for high end cars. You can add in a few more % when you start to additional features to the car. (Dealerships these days often make most of their money through financing, service, accessories, warranties, and selling used cars.)<p>It&#x27;s very interesting to see historically high markups evaporating with direct-to-consumer sites like Aliexpress. But I&#x27;ve rambled enough in this comment already :)')
