Clearly, the problem with design patterns is that clueless developers have no idea what they are talking about, thus they mount incomprehensible complains that make no sense if you&#x27;d understood the basics.<p>Developing software is a complex endeavor that is much more than declare variables and nest control statements. There is way more to developing software than what is covered by a &quot;intro to language X&quot; or &quot;learn framework Y&quot; blog post.<p>If a programming language gives you brick and mortar, you start to talk about retaining walls and windows and stairs. If a programming language gives you gears and screws and bearings and springs, you start to talk about pumps and differentials and dampers.<p>So what&#x27;s hard to understand in needing design patterns to talk about components and solutions to common problems?')
