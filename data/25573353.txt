I actually would usually prefer a bookmarklet if it wasn&#x27;t for a lack of keyboard shortcut.<p>I use raindrop.io and notion, and before seeing the shortcuts, I didn&#x27;t use them much. It was also kind of the reason why all my previous tentatives to use a cloud bookmark service didn&#x27;t go well.<p>The second reason is how accessible it is to click on a bookmark. On the browser you have the bookmarks bar, so at least for your top bookmarks, there&#x27;s no way to beat it. But  for everything else, as long as I can setup the page as my new tab page - or the extension having a shortcut to open the full page - it&#x27;s also great')
