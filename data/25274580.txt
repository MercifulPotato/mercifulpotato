Where can we read about it?<p>&gt; E.g. see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;EczW2IWdnOM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;EczW2IWdnOM</a> from June around the one hour mark.<p>What are you referring to, where exactly in there?  I poked &quot;around the one hour mark&quot; and didn&#x27;t stumble across it, but am not gonna watch the whole thing.  It&#x27;s over an hour of somebody talking at a camera.<p>Does an offhand comment buried in the middle of a 90-minute youtube ramble really strike you as appropriate notification of such an important requirement?  Especially when this requirement doesn&#x27;t appear anyplace where it can be <i>read</i>?')
