It&#x27;s part of the agreed price, not something I voluntarily add. The &quot;price&quot; is what I can pay and still return.<p>It’s effectively a part of the agreed transaction. I understand the mechanics of it, but it’s extremely weird to me (who isn’t American). I’d be fine with service charges of almost any level. Also if it said “service charge is 30% - please let us know if you aren’t happy with the service and we’ll remove it or compensate you”. That’s fine.<p>What’s important to me is that it’s on the receipt.<p>I wonder how Americans feel paying 0% tip without complaining in Europe (I wouldn’t ever complain and possibly not come back).')
