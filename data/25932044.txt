It&#x27;s much more expensive and harder to find used, but when you buy direct from HermanMiller you get a free return period so it&#x27;s a risk free trial.<p>To me the Leap <i>was</i> comfortable and wasn&#x27;t bad, but just didn&#x27;t feel 100% right. The Embody is just perfect. 100% worth the cost. And the materials&#x2F;construction also feel much more premium.<p>There are plenty of reviews on YouTube as well as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.szynalski.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.szynalski.com&#x2F;</a>, but ultimately you can&#x27;t be sure unless you sit in one yourself - every person will find the fit and comfort to be different. SteelCase Leap v2 &amp; SteelCase Gesture and HM Embody seem to be the top three. HM has a 15% off sale in the summer and end of year.')
