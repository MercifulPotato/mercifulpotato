Item(by='Enginerrrd', descendants=None, kids=[24948480], score=None, time=1604108554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24948378, text='&gt;2) Nobody has the right to own an asset for pennies on the dollar indefinitely<p>That&#x27;s a ridiculus assertion.  When I buy something, having paid income tax and the government gets paid the taxes on the sale, why should I have to permenantly rent that item from the government?<p>If that logic applied to you car and computer and clothes, and prized heirlooms from your family, I think you&#x27;d object.  Thats a fundamental assault on freedom and property rights.<p>Taking it to the extreme, it means ONLY the very wealthy could ever own things like land and that is just a fundamentally unamerican idea.')
