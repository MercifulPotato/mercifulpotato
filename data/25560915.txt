Item(by='cf100clunk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609175585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560695, text='In my early twenties I read that the human eye naturally tracks laterally in a jerky motion and that using a cursor helps train the eye to follow sentences smoothly over a book&#x27;s pages. It was postulated that the gaps caused by the jerkiness were sapping the speed of information intake and that the smoother motion allowed larger batches of information to be &quot;gulped&quot;. I began using a simple coffee stir stick. After a few months of initially difficult adjustment my speed reading superpower was born, which served me very well through university and my career. I recall sadly that my early school teachers used to scold kids who used their fingers, pencils, etc. to read. Those kids were onto something and lost a valuable life skill, I think.')
