I do 2) a lot; most of my friends from college are not software engineers and I don&#x27;t want any of my friends to be &quot;priced out&quot; of hanging out. I usually try to do it in a subtle way (eg, spend $30 on pizza, not mention what it really cost, and ask everyone for one or two dollars), not sure if that makes it more or less awkward. 3) and 4) I agree with, though I never find myself in a situation where that would be relevant.<p>I do 1) differently. I was more generous in the past, but some people took advantage of that. I&#x27;ve also come to feel that simply giving money jeopardizes the peer relationship. instead, I now give any friend who asks a 0% interest loan with no due date. no questions asked, but I do keep track (roughly) of how much I&#x27;ve lent out to each person. I never say anything about it, but if they hit $1000 or so, I start saying no to further requests. I guess this probably violates the spirit of your policy, but I prefer this approach over having to decide yes or no for each individual request.')
