My public sector clients esp. have a hard time buying any Saas as each one involves finding vendors, getting it approved, setting up payment, etc etc etc.  obv they have a whole procurement department for that, but I could see their job being easier if all their aws, azure, and smaller saas came on one bill.  The organization would still need to handle compliance and be sure POs were valid, fair pricing, no conflicts,  etc. but do that against one vendor instead of 100.  It would be difficult to get right though.  Balancing buyer and seller interests while trying to get a cut.  In fact the same org I’m thinking about was recently forced to do all purchasing through a 3rd party vendor and it slowed down and complicated purchasing even more...')
