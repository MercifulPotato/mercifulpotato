Bucketing them into these limiting categories is a gross oversimplification. The different pre-A stages have come about to make it more accessible for founders to start companies.<p>YC started in such a capacity to give smaller checks to more people so that more founders can try something (the seed round). That has honestly democratized the whole game, and I think constricting the different stages to make it seem like there&#x27;s some sort of golden standard is exactly the kind of old guard mentality preventing new founders from getting started even if just with a little bit of money.')
