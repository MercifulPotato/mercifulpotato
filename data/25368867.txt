This is exactly what a futures option gives them - they can offload the risk of price fluctuations (and demand reduction&#x2F;changes) in the future, and someone else can speculate on this (and make more profit, or loss).<p>It seems stupid for a farmer&#x2F;producer to take on this risk, rather than sell these futures.')
