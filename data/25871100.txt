And it isn&#x27;t healthy either. Also mind is not as flexible.<p>Possible solution for any body issues might be frequent exercise and for mind -- working in the morning as suggested in other comments.<p>I&#x27;m working on my project for around 6-7 months already. First couple of months of work was done mostly during weekends and after hours. But recently I had a 2 week Christmas break which I used to work on my side project full-time. This made me realise how much more productive and creative I&#x27;m when I can single-focus on one thing for couple of days in the row. I&#x27;ve redesigned my whole app, it looks and works much better. So in result, a little over one week of work had similar effect to 6 months of working after hours.<p>So perhaps a good solution is just to take days off to focus entirely on your product and use your after hours and weekends to actually rest.')
