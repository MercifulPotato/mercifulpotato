One running hypothesis IIRC is that they intercalate into the membranes and alter their membrane fluidity... Then underpants gnomes... Then &quot;reduced ion channel activity&quot;.  Iirc We know it&#x27;s not something more obvious like &quot;conductivity of the membrane&quot; because that&#x27;s easy to measure and the effect is not enough to explain the observation.')
