Parler absolutely did play a role here due to their repeated and documented refusals to abide by terms and conditions and Apple isn&#x27;t to blame for rumours that bad actors choose to spread.<p>You&#x27;re suggesting that they should refrain from regulating one bad actor which they <i>do</i> control because they would then somehow be responsible for the actions of bad actors which they do <i>not</i> control.')
