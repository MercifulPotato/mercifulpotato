There are valid cases where a subquery can use an ORDER BY, such as when a LIMIT or OFFSET is specified.<p>I&#x27;d go to far to say that unless a query has an ORDER BY it is likely a bug to use LIMIT or OFFSET. In the absence of an ORDER BY the database is free to sort the rows any way it likes, and this could change between versions or based on any number of implementation details. If it appears to sort determinsitically with no ORDER BY it should not be relied upon.')
