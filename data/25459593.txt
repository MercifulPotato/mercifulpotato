It&#x27;s not like the introduction of GDPR in Europe 2 years ago suddenly made all of the shit a marketing dept shoves into Google Tag Manager completely legit and above board.<p>These third parties will take what you give them and _also_ take what they can get from your browser if you&#x27;re embedding their script. Are you going to proxy those scripts as well to stop them getting the user&#x27;s IP address and then geolocating it to grab even more info?<p>The cookie warning banner is bullshit only in the sense that it achieves nothing. Accept it or deny it, it won&#x27;t change a thing. Same with the tracking consent popups: despite the law saying they should be opt-in by default, they&#x27;re still treated as opt-out by default, meaning that all of these sites _still_ collect your data because you&#x27;re <i>blacklisting</i> individual sites from tracking, as opposed to <i>whitelisting</i> them. You need to set a cookie to say that you don&#x27;t want tracking and not thousands of cookies to say you <i>do</i> want it?<p>That&#x27;s being tracked... it&#x27;s all wrong. Literally everything you offer as information, or don&#x27;t offer, is another node in their graph.')
