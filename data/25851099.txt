All Linux distros work by repackaging upstream code, the majority of which is written by volunteers. For Debian, they’re repackaging directly from upstream. Ubuntu repackages from Debian.<p>The value of going through a company is that you can choose to write a check to Canonical or RedHat and say “I’m hitting this issue with the software you repackaged, here is money, fix the problem”. There’s no similarly direct pay-to-win for Fedora or Debian. You can shop around for a consultancy or engineer and pay them to try to debug the issue, but they’re always going to be coming in as a 3rd party, which has an impact on the levers they can pull to resolve an issue.')
