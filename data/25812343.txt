All those angers of people struggling to make survivable wage are valid, but this is barking down the wrong tree.<p>1, people are not stupid, they chose to be exploited by gig companies because other minimum wage jobs pay even less.<p>2, those companies already pay majority of their revenue to drivers, paying more means charging more, which leads to lower market share, which leads to bankruptcy in a winner-takes-all market.<p>I think the only way to pull gig workers out of their precarious position today is to lift the minimum across the board. So there are better alternatives than slaving away at gig jobs, gig companies will naturally provide better wage&#x2F;benefits in order to retain those workers.<p>This can be achieved with basic income or higher minimum wage, but both have holes that require more nuanced design to ensure effectiveness and minimize unexpected side effects. This is sadly very hard, and I&#x27;m not sure if we have the legislators capable enough to do the right thing.')
