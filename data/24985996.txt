The HP printers are constantly fighting me by, e.g., demanding internet access to print, failing to print when HP servers temporarily go down, putting up baffling errors, etc.  The Brother printers just work.<p>The fact that Wirecutter recommended HP when Brother is so clearly superior has forever lowered my faith in their recommendations.')
