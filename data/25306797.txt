[follow-up to the recent depression poll]', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been recently thinking about that poll https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25096877, the state of HN, and the IT industry in general. Most of my friends are code monkeys, just as I am, and I&#x27;ve been talking to them too.<p>Many of them are depressed. Several mentioned something about wanting to kill themselves over the years, but luckily they got help, which keeps them afloat somehow.<p>I was also depressed for a long time. In my case, the reasons were mostly external. 1. I needed money - I come from a more impoverished country - I was working too much, which prevented me from doing what I wanted to do in life.  2. I was not too fond of the place I was living in for multiple reasons. I changed both, + a few months of therapy and a few years of self-development, and I can finally say that I&#x27;m not depressed...<p>So I&#x27;m thinking about this a lot - why are people in IT so miserable? My interactions with people in other fields over the years tell me we are more depressed than, say, graphic designers.<p>The topic of depression interests me a lot in general. So I want to start a discussion here and ask a few questions:<p>1. Why are you depressed?\n2. What would alleviate your depression?\n3. What are you doing to achieve 2?<p>All the best to all of you.')
