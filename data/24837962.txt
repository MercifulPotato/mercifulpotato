I don&#x27;t know how you could even find that many, but if you did manage to do it, you&#x27;d probably end up with an assembly line that would spit out 60 iphones a second.<p>Instead what you might have is a setup where no individual process is getting the attention it truly needs. Each step is probably just barely working because the pressure to get 1000 automation steps working means that as soon as it works even poorly you&#x27;ve got to move on to the next step.')
