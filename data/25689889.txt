The typical BASIC for the 6502 used it. See for example <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackzapple.org&#x2F;scripts_php&#x2F;index.php?menu=14&amp;mod=8517283d55e912b0b5ac842147e28904a4a751d3&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackzapple.org&#x2F;scripts_php&#x2F;index.php?menu=14&amp;mod=8517...</a> (search for “The CHARGET Subroutine”). Here, it is used for speed, too (otherwise, at least one of the functions would have to do an indirect load, which is cumbersome and slow on a 6502. The self-modifying code is a lot faster)<p>It also often was used when one had, say, a function to output a character and another function that printed a specific character. Combined with a creative use of the BIT instruction, one could even have functions printing _any_ character, a space, a question mark, or a CR share their tails (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retrocomputing.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;11132" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retrocomputing.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;11132</a>)<p>But yes, nowadays I guess it is rare, although, with an ABI designed for it, it could be used to make a call with a default argument value fall through into the more generic code)')
