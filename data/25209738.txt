Didn&#x27;t matter if they were responding in between the double taps to help their fellow citizens locate their limbs, recover their loved ones from under the rubble, etc.<p>&quot;If they were drone-striked, its because they were combatants.&quot;<p>Thus, &#x27;Obama killed less civilians&#x27; can be sold.<p>That this was also abused under Trump is not in question.<p>Comparing these two war criminals to each other to find out which was the nicer is an utterly ludicrous exercise.')
