In the case of A Song of Ice and Fire in particular, this vision of the past is particularly worth interrogating because it serves as the basis for a parable on power and violence.<p>I&#x27;ve had conversations with people who believe fiction such as George R. R. Martin&#x27;s is &quot;realistic&quot; and worth examining as if it were a history.  So, yes, apparently it would shock some people.  Yet, no, you should not be shocked.')
