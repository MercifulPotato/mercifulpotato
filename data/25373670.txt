Compare that 28-episode $300 Aniplex of America release to something like the Sentai&#x27;s Shirobako release (24 episodes), which allegedly retails for $90 and is available on Sentai&#x27;s own store for $45. And that&#x27;s not even counting the fact that Shirobako is the better anime of the two.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sentaifilmworks.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;new-releases&#x2F;products&#x2F;shirobako-complete-collection-blu-ray" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sentaifilmworks.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;new-releases&#x2F;pro...</a>')
