You are not expected to use Waypoint and not understand the underlying platform. This is similar to Terraform: you still have to know something like AWS well to use Terraform.<p>With Waypoint, we aren&#x27;t doing any magic, you specifically opt into a Kubernetes plugin for example. If something goes wrong, you&#x27;ll have to understand Kubernetes. Waypoint isn&#x27;t trying to replace that, we&#x27;re just trying to provide a common workflow on top of these platforms (same as Terraform with infra).')
