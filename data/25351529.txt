I said there is no need for <i></i><i>on ear</i><i></i> computation. I personally even have impulse response profiles for my headphones that I load onto my phone and computer to make them sound much better.<p>For things like on ear sound stage correction, sure. That can be done. You will pay a heavy cost in sound quality, but it can be done. If your goal is sound quality, you&#x27;re not going to be doing anything more that is very latency sensitive than ANC.<p>As for the last point, have fun with your sound streaming device that has 3 bit&#x2F;s of UI bandwidth and a battery life of 1&#x2F;5th that it would otherwise. It&#x27;s not an issue you can fix by trying to fix it in that use case, it&#x27;s an issue you fix by improving human interfaces, battery technology, and cellular technology, which is already being done. When that will be good enough for what you&#x27;re describing, we can talk.<p>As for me, I&#x27;ll enjoy having headphones with high quality and essentially unlimited battery life, and use the carefully optimized interfaces and computational power of my phone and computer to listen to music.')
