Some disruption at the beginning, but fairly easy to account for.  There is already plenty of man made objects that need to be accounted for like the ISS, any of which could cause an issue but it’s a tiny fraction of data that’s impacted and therefore it can be removed fairly easily.<p>That said, amateur astronomers doing long exposure shots will likely be impacted.')
