But they have poor predictive power. From wikipedia:<p><i>Though the MBTI resembles some psychological theories, it is generally classified as pseudoscience, especially as pertains to its supposed predictive abilities. The indicator exhibits significant scientific (psychometric) deficiencies, notably including poor validity (i.e. not measuring what it purports to measure, not having predictive power or not having items that can be generalized), poor reliability (giving different results for the same person on different occasions), measuring categories that are not independent (some dichotomous traits have been noted to correlate with each other), and not being comprehensive (due to missing neuroticism). The four scales used in the MBTI have some correlation with four of the Big Five personality traits, which are a more commonly accepted framework</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indi...</a><p>EDIT: My theory is that Myers-Briggs is more popular among laypeople than Big5 precisely because it&#x27;s less scientific. People feel like  their Myers-Briggs type tells them something non-obvious about themselves. Big5 is so straightforward that it doesn&#x27;t tell them anything they didn&#x27;t know before.')
