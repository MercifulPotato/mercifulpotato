The Russian revolution definitely wouldn&#x27;t have happened without university-educated Lenin and Trotsky, and I&#x27;d say that even Stalin falls under &quot;educated but with no stable job&quot; umbrella (if I&#x27;m not mistaken he had gone to a priest seminary).<p>In my country (Romania) most of the inter-war intellectuals had turned extremists for exactly that reason, i.e. too few white-collar jobs to chase for people who had finished university. The most well-known examples are guys like Eliade or Cioran, but a more relevant one is Corneliu Zelea-Codreanu [1], which is currently well liked by some people in the US [2] and in Northern Italy [3]. A very relevant book on the subject can be found here [4], unfortunately for the time being with no English translation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corneliu_Zelea_Codreanu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corneliu_Zelea_Codreanu</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagotribune.com&#x2F;nation-world&#x2F;ct-charlottesville-college-campuses-20170818-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagotribune.com&#x2F;nation-world&#x2F;ct-charlottesvil...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.repubblica.it&#x2F;cronaca&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;news&#x2F;lealta_azione_documentario_sky-212139492&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.repubblica.it&#x2F;cronaca&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;news&#x2F;lealta_azi...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Limitele-Meritocratiei-Intro-Societate-Romanian&#x2F;dp&#x2F;973465148X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Limitele-Meritocratiei-Intro-Societat...</a>')
