Item(by='AsyncAwait', descendants=None, kids=[25637325], score=None, time=1609791182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636493, text='&gt; Assange tried (at least he claims he tried) to get the US government to help him remove names that it felt should not be released. The US government refused. Which is perfectly understandable: why should the US government tell Wikileaks exactly which names in some leaked documents are the names of actual US government informants? That would be stupid.<p>If that&#x27;s stupid then complaining asking him to redact names without telling him which ones is even more stupid and gives the U.S. no right to complain. Especially when top secret is used to conceal war crimes.<p>&gt; Assange then chose to release all the material anyway<p>Not publishing war crimes because those who commited them refuse to cooperate in redacting names would be a great way for the Pentagon to make sure their crimes stay hidden. In fact it appears that was their goal in not cooperating.<p>&gt; Newspapers, in the same position, did not publish the names.<p>Newspapers were NOT in the same position. They published the leaks but Pentagon started cooperating with them by then.<p>It&#x27;s remarkable that people exposing war criminals get more blame that actual war criminals who did not face any consequences and laughed about while murdering civilians including journalists.')
