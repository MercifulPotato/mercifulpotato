Typically the open source license is chosen to as onerous and scary as possible to force companies to buy the commercial license. And it requires you to hold all the copyrights so that you can relicense it, giving most contributors cold feet. A typical example of this is MySQL or Qt, or the various server-side licenses adopted by MongoDB etc (though those are onerous enough to not be certified open source by the OSI, but the principle remains the same).<p>In a free software product, the code itself is available under an open source license, often one that doesn&#x27;t prevent use by companies. The product is some particular version of the code built, QA&#x27;d, vetted and supported by the vendor. The typical example being RHEL. But in addition to RedHat, this model can be used also by single-product companies.<p>For more detail see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfosc.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;book&#x2F;business-models&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfosc.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;book&#x2F;business-models&#x2F;</a>')
