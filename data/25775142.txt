Item(by='sn_master', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610624003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772643, text='&gt; 80+ million people who voted for Biden would like to have a word with you.<p>The 75 million people who voted for Trump are nothing then? We&#x27;re in a winner takes all society now? Trump lost, yes, but he still got a very substantial vote that gives anyone the right to listen to what he has to say. I also don&#x27;t know if all of the 81 million voters are happy to see the Ayatollah tweets calling death for america, or the china tweets saying the US invented covid and pushed it to china and the rest of the world, in english, straight targeting to naive and gullible Americans.<p>If he says something illegal (which he absolutely did last week), go ahead and put him on trial and impeach or even put him in prison using the law like any other citizen. I am all for that. But when he talks about less industry regulations, about the economy, about reducing drug trafficking and about our military, I do want to hear about that, at least as long as he is a free man by law and still has his 1st amendment rights.<p>&gt; Go to Gab or 4chan then? I don&#x27;t see any issues here, there are always spaces for these &quot;people&quot;.<p>You&#x27;re proving my point. By kicking off moderate opinions into their own forums, these forums become breeding grounds for extremism. Most of Trump voters are against the Capitol events, yet it makes no difference when it comes to discussion, they all get labeled as extremists.<p>Instead of a healthy mix of pro and anti Trump, those forums have nothing except pro-Trump and pro-extremism, because on other forums with intelligent people, like this one, there is nothing allowed except outright anti-Trump. This is not healthy.<p>&gt; So? We all know that &quot;Iran are bad guys&quot;<p>There is no contradiction. You banned Trump because he incited violence against the US government, good! I am all for you!<p>I felt sick to the stomach when I saw the capitol events and never wanna hear anyone supporting them.<p>But, be fair and ban the leaders of other countries who are inciting violence against the US government too. The Ayatollah is directly responsible for thousands of US casualties and fatalities due to his very direct and very public role in funding and supporting the Iraq insurgency in the mid 2000s, and until now his Twitter account is full of very direct anti-US threats.<p>Why should US companies employing Americans on US soil aid in the distribution of such propaganda to US citizens? What other country does anything like that in the world?<p>Does Israel allow neo-Nazi newspapers to be printed and distributed on its soil?<p>Or the Chinese Tweets in the article that were directly saying the US made the coronavirus and sent it to China in produce shipments, or murderers like Farrakhan and OJ be there and share their life like a musical celebrity with fans all over the world.<p>I want Trump getting kicked out of Twitter to be a wake up call to clean up the platform from all sorts of extremisms, rather than a one-off hit that only makes tens of millions angry, frustrated and increases the divide amongst us. I bet you anything, Fox news would have been silent if Twitter kicked off all those others at the same time as part of a &quot;non-extremism&quot; policy enforcement, rather than the selective targeting of one of the most hated (and liked, at the same time, by those 75 million voters at least) political leaders in the US.<p>&gt; It wasn&#x27;t even relevant in the first place to this thread.<p>I had no other way of replying after the thread was flagged, and this is still a political thread about Trump, its as relevant as I can possibly get. HN doesn&#x27;t have private messages or anything of that nature unfortunately. I was saddened when I saw we reached the level of discussion where phrases like &quot;nothing happened, he most likely forgot about it&quot; were being used as an argument on a platform like this, by someone like you, who from your post history clearly knows much better.')
