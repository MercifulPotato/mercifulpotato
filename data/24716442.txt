Check our the teardowns by Sandy Munro. He is not shy of critisizing Tesla, but had nothing bad to say about the suspension.<p>The suspension is the one part in a car, which is easily inspectable by just looking at it. And which has not changed much over time. Any competent mechanic should be able to check it. If there were fundamental issues with Tesla suspensions, the net would be full of reports about it and of course authorities would have acted, but beyond that one crusader against Tesla, no one has claimed they are unsafe. Actually, by most accounts, the Model 3 is one of the safest cars you can buy.<p>However, the suspension of any car is a vital part that is exposed to the outside and exposed to wear constantly. While most electric cars don&#x27;t require much maintenance - Tesla does not have a maintenance plan any more - the brakes and suspension I would have checked by a mechanic at least biyearly, as this is a very important mechanical part you want to be serviced before there is a failure.')
