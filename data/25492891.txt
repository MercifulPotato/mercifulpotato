Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some say it was an engineering master piece of the 1990s. But it was different from everything else and it was difficult, I don&#x27;t think this can be disputed.<p>The no good reason is not the whole truth:<p>* When Symbian (then called EPOC32) was developed there was no C++ compiler that supported exceptions without major problems. &quot;Don&#x27;t use them&quot; was typical in style guides at the time. So EPOC came up with their own macro hackeries instead, which worked when used correctly. The latter was too difficult for many developers.<p>* Early devices had just single digits of megabytes of RAM. So 500 times less than a phone of today. More macro trickeries to save Bytes were the answer.')
