They need to find and convict a suspect to instill confidence from the public that they&#x27;re doing a good job, in order to keep their jobs and their funding. This doesn&#x27;t mean they need to find the actual criminal, only that they need to <i>appear</i> that they did.<p>The more information you have about a person, the more you can present to a jury selective facts about them that make them look guilty. And with enough circumstantial evidence you could make quite a lot of innocent people look guilty, despite having no causal evidence whatsoever. Google is providing circumstantial evidence, not causal.')
