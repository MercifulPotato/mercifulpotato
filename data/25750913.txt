Gets really hot (i7 chip) and quite noisy, touchpad glitches out and gets &#x27;sticky&#x27; randomly, battery seems to often go to a &#x27;plugged in but not charging state&#x27; and the battery life is pretty dire.<p>Machine itself feels nice though and the performance is good.<p>I think my next purchase will be an ARM Macbook if I dare to cough up the dough.')
