And even if you didn&#x27;t use the apps the ease of backup through iTunes was a massive boost.<p>I had Dropbox on my android phones as soon as you could and would tell everyone to do the same, but for android it wasn&#x27;t really until Google photos that photo backup and sharing got as simple and easy.')
