MMS was the only common form of media sharing for loads of users and that really degraded the image quality - I forget the maximum MMS size but it was tiny.<p>The iPhone and the apps actually encouraged people to share their images and explore others in the way that devices before didn&#x27;t. And even if you didn&#x27;t use the apps the ease of backup through iTunes was a massive boost to people accessing and using their images away from their phones.<p>I had Dropbox on my android phones as soon as you could and would tell everyone to do the same, but for android it wasn&#x27;t really until Google photos that photo backup and sharing got as simple and easy. And even recently it still wasn&#x27;t installed on the majority of new phones, and manufacturers pushed their own backup&#x2F;gallery apps that were rarely as good.')
