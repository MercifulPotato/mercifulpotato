It quickly come to &quot;do this, do that and you&#x27;re done&quot;. I need to know the concept before the implementation. I&#x27;m probably lacking some CS background or so.<p>Illustrations in the article just clicked in my head and made me understand what I was not able to understand in other resources (like in the flask mega tutorial written by Miguel Grinberg). I&#x27;ve found explanations before code samples crystal clear and so helpful to review the code.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to be at home to clone the repo and mess with it.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for others but for me, this article is what was missing to go ahead in web dev. Thank you.<p>I&#x27;ve liked so much the illustrations that I&#x27;ve saved them on my smartphone.')
