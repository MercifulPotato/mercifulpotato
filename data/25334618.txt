I&#x27;m skeptical of that leaving.<p>I have seen coworkers and friends leave, but it&#x27;s mostly a housing issue. As people turn 30 and want to have a family if you haven&#x27;t cashed out $5M in some exit event then it sucks to live here. $500k can get you a nice place in CO, $750k for outside Seattle.<p>I have had older friends leave to have a family. They went to Santa Cruz, Seattle, Denver, DC, and Austin. It&#x27;s a shame. The ones that stayed either are very rich where a $5M house is not an issue, or they still live with three roommates and rent without kids.<p>Some other reasons to complain about, but that I don&#x27;t think are usually deciding factors for people to leave:<p>- Bad policy (AB5), Extra founder Tax, Hostility towards tech in general.<p>- Political monoculture (I don&#x27;t mean not enough trump people, I mean it can be controversial to be an obama era moderate&#x2F;neoliberal and &#x27;woke&#x27; politics is hard to avoid).<p>- High state taxes that harm capital gains and new money. This is related to housing and prop13. Not only do the people that live in housing they bought decades ago pay almost no property tax compared to new buyers, they then push to restrict new supply <i>while</i> also pushing to increase tax on new money. This comes in the form of higher capital gains tax (there&#x27;s a bill to raise it to 16.3% this year retroactively, by far the highest in the country). They also push legislation to increase tax on the companies excluding homeowners to fund their services (which indirectly affects the employees again). This kind of thing makes it doubly hard to be able to buy in and live here.')
