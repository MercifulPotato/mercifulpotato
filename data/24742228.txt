They were left with the building caretaker who just signed without checking.<p>We only got one. And IKEA won&#x27;t do anything, because we can&#x27;t prove we didn&#x27;t receive the second one and aren&#x27;t just fraudulently asking for a freebie.<p>Never got these kind of issues with anything sold <i>by</i> Amazon. Only time a package went missing, despite &quot;La Poste&quot; stating the contrary, they just re-delivered it without a fuss.')
