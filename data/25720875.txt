Nothing is preventing them from building stuffs themselves. Even if they and Trump build their own platform, they will have to build their own bare metal server clusters and scatter those across USA. Not to mention they will have to hire and pay actual market salary from DevOps, backend developers, frontend developers, UX designer, testing engineer, security engineer etc. In the end they will burn their money fast just paying those engineers salary building stuffs just for them without the ability to generalize their platform and amortizing the cost like AWS, and they will fold in a few months.<p>There is no way out. Everything is dead end. You want to isolate yourself from your neighbors. Sure, that is fine, go alone if you want to go fast. Just don&#x27;t complain when your neighbors are isolating themselves from you.')
