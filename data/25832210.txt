If I count articles, the short texts from some gossip portal are valued as much as Harvard Business Review, science journal or whatever else, but their value is wildly different. Same goes for books by the way, but effort to <i>finish</i> a book is much higher.<p>I also do not believe reading time stats, as people are not that good on self reporting, especially without hard criteria.<p>The problem is that if you do not read demanding content, your ability to comprehend gets smaller.
