Item(by='klmr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607095885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302513, text='&gt; <i>but realistically most of us need a job before you can learn all of that</i><p>The interview was for a senior position.<p>&gt; <i>Even if you do learn it all, people tend to lose knowledge they don&#x27;t use</i><p>Let me emphasise that my interview was <i>not</i> a knowledge test (and at any rate I don’t study for interviews). I wasn’t expected to know by heart how to implement popcount. The interviewer was trying to see me work. Successfully, I might add. — Another question I got concerned something I had no knowledge of, and I had to derive a solution myself. In fact, I <i>failed</i> to do so, but that didn’t prevent me from getting the job since the interviewer was satisfied with what they observed about my thought process.')
