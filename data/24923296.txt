I can certainly manage user sign-up from the admin tab for the time being. Once it&#x27;s hooked into email, I believe that will make things maintainable again for me.<p>From a UX standpoint it&#x27;s still sub-par. Someone who wants to report an issue doesn&#x27;t want to wait an arbitrary amount of time to be allowed to report an issue. They are ready to report it at that moment.<p>And as an admin, I don&#x27;t want to have to approve new users on a schedule to ensure the delay is low enough that they are still willing to submit the issue after I approve them. I&#x27;d much prefer they go ahead and submit the content, especially so that I can use it in my review of whether to approve the sign up or not.<p>I seem to remember some pattern in Gitlab where my login period timed out before I finished making a comment. When I logged back in, Gitlab had somehow saved my comment content so that I could then post it so that others could see it. Is there any way to use that pattern for users who haven&#x27;t been approved yet? So that they can post content, but with a warning shown to them that other users won&#x27;t see it until the sign-up is approved.')
