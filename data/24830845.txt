Making an effort to maintain financial privacy is not in itself illegal.<p>&gt;&gt;It&#x27;s saying that &quot;Mixing is probably money laundering on its face, no matter where the money came from.&quot;<p>No, money laundering is by definition hiding the origins of illegally obtained money. If the money is not the proceeds of criminal enterprise, then hiding its origins is not, by definition, money laundering.<p>Exercising privacy-protection with respect to legally obtained money may be illegal, or with new laws be made illegal, but it does not and will not ever fall under the definition of money laundering, as that is not the definition of money laundering.')
