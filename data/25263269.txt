It could work for CS-students, which are pre-selected in a way, but I still wouldn&#x27;t teach students that methodically. There&#x27;s just no fun there.<p>For example, I&#x27;m an adult-ADHD developer in my 30&#x27;s and really good at my work. I started programming, by just doing fun things and it&#x27;s only been after few years as a developer, that I&#x27;ve become interested learning more about CS-theory. It&#x27;s hard to be interested in such topics unless you have insight on why such things matter.')
