Something like 200,000,000,000 cpu instructions per second.<p>And we&#x27;re already there. Single core CPU speed has been stagnating for years. We used to get ~1.5x performance boost every 2 years. Today&#x27;s CPU&#x27;s are only twice as fast as designs from a decade ago.<p>Everything is going parallel, which buys us some time. But long term, I think the biggest factor will be &quot;slow&quot; programming languages going extinct.<p>When you can&#x27;t depend on CPU performance constantly increasing, companies will look elsewhere. The 10-50x speed difference in programming languages will become a target.<p>IMO you can already see this happening to Ruby, and Rust. Increasing attention to making low level languages more palatable. And decline of slow languages that don&#x27;t have other advantages. And I think this is just the beginning with all the focus on energy efficiency.<p>I dare say performance might even become government regulated, like efficiency is for home appliances')
