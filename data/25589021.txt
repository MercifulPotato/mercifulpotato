I like to keep my momentum going, so I order from amazon because some of those resellers stock locally, and thus I get the product in 1-2 days.<p>Contrast to China&#x2F;AliExpress, where it may take them 3-4 weeks for the product to reach me. At that point, my interest may have fizzled out or I get busy with real life.')
