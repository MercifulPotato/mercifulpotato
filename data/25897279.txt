If the receiver has a good lock (and a good clock) and a basic IMU then jamming on the last few minutes of approach might not cause too much drift -- but it could certainly spook a pilot into diverting.<p>As to mitigation, it is all expensive (in terms of antenna construction and processing) and GA is price sensitive. Airports with urban buildup get multi-path interference in the GPS signal <i>and</i> jamming signals, and it becomes complicated to computationally null the jamming signals. Chirp jammers are now as cheap as basic noise jammers.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not so easy, look at any current research paper on anti-jam. Imagine if 500 MAGA&#x2F;Antifa types plugged in PPDs over a city wide area and kept them mobile? It would be chaos.')
