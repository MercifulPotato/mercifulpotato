We don&#x27;t see the designs that fail, as they don&#x27;t pass the review? Using the analogy of software engineering being the design stage (vs build&#x2F;construction stage), this would be a closer comparison. How many skyscraper designs fail before they end up being &quot;uptaken&quot;.<p>Also, just because buildings don&#x27;t collapse and fail catastrophically, I assume there are many flaws in the design that get &quot;worked around&quot; during construction. Many flaws (bugs) do likely end up &quot;in production&quot;, but they are more of a technical debt type of issue that will be a burden for building maintenance and&#x2F;or future tenants.')
