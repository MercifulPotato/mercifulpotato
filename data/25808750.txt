It still seems there’s a meaningful difference between “if we’re in a bad state, kill the character instead of trying to recover” and “see a bad state coming in advance and avoid it”, which is what parent proposed.<p>The Destiny version doesn’t require understanding the bug, only recognizing after the fact that the player has, say, clipped out of bounds. Doesn’t matter <i>how</i> you got there. That sounds like a decent compromise for a pvp game where preventing exploits is very important.<p>But being able to extrapolate that the current state will <i>lead</i> to a bad state implies that you already understand the bug and could, you know, fix it.')
