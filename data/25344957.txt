I opened the settings and kept getting notification popups regarding storage and saying that the storage is full. I decided to reboot, and the iPhone did not start after that. No reboot, restore, no safe recovery, nothing worked. Took it to Apple Support, told me the same things I found online &quot;hardware failure&quot; and proposed to &quot;fix&quot; it by buying a new phone of the same (2.5 year old) model for $570.<p>Nope.<p>I&#x27;ll never buy an &#x27;un-repairable&#x27; headset for $549.')
