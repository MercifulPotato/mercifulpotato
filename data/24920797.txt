If parts of the giant function are only reading the buffer, than you can just pass it as a const T&amp; to your smaller inner function. If the inner function is modifying it, then i&#x27;d still pass it in, just as a T&amp;. Or maybe I&#x27;d define an immediately invoked lambda that captures the buffer by ref. Functions are a tool for defining interfaces to pieces of logic - maybe I&#x27;m not as smart as Carmack and I don&#x27;t have such a huge working memory, but I just can&#x27;t keep more than 3-4 concepts in my head at the same time. Functions let you isolate those concepts and only think about their interface, rather than their internals.')
