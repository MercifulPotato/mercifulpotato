In Elm, there is either a happy path or there is no path. As a newcomer, you&#x27;re not overwhelmed or paralyzed with a plethora of choices on how to get things done simply because Elm limits your choices. Each tool in your toolbox is documented with simple examples how to use that tool.<p>After finally jumping the fence and exploring&#x2F;devving with other OCaml languages (specifically F#), I still come back to Elm to see how it and the community does things: namely their best practices and explanation of fp concepts.')
