I couldn&#x27;t find the exact number, but an absurd percentage of graduates go into a select few high prestige career choices, namely finance, consulting, law, and medicine. The point being students are optimizing for high status.<p>To paraphrase an interaction from the book about entertaining different paths, when pressed a student made it clear: &quot;We&#x27;ve known who we want to be from elementary school. We are the type to get into &lt;&lt;Ivy League School Name&gt;&gt;&quot;.<p>I sometimes wonder if people focus on chasing status when they&#x27;re at a loss for defining any other concrete goal.
