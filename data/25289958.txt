The reason given was &quot;what if you&#x27;re in the middle of the ocean and your batteries die?&quot; or something stupid like that. But the real reason was that our instructor wanted us to <i>think</i> about what we were doing. Celestial navigation involves a lot of steps and errors compound. Forcing you to think clearly about the intermediate results means that you&#x27;re more likely to realize you pulled the wrong number out of a table, or your star sight was just plain wrong and you&#x27;re not off the coast of Madagascar, but somewhere near the Azores instead.')
