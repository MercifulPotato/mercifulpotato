A family office is a company fully owned by a family, with no clients other than the family, that doesn&#x27;t hold itself out as a public investment advisor.<p>The SEC release notes that most family offices already qualify, but the law was somewhat ambiguous. The problem isn&#x27;t that family offices can&#x27;t legally invest, but rather that companies are reluctant to sell to them --- that&#x27;s where the real risk is in running afoul of these rules, to the securities issuer, not the investor.
