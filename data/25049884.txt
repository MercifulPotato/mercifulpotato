My symptoms were just fever in the first day then I lost all my sense of smell (which is still recovering), but what scared me the most was the psychological effects I had to deal with.<p>I tried to get myself busy, did my workouts everyday, worked from home, that helped a lot. But was mostly at night when I was doing nothing that bad thoughts would try to take control. Some days I would think that I was having difficult to breath, start to get dizzy, but it was all in my mind. I then would calm down, take some deep breaths and watch all the &quot;symptoms&quot; disappear.<p>I blame that on the apocalyptic coverage the media gave to this disease, every day on every channel, if you tuned in, all you would see were patients in respirators, people dying and mass graves.<p>Now what I try to do is be very optimistic when talking to people about the disease. I say to them that although it can be a dangerous disease, the majority of those infected will recover without trouble and that I was one of them, so they can have a good case to remember against all the bad news they already have heard. It may help them when they had to deal with it too, as sadly I think everyone will have at some point.')
