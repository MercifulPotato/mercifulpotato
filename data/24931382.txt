But rather the very vocal minority of people who try to push CoCs everywhere, then viciously start insulting people who express dissent or even just some concerns about such CoCs, and once they get their way start abusing the CoCs to start witch trials and kangaroo courts seeking not to inform people of their (alleged) mistakes and give them opportunity and help correcting their behaviors (if correction is deemed necessary by the larger community), but seek to outright banish people without due process[1].<p>You saw some of those people act when you were at mozilla I&#x27;d think, when it came to Brendan Eich and gerv[2]. I am not talking about people rightfully disagreeing with or criticizing Brendan Eich and gerv, I am talking about people slinging mud and insults only and trying to banish them from public life at all cost.<p>And as you were mozilla at the time (right?), you probably remember the rift between mostly US and mostly European community parts over the proposed CoC at the time[5], with mostly the Europeans raising a lot of concerns about the CoC proposals and a CoC in general. Which is fine, and there were a lot of constructive discussions[6], except for the people who started accusing everybody who said a CoC (like that) is not necessary and could be actively harmful was a homophobic ass or sexist or whatever, trying to squash any discussion from the get go[7].<p>It&#x27;s those latter people you do not want in your community. And a lot of them I&#x27;d describe as &quot;psycho-sadists&quot; as well, who become very giddy and outright ecstatic when they succeed in banishing people, instead of expressing dread that such steps had to be taken.<p>[1] Brendan Eich, Linus or RMS, or google Rod Vagg or Larry Garfield<p>[2] gerv was[3] another prominent member of the mozilla community from the UK. He also rejected &quot;gay marriage&quot;, but from what I remember not the equal rights portion, &quot;just&quot; the terminology, arguing against it by saying it was a defined traditional religious term, and gay partnerships should have equal rights but should not be called &quot;marriage&quot;. He was wrong on that one[4]. I remember people calling him every name in the book, and wishing him he&#x27;d die from cancer[3].<p>[3] Sadly he passed away after a long fight with cancer. I know at least one of the people who wished gerv to die from cancer was fully aware of his ongoing long battle with that disease.<p>[4] Yes, I said &quot;wrong&quot;, don&#x27;t CoC me please.<p>[5] Early proposals of the mozilla CoC e.g. suggested that to be compliant one has to endorse things like e.g. the right to be homosexual. Which sounds nice at first, until you realize that some of mozilla&#x27;s community members are from countries that put people in jail for such endorsements.<p>[6] At least I for one thought I learned a lot about problems I wasn&#x27;t even aware of both on the pro- and contra-CoC side.<p>[7] A lot of those not-very-nice people were not even mozillians, but people who just came to mozilla to &quot;participate&quot; in the CoC discussion.')
