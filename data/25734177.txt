And, even those won&#x27;t last long (just until the first imagined slight or use of the wrong adjective).<p>This, too, is instructive.  Coddling a lack of resilience is <i>not</i> helpful to someone -- but, whatever.  Fill your boots!  If it works for you, have a blast with your two currently-acceptable friends!  ;)<p>But seriously, the current Kristallnacht purge of social media is the best thing that could happen, in my opinion.  It&#x27;ll force a Cambrian explosion of new platforms that more capably handle differences of belief and tolerance!')
