For those who aren’t aware let me let you in on a secret. Some people who hold crypto push fud for the coins&#x2F;tokens they hold to make others not buy them. This seems counter intuitive but gives people whose cash flow is low a longer period to get a decent stake. Then you have sad 4channers who do it just to be mean. Beware the fud. If people are pushing a negative view in something always ask what’s in it for them.')
