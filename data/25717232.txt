So, male circumcision or teeth corrections or vaccinations are not &quot;forced&quot; on the children, because they are acts that their parents consider are beneficial to the child.<p>However, if the state were to force children to be circumcised or have their teeth aligned regardless of their parents&#x27; desires, then most people would object to that.<p>Even more importantly, any actions which affect someone&#x27;s ability to use their body in a normal way are generally considered abhorrent. That is why male circumcision is usually tolerated, while female circumcision is an abomination, even if done by one&#x27;s parents. Forced sterilization is obviously in the second case, since it is terminally preventing someone from performing one of the 3 fundamental components of life.')
