Voter fraud happens regularly. Probably not to the extent that the election flips but I see no issue with asking fraud claims to be looked into. There 0 good excuse to completely ignore fraud claims. IF you really want confidence in our system all claims of abuse should be taken seriously. Tossing them out and acting like fraud never happens is every bit as ridiculous as claiming the election was rife with it. The only way to determine they&#x27;re &quot;baseless&quot; is to actually investigate them.')
