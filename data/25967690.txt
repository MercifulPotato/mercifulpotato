The smooth brains have been in the game as much, they have seen their capital dropping to 0 more than the HedgeFunds are accustomed to losing at their own game.<p>A hedge fund with capital and influence, capable of controlling the narrative, could and tried to decide the outcome of their bet based on their bet, we saw this with TSLA as well. They believed, like most people, that GME would go bankrupt, they didn&#x27;t consider the bull case [1] because things had been going down for so long, but GME&#x27;s revenue is periodic, bringing us back to the fallacy. Things are how they are until they are not, and the inability to adapt due to logical fallacies becomes evident.
