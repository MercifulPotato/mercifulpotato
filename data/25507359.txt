Folks in camp #1 think camp #2 is creating too much abstraction by naming all the data each step of the way, and camp #2 thinks camp #1 is creating too much abstraction by naming all the functions each step of the way.<p>Really it’s just these two mental modalities butting up against each other, because you will separate your layers in different ways for increased clarity depending on which camp you fall into. What makes things clearer for camp #1 makes things less clear for camp #2, and vice versa.<p>That’s my suspicion anyway: the premise of the discussion is just a little off.')
