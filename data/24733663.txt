This is a hotly debated subject. What you suggest aligns with what classical economics predicts, but real world evidence doesn&#x27;t necessarily back that up.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think it would cause any significant unemployment as long as you don&#x27;t do it all at once. Based on my own research, the evidence doesn&#x27;t support minimum wage hikes increasing unemployment, except possibly in the very short term. The logic is basically that because the marginal propensity to consume is so high for low income workers any increase in the minimum wage creates large spikes in demand. No one wants to fire their workforce in the face of increasing demand. Prices go up some then stabilize. Companies bring in more absolute $s, and employ a similar (or even possibly a larger) workforce. It ends up being a redistribution without meaningful negative consequences. The obvious question becomes &quot;why not keep raising it even more then?&quot; and then answer is basically that at some point the MPC drops too low and you stop getting the positive effects, at which point you&#x27;d presumably start driving unemployment.<p>That&#x27;s obviously an oversimplification, but so is the simple logic that large changes in minimum wage spike unemployment.')
