IMHO, the research into type and effect systems in recent years has been promising, but also shows that this is not an easy problem to solve. I’m hoping that in a few more years we might see a new generation of programming languages that incorporate this kind of “effect safety” as easily and naturally as many developers use const and qualifiers and resource management idioms today.')
