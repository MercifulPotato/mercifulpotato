What followed, eventually, is what we call &quot;The Enlightenment.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure the decline in government is a bad thing. Here I will disclose my political leanings. I lean very heavily libertarian. I&#x27;m something of a classical liberal, in favor of what&#x27;s derided as a &quot;night watchmen&quot; government. I am not for getting rid of government. I just think it should do a lot less. The scope of government increases only because of the &quot;faith&quot; people place in it, because its track record by comparison isn&#x27;t all that good.')
