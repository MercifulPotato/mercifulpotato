This page is the attempt of a non-coder, who believes that Open Source is an ethical  (and privacy-aware) choice, to share resources with other people. As a non-coder, they are only exposed to the trash tools that we as programmers give them now, hence the page is as it is, no worse than the average restaurant&#x27;s site. Hopefully it is successful and eventually the author gets help in simplifying the code.<p>Also hopefully, over time, they gain a preference for Free Software since they seem to prefer Open Source for ethical reasons. It&#x27;s a point of pride for Open Source that it asks no ethical questions; only because of <i>that</i> it conforms to the ethical stance of Free Software because it&#x27;s willing to conform to the ethical stance of any distributor.')
