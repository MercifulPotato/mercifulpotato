But what really had me saying: that&#x27;s enough, was the HUGE amount of unsolicited communication I was getting. From young professionals entering hackathons and looking for guidance to the &quot;talent acquisition&quot; people, who just dump on you all the openings they have to see if you respond to any of it.<p>Hackernews is currently my social network. I use youtube to make low effort videos logging what I&#x27;ve been working on and HN to actually invite people to interact with things I build and get feedback. I still have an Instagram account, but I&#x27;m planning on deleting it also.')
