The uncertainty principle applies just as much to grains of sand as it does to electrons.  The only reason they appear to have definite position and momentum is that their masses are large, so a very small velocity produces a very large momentum which gives them a very small wavelength, much smaller than their physical extent.  But the uncertainty principle still applies.  With the right technology you could do a two-slit experiment on grains of sand.
