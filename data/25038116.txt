I suddenly can’t print via WiFi anymore, from any device. Also, if I switch off the printer I can’t switch it on again unless I perform some crazy dance routine involving pulling out the power plug and paper tray and holding buttons in a certain order while plugging it back in.<p>Also my brother printer claims the cartridge is empty even though it is half full. I get around this by putting a sticker on the little window it uses to peek into the cartridge so it thinks it is full.<p>Insane.')
