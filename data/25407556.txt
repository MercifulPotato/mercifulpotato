However, most of the bootstrapped SaaS founders are wearing many hats at the same time and it gets almost impossible for them to respond to their clients on time.<p>This is exactly how the idea of Foundkit was born. We&#x27;ve launched an MVP in two weeks and tested all of our processes on our first 4 clients. Now we&#x27;re ready to scale and start freeing up the time of the fellow bootstrappers here.<p>Happy to answer any of your questions.')
