I have worked on projects which were built on exceptions, and on projects which were built on return codes. Exceptions is hands down the cleanest. Instead of becoming a mess of call&#x2F;error handle blocks, you code can clearly separate business logic and error handling. If I had 10 cents for every time I&#x27;ve fixed a bug when an error analysis is skipped because it is not supposed to happen until it is...<p>Golang way is terribly flawed. As a matter of fact I&#x27;ve watched a video yesterday on golang best practices, and got very excited. And then I realized, this is still a language where you can&#x27;t throw an exception and that made me very sad, as I realized golang is going nowhere. It will be exciting for a few more years, like ruby was once, and then everybody realizes what a PITA it is for large codebases, and it shall become another ruby.')
