I was intrigued by the genre and picked up what happens to be the only books mentioned in the article by name: The Dispossessed and Sunvault.<p>They&#x27;re both fairly boring. Slow paced, lack of nail-biting moments, some stories from Sunvault completely went over my head (barely understood anything from them)...<p>I have respect for Doctorow from an advocacy perspective, but I&#x27;m not a fan of his fiction at all.')
