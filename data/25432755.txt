To be able to find such a bug in production would require very good tracing most likely; to have a specification detect such bugs before you have even coded the thing is invaluable.<p>&gt; 2. distributed systems and concurrency are a very common example of subtle algorithms that engineers often encounter and are tricky to get right without help.<p>I would posit that Distributed systems are typically a category of concurrent systems; just at a different level of abstraction (threads vs nodes)<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TLA%2B#Industry_use" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;TLA%2B#Industry_use</a>')
