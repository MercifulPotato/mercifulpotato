And you want it to rock, to be perfect, and you can’t sleep at night if there is a fucking heisenbug.</i><p>This has been my experience.<p>I have refined my development skills, as a <i>direct</i> result of my OSS work (I&#x27;ve been writing open-source for over twenty years). During this time, I was a manager, at my &quot;day job,&quot; and the company I worked for actively discouraged managers from being engineers. I wasn&#x27;t having that, so I did OSS on the side, to keep my chops up.<p>Also, I worked for a company that insisted on a rigid, waterfall-based development methodology, that I thought resulted in sub-par software. It worked great on hardware; not so great on software.<p>Through my OSS work, I was able to prototype and refine a methodology that is a great deal more flexible than that used by my corporation. I feel that it results in far better software.<p>I have not experienced a whole lot of the troubles that Antirez encounters; mostly because I haven&#x27;t authored anything of the scale of Redis. I have, however, authored another project that has become a worldwide standard framework (for a much smaller demographic), and the best thing that I did for it (and for myself), was to get the hell away from it. It&#x27;s being maintained by a team of fairly brilliant and energetic folks that have taken it to the next level.<p>I really feel that if I had remained &quot;in the mix,&quot; I would have stunted it.<p>As Twain once put it: <i>&quot;I cannot help but notice that there is no problem between us that cannot be solved by your departure.&quot;</i>')
