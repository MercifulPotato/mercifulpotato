I&#x27;d say educating women (and people in general) is a good idea generally speaking, and so could potentially help in this regard if what I said is wrong, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt. But I do believe that people who have resources to support 3 people don&#x27;t deliberately have 10 kids, that&#x27;s the economic pressure that I&#x27;m relying on, I&#x27;d say accidental births would be more of a factor here than inertia due to cultural norm. Contraceptive technology IMO is more important.')
