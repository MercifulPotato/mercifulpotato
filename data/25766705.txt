Item(by='stragies', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610565431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25759764, text='Thank you for taking the time to write this!<p>When using CUPS in my previous posts as an example of &quot;Standard OpenSource component that could be a drop-in replacement in a vast majority of deployments&#x2F;installations&quot;, I was hoping, that somebody knowledgeable would reply with some details about the (speciality-use) features&#x2F;use-cases of the Windows Print-System.<p>You mentioned a few points, that I&#x27;ll try to itemize, and respond to:<p>* Specialty hardware setup, and UI&#x27;s for that:\n  In these times(for non-ancient devices&#x2F;deployments), is that not easily solved by the [WEB-]UI of the printer?<p>* Speciality hardware runtime control for printjobs (staples, binds, folds, glue, mailing, ...):\n  I thought, all of these are commonly abstracted into &quot;verbs&quot; in the PCL&#x2F;PJL, and just need to be &quot;included&quot; in the PrintJob.<p>* Decent integration into enterprise setups.\n  In what ways do you find CUPS lacking here? I find CUPS+AD-Auth_to_Samba4AD works great, and all the RSAT tools are functional from a domain member workstation<p>* Driver support: \n  Is that really still a problem these days?<p>* Availability of paid support for Windows Printsystem for X amount of money in 2031: \n  If commercial interest is there, I have no doubt, that MS will offer something like for WinXP and Win7 years after the normal EOL of Srv201{6,9}. I just thought, It was already visible now, that the &quot;commercial interest&quot; for this was going to be small, but then again I might be underestimating the (future) size of the &quot;Seriously large-scale paper printing&quot; market.<p>&gt; &quot;When was the last you heard somebody say: &quot;I would buy Windows server, if it had CUPS printing support in it&quot;? &quot;<p>Admittedly, never, but I can probably count in years the paid time, that I have worked helping clients with their Windows Print problems, many times calming them down to get the screaming and crying under control. So maybe a replaced print-system (In WinServer) could (by some) be seen as net positive, while the average Windows Home user wont notice&#x2F;care. ;)')
