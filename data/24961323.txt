What does that even mean? Why is Bo one of the oldest languages? Is Greek old? Is English old? Is Lithuanian old? Is Tamil old? Korean? Chinese (which one?)? Any language? If your answer is &#x27;yes&#x27;, then (a) please explain what you mean, and (b) rest assured that it is not the same language today as when it was &#x27;young&#x27; (whatever that means) -- &#x27;young X&#x27; is probably a different language than &#x27;old X&#x27;, but what does that mean for &#x27;X&#x27;? I don&#x27;t get it.<p>Such a weird notion. It seems to me that &#x27;old&#x27; for a language is often used to imply that it is &#x27;important&#x27; (culturally? presumably yes.), which feels, well, not racist, but maybe &#x27;linguist&#x27; -- OK, that word is already occupied... Even fighting exists about which language is &#x27;oldest&#x27; -- could you please make up the rules of the game before playing?<p>Anyway -- this is just me not understanding what people mean.')
