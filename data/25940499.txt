Why do we allow people to seek out and absorb hateful ideas and opinions? It&#x27;s the intellectual equivalent of financing terrorism and the people engaging it are escaping justice. It&#x27;s a huge blindspot for society. Who knows how much harm is caused by this &#x27;dark thought&#x27; in every day life, as the rest of us unwittingly engage with these individuals, assuming they are not motivated by any sort of forbidden information.')
