Out of the box on Debian, just no luck. Salt was just plug and go.<p>Haven&#x27;t bothered with Ansible (yet) as it didn&#x27;t officially support states when I was evaluating options, and statefulness was my number one need. I can pick up languages fairly easy (I&#x27;m a software dev by trade), so different languages don&#x27;t bother me, it was more about feature set. It is annoying, though, that it seems everyone treats Salt as forgettable. I wish I could find things like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dev-sec" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dev-sec</a> for Salt, but they only have Ansible, Puppet and Chef versions.')
