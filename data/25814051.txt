It just feels the most natural and it also forces you to look at the hunks, so there&#x27;s really no chance you&#x27;ll accidentally forget to add something.<p>When using GUIs with sidebars showing what files changed, etc. it&#x27;s easy to forget to add something because you skim it without really paying attention to what was changed.')
