But it&#x27;s usually not sociopaths versus normal people.  Sure, maybe there <i>are</i> a lot of CEOs who could be clinically diagnosed as sociopaths, but <i>a lot</i> of average people who don&#x27;t fall into that bucket are able to rationalize their way into doing shitty things.  I&#x27;m talking about everyone from waitstaff and gas station attendants to people doing admin work and small business ownersâ€”not just people in conspicuous positions of power making many times the national average income.<p>I&#x27;d wager that if you were able to get your hands on an oracle that could provide the true count of incidental contact and the measure of impact on the average person&#x27;s life by sociopaths versus good people who do bad things as a matter of performing their daily routines, the difference is probably an order of magnitude heavier on the side of the latter.
