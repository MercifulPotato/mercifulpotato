That&#x27;s a fun thing to do as, like, a game or a way to pass the time, and I guess that&#x27;s what HN is, but it&#x27;s still crazymaking, because essentially every paper written about messaging cryptography refutes this comment. Cryptographers would like to move people onto GPG? The fact that GPG is non-repudiable and shouldn&#x27;t be is one of the 2 motivating use cases for OTR, and later Signal. Nobody is trying to get people to use GPG.')
