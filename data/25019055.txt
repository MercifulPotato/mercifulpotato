For example, most terror attacks in the US are conducted by white supremacists[1].<p>The point is not about trying to prevent other viewpoints, which is obviously bad, but to preserve the rule of law and patch holes in the laws and other customs where they exist. Trump showed where the holes are. I don&#x27;t think you would be happy if Biden and Democrats started using the same loopholes that Trump and Republicans have been using. By the way, research has shown that conservatives are less likely to be able emphatize with other viewpoints compared to liberals[1].<p>I want to point out that Trump and the Republican party has taken dishonesty to completely new level in America. The party even came up with a new term to call lies: &quot;alternative fact&quot;. Trump has lied more than 20,000 times since taking office.<p>The issue with the modern Republican party is that they are not going to compromise on anything. It is either their way, or no way. That is not the right way to govern a country.
