Everyone was manager of something . We had chief tech happiness officer.<p>His job was to make python script to make devs happy. I’ve never heard of that before.<p>The company went bankrupt after wasting 200M in venture money and generating 10K in revenue.<p>Was fascinating to be part of that experience. Nothing was being done , just a bunch of people making brainstorms all day long while 10 devs were doing everything and being told to change idea every other day.<p>Was a relief when I quit after few months, when I look back at it no doubt it was a who’s the &quot;coolest of the club&quot; culture. No actual talent was there.')
