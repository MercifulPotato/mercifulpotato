The language itself had way too many limitations back when Sun ran it, for really dumb reasons proffered by too smart for their own good people. I was sadly paying attention to the wretched arguments about how there was literally no way to reasonably make first class functions work, or closures, or value types, or escape analysis, or any of the million things that C# just said yes to from day one which worked out fine. It was a lot of edge case kvetching that really needed a dictator to cut through, but Sun were terrible stewards and let the worrywarts run the show.<p>The enterprise culture could I guess be blamed, but Sun was a shite enterprise company when it came to financials, you&#x27;d think MS would be much worse in terms of command&#x2F;control but C# ended up as a damn good version of Java, and once Oracle grabbed the ball hairs Java got pretty great. So it&#x27;s not the whole problem.')
