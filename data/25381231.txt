These platforms have driven up into the million-per-month range of sales for consumer (and team!) based products. The vast majority of the platforms are trash, yet power jaw-dropping amounts of sales and usage.<p>I think it perfectly reasonable that Pegasus has all the underpinnings these kind of platforms would use and greatly benefit from. What kills me is that hosted platforms of this nature tend to either: 1) completely suck; 2) have costs that only large corporations can afford and benefit from.<p>That said... I&#x27;m curious what obstacles prevent the author from growing this into a hosted SAAS solution that focuses on enabling externalizing provisioning (e.g. via webhooks) and customized sales flows. It seems like there is a solid foundation in place!')
