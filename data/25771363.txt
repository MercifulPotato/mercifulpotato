In which case...<p>You&#x27;re missing the point, which is that the higher baseline QoL means that it&#x27;s better to be poor &#x2F; middle class in Germany or UK than it is to be poor &#x2F; middle class in the United States.<p>With regard to immigration rates, there are many factors to consider:<p>Yes, some small percentage of Americans can get lucky and make the jump from middle class to upper-middle- or upper-class, perhaps enticing Europeans who hope to get that high-paying SV job.<p>However, moving your entire life from one country to another requires a certain amount of social and financial security.  The argument might be made (whether or not it&#x27;s true--I don&#x27;t know) that more Europeans move because more Europeans have the financial means to move, along with a quality education that enables them to outcompete domestic American talent.  It might be that many Americans want to leave, but are trapped into staying for social &#x2F; political &#x2F; economic reasons (e.g. &quot;if I leave, my elderly parents will have no one to care for them due to our expensive healthcare system&quot;).<p>So without further investigation, the inflow&#x2F;outflow rates can&#x27;t really be used to support either side of the argument, even putting aside that the number of people who leave their home country is peanuts compared to the number of people who remain.')
