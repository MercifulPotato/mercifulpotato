They sell advertisers access to you.  Everything else is a sideshow and they will eventually get bored with it and let it rot.  Google has had a lot of good ideas over the years.  They let devs create amazing things with the constant flow of ad dollars.  But then those cool things don&#x27;t make as much money as selling ads, and the devs want to move on to create a new thing, so the 300lb idiot baby that is Google wanders off and squats on something else.<p>I also have to wonder if Google is stuck in the doldrums of being a mid-life startup.  Their initial team of rockstars have probably all retired to roll around in their millions.  A whole new crop of money and status seeking folks have taken their place.  Wall Street is expecting growth every quarter.  There is constant pressure to refocus on revenue producers and grow the stock.  They seem far detached from their initial roots under Sergey and Larry.')
