Even if everything around us would become 10x more efficient - which already would require many scientific breakthroughs - that&#x27;s just multiplying the exponential growth curve by a constant factor of 0.1. A little bit of relief, but it fundamentally doesn&#x27;t change anything.<p>And that&#x27;s ignoring the reality that if you make something 10x efficient, it tends to become used more - sometimes much more, cancelling the gains. Our economy is self-regulating; altering one factor only makes all others readjust to compensate. Permanent change will require more complex approach.<p>Energy efficiency is definitely a very important part of dealing with climate change, but it isn&#x27;t a silver bullet.')
