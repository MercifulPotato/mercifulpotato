Pre-pandemic, having the cellular version also means I can work anywhere, coffee shop, traveling, and not have to worry about wifi, or depleting my iPhone battery by tethering.<p>The screen is gorgeous. The sound is impressive. The new keyboard thingy is very serviceable. _Overall_ I like using it more than using a laptop. It&#x27;s my go-to machine when computing around the house, or when working away from my desk&#x2F;office (e.g. coffee shop), or when traveling.<p>The pain points currently (iPad Pro 12.9) are:<p>- FaceTime camera on the &quot;top&quot; edge, which means, when used with Apple&#x27;s own magic keyboard, the camera is actually on the side, giving a perfect view up my left nostril. There should be two cameras. This is so obvious.<p>- File system stuff is still a pain point despite the recent advances in the Files app and in multitasking. The odd time when I want to have several apps open and move several files around it really is painful and I usually give up and move to my iMac. Honestly I don&#x27;t know what the solution is. Perhaps it&#x27;s a case of &quot;iPad isn&#x27;t supposed to be used for that sort of thing&quot;. Or perhaps it&#x27;s a case of re-jigging my workflow. Which is up to me of course. I could just get a M1 MacBook Air and call it a day, that would be OK, but I still prefer the overall experience of using the iPad.<p>- Coding, of course. If I am on a fast connection to a local machine I can use Remote Desktop, which is sort of cheating, it&#x27;s just using a desktop Mac, sub-optimally. I can use an ssh client and access a remote machine using a text only interface, which works for some coding purposes, but not interactive graphics. My instinct is this is a problem not to be solved for the iPad as it&#x27;s just not supposed to be used for that. I&#x27;m OK with that.')
