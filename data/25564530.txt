They wouldn&#x27;t even let me defend my positions, just mark it wrong. This was a common problem for me as I would think out side the box (as told) but they didn&#x27;t like my answers because it doesn&#x27;t fit with their view. This still happens at work today.<p>I had a logic course in college called philosophy of argument. It was graded differently. You were graded on your knowledge of fallacies and structures of arguments. You did have to construct some basic arguments, but you could have people in the same class with opposing positions and both could still recieve full marks if their arguments didn&#x27;t contain fallacies, factual issues, or structural issues. This way provides the building blocks for arguments and recognizing fallacies without indoctrination.')
