The &quot;limitation&quot; here is JSON which doesn&#x27;t attach type information. You&#x27;re going to have to implement some typing protocol on top of the JSON anyway which will face similar problems to the ones you raised (unless you do some trait based inference which could be ambiguous and dangerous).<p>If they were Enums&#x2F;Unions over a serialization protocol like protobuf, maybe your case makes sense. Even then, Im guessing a large % of the OAuth 3 requests will go through Java&#x2F;Golang libraries, so on a practical level this is a bad idea too.')
