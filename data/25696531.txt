I think your opinion would not be downvoted as much if you simply stated your thought without labelling others.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t believe (though I have no evidence in this regard) there was any coordination here. Companies like Twitter and Facebook have been profiting from disinformation and hate speech for years, and Trump is neither the start nor the end of it. They should have banned him and others much earlier, but just didn&#x27;t feel like the trouble of standing for basic ethics and human rights was worth that sweet stock. Now they can ban the man not only without hurting their bottom line, but also with a nice PR boost all along. And as soon as one makes the first step, the other tech-herd follows. No coordination, just VP herd mentality.')
