I deal with tons of small businesses and they complain about spending $5 &#x2F; month on MS365 for email which is absolutely essential to their business.  The idea they&#x27;re going to be signing up for all these SaaS platforms is crazy to me.<p>On the other side there&#x27;s enterprise, but if I have 1000 users, why wouldn&#x27;t I deal with my own infrastructure instead of paying someone $120,000 &#x2F; year to do it for me?  I&#x27;m in Canada and you could get 3 decent sysadmins for that.')
