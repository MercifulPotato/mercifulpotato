Partly because the corporation I work for seems to have gotten our NAT addresses onto a blacklist so I get captcha&#x27;d <i>constantly</i>, and partly because my close up vision is getting noticeably weaker (pushing 50, that&#x27;s why) and without hunting down my reading glasses it can be difficult to make out the smaller details necessary to solve the puzzle.  Especially when I&#x27;m on my phone.<p>I really wish we could find something relatively foolproof that didn&#x27;t rely heavily on tracking or really good vision.')
