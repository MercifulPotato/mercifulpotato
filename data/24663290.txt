Not a cinophile though, so can&#x27;t really comment on anything there. Am a gamer; no noticeable smearing and no detectable input lag greater than any other TV. We ended up getting rid of it after a move caused it to get damaged. Only thing really of note I can remember was it was fairly heavy, but I never compared it against other TVs being sold around that time so can&#x27;t say it was due to the brand.')
