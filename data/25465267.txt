You can&#x27;t even rely on <i>commas</i> in CSVs.<p>I would say any format that is compatible with Excel is not suitable for archival.  Ever open a file with numeric values with more than say, 20 (I forget the actual cut off) digits?  Excel converts to scientific notation and loses precision.  When you change the format there is data loss.  The length data is preserved but not the full precision.')
