Can I use &#x27;?&#x27; to match 0 or 1 (common) or do I have to use = (vim)? Or maybe just {0,1}? But then should I escape the braces?<p>I think that&#x27;s just older tools like vi and sed. Perl, Python, Java, and Javascript use a similar modern version where + and ? work, and parentheses and braces don&#x27;t need to be escaped.')
