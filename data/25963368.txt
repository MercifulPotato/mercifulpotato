Since most of it is in conventions and institutionalized knowledge, the &quot;core&quot; of it that we actually use&#x2F;type on a day-to-day basis is so small that it fits into everybody&#x27;s mind, and it&#x27;s getting constantly refreshed as well. No temptation to google anything, there wouldn&#x27;t be answers anyway. And our in-house stackoverflow clone died from not being used years ago.<p>Wow this sounds terrible.
