My understanding was that even with statically linked glibc, things tend to break when the host system has a different libc &#x2F; a sufficiently newer glibc.<p>Also, how do you do OpenGL&#x2F;Vulkan&#x2F;etc statically? x11docker handles them more-or-less fine, but I&#x27;m fairly certain the GPU gods send you to Tartarus if you start trying to statically link in various vendors&#x27; libGLs...<p>&gt; Simple Unix&#x2F;BSD constructs like chroot&#x2F;jails are far simpler and they are reliable.<p>_Fully_ agree about jails, especially nice since they&#x27;re persistent. Though, for an X11-using application, I think you&#x27;re screwed any way it comes out, since afaik there&#x27;s no permissions difference between being able to create a window, and being able to steal keystrokes + send keystrokes to a terminal. Maybe the Qubes people have something?')
