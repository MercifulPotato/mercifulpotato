Then you stop at a truck stop and everyone is super nice, chatty, and helpful.  I had minor car trouble - casually mentioned it to the cashier at a gas station, and with folks overhearing ended up having half a dozen good &#x27;ole boys getting me fixed up and on the road again.<p>It&#x27;s weird, but I suppose not uncommon.  I originally am from MN, and drivers there kind of mimic the general personality too imo.  The &quot;Minnesota Nice&quot; and general passive aggressiveness merged into one hellish of a driving experience.  But, get out of the car and people generally are quite helpful and pleasant as well.<p>The only place I&#x27;ve spent any appreciable time in where I can say the drivers were downright pleasant was Kentucky.  I lived there about a year, and even to the day I left I could never quite understand people actually getting over to let me merge on the freeway, stopping voluntarily off busy roads to let me turn left, not blocking the left lane unless to pass, etc.  Yet I&#x27;d say the general day to day in-person interactions I had there were probably less friendly than Texas overall.<p>tldr; weird Sunday rant about driving styles and state personalities :)')
