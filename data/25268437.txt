Issue I can spot with it is that you would still be incentivized to sell &quot;short term&quot; as you still get equity. The equity isn&#x27;t becoming more valuable due to your sales (which don&#x27;t act as recurring revenue), but your equity does increase in value from the other (more honest) salespeople who are doing &quot;long term&quot; sales.<p>Still, I think it is a neat idea.')
