So far it appears that you have received an informal opinion from the Embassy but there is a formal process under these circumstances that would reaffirm her green card status and allow her to travel back to the US. The document is called a returning resident visa and it probably makes sense or her to apply for this and force the Embassy to review the evidence and make a real decision. She should consult with an immigration attorney, however, possibly the immigration attorney for your employer, to help her with this application.')
