Item(by='efreak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607894607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407644, text='I&#x27;ve seen a number of books, mostly children&#x27;s books from scholastic, with different editions (different art, copyright, etc) that have the same ISBN number. I&#x27;ve since removed most duplicate books from my collection, but I had found a bunch when I last sorted my books; Maniac Magee is the only one I can remember by title. More annoying was the book with a CD attached to the front, that caused the finish to peel off when the CD was removed (the CD contained a non-working installer for a screensaver that, when extracted using other tools, also didn&#x27;t work).')
