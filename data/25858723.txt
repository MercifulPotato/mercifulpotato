Item(by='bubblethink', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611237027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25858598, text='Stream is a bit closer than Fedora, but the larger point of needing paid support remains. The slow cadence of RHEL means that unless you are paying for support, things get kind of frozen around the .5 release. After that, they just won&#x27;t backport fixes, not even regressions, unless  a) You are paying, b) It&#x27;s really a critical security bug. I don&#x27;t think that will change with Stream.<p>To summarize, the RHEL model of releasing an OS every 5 years with these staggered upstreams is really not that great. It creates immense inertia and pain down the road. RedHat itself hasn&#x27;t been able to port its own offerings like Satellite to RHEL 8. I would rather have the Ubuntu cadence of LTS releases every 2 years so that you are at most 2 years away from any fixes you need.')
