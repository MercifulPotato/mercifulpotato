If the application is accepted, the debtor gives up all their assets and submits to paying all of their earnings towards their debt, for five years. A politically determined subsistence sum is all they get to keep for themselves.<p>After five years, the agreement ends and the debt is cleared. Each person can only apply once in their life. Any future runaway debts cannot be cleared without the consent of each creditor, which probably won&#x27;t happen. Unsure how this is done in the rest of Scandinavia.')
