Or figuring out which instructions are most appropriate given various constraints.<p>This is a different kind of hard than, say, the makework that dominates other domains: &quot;oh I haven&#x27;t touched this project in a month and it now is somewhat broken because dependencies have subtly changed in ways that I have to spend hours debugging.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m convinced some devs love the pain imposed by the former, while others can better tolerate the pain of the latter without issue.')
