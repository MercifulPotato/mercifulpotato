(it is quite possible indeed they didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not saying that is a coverup for some other motive, I&#x27;m saying that is incompetent).  What was the QA process like? Who was involved in it? From the article, apparently not any department heads or medical staff in general.<p>That&#x27;s not a competent design process for something so important, is it?<p>That they never bothered to see how &quot;the algorithm&quot; treated residents demonstrates that they didn&#x27;t give a shit about residents, not necessarily that they were intentionally screwing them.<p>The administration doesn&#x27;t say much about how the algorithm was designed, they just say &quot;oh, it was an algorithm.&quot; I think many people believe that &quot;algorithms are objective&quot; and they are trying to play that.')
