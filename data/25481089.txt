Best my both brain cells could come up with is either a - remote power transmission, or b - optimizing a signal to avoid absorption by water.<p>The optimal frequency studies for power transmission I saw were all for biological applications, like pacemakers and they do come in at somewhere around 1 GHz.  The optimal frequency seems to be dialed in to minimize energy losses absorbed by tissue, meaning in our case, water in cells?<p>Remote spectroscopy must show Earth reeks of water.  And water is the cheapest and most effective radiation shielding there is.  Does any of that track for anyone who knows what they&#x27;re talking about, because I sure don&#x27;t?')
