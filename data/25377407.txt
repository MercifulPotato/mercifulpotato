It&#x27;s not &quot;lock in&quot;, it&#x27;s sales. The only amazon &quot;lock in&quot; really is their bandwidth-out pricing, which is a sleazy tactic for sure but I&#x27;m not hesitant to call it out <i>when it&#x27;s the case</i>.<p>You can get the $100&#x2F;$300&#x2F;$1000 tier if you are in &quot;just checking it out&quot; solo mode. $5k and up requires either connections, partnerships, or a serious application.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t know what your point is, I&#x27;m not even sure if you have one. They&#x27;re not &quot;marketing&quot; their pricing, nor the fact that you are &quot;forced to design systems that use less resources&quot;.')
