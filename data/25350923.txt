Instead of buying a given MCU for embedded and dealing with crappy weird peripheral issues, or undocumented behavior, you an choose a RISC V core and architectural implementation. Then download the core and simulate it in software with an open source qemu module with peripherals and all using an open source RTOS, perhaps with some commercial RISC-V add-ons for your project. The burn it to an fpga and test real world or if you need&#x2F;want purchase an ASIC version made by a third pzrty. Of course we&#x27;re probably far from that in practice but in theory it&#x27;s achievable.')
