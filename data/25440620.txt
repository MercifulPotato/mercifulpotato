At least not one compatible with democratic-like systems.<p>The fundamental issue here, at least to me, is that the upvote is an &quot;I like this&quot; signal. The instinctive use of an upvote is to see more of what you like. Turns out that what people like is what people already agree with.<p>Unless you build a strong culture that values the signal&#x2F;noise ratio (remember that early reddit had much more of &quot;UPVOTE IS NOT A DISAGREE&quot; culture, hivemindy as it was), you&#x27;re not getting your desired outcome. Worse, if you let in the mobs, it doesn&#x27;t matter how principled your initial group was as they&#x27;ll soon be overwhelmed by the crowd. The historical record there is obvious.<p>I think the only way about this is gate-keeping. You want that culture, you&#x27;d better enforce it. If you somehow start with a seed userbase of principled people, you only allow people voting rights once they meet whatever gatekeeping criteria that you&#x27;ve set. I don&#x27;t think this is that scalable, but smaller more tightly knit communities might be a plus to some.<p>Actually, I&#x27;m wondering if something like this might have a niche out there somewhere. We know that Digg in the old days had the superuser group, and the strength of reddit was it&#x27;s specialized subreddits. Would a system crossing specialized subs with hierarchical user privileges (viewer&#x2F;voter&#x2F;voter_with_grant_privs) be something that could work?')
