They practically turned GME into a ponzi scheme, encouraging more and more people to pump up the price by buying it.<p>It was funny when it was just hedge funds losing millions of dollars because they shorted it, but eventually all the WSB people buying the stock are going to be stuck with something worthless once it inevitably comes back down to Earth.<p>Trading on GME probably should have suspended a while ago. Now we&#x27;re stuck in a situation where RH has blocked purchases, and people are going to blame them when the stock tanks and they lose their money rather than themselves for buying ridiculously overpriced stock to begin with.')
