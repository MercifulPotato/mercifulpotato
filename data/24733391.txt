Hell, even the ones I do, often don&#x27;t mention anything about ad blocking. I can&#x27;t see anything directly prohibiting ad blocking here on the Facebook ToS, for example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;terms.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;terms.php</a><p>&gt; how is this any different than signing an agreement with a lawyer<p>ToS and a contract with a lawyer are very different things. It is not generally a crime to violate a ToS, but rather, merely a breech of agreement, and they can refuse service in return. If I violate a ToS, they can block me from using the site, and that&#x27;s about the most they can do, unless I intentionally harmed the company (e.g. hacked other user data or compromised their servers).<p>(In the particular case of Facebook, it would also probably not be in their interest to block me, because I post a lot of original content to the platform that causes <i>other</i> users to spend more time on Facebook, and my presence on the platform is highly likely a net positive for them cash-wise.)')
