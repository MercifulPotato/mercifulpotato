I know quite a few people who have attempted the &quot;covid digital nomad&quot; lifestyle (and I myself have some experience as a nomad pre-covid), and although they haven&#x27;t reported something as entertainingly cringey as posting up on a McDonald&#x27;s sidewalk for conference calls, they&#x27;re not too far off.<p>The logistical problems (working wifi, etc) are expected and avoidable to anyone with half a brain, but the bigger problem is the social divide. The story about the guy in Costa Rica seems to be the most accurate. There is a good amount of disdain for this type of lifestyle, <i>especially</i> during the pandemic. Among my &quot;nomad&quot; friends, the only ones that haven&#x27;t come limping back home were the ones who successfully walled themselves off from external judgement and formed a &quot;bubble&quot; where they only associate with other nomads. Fun if that&#x27;s what you want to do, but probably not what most people expect when they embark on this escapade.')
