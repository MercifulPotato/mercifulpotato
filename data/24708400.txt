I was seriously concerned for the console&#x27;s health. God of War is another game that put that console to its breaking point. A few times dropping down to what was probably 15-20fps with fans on at max-speed.<p>It actually is bad enough that I will limit gaming sessions out of concern for the hardware. Which is also probably better for me and my personal life.')
