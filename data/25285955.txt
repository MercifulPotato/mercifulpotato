Basically, the poorest people in Georgia are paying for the children of mostly middle and upper-class residents to go to UGA and Ga Tech for free. Of course the state points out the handful of low-income students who also benefited from a HOPE scholarship, but these are the minority of recipients, and they would almost all have qualified for significant grants and financial aid anyway. The most offensive aspect, I&#x27;ll state again, is the fact that the poorest residents overwhelmingly purchase lottery tickets while the wealthiest residents overwhelmingly receive the scholarships.<p>It also makes the state university (UGA) much, much harder to gain admission to, since demand for a free college education is high. Applications (and thus necessary GPA&#x2F;SAT scores) are through the roof... Ivy-qualified students (again, often from wealthy families) are often encouraged to go to UGA for free instead.<p>HOPE already vastly exceeded its budget once, leading to cutbacks and reforms about a decade ago, with many students losing scholarships or suddenly not qualifiying. A more recent report says it is likely to run out of funds again in 2028. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.11alive.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;new-analysis-shows-hope-scholarship-to-run-out-of-money-by-2028&#x2F;293407419" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.11alive.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;news&#x2F;local&#x2F;new-analysis-show...</a>')
