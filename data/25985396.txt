They already squeeze all or most of the profit out of anything they pickup and deliver.<p>Sadly, many restaurants don’t have a choice, in these days of COVID-19. They work with GrubHub and DoorDash at zero profit or even a loss, or they go completely out of business. Those are the only two options.<p>So, it’s no wonder that the restaurants wouldn’t want to provide bathroom facilities for the drivers.<p>Uber is just as bad (or worse), but they’re in a slightly different line of business, unless you’re talking about UberEats.')
