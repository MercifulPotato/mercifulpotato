Ignoring cash for the moment, consider that banks are properly characterized as a connected graph of double-entry ledgers, where the edges are network connections. As such, it should be trivial to a) assign a public&#x2F;private keypair to each bank node, b) encrypt and&#x2F;or sign outbound messages, and c) have it work in real time. We could even impose serializability on the whole network, and still operate in real time.<p>Perhaps it is impossibly naive to think that centrally controlled bank systems could be so straight-forward and simple, free of precedent and regulation, but I&#x27;d like to understand why.')
