You&#x27;re offered an illusion of choice and then you&#x27;re &#x27;incentivized&#x27; (every policy makers favourite word in the free world) to choose the correct thing. The beauty of it is of course that it, in contrast to authoritarianism, obfuscates existing power relations, because if you have choice there&#x27;s nobody you can attack or hold responsible, you&#x27;re always responsible yourself.<p>In that sense authoritarianism actually treats you less like cattle, because  authoritarians think highly enough of their subjects to actually perceive them as a threat. The modern western technocrat on the other hand pretty much just thinks everyone&#x27;s a number in an excel sheet.')
