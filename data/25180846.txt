Even designing a button needs a base colour, a hover state colour, a clicked state colour and sometimes border colours too. You can ‘wing’ it by using sass ‘darken’ etc as someone stated above, but I’ve found that to be interpreted differently by different browsers, and it’s just better to anticipate these needs and come up with the required colour stops upfront.')
