To me it&#x27;s exactly the right mental model - I can do mass edits with the same commands I&#x27;ve learned in single cursor edits, and, maybe more importantly, I have immediate visual feedback between the edits I compose this way. I&#x27;d recommend anyone thinking about learning Vim to give this a try first and then evaluate whether there is any additional benefit from spending a lot of time learning Vim commands.')
