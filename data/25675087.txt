The plaintiff may cry &quot;We have evidence!&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they have legally admissible evidence.  Before the judge will bother to hear the evidence, it has to clear that bar.<p>IIRC, there was an election case in Pennsylvania that made it up to the Federal appeals court.  There it was dismissed for <i>lack of evidence</i>.  (The opinion was written by a judge appointed by Trump.)  You can think of that as &quot;procedural grounds&quot; and &quot;not hearing the evidence&quot;, I suppose, but to me it looks like examining the evidence and finding it lacking at the most basic level.')
