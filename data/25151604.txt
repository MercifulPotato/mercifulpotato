The benefit is that they form communities around a common root. It doesn&#x27;t even matter that the root isn&#x27;t shared anymore by most people because the forum has evolved into different categories and threads. It is some kind of square or piazza. Funny enough founded by a internet shop and website around a game it is now hosted by an independent society &quot;e.V.&quot;.<p>What matters are moderators if they aren&#x27;t able to keep out their own opinions and views the forum and the community will die.<p>On the other side we have - as usual - big tech. Neither Facebook nor Twitter form communities, what I see is that existing communities get sucked up into it. Maybe Reddit host and forms communities? Regarding Imgur I don&#x27;t have the feeling that it forms a communitiy, their is no common root or actions they carry out together.<p>My feeling? Forums are social media. Facebook and Twitter? Not even close.')
