Huawei was perhaps even closing the gap before the trade war knocked them out of contention.<p>I don&#x27;t think apple was really all that special in this regard. They were ahead of the curve, which is impressive, but the market was created by arm, not just apple. I doubt we&#x27;d be seeing this kind of resurgence had others - especially google - not also jumped on the ARM bandwagon.  A rising tide lifts all boats; both android and ios likely benefited from each others shared usage of arm because it helped the whole ecosystem.<p>For some sense of scale: qualcomm&#x27;s latest chip just released some benchmark numbers, and while they&#x27;re not all that impressive (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16325&#x2F;qualcomm-discloses-snapdragon-888-benchmarks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16325&#x2F;qualcomm-discloses-snap...</a>) it&#x27;s still good to put &quot;not that impressive&quot; in perspective: they&#x27;re comparable to i7-6700k in single-threaded workloads, and to an i7-4770k in multi-threaded workloads.  The oldest iPhone that runs the same geekbench version I can find is the iPhone 5s, which is a little more than 4x slower in the single-threaded benchmark, and 8x in the multi-threaded.  Yet that chip was no slouch!<p>Obviously, apple&#x27;s impressive pole position completely hogs the spotlight, but it&#x27;s worth remembering that the competition isn&#x27;t actually all that bad.  That level of performance would make for an extremely fast chromebook - were it not for the fact that most are cheap cheap cheap and will never use a high-end chip.<p>Development across the board has been so fast, that if you remember slow ARM chromebooks, I think you attribute that slowness to 2 things other than apple vs everybody else: firstly, they were built to a bargin-basement price, and thus you weren&#x27;t getting anything near this performance not because it wasn&#x27;t apple, but simply because they didn&#x27;t use the right chips in the first place, and secondly, it&#x27;s been a while, and when things improve that quickly, then a slightly outdated model can easily appear terrible without that being a condemnation of the whole approach.')
