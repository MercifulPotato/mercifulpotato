Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604349011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960949, text='Word suffers from the case that it needs all features for all users accessible at almost all times (despite most people only needing about 20% of it at a given time). Word actually has a great &quot;Focus Mode&quot; if you can find it (among other ways to get to it there&#x27;s a button for it in the status bar these days).<p>I wrote most of a novella in the iOS version of Word last year for NaNoWriMo, mostly because I really liked Word&#x27;s OneDrive-based sync to make sure I was always up to date no matter which device I used and that I could reasonably trust offline sync in the rare cases where I worked on the document on multiple devices &quot;in parallel&quot; because one was offline. The iOS version defaults to &quot;Focus Mode&quot; and that eventually pushed me to figuring out how to get the right &quot;Focus Mode&quot; settings on my desktop to get a similar writing experience, which turned out to be easy when you knew what you were looking for.<p>I think it&#x27;s all another reminder that it isn&#x27;t necessarily your tools, but how you use them and how familiar you are with them. In a nutshell that is most of the discussions here, use what you like and if a 30+ year old word processing tool meets your needs, wonderful. On the flipside, the modern tools aren&#x27;t without their merits and there are similar familiarity tricks to using them that maybe just take a bit a seeking them out or learning them.')
