Summed up, I&#x27;m currently saving just over 11% on all the groceries + ~7% on fuel cost by sharing that information with 5 companies. (car insurance, CC, shop card, honey, airline)<p>I&#x27;m not attached to this, I&#x27;d rather the programs like this get destroyed. But also by stacking the offers, I believe I&#x27;m getting more value here than they do.<p>So for now I&#x27;m cool with this exchange. Would others put the privacy&#x2F;money break-even somewhere else? (This is assuming reasonable shopping - I make a full list before starting to order a pickup, I rarely actually go through a shop, so there&#x27;s no upsell here)')
