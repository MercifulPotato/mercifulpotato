It’s like corporal punishment: it’s more about the parents anger and emotions that it is about disciplining the child, but the collateral damage is you’re causing pain to a child who probably doesn’t understand the full picture of why mommy is slapping them. In my experience, parents are generally unable to remove their own ego from a situation, to where it becomes a task to force a child to bend to their will and show who’s boss.')
