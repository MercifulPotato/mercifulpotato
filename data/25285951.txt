Item(by='cookiengineer', descendants=None, kids=[25291171], score=None, time=1606975699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285004, text='&gt; How exactly did ‘Steve Jobs cripple the web browser’?<p>&gt; I’m guessing you don’t know that Apple took the open source WebKit from KDE, and continued to develop it into a world class engine in the open.<p>While I agree with your points that Apple in general contributed a lot when it comes to how humans perceive technology (for better or worse), I cannot let this argument stand untouched.<p>- WebKit is NOT developed in the open.<p>- It has a private bug tracker nobody outside Apple can see. Try to report a bug, even as a bug reporter you can&#x27;t see shit what&#x27;s happening with it. And this wasn&#x27;t the case before ~2009, from personal experience.<p>- Over 80% of contributions were actually from Mozilla or Google.<p>- WebKit source code is still released 6 months after it was developed, leaving nobody outside Apple&#x27;s internal team with the capability to even discuss features or APIs.<p>- Apple&#x27;s &quot;Open Source&quot; philosophy is the minimum legal requirement, aka dumping a fucking zip file with random shit to a server and forget about it afterwards. Lots of people from Chromium have been in contact with Apple&#x27;s legal team until they &quot;really complied&quot; and actually dumped the full source code (again, as a shitty zip file). Apple didn&#x27;t do this on their own, and they never have.<p>- The Blink incident. Don&#x27;t forget this. A shitload of contributors left WebKit because of the previous points, and now Chromium is getting dominant due to Blink. Do you think this is a coincidence?<p>All these policies how Apple &quot;loves Open Source&quot; speak against the fact. Also, don&#x27;t forget bash, tcsh, zsh and pretty much all related to the brew ecosystem. These people, while they still love Apple&#x27;s ecosystem, never benefited a single dollar and neither a single contribution from Apple.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe me, pick a random zip file on Apple&#x27;s &quot;open source server&quot; [1], contact the maintainer of said project and ask them about how they think Apple helps them. The answer is: not at all.<p>I won&#x27;t dig into the other facts which made the Web crippled, where we&#x27;ve been before with IE6 and ActiveX. Humanity hasn&#x27;t learned shit from that lesson. And &#x2F;u&#x2F;themacguffinman did that already in his own comment to elaborate this fact [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25285306" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25285306</a>')
