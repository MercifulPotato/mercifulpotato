The drugs weren&#x27;t available from other pharmacies (that CVS runs one of the largest specialty pharmacies can make this confusing, but normal CVS probably don&#x27;t stock it if the prescription goes to their specialty pharmacy).<p>They present themselves as helping the patient navigate a complex drug, but in practice this just meant they had a bunch of questions to tick off each time you talked to them. Their outreach and phone tree were both pretty bad, clearly designed for high operator utilization and not customer service.')
