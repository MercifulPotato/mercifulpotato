It&#x27;s exact opposite of natural language, where short sentences heavily rely on context and supposedly shared knowledge to beget correct understanding. And as such short sentences are prone to misinterpretation.<p>A program can also be seen as an awkward natural language, conveying programmer&#x27;s intention to other programmers, of course. But it&#x27;s a different modality of the code.')
