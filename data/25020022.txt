If this is indeed something that happened (despite your use of future tense) I apologize.<p>&gt; If voters want more relevant choices on the final ballot, and vote for the change, that should be fine in a Democracy.<p>If they decided to simply not have elections, because people want all D so what&#x27;s the point, would that be OK in a democracy? (Answer: No, because it&#x27;s not a democracy any more then).<p>I feel this discussion has sidetracked a bit. I think the conclusion is this: in a 2 party system, if opinions shift (due to time&#x2F;demographics&#x2F;fashion&#x2F;talk radio...) then if both parties don&#x27;t adapt, you risk ending up with a de-facto one party rule. And that&#x27;s  not the fault of the party that didn&#x27;t need to change, but the fault of the party that needed to but didn&#x27;t.')
