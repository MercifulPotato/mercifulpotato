It&#x27;s a place very far away from them. Ottoman conquests of the Maghreb had around 40 000 casualties, many of them not of Algerians but of Ottomans and French&#x2F;Spanish soldiers.<p>As for the Caliphate, they certainly did not annihilate any culture before them, and it&#x27;s incredible to equate culture with Religion. The dominant religions there at the time of their invasion were Christianism and Judaism, which were preserved for a long time and are barely different from Islam, and religion is a tiny aspect of Culture. Their impact on the common person is so small that during Islamic rule the vast majority of people didn&#x27;t even speak Arabic.<p>What the French did that was objectively much worse was to create a system where the citizens of the Maghreb were to remain an inferior second class only useful insofar as resources can be stolen forever.<p>As for colonialism in general, which I should remind you is the point, it caused more deaths than WW2.')
