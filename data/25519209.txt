That is certainly possible but it can&#x27;t be argued: Google hired these people under the pretense of letting them do their research free of censorship and, now that they work for Google, this censorship is being imposed.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the rest of this comment is alluding to... The posted article from Reuters doesn&#x27;t mention race and gender, the article implies these researchers focus on AI and ML.<p>In regards to the &quot;specific case&quot;, I would have to guess at what that case might be. Were I to guess, it seems like I&#x27;d be guessing wrong as this assertion seems to lack grounding in fact.<p>Naive or not, peer review is in place and part of it&#x27;s purpose is to keep the biases of researchers in place. History has proven that this is far from infallible, but it&#x27;s the process we have today and the process Google agreed to when it hired these researchers.')
