In the day time we have a lot of excess electricity available from solar where as at night gas and coal plants are used. If everyone starts charging at home more coal and gas plants will be needed to be built which will result in higher electricity prices for everyone as capacity payment parts of the electricity bills increase. Majority of cars are parked in parking spots at work between 9am to 5pm just like they are parked at home for 10-11pm to 7-8am at home. Electricity from solar is still getting cheaper by 15-20% a year most of us don&#x27;t see it in our bills is because of capacity payments that power producers negotiated into our bills.')
