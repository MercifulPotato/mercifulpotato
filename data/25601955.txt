It feels real time, in the moment, theatre of the mind style.  Like the other person is &quot;there&quot; going to respond or review.  Using a different app breaks flow and it is more or less devolved into writing a letter.<p>The comment field is a place shared by other participants.  And the closest way I can articulate it is being similar to how we may express ourselves differently when at home, vs work, or a bar.<p>Because of how this works, I always give benefit of the doubt on edits and intent.  Sometimes reading it a couple times and or that ninja edit makes all the difference in the world.<p>And it is also why I love basic, threaded discussion.  Healthy participants are capable of powerful insights no single member may realize individually.<p>That aside:<p>The real reason I am responding is I find this exchange thought provoking.<p>What can someone interested in thinking with this perspective read, listen or watch to gain a greater grasp of it?')
