Sure, they were used as an instrument of communication but had Facebook not been there people would just use SMS or IRC. The 2002 Gujarat unrest, for instance, predates Facebook. We know what deadly unrest still forms in the absence of Facebook and other social media. I don&#x27;t think we have evidence to claim that social media exacerbates unrest, versus the simple fact that more people are on social media and it&#x27;s becoming a more popular communication tool than SMS.')
