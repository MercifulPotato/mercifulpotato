In fact, even the IAM can be off-prem (Okta). It relieves the maintenance and upgrade burden significantly.<p>Yet, open source + self-hostable services have found a niche. Many organizations can&#x27;t use off-prem for anything remotely sensitive, so they turn to software like GitLab and Mattermost. Interestingly, I have noticed that these self-hosted services broaden their scope to incorporate functionality that might be covered by another service, to reduce said on-prem maintenance burden.')
