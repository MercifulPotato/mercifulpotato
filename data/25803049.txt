Most build systems try to be declarative, but can&#x27;t help to have imperative parts where order of execution matters or when a certain environment variable is set. You have these kind of problems in Gradle and I experienced them in Cmake, Maven and Make as well. At some point you just want to step-debug or have the environment variables print at a certain point during the build. All I want is a build tool where I declare my build by simply calling functions (or extend with custom functions) and if there&#x27;s an issue I want to be able to step through the script and check what&#x27;s wrong.')
