So it&#x27;s not a clear win for native apps (unless the native app is using HTML for UI, I guess).<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think PWAs have a good way to get background data updates, which is unfortunate for apps that could work offline. You can&#x27;t do a silent push to update data, last I checked, anyway. (Use case: I want a weather app that has current&#x2F;recent data without loading when I start the app, because I often start the app in dead zones; also I want to have it background fetch the data when my location changes).')
