They&#x27;ll only look at the tapes if something occurs.<p>And they can claim they didn&#x27;t watch it at all? Total surveillance without specific reason and without information and consent is exactly what the law is trying to prevent.<p>&gt; - Random bag checks, like in programming, is not really random. You either have a particular target or type in mind or you apply it to everyone and bag checks are a lot more invasive than video surveillance.<p>And that&#x27;s the whole point. If there&#x27;s a reasonable suspicion that someone stole something, they can ask to check the bag. The Person has the right to refuse that his bag be checked by company employees and ask to involve the police.')
