This blog does cite the ADA and IAADP though.<p>You seem focused on the bureaucratic hoops and seem to think I want them enforced more strictly? I haven&#x27;t mentioned that. Please evaluate only the words I use. You seem to be making a point about specifics I haven&#x27;t raised.<p>The people acting unethically&#x2F;immorally and abusing the system know who they are when they do it. It&#x27;s why they are so defensive. Selfish people ruining good things, once again.')
