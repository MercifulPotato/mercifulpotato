We&#x27;ve given up on protecting our freedoms, and our devices aren&#x27;t really our own anymore.<p>And you have people like the die hard Apple apologists &#x2F; enablers that think it&#x27;s fine you can&#x27;t build stuff for iPhone without going through Apple.<p>We&#x27;re about to enter a trusted computing dystopia. You won&#x27;t be able to run software on your laptops or desktops, and everything will be tracked.<p>The web was the perfect platform and would have been utopia. Google sunk their claws in and neutered the browser, removing the concept of the URL, forced media companies to use AMP, and crippled ad&#x2F;tracker blocking.<p>Silos like Facebook rank content that isn&#x27;t hosted internally lower, so the open web has atrophied.<p>And iPhone has a shitty browser so it can favor apps.<p>I don&#x27;t hate computers. I hate the grifters and gaslighters that have taken the good parts away and told us our way of thinking is the problem.')
