Tried the Oculus Rift and PSVR. I had to deal with minor motion sickness issues with both. I didn&#x27;t like that there was a lot of setup and physical space involved with keeping them ready. It seems like that&#x27;s gotten better with the Quest 2 but there&#x27;s no trade-in program so I guess I&#x27;m stuck for a while.<p>Here are some experiences I wish I could have:\n1. Virtual presence at a concert or sporting event\n2. More apps or games where I sit down and can move around but still experience VR. Controls seem awkward still for this type of thing. Maybe it contributes to motion sickness.')
