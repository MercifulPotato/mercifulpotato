You couldn&#x27;t go back, delete, etc. And its purpose was exactly what you are asking for - a productivity tool that let you get your ideas written out without getting sidetracked by tweaking, and you could then use another editor at another time to polish it up.<p>At the time, I thought it would be cool to make that a particular mode in an editor - kinda like running vi in INSERT mode without readline, but additionally without all the ^Control characters showing up whenever you accidentally try to do something other than typing straight ahead.<p>Hopefully my description will jog someone&#x27;s memory.')
