A corporation is not merely its stockholders. A corporation is accountable to multiple stakeholders, and it&#x27;s stockholders are just one of many such stakeholders. A corporation&#x27;s employees and customers are also stakeholders, as well as the society and nation in which it is embedded. It is perfectly legitimate for any of the various stakeholders to attempt to influence the behavior of the corporation.<p>If you are for tolerance and the coexistance of different values in society, you will understand that values come into conflict constantly. And you will respect the prerogative of employees and customers to push back when their values conflict with corporation management (who represent stockholders).<p>When you insist that employees must unilaterally disarm by walking away at the first sign of conflict with their employers, you are essentially expressing a class preference. You are asserting that the working class must submit to the stockholding upper class. A corporation requires capital to compete in our economy. And when the top 10% own 80% of the wealth, workers cannot simply walk away.<p>Stockholders can&#x27;t walk away either. They need workers, just as workers need capital. So they will need to find a way to coexist, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there won&#x27;t be conflict. There will always be conflict. The virtue of our democracy is that the conflict is manifested as demand letters and PR statements instead of clubs and bullets.')
