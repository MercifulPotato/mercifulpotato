Horrible news.<p>I remember thinking, it’s so difficult to pick one subject to dedicate your life to. He chose software verification and model checking, and made a ton of advancements in that space. He was also very willing to give credit to the people who helped him and who he built his work on top of.<p>I hope he felt that he made a meaningful impact on the world. That’s all you can ask for I suppose.')
