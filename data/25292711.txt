You don&#x27;t get the same rate of return if you use margin, say, in order to leverage.<p>If you use a 3x or other leveraged fund, then you run into tracking issues (look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etf.com&#x2F;etfanalytics&#x2F;etf-comparison&#x2F;SPXL-vs-SPY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etf.com&#x2F;etfanalytics&#x2F;etf-comparison&#x2F;SPXL-vs-SPY</a>) where you see tracking break down), you can lose everything (remember XIV?), and you have other potential issues.<p>So it&#x27;s not as simple as leveraging up a low-risk portfolio to assume a given risk&#x2F;return ratio.
