Gzip is not bijective. The definition of bijective compression is that an arbitrary bytestream is valid for decompression.<p>To put it another way: because there are some output files that gzip compression can never create (whatever the input), it&#x27;s a not surjective function from the set of possible inputs to the set of possible outputs. For this reason it is not bijective.')
