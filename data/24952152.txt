These days I&#x27;m remote and besides a few relatively early meetings, I&#x27;m pretty flexible so I don&#x27;t really care at this point what effective timezone I&#x27;m in (within reason) over the course of a year. I might even feel at this point that the very minor annoyance of changing clocks and syncing with worldwide DST changes doesn&#x27;t really have offsetting benefits for me.')
