Those are no longer allowed in most EU countries. If they do not comply you are free to cancel your subscription via the bank&#x2F;creditcard by revoking their SEPA permission and reporting them to your local responsible authority.<p>edit: Both my mobile phone, internet and television service I can cancel directly online without problems starting next month.
