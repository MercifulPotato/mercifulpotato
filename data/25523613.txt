The truth is that session cookies do not necessarily expire when the browser is closed.  Indeed they are lost to the browser, but the user can save them to a text file.  If they are truly expired then they should no longer work.  However, in some cases, the cookie in the text file can be reused to avoid login, long after after the browser is closed and across subsequent reboots.  For example, one such case is a very popular webmail provider.  Since the provider now forces users to run Javascript in order to login, this technique can be used to check, read and send mail from the command line using clients that do not include a Javascript interpreter.  There are many other examples where session cookies can be used after the browser is closed to avoid having to keep logging in.  Unless the website is one that logs the user out after a period of inactivity, there is a good chance &quot;sessions cookies&quot; can be used long-term.')
