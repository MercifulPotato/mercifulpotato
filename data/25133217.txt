But I don&#x27;t think, nuclear families are about denying that. It&#x27;s more about having enough space and freedom to see each other when you <i>want</i> it, but keeping off each other&#x27;s backs and not letting the differences between the generations ruin your relations.<p>I&#x27;ve grown up in a typical 3-generational Russian family sharing a rather small apartment, and I can tell you, it gets on your nerves when the grandparents want to watch TV at maximum volume, while the parent is trying to catch some sleep debt and the kid (me) is doing homework in the same room. That was one of the main reasons why I decided to move to the West where having enough private space was considered to be a basic and unquestionable necessity.<p>Please, don&#x27;t romanticize it. If our economy is changing in a way where the corporations are getting richer and richer, while the rank-and-file employees are forced to live with their parents forever and will never afford to move out, it&#x27;s not cool at all. It&#x27;s a sign of very serious economic troubles and we need to focus on solving them instead of trying to think of the changes in a positive way, and then wondering why is everyone depressed.')
