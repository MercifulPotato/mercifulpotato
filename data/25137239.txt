They truly care about developers and they love indie developers. To me this sounds like they took the feedback they were getting from big players pretending to be standing up for the little guy and realized they had a point.  Even though the feedback was delivered in the most hostile way they still saw that small businesses could use a break. This also gives small businesses a chance to afford 15% more in cost per acquisition so it is a little easier to compete with big businesses with larger budgets. Thanks Apple!<p>Disclaimer: I used to work for Apple years ago')
