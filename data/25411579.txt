Which is a win for the US because we have China paying us billions of dollars in tariffs without paying significantly higher prices for goods.<p>Can you tell my suppliers this so they stop passing on 50% of the cost of the tariffs onto me please? They don’t seem to have gotten your memo that the Chinese are paying the tariffs instead of the consumers.<p>I literally have “import tariffs” as a line item on all my invoices that relate to goods manufactured in China. Every single supplier appears to be colluding to increase their profits, if what you’re saying is true.<p>The alternative is that tariffs are actually driving up costs unnecessarily.')
