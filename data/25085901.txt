Yes, you could do those things, but can you do that for billions of people? Going back to the &quot;you don&#x27;t own your computer&quot;-post from yesterday (or the day before?): it&#x27;s not simply a matter of &#x27;the big bar corp did it&#x27;, users that do not or cannot understand technology to a degree that they can also control it generally don&#x27;t have this choice at all. And for people that do have that choice, you also have to choose the ecosystem (be it social or technical). Plenty of people seem to stay on facebook for the same reason.
