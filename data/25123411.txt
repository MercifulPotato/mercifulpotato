Item(by='peterwwillis', descendants=None, kids=[25124611], score=None, time=1605619340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121604, text='A long time ago I suggested a new uri prefix - &quot;secure:&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot; - that would be a synonym for &quot;HTTPS-only&quot;. If you visit a secure:&#x2F;&#x2F; link, every single page load in the session would require strong encryption, secure cookies, etc.<p>The idea was to allow http if needed, and alternately allow strict https if needed, in a backwards compatible way (visiting a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> url would work as before, but visiting secure:&#x2F;&#x2F; would trigger the strict security for the rest of the session). This way you have the best of both worlds and the user (and server) get choice&#x2F;agency.<p>The purpose was to stop MITM. The ability to MITM only requires blocking port 443 and letting the browser fall back to 80; this works even against HSTS because most people will just try other URLs until one works. So you need a way to avoid MITM at least for some specific requests. Banks, e-mail providers, etc would say <i>&quot;type in secure:&#x2F;&#x2F;mybank.com in your browser for strong security&quot;</i>.<p>Another option was a &quot;secure only&quot; button on the browser. It seems they&#x27;re moving towards this. They&#x27;ve buried it in preferences, which hopefully they&#x27;ll change to the front UI. But I still think the secure:&#x2F;&#x2F; links are easier for laypeople.')
