Unfortunately, a lot of people believe that.<p>But how does Tesla sell its cars for double the price of comparable gas-powered autos? How does Whole Foods sell people on $6 tomatoes?<p>Both of those represent a choice to consume less, since inherently if you spend more money on something than you have to, then you have less money with which to consume other things.<p>Yet nobody buying Whole Foods thinks they are “decreasing their standard of living.” Its the opposite!<p>So the very first thing, if you want to pursue change, is get this idea of “standard of living” out of your head. Think of lifestyle instead.<p>Can you sell people on an alternative lifestyle that results in less consumption? YES. This happens all around us all the time.<p>It doesn’t even have to be glamorous. During the world wars, gas was rationed and slops were collected for pigs... people bought war bonds, etc.<p>Free people can and do rise to meet collective challenges when they are well-led.<p>Right now it’s very hard to argue the west (as a whole) is well-led.<p>But things can change.
