They&#x27;re spring steel, but even spring steel is still somewhat subject to plastic deformation with enough cycles.<p>It&#x27;s never gotten bad enough to be a problem with mine, but I&#x27;m still happier to be using magnetic charging cables most of the time. That&#x27;s primarily for the convenience of it, which is significant, but I don&#x27;t mind that they also preserve the connector.<p>(They&#x27;re especially convenient in the car. I have an SE, but even with a phone that supported inductive charging, I suspect I&#x27;d stick with the magnetic-mount-and-cable arrangement - it&#x27;s exactly as convenient as inductive charging, with no risk of compromise on the strength of the mount in order to get one with half a transformer in it.)')
