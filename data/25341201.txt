If they refuse, there can be no punishment. This has gone to the federal courts, and even the Supreme Court, several times. Cops have absolutely zero legal obligation to enforce the law. There&#x27;s no sense in you even trying to disagree with this because the highest court in the land had consistently declared it as the law.<p>On your second point... I agree? Cops are forcing themselves into people&#x27;s homes with the express intent of fucking shit up, that&#x27;s why they enter armed and dangerous, the same as a thief. Is that what you&#x27;re saying? Because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. Do you sympathize with the thief? I don&#x27;t, the same as I don&#x27;t sympathize with the cop.<p>Edit: to clarify - the cop could be entering the home as a neighbor and a friend, and that&#x27;s what everyone would prefer. Unfortunately, cops decided long ago they&#x27;d rather hold onto their right to kill with no questions asked, so now they&#x27;re no better than a methhead busting down a door. It&#x27;s ultimately their fault for this image, and they&#x27;re the only ones that can fix it.')
