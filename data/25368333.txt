Item(by='doonesbury', descendants=None, kids=[25368805], score=None, time=1607563552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367987, text='Right ... the underlying issue here is that we have N entities each with their own IT systems. There is a serious and direct dependency between them in order to carry out daily trading as my custodial example shows. The way out is to have a realtime event feed between the two which requires a common serialization format, securityIds, accounts, etc. etc. Not even JPM or BNY has this so far as I know on the custodian side before we even entertain what trader X&#x27;s company might have.<p>Therefore what tends to happen is ETL&#x27;s where some middle-system imports the trader&#x27;s and custodian views and tries to reconcile. Note these views are often only available after batch processes run at the end of the day ... The problems are ... tons:<p>- Even FIX&#x2F;Swift etc. messages are prone to incomplete interpretation and mis-usage the latter hard to change once it&#x27;s baked in. Setting up yet another format is a huge ask.<p>- Each end of the work invariably has a slightly different data model so even if one did get the data it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a memcmp of two structs at the bottom somewhere<p>- As I say blockchain w&#x2F; POW is not only slow, there are oodles of privacy concerns. And even if you tech&#x27;d that out blockchain would be a Merkle wrapper of something like a CSV&#x2F;FIX&#x2F;Omgeo&#x2F;Swift message ... and what&#x27;s the point then of all that crypto nonsense? Better to have a direct HTTPs connection, and skip the crypto work.<p>However, if counter-parties could somehow get messages from the exchange at the time the trade is done and forwarded something to the trader and counter-party (granted encroaching on the some $100 billion&#x2F;yr custodian business) that might help. Indeed, other writers here make a good point: trading through exchanges is nice. Post-trade sucks.')
