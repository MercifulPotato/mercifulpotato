The prices go down decreasing the margin so the producers put more in the market, pushing the price down further, reducing their margins further, leading to unpayable debts and bankruptcies.<p>An abundance of commodities disrupts the conditions for the creation of profits. Nobody really disputes the overproduction phenomena and consequences. At the macro-scale this can have a contagion effect and cause what&#x27;s called a &quot;general glut&quot; identified by both Smith and Ricardo.<p>We saw that in the shale oil bust just recently. Price controls and making the government the buyer of last resort (for instance, the Commodity Credit Corporation) are remedies for fixing this flaw. They are there because of a fundamental flaw in market economics.')
