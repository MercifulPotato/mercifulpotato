Since then, however, the trends in Russia towards state control over independent press, the politicisation of sports and culture, the blurring of lines not to be crossed (e.g. the annexation of Crimea) and overall clinching of Kremlin power at all costs have made lots of people in Europe worried.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;Russia is the enemy&quot;, for a number of reasons: first of all, it&#x27;s not true; secondly, it&#x27;s not helpful; and thirdly, it obviously breeds distrust and antagonism not only between states but between individual people.<p>But tensions have obviously been rising, and we are not in the pleasant situation we saw 20 years ago when Russia seemed to be heading towards democracy and increased international cooperation. The current regime in Russia, with its increasingly authoritarian and nationalistic pursuits and somewhat erratic foreign politics, has certainly been feeding those tensions. It would be disingenuous to claim it hasn&#x27;t.')
