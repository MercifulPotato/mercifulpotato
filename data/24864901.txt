If you legitimately think your business and all it gives to the economy and community would be destroyed by that proposition then tell that to all the residents of the state - targeted messaging to your employees is just all sorts of shady and, whether intended or not, it will leverage the power imbalance of the employer&#x2F;employee relationship for some people.<p>It&#x27;s pretty much the same reason you should look elsewhere for love - there is an existing relationship between an employer and employee - bringing other relationships into the scenario just makes things murky.')
