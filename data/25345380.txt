But we didn&#x27;t learn the positive lesson - a society needs a controlled way for rebelling for the sake of rebelling.<p>Heavy metal, punks, hippies.. What&#x27;s up today? Now it gets harder and harder to rebel as more and more things are becoming &quot;normal&quot;. So people go more extreme.<p>Soon biggest rebellion will be to do nothing &quot;rebellious&quot;. Go to school, don&#x27;t party too much, stick to classic conservative ideas, maybe go to church (or equivalent), dress in a shirt and jeans, go for family&#x2F;kids&#x2F;house with a white fence.')
