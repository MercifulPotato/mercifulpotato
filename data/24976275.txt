I thought the youtubes of the world did that because of the volume, but hypothetically, couldn&#x27;t they do some due diligence and push back on requests they don&#x27;t think are valid instead of just taking them down and requiring the repository owner to appeal. I&#x27;m sure it would be more expensive for them, but it&#x27;s still a choice.')
