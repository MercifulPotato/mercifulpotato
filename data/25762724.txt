They all started pretty wholesome and pretty great before &#x27;the real world&#x27; kind of seeped in.<p>Early Twitter (in particular) was a game changer for me, who was working from home for the second time in my life. I had people to talk to and bounce things off and all of a sudden work wasn&#x27;t so <i>lonely</i> (as I had been the first time I tried). There was a genuine community feel without all the snark and unpleasantness.<p>I don&#x27;t use TikTok, but I hope they&#x27;ll be prescient enough to see where the others have struggled and keep on top their content policies, communities and moderation.')
