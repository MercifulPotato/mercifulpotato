I occasionaly use it in Swift to clean up resources; s’okay there, I guess, though I’m not convinced it’s better than Python’s &#x27;with&#x27; block. But in C?<p>One of C’s few distinguishing strengths is that the language is relatively† small and stable, and well understood. For that kind of cleanup there is already &#x27;goto&#x27;, which again is small, stable, and well understood. I just used it for that the other day: it works, it’s fine; I’m a grown-up.<p>Yeah, sure, &#x27;defer&#x27; is “safer” and “more elegant”… did we mention this is <i>C</i>? That ship sailed <i>fifty years ago</i>. Don’t try to make C into something it’s not: that’s C++’s job so go fill your boots there instead.<p>I just posted Tony Hoare’s excoriation of ALGOL68 the other day, but clearly it’s needed again:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zoo.cs.yale.edu&#x2F;classes&#x2F;cs422&#x2F;2011&#x2F;bib&#x2F;hoare81emperor.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zoo.cs.yale.edu&#x2F;classes&#x2F;cs422&#x2F;2011&#x2F;bib&#x2F;hoare81emperor...</a><p>Simplest solution: track down the ruddy C standards committee and beat them in the head with a leather-bound copy of Zawinski&#x27;s Law (wrapped around a large gold brick), till either they’re dead or they leave C be. It does what it was designed to do, and that along is reason enough not to dick with it just because they’re bored and struggling to justify their continued existence.<p>The only thing C needs to do is keep on working. That will only get harder the more crap they pile on top. A good artist knows when to stop.<p>Which brings us to…<p>“panic&#x2F;recover”<p>K&amp;R give us strength! Tell these frustrated wannabe language designers to go make their <i>own damn language</i>, instead of screwing up someone else’s!<p>Okay, <i>now</i> I’m done. And get off my lawn!')
