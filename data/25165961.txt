No bespoke file format, programmable API, no need to google for the right journalctl switches, and then of course the advantages of containers and images over processes and system packages. Iâ€™m not suggesting everything should be a container nor that docker is the ideal implementation, but it certainly points in the right direction.<p>Docker was created to give an extra life for legacy applications depending on outdated packages, the concept of gluing all dependencies withing a compressed rootfs and shipping that, with low effort.<p>Docker became popular because of that, but seems that did more harm than good for the ecosystem in terms of security, that why podman might have a great future. The docker interface is bad and comparing that with systemd is quite a stretch. ;)<p>Anyhow, aren&#x27;t systemd units ini files? The journalctl ships with man pages though.<p>Aren&#x27;t containers just processes with namespaces and cgroups?')
