The purpose of writing is to communicate an idea. Something this article failed to do. If there&#x27;s one thing I was taught that&#x27;s most important in writing is be concise and get to the point.<p>This article sure talks about a lot of things, it uses a lot of words, but it wanders aimlessly and doesn&#x27;t focus on anything.<p>There&#x27;s two kinds of writing.
