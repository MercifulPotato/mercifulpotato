From what I&#x27;ve heard the products are also still completely on the same level because it&#x27;s not like Geely just started selling their cars with the Volvo brand, but they keep the company doing what it&#x27;s good at.<p>A counter-example is the German car brand Opel that was recently sold from GM to french PSA. Because the car manufacturer attached to the brand was already largely dismantled all Opel cars are now PSA models - which is rather well known by people who care and also affects the brand.')
