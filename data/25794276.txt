The more people are able to find interesting people on their app, the more they will loose their paying customers.<p>So basically the better they do their job, the less revenue they make.<p>At least they never advertise or tell in their S-1 than they want people to find exclusive relationships. But they are not alone Tinder neither advertise themselves like that, they always use tricky expression like &quot;Bumble empowers users to connect&quot;<p>Today their product is great compare to Tinder (Tinder is more profitable mainly because their product prevent guys to match with girls, don&#x27;t forget that dating apps, the less people match, the more you make money) so they are gaining users. But I bet in 2 years, they will have the exact same profitability that Tinder has today, and their product will be as bad.')
