But at the end of the day, that was the entire market at that time. What sunk Lehman was, in the end, a decision by all of the other big banks and the regulators that they’d let Lehman die because of something that might be best summarized as “lol idk sorry Dick but we’re just gonna let you go and let the Fed bail the rest of us out sorry bro lol.” Like really. That’s how it went behind those closed doors in the lairs of the lizards that control the universe. Lehman had already suffered near-death in 1994 — the world has now forgotten that Dick was the hero that saved the firm back then — and now it was to be made a sacrificial lamb for everyone else’s benefit.</i><p>I thought everyone knew this? It was an open secret that former GS CEO and Sec. Treasury Hank Paulson threw Lehman under the bus only because he was tight with Blankfein and was on bad terms with Fuld. Not to mention, Lehman was a much smaller sonofabitch challenging all the big banks.')
