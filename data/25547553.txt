Engagement is the incentive that drives news now. It takes more effort to get relevant information out of the articles. Headlines feel designed to make me as angry or afraid as possible and once you follow up the story usually turns out not to be as inflammatory as it seems.<p>Up to recently I had been using Reuters, AP, and an aggregator called spectrym.news. These are fairly good but don&#x27;t completely solve problem.<p>Over the last month or two I&#x27;ve almost completely switched over to the current events page on Wikipedia.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Portal:Current_events" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Portal:Current_events</a><p>It&#x27;s amazing! If any editors for that page are reading this, you&#x27;re doing a great job! Thank you so much!<p>That page, and Wikipedia generally are not optimizing for engagement. So the headlines are informative rather than inflammatory. I can get the same amount of information that I used to get from other sources in an extremely small amount of time. Which is what I&#x27;m going for.<p>I want to be informed without investing a lot of time or feeling like I&#x27;m being socially engineered for ad revenue.<p>I had been checking that page and the following up on Reuters, AP, and Spectrym to make sure there weren&#x27;t any big stories that I had missed. While there was occasionally something notable not on the Current Events page it was rare enough that I usually don&#x27;t even feel compelled to check the other sites anymore.<p>It&#x27;s also nice that it&#x27;s organized by day so if I take a couple days off reading the news I can easily go back and see it chronologically.')
