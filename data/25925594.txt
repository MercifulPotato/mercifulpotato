One reason was that quality was never a priority in the professional world. Another reason was that I was working on crap software that would not reach outside the company, and didn&#x27;t accomplish anything good. Another reason was the crazy deadlines that were usually being pushed.<p>Eventually, I unsubscribed my way out, and now I&#x27;m 5000+ commits into a project I love working on, even if it doesn&#x27;t bring in any money.
