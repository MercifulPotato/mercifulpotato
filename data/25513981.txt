However, from the categories you listed I can&#x27;t really name anything. I assume companies like Samsung make the things you mentioned, but I&#x27;d have to look it up. I certainly can&#x27;t think of seeing an ad for any of them (except toothbrushes).<p>There are only a few brands of toothbrushes in supermarkets here. I&#x27;ve seen ads from them, but the reason I know the brands exist is because I&#x27;ve used their toothbrushes or paste. In the store I pick whatever&#x27;s cheap.')
