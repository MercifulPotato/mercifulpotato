In some there isn&#x27;t.  Where I live, no chance, people who have found unoccupied patches and built on them tend to eventually have their property destroyed by government.<p>So maybe you&#x27;re thinking, move countries.<p>Nope.  A lot of people in the world are prevented from moving to countries they&#x27;d like to move to.  Heck, sometimes married couples are prevented from being together.  It&#x27;s a pretty restrictive world.')
