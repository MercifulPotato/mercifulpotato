Two 28&quot; displays and an ergonomic keyboard vs a 14&quot; laptop, a rack full of synths and a large keyboard vs a DAW and a tiny keyboard, a full workbench with dozen power tools vs a contractor chest, etc.<p>When you have to spend an equal amount of time in two workplaces, you have to invest equally in each. Either you (or your company) spend twice as much on a nice setup in two places, or, more probability, you have two half as nice setups in two places.<p>Also, if your workplace is routinely used by someone else half of the time, you both waste time and energy on putting things right, adjusting screens, chairs, desks, etc.  You either learn to do it in a reproducibly perfect way, or make do with what you&#x27;ve managed today.<p>Some permanence has certain advantages.')
