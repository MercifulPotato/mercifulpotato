They made it personal and could have handled it more gently. But then again i have a bias towards TESLA and im more inclined to trust press release  by lawyers which is legally admissible. There is no doubt she was traumatised by the sudden nature of it all. although i hope after all this PR spotlight she will have her name cleared and one of the many HN comments who are disgusted by the way Tesla handled this will recommend her for employment in their organisation.')
