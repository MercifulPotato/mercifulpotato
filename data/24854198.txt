Usually the equations we use are simplified and contain a lot of subtleties when you dig into them.<p>In fluid dynamics for example the Navier–Stokes equations are infamous because we don&#x27;t understand all the theory behind why they work. They are used all the time despite not being fully understood.<p>Semiconductor behavior is another area, the Band Gap models used to describe them incorporates a lot of quantum physics nuances involving Fermi–Dirac Statistics and wave functions and the like.<p>At some point when you do work in Engineering you are &quot;high enough&quot; up in the stack you can use simplified abstractions and trust that what is underneath is acceptable.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen software engineer has these abstractions as well, process switching sounds like one of these cases.')
