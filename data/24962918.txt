Discoverability is great in modern GUIs, for example a photos app on a mobile device. There are lots of options and they’re all mostly independent and needed in different cases. So it’s great you can just get started, click around at icons that look familiar and get results.<p>I would argue that this doesn’t apply specifically to text editors. 95% of all text documents are paragraphs with headings and inline formatting. With styles and display codes, WordPerfect lived up to its name. You could get the document looking perfect, exactly the way you wanted it. WYSIWYG editors look nice and could get you started quickly, but anything more than a letter turned into a mishmash of styles and fonts and spacing. The now-infamous ribbon in Word lets you discover and apply all sorts of formatting, but what you really want are consistent paragraph styles. Word perfect guided you into using those styles because the UI was restricted in just the right way.')
