If some 3rd party clones your token and uses it to commit a crime there is no way to prove that happened.<p>There are other solutions.  Being able to make one key a proxy for another is one.  That allows you to keep your master identity in a bank vault, and then use it to &quot;sign&quot; the one you keep on you during the day.  Should you lose your daily driver, just sign another one.  This still suffers from the &quot;one true name&quot; problem though - if someone steals that bank vault ID, you&#x27;re gone.<p>Another approach is servers allowing a client to register multiple ID&#x27;s, and later delete them.  Since there are multiple ID&#x27;s, there isn&#x27;t one true name any more.  If one is lost you cancel it, and replace it with another.  The approach is already built into the FIDO2 protocol, so they&#x27;ve already thought about your concerns and solved them, and IMHO solved them in a better way than you propose.<p>A more robust approach still would be a combination of the idea above: FIDO2 multiple ID&#x27;s solution, plus proxies.  One key could then provide multiple ID&#x27;s to every server you log into, signed by different masters that are stored in different places.  Keys can&#x27;t be copied, but a lost key can be replaced by signing it with the master.  A compromised master can be have all it&#x27;s ID&#x27;s dropped by logging in with an ID proxying other master.  You could think of it as RAID for 2FA&#x27;s.')
