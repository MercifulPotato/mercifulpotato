Car drivers never had a problem with me, It seems that I never disturbed the apparently so important car traffic, they just passed and went their way. So what exactly was the purpose of the bike lane?  Clearly, to kick me and other cyclists out of the way because they didn&#x27;t like us. That is just plain discrimination. And I am not saying that I don&#x27;t facilitate passing when safe for me to do so. I think we cyclists have to do that. But the bike lane is just obnoxious.')
