(The first time, it was an offer directly in response to a ShowHN I&#x27;d posted; the second is harder to explain since it comes down to a series of calls&#x2F;emails with the guy who hired me, and the fact that my unimpressive formal schooling was in stark contrast to everyone I worked with.)<p>In any case, during that time I&#x27;d turned down many inquiries sent to me by people potentially interested in hiring me, and the only places I applied to I was hired at.<p>More recently when I&#x27;ve tried applying for positions it&#x27;s like my portfolio is irrelevant. Where previously those projects were met even with astonishment at times, and frequently with what seemed like genuine curiosity, now it seems like people are more interested in &#x27;gaps in my resume&#x27; (where I was in fact working on more research or entrepreneurial software projects).<p>What&#x27;s strange to me is that I wasn&#x27;t particularly young during the first phase I spoke of: I posted the ShowHN that landed me my first real startup position when I was 27 (I&#x27;m 34 now)â€”so it&#x27;s not like people&#x27;s reactions to my projects were about it being impressive &#x27;for my age&#x27; or something.<p>It seems like more and more the work I&#x27;ve done on my own on is irrelevant or even seen as a negative, while more traditional resume items take the forefront.')
