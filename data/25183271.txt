Assume work hard and reach some level of prosperity, enough to have a big house, and afford kids. You pass your values and knowledge to them, try to raise them according your understanding of what&#x27;s best.<p>The very next moment the social justice kicks in. Your kids are labelled privileged. They will be demoralized at school and told to hate themselves. They will be penalized when trying to apply to top academic institutions, denied promotions at work, and constantly guilt-tripped.<p>Instead these positions will be split between those who get them via connections, and the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; people who will pose a much lower political threat to the &quot;connected&quot; group.<p>So unless you are a part of the hereditary elites, whatever wealth you have created, gets erased in the next generation.')
