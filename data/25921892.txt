I&#x27;m fairly sure it&#x27;s a compliment, though, so thanks!<p>&gt; it&#x27;s remarkably shorter than an old-fashioned LCD alarm clock in which an alkaline battery could last for months.<p>It certainly is, but an LCD alarm clock is much less fabulous, since it has to be pressed or otherwise activated to produce light, and that&#x27;s my main need here (a clock that I can read in the dark without moving).<p>&gt; it&#x27;s remarkably shorter than an old-fashioned LCD alarm clock in which an alkaline battery could last for months<p>That&#x27;s a good suggestion, but it loses some of the &quot;set it and forget it&quot; factor, and I will very definitely forget it (especially when there&#x27;s no low voltage warning). I have some ESP32 boards with a built-in charger, so that&#x27;s more hands-off. Also, the length of the clock is shorter than a 18650, so I&#x27;d have to make the clock larger and the screen would look even smaller in comparison. I appreciate the suggestions, design is fun and getting feedback from others makes it even better!<p>&gt; cheap LiPo pouches have an annoying tendency to puff up and go bad<p>Oh, don&#x27;t worry about that, they&#x27;re all already puffed up.')
