I don&#x27;t know F# very well but I understand it is very close to OCaml which I know quite well. F# also has algebraic data types, match, type inference, static type checking, etc. I don&#x27;t know if C# supports all this, but if it does its probably thanks to the existence of F# on the same .NET platform :).')
