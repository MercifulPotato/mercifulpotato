If the incentives had been to welcome such genetic experimentation in a <i>controlled</i> manner then regulators would have noticed the predatory behaviour of the velociraptors <i>before</i> it became a problem.<p>Again, it&#x27;s about risk&#x2F;incentive management, not about judging those who dare to go too far. The T-Rex will eat you even as you shake your fist at its unethical re-creator. Better to not merely hope that everyone chooses the friendliest route by virtue of human nature.')
