The big retailers ask for this so that you can&#x27;t use their fake &quot;price match guarantees&quot; because the model number is different between stores.<p>For example, the TV I bought at Fry&#x27;s was the same as a model at Wal-Mart, but with one fewer HDMI input.  Another TV I bought (again at Fry&#x27;s) was the same as a model from another store, but with the built-in DVR disabled.<p>That leaves the burden on you to figure out which model was in Consumer Reports by matching up the features.  It&#x27;s annoying, but possible.')
