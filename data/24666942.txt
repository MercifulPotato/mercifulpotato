The most common misconception by far, was that fat is converted to energy. The problem with this theory is that it violates the law of conservation of matter, which all chemical reactions obey.<p>For reference, if losing 10 pounds of body weight corresponded meant it was converted to energy completely, that would produce  about 4 * 10^17 joules of energy. That’s equivalent to 95 megatons of TNT (or two Tsar Bombas) or 111 million megawatt hours.<p>&gt; The only thing in food that makes it to your colon undigested and intact is dietary fibre (think corn). Everything else you swallow is absorbed into your bloodstream and organs and, after that, it’s not going anywhere until you’ve vaporised it.<p>This is an oversimplification; if digestion was 100% efficient, feces would be sterile. I think there are even bariatric surgeries that work by making the digestive system less efficient.')
