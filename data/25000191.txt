It’s obvious to me that TSMC would rather produce tiny Apple chips and AMD Zen chiplets to for yield and wafer space efficiency. We all know that smaller rectangles pack better into circular wafers than big rectangles.<p>Apple could have made the A14 much bigger and faster than the A13, but they chose to cram more chips on the wafer, which I speculate they did to have more wafers available for their bigger upcoming iPad and Mac chips.<p>I think you have it backwards on margins. Per square mm it’s clearly more expensive to produce an A100 die than an A13 or Snapdragon SoC due to the wasted die space and need for golden samples on the Nvidia side of things where they’re not selling any cut down dies in GeForce cards.')
