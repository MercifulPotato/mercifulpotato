People can say awful things against their opponents and get praise from people on their side. People on the other side have clapbacks as their only means of response.<p>Although Hacker News is by far the least toxic social network I participate in, I notice recently there has been a higher degree of toxicity.  Increasing the weight of a downvote relative to the upvote could improve matters.  It could be done as perhaps a week-long test to see if the community likes it, if it should be adjusted, or if it should be removed all-together.')
