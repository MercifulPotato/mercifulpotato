I feel  bad about comments like this. Kids are the greatest gift and I cherish every second with them. Getting to spend more time at home with them has been a god send. I feel like so much of this comes from a lack of control when people feel (for some reason) like they should be able to &quot;control&quot; their kids. Maybe let go of the control thing and just enjoy your time with them?')
