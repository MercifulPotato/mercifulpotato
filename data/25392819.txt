It&#x27;s entirely possible that not many people making $900 per week go to Seattle, and when they do I bet they don&#x27;t stay at the Hilton.<p>Agreed though, it&#x27;s hard to price in the potentially massive hassle of a bad Airbnb. I think most people treat the probability as zero until it happens to them personally.')
