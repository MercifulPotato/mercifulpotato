Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608001693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425971, text='&gt; I can go on and on and our country will be bankrupt before we’re done.<p>Isn&#x27;t that a shame, well at least we could then hold our heads high.<p>&gt; But hey, at least you’ve taken responsibility for the actions of others.<p>The title is encumbered. For the same reason that laundering money doesn&#x27;t make the original theft disappear, its not ethical or moral to benefit financially from atrocities then launder the money and pretend that nothing can be done.<p>Are you really so sure that once the ill-gotten gains are subtracted from this country&#x27;s wealth there would be nothing left? In that case how could you ignore such widespread and lucrative immoral heritage?')
