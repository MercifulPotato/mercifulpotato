Sounds like it could be one of two things:<p>1. Chrome only showing the domain in the address bar<p>No, I doubt it&#x27;ll make any difference here. Google&#x27;s reasons for doing that are anti-fraud, not anything to do with AMP. And (I&#x27;ll give up shouting this into the void one day, I swear) Apple did this with Safari years ago and no-one cared. It&#x27;s outrage for outrage&#x27;s sake.<p>2. The whole &quot;web packaging&quot; format issue<p>Google proposed a standard that let you &quot;fake&quot; the URL of a page (albeit with cryptographic signing to ensure it actually came from the right host). This might be dead in the water, yes. Mozilla and Apple already came out against it, and one the primary use cases was AMP. I doubt Google will un-implement it any time too soon, but I think it&#x27;ll end up being a weird edge thing that very few people care about or use.')
