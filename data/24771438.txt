It would be as though people started using &quot;the die is cast&quot; to mean dying, simply because the word &quot;die&quot; is in there, without any knowledge of Caesar. Is there any idiom -- not a single word, but a full phrase -- whose meaning has changed over the years, simply by virtue of its being misunderstood by the linguistically inept or the historically ignorant?<p>Sure.  But if we told them, they could care less about it.   Or, um, couldn&#x27;t care less about it.')
