Basically like &quot;status message&quot; in good ol&#x27; IMs, except a) made from pictures or videos, and b) self-destructing after 24 hours.<p>I personally hate them as a concept, but that&#x27;s because I generally don&#x27;t like <i>transient</i> things on the Internet. Given their popularity, however, I&#x27;m guessing that more than half of photo sharing activity on social media is through such self-deleting broadcasts, leaving no trace and no ability to catch up on it. Which is probably why the platforms like it - it exploits FOMO to keep you checking the app <i>every day</i>.')
