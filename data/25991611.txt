I’m tired of `font-family: Some Fancy Sans, Helvetica Neueueue, Helvetica, Liberation Sans, Arial, Droid Sans, sans-serif` and the likes. Mostly you should just go with `font-family: Some Fancy Sans, sans-serif`, and revel in not knowing what the fallback font actually is, because you’re following the user’s preference (well, for the small fraction of users that have expressed a preference, anyway; but we’ll probably appreciate it).')
