You stay inside for 3 weeks and it will literally end the respiratory illness unless there&#x27;s another reservoir you&#x27;ve failed to account for.<p>Non-compliance however kneecaps the ability of lockdowns to be effective, leaving you in a worst-of-all-worlds situation with a damaged economy and a largely unaffected disease curve. I would say the better way to frame that is:<p>- &quot;lockdowns only work if you actually take them seriously&quot; (as evidenced by countries that did: NZ, TW, CN, AU -- look at their graphs [1], they work).<p>- and &quot;lockdowns may not be necessary to achieve sufficient results.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aatishb.com&#x2F;covidtrends&#x2F;?location=Australia&amp;location=China&amp;location=New+Zealand&amp;location=Taiwan&amp;location=US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aatishb.com&#x2F;covidtrends&#x2F;?location=Australia&amp;location...</a>')
