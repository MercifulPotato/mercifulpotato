And I would hate to be looking forward to 2+ hours of being with someone after I figure out that I&#x27;m no longer interested in the person within the first 5 minutes of a first date.<p>Dinner following the movie gives you all sorts of opportunities to screw up and then you still have the task of finishing the meal. Bad table manners, getting messy food all over your face, making odd eating noises and the list goes on. Leave all that until after your date is already much into you.<p>Best date? Coffee. Explicitly tell your date that you&#x27;re going to be out after one cup or 15 minutes, which ever comes first. If the date goes bad, then either party only needs to wait 15 minutes or drain the coffee and run. It&#x27;s only 15 minutes of conversation to fill. Memorize a list of questions if you have to. Then try to improv on the questions and the following conversation. Don&#x27;t have anything to say? Let the date answer the questions. Date is answering quickly? Then make sure you create lots of questions. Or maybe the conversation just isn&#x27;t that interesting and you should drain your coffee.<p>Repeat for date #2<p>Then you can start getting more creative after that.<p>Date doesn&#x27;t like that the meeting was so quick? There&#x27;s plenty of fish in the sea.<p>Edit: Yeah, I&#x27;m not a dating advice guy. Sorry about that. I don&#x27;t know where this came from. I guess the point is to make those first couple of dates quick and also easy to bail on.')
