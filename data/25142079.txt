Just to take colours, for a moment. Ordinarily I might define semantic classes, let&#x27;s say &quot;primary-nav&quot; or &quot;prominent-action&quot; and apply them to relevant things (and use relative selectors for things inside them, etc.). So if I want to change the colour of all prominent-actions across my web app, I just do it in one place. This seems to be demo-ing adding a particular colour class to everything I want to be that colour. So... If I change my mind, what now? I have to find all those places and change the applied class? Search and replace?<p>This seems like the literal opposite of the clean separation I always understood to be the point of styling being separate to markup...')
