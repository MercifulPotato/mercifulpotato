Scrounged up a Firewire card for my Linux machine and started recording.  The files sit on my hard disk(s) to this day, interlaced.<p>tape1.dv: DIF (DV) movie file (NTSC)<p>VLC plays these with the interlace jaggies (on horizontal motion) pretty well masked but you can see that something is going on.  Mplayer shows them in their original jagged glory.<p>Anyone know a reasonably optimal way to deinterlace these (without sacrificing half the vertical resolution) and turn them into some &quot;normal&quot; 480p type of thing?  With Linux tools of course.  Maybe the article had the answer but it&#x27;s hugged to death already...')
