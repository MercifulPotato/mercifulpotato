The Guix installer script also stops if it detects an existing installation, and has done so since the initial commit:</i><p>You&#x27;re right about this, apologies. What I intended to convey was that Guix hard bails on an install so can&#x27;t be scripted as part of a &quot;dotfiles up&quot; on a new system. Nix gracefully bails and can therefore be scripted.<p>&gt; <i>This can happen when your installed locales are from a different glibc than what the guix-daemon was built with. Upgrading and restarting the daemon will solve it.</i><p>This is from 5 minutes ago. I have both <i>glibc-locales</i> and <i>glibc-utf8-locales</i> installed:<p><i>&#x2F;gnu&#x2F;store&#x2F;29jhbbg1hf557x8j53f9sxd9imlmf02a-bash-minimal-5.0.7&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.utf8)</i><p>&gt; <i>If you are complaining that the installer verifies the GPG signature of a file it downloaded from the internet, I don&#x27;t know what to say. :-)</i><p>Speaking strictly from the perspective of a desktop end-user, this should probably be rolled into the one-liner.<p>And, as I&#x27;m testing, I also notice that even for operations which require no changes, a <i>guix pull</i> takes 5 or more minutes over the equivalent nix operation. Why am I building guix-system for 5 minutes with nothing to be done?<p>I urge you to take all of this as friendly advice from someone who fits into the market category of Guix&#x27;s next million users. How you capture them is by removing the barriers to entry, streamlining the package management process, and massaging over papercuts that a brand-new user won&#x27;t have the patience for.<p>&gt; <i>The system installer disk image does give you an option to create an EXWM system (as well as GNOME, Xfce, etc).</i><p>This is awesome. :-D')
