Item(by='astrophysician', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610468013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742541, text='&gt; I think you&#x27;re missing the central point, which is that computation is observer relative. Anything can be interpreted as a computational process.<p>I see what you&#x27;re saying, and maybe I am misunderstanding your point, but to me it seems like you&#x27;ve gotten yourself bogged down in wordplay when there is something much simpler going on: say I have a human named Bob from Des Moines, and next to him is a machine constructed to approximate Bob to arbitrary accuracy (this is possible because Bob is a made up of a finite number of particles&#x2F;wavefunctions). Are you arguing that there&#x27;s something special about Human Bob? If so, what is your argument for that? The two are &quot;indistinguishable&quot; and by that I mean whatever threshold you have for two things to be &quot;indistinguishable&quot; (practically speaking), you can technically make a reproduction of Bob that satisfies that threshold.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s circular reasoning. The point is that qualia are not something which, in principle, can be the subject of computation. There is no way to represent the fullness of sensation itself, like the redness of red or the softness of silk, as information. So how can our brains be &quot;computing&quot; it?<p>I would argue <i>this</i> is circular reasoning. &quot;There is no way to represent the fullness of sensation itself&quot; -- yes I would argue there is: whatever time-dependent set of physical states make up this &quot;realization&quot; in your brain.')
