Firefox makes Mozilla money (through search provider sponsorship), and therefore needs to be a company to receive that revenue. Nothing else Mozilla does makes them money, and therefore nothing else they do needs to be a company. What would you imagine the Mozilla Corporation exists to do, if not to make money from Firefox (and then plow that money back into Firefox development)?')
