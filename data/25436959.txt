It forces everyone to work in overdrive. It&#x27;s plainly not a personal contribution&#x2F;performance bonus at all. If CDPR makes a bad hire that causes a delay (even outside of development, like marketing?), then everyone suffers for that from a lack of a bonus.<p>This is particularly shitty when combined with the stress and demands and low pay of the game industry as it is.<p>Also, super curious if the tokens can be forged. Can I just show up at the end of release with 50 tokens and cash in? Surely they were tracking it elsewhere, making the tokens useless.')
