The pain of trying to play AIV and DIVX files 15 years ago was generally miserable. To me VLC saved me from codec hell on, iirc Windows ME, and I&#x27;ve never looked back. Downloading and installing codec packs back then felt like it was a dice roll to getting a virus. It was also the only player I&#x27;ve used that could easily play FLV videos back then. Honestly, VLC is the only software I shove on friends computers if we&#x27;re trying to play video.')
