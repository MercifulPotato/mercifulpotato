Multiple new strains will be around at the end of next year, some of which will not be protected by the vaccines. Many more countries, specially those under the Chinese influence (which there will be more of), will not shut down or have travel bans or vaccines or have any measures against the virus.<p>- The vaccines will kill people at a higher rate than the pandemic, mostly by other diseases than COVID (because the immune system is a very efficient adaptive model, if you bias it to be effective against one thing, it will be at a cost of losing effectiveness against most of everything else), and vaccines will be considered very successful.<p>- Bitcoin will have lowest value in the year around Christmas time next year, but it will still be around the lowest value this year. It may reach much higher before it drops.<p>- Most American big tech companies will lose significant value. At the same time, a few like Microsoft and Tesla will be completely unaffected.')
