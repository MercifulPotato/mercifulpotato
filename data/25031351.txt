If you feel Trump voters&#x27; voices are muffled in NY or Biden voters&#x27; voices are muffled in Texas, I agree wholeheartedly and would be strongly in favor of proportional allotment of electors at the state level.<p>The electoral college, however, serves the explicit purpose of making Wyoming votes count more exactly because they are extremely disadvantaged when attempting to impact federal policy. The same argument against the electoral college could be made against the Senate (why should every state get the same number of Senators?), but I don&#x27;t hear too many disagreements (yet, at least) that the Senate as an institution has value.<p>The top four states have roughly a third of the national population; if federal policy were enacted purely by population, why shouldn&#x27;t they allocate all federal funds to themselves and deprive other states entirely? The Senate and the electoral college give enough of an advantage to small states that, even though no one or two small states are liable to flip an election by themselves, they are still able to have a voice in federal policy by coalition-building.')
