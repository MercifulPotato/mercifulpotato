And if you fall outside of them, bad luck.<p>Still, at work we find it easier to deploy and interoperate with other tools than Pytorch. Hell, we have a guy working in Pytorch who converts his work to ONNX so that we can then connect those to some tooling we already have from back when TF was our only backend.<p>Could there be a better way? Perhaps. But we have to ship models and TF &quot;just* works&quot; (with a big asterisk, yeah).')
