Games can be labeled as a cause of problems by parents and society alike.<p>A. Like smartphones and VR goggles, devices themselves are not harmful. It’s unhealthy to become dependent on them. I want children to experience many things, like playing outside, reading books, and learning more. Balance is key. It’s almost as if video games are attributed as a source of crimes, but it’s a result of becoming obsessed or losing touch with people. It’s wrong to blame social problems on a device.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Source: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rickyreports.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;miyamotoshigeru&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rickyreports.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;miyamotoshigeru&#x2F;</a><p>I appreciate his views, but I find it rather ironic that while Miyamoto points out the violence in other video games, even Miyamoto&#x27;s creations involve some degree of cartoon violence. (e.g. Mario stomping on Goombas, Link stabbing his sword and breaking vases)<p>&gt; (Miyamoto) expressed sadness at the number of people Bond shoots down, and suggested to him that, during the end credits, he make the player visit each victim in their hospital bed<p>Hideo Kojima did this in Metal Gear Solid 3. During a boss battle, the boss would conjure up the souls of those who fell to the protagonist Snake. Snake&#x27;s movement would slow down because of the ghosts surrounding him. One of the most harrowing scenes in video games history.')
