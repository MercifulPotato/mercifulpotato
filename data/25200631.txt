How can anyone take these people serious after they ended up hard forking?<p>They literally had to go against everything they said and stood for by manually intervening or throw the investments of thousands under the bus. Either you&#x27;re a decentralized system ruled by consensus or you have top-down hirarchy but you can&#x27;t claim both. They proofed that a human would intervene any time the proverbial sh!t hits the fan which makes them no better than an expensive but centrally controlled set-up of an RDBMS.<p>Ethereum is snake-oil and if I see a CV that says blockchain without making crystal clear what they&#x27;re doing in that space it goes immediately in the recycle bin.<p>There literally are no valid use-cases (other than buying heroin) in crypto today. And anyone who peddles this stuff always looks like a shill. the tragic is that all this sounds like hyperbole until you realize the same is true for all the BS ideas that got (and still are) peddled since 2017 (wink-wink nudge-nudge $iota the blockchain that isn&#x27;t one and that manages to invent the only hash-function which isn&#x27;t collision resistant).')
