Insurance companies absolutely abhor risks that are affecting large portion of their customer base at the same time but only rarely. Re-insurers offer some help, you can talk about some special investment vehicles where insurance companies can offload those kind of risks off their books, but in the whole, I think it is quite safe to assume that insurnace market for  those kind of risks would be seriously broken.')
