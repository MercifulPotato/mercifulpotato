As described the man had to spend his entire savings on this defense.<p>The court system worked correctly, in that the judge told the prosecutor to produce more evidence. The charges were dismissed.<p>So we have the &quot;happy&quot; ending of a man whose life has been turned upside down, whose financial situation has been ruined, and who has had to spend his time and effort defending himself rather than contributing to society in a positive way. All because facial recognition <i>was</i> used as the only piece of evidence.')
