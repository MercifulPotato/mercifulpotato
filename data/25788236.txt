That will probably work to a degree but these streamers are so pervasive it&#x27;s hard to see how UFC will make a real dent. Over this year&#x27;s college football season, not only have I seen many pirate streams pop up on YouTube, but have had YouTube&#x27;s own recommendation algorithm recommend them to me even though I&#x27;ve never searched for them. Simply being a person who watches legit YouTube channels on the subject of NCAA football was enough to get these streams recommended to me. That&#x27;s pretty much zero effort piracy enabled by YouTube. Sports organizations can go after YouTube for this kind of thing but that it exists even in a controlled platform like YouTube doesn&#x27;t bode well for them.')
