I think Apple uses all of those as a sign of &quot;suspicious&quot; activity. Whoa, a pro user, that&#x27;s suspicious! Jokes aside, I do all of those and had some problems with Apple ID (not as bad as you described) that went away when I temporarily disconnected the VPN, DNS set to 9.9.9.9 and Apple services where whitelisted in Lulu firewall for macOS. But also possible it was connected to the outage and some caches kept being evicted.<p>Side note: To me it seems a lot of people rushed to activate their new Apple devices on the Christmas day.
