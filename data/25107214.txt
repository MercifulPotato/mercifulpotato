At that time, I had been using Emacs for a bunch of years. One day I decided to cross over to the other side.<p>I hunted down all the readily available open-source Vi implementations, downloaded them and compiled them all. I tried Elvis, Nvi, Xvi, Vim and a couple of others I don&#x27;t remember.<p>Vim was the best, by a long stretch, so I continued with that. I found the built-in tutorial very handy; I went through that, and within a week I was proficient.<p>A couple years later, I started seeing Vim in GNU&#x2F;Linux distros as the default Vi implementation.')
