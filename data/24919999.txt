I was not a Helpdesk or Desktop tech, but worked supporting servers -- they sent me over to do the installs because invariably &quot;something wouldn&#x27;t launch&quot;.  Different IDEs were used depending on what language you were writing in with this monster of an app that was used to write programs in Visual Basic[0].  And the program was 5-10 times larger than the largest installed application and came with 2 CD-ROMs worth of documentation that needed to be installed locally[1].  I remember I&#x27;d start all of the installs at the same time because they took several hours to complete.<p>[0] If it isn&#x27;t obvious, this was a one-off job that I don&#x27;t recall very much about.  I didn&#x27;t start using a Microsoft IDE until the first release of Visual Studio .NET (retroactively renamed &quot;Visual Studio .NET 2002&quot;, I think).<p>[1] For the younger among us, that&#x27;s about 1.5GB in a world where two years earlier 16GB of HDD was very expensive.')
