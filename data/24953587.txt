Over the course of three hours, the drivers took control more than a dozen times, including at least two cases when the car seemed to be on the verge of crashing into another vehicle.&quot;</i><p>In a way, it&#x27;s good that the Tesla system sucks so badly. If they had a disconnect rate of one per month, drivers would trust the thing.<p>The other guys, disengagements per 1,000 self-driven miles in California:<p><pre><code>    Waymo,  0.076, or one per 13,000 miles.\n\n    Cruise, 0.082, or one per 12,000 miles.\n</code></pre>\nNot clear how many of those would have resulted in a crash, as opposed to just stopping. Probably not many, the California autonomous DMV reports indicate. US humans have a crash rate of one per 508,000 miles driven.<p>Anyway, Tesla does not have &quot;full self driving&quot;. They have slightly better Level 2. Not even Level 3. You&#x27;d think that by now they&#x27;d have hands-off freeway driving totally automated to a better than human level of safety. But no.')
