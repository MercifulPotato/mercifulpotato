Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609135924, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551544, text='Presumably, at the earliest stages of language acquisition, the brain is learning to group similar sounds into phonemes.  The brain performs a clustering operation on sounds, and needs to learn in a language-dependent way which variations in sounds need to be ignored and which variations are important.  For instance, many Japanese and Koreans have a hard time distinguishing between R and L because the range of sounds in English are a single phoneme in Japanese and Korean.  Similarly.  Apparently also the closest phoneme in Korean to English&#x27;s F roughly covers the space of both P and F in English, leading to &quot;Waffle&quot; being pronounced as &quot;wapple&quot;.  I&#x27;m a native English speaker and it took a while to un-train my brain to filter out differences in tone in Mandarin and Thai.  Thai also has a sound somewhere between T and D that I had always heard as T, until my wife was horrified that I was pronouncing the name of a king as the name of a controversial politician.  My Thai wife has a lot of trouble hearing the difference between CH and SH.  I remember seeing a public television show where they tested the ability of children to distinguish between two phonemes in Navajo that sound identical to most English speakers.  Beyond a fairly young age, it took longer than the duration of the experiment (I presume several hours) for children to learn to distinguish between the two Navajo phonemes.<p>I&#x27;m not a developmental psychologist, but it seems like early on, you&#x27;re just throwing phonemes at the child to allow them to learn to cluster the sounds so that later stages in language processing don&#x27;t have to deal with as much noise and variation.  I suspect that as long as you&#x27;re not switching up the phoneme rules on your kid (T&#x2F;TD&#x2F;D vs T&#x2F;D, R&#x2F;L vs L, tonal vs. non-tonal, etc.), the actual words used early on don&#x27;t matter.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not a developmental psychologist, but my guess is that before the brain gets phoneme clustering down, there&#x27;s too much noise and irrelevant detail being passed along to later processing stages for the brain to make much progress in learning higher-level details of language.')
