First, understand that the project requires multiple tests results from each exponent - I believe it needs a triplicate confirmation (ie 3 different computers have to run the same test and all have to match) At some point, they developed a new, different algorithm that can do the check in one go (but it&#x27;s more expensive computationally). However, most of the pre-existing work was done using the type of calculation that needed the triplicate check.<p>There were a lot of exponents where some computer claimed one of the &quot;verification tests&quot; (ie it was already rejected as a prime, but we needed 2 more computers to verify), but then stopped mid way (it&#x27;s pretty common since these primality tests take about 3-5 days on a modern fast threadripper - so it could take up to a month on slower machines from years ago).<p>It&#x27;s very unlikely that these exponents signified primes (since they were already verified to NOT be prime by 1 computer, and it&#x27;s just the rechecks that are pending) These abandoned exponents formed a huge amount of &quot;leftovers&quot; that people didn&#x27;t want as work units because they are most likely not prime, and if you were hunting for primes, these are not the work you want to do.<p>So at some point, the project said they wanted a big push into picking up abandoned re-verifications and giving them a much higher priority to computers that could complete the test in a few days [either by finishing off what was left of the triplicate check, or by using the new algorithm that just needed one pass] - thus getting them out of the queue once and for all for good. If you have a fast computer (ie modern day i9, threadripper, xeon, anything with AVX512, etc) chances are you were assigned this type of rechecking task unless you rejected the work units.<p>It&#x27;s not just the gap you noticed in June, this whole project of looking for and verifying old exponents has been ongoing for the bulk of 2020.<p>Another idea is that the project is always trying out new number techniques and algorithms and always looking for new instruction sets to use etc - a change or tweek in algorithm could cause this kind of &quot;pause&quot; as well, the client computers don&#x27;t make the shift all at once (there&#x27;s likely some verification, where a small subset of clients run both algorithms in parallel to see if the results are the same, etc) and then machines are moved onto the new algorithm as verifications are complete, etc.<p>EDIT: As I wrote this post, I started remembering more about the different algorithms the projects used. All of the text above can be check with the prime95 forums, where they discuss these algorithm changes, the push to re-verify, etc.')
