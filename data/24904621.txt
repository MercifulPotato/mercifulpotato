We were trying to do GPU-based automatic video editing at a time when the Microsoft OSes were evolving rapidly, so were the NVidia and other drivers, and OpenGL itself .. with varied support for &quot;optional&quot; features .. not to mention that machines+OSes weren&#x27;t yet 64-bit by default. The testing team had a great setup to cover a lot of ground, but there&#x27;ll usually be something stumping us. It was also a time when people were moving to <i>slower</i> and smaller machines - like mini notebooks - where they&#x27;d expect to run muvee on the Intel integrated graphics chip at full screen res. It was also a time when video was graduating to HD and codecs weren&#x27;t fast enough and 320x240@15fps wouldn&#x27;t satisfy people any more. We needed 720x480@30fps at least for the previews and taking the GPU route was a no brainer due to that.<p>It was a case where we&#x27;d raised people&#x27;s expectations so high (what&#x27;d take an editor perhaps a week to do happens in about 5 seconds with muvee) that unreasonable performance expectations became the norm :) You can, in seconds, try variations that would cause an editor to pull her hair. To top this all, the &quot;constructor&quot; which is the heart of the product had to be tested against many variations in media and styles.<p>The details of that journey is probably worth another talk on its own.<p>muvee released muSE as open source btw and you can find it here - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;srikumarks&#x2F;muse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;srikumarks&#x2F;muse</a> . .. and it is (I believe) still usable in the &quot;Reveal Encore&quot; product.<p>edit: ... and along the way, muvee also built the first mobile automatic video editor which shipped on the ROM of early Nokia camera phones such as the 6630 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile-review.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;nokia-6630-camera-en.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile-review.com&#x2F;review&#x2F;nokia-6630-camera-en.shtml</a> .. scroll down to the &quot;Movie Director&quot; section)')
