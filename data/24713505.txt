In case of the mirror, you see what&#x27;s BEHIND you, because the stuff in front of you is blocked by the mirror, no? And just to be clear, by &quot;you&quot; I mean your eyes, and in particular the direction your eyes are looking at.<p>Now in contrast a photograph never shows what&#x27;s BEHIND the camera (now that would be kind of funky, don&#x27;t you think?), but - just like your eyes - only captures what&#x27;s in front of the lens.<p>And there&#x27;s your difference.')
