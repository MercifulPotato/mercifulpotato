And that&#x27;s true nearly world-wide. People have never been better off or worked fewer hours at the median. In modern - affluent - society, it&#x27;s that people have become soft, weak, fragile. The times are not harder, they&#x27;re easier. People in affluent nations have never been more coddled and protected.<p>What demands are you talking about? Influencers pressuring people to have whiter smiles on Instagram or better abs on TikTok? Someone getting their feelings hurt on Facebook?<p>In the US things were dramatically worse for the bottom 1&#x2F;2 as recently as the 1970s and earlier. Look up the poverty and hunger rates&#x2F;issues in the US across the century from 1870-1970. It was barbaric compared to now. The same is true for violent crime, homelessness, and so on. The past 30-40 years have been amazing compared to the past and that holds true for the most of the world. In affluent nations you have a vast number of exceptionally spoiled people that have known very little suffering.')
