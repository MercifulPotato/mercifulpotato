That&#x27;s the danger of exponential growth.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine doublings:<p>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.<p>If total capacity is 100, the moment that capacity is less than 20% used up, we&#x27;re 2-3 timesteps away from using over 100%. It is a very dangerous gamble, and controversial decisions are made or not made and the worst part is that, when you do the safe thing, you have no way of being certain or explaining that the bad thing would have or could have happened, because &quot;it&#x27;s only 20%&quot; and that looks small.')
