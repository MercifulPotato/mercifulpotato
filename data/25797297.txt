I would genuinely be curious what you come up with. Personally I do not think it would be possible to do in an intuitive way.<p>&gt; Someone who is just getting started in a new programming environment shouldn&#x27;t need to know the ins and outs of a dozen different tools, especially when those tools are used to solve problems that user has not even conceptualized the existence of yet.<p>For some more complicated environments yeah it is hard to get the environment up and running. Python environment hell is a very really thing. But if you want a a simple environment to write a simple program is it trivially easy to get one up and running.<p>I am on computer I’ve never downloaded python on. I just googled python IDE. Clicked on the top result, pycharm. Downloaded latest release clicked next 4-5 times without looking at options. Opened it. Agreed to some TOS. Clicked new project and then clicked next without looking at any settings. Then I clicked the big green run icon. It printed “Hi, PyCharm”.<p>Python is a beginner friendly language and if I wanted to start programming it is probably the recommendation I would get. I did not have to know anything to install it and start programming.<p>And even easier if I want to do front end development I just go to codepen.com and that’s all I need to do!')
