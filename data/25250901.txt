That&#x27;s all true. Also with a drone you need one that&#x27;s big enough to carry at least several pounds of explosive...to handle an armored vehicle and the likelihood the detonation would be not directly next to it. You&#x27;d need FPV or something so you can guide the drone in close. Also vehicles could be moving at a reasonable place, so the drone would need to be fast enough to keep up&#x2F;catch up.<p>Could it be done? Totally. Are there easier&#x2F;cheaper ways? Totally.<p>Heck an RC Car ala Call Of Duty games would be more realistic.')
