Or I find sources outside of the big tracking companies, like openstreetmaps instead of google maps, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not a promiscuous browser, if I click on an interesting link and I get an empty page because it insists on javascript I close that tab and figure I saved myself from wasting my time on a crappy ad-tracking-infested website, so many of which are lame anyways.<p>That being said I do sometimes enable javascript temporarily on sites when I am desperately looking for some specific bit of info, then I reset back to my default-off when finished.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this for a couple&#x2F;few years, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal to me. I&#x27;m happy to have that reminder that a site is irritating me insisting on javascript for no good reason, more often I go elsewhere and that suits me fine. It saves me from having to worry about so many nefarious things that go on in this space.<p>Why not give it a try? Ublock lets you default disable all javascript and enable it on the page you are looking at with a couple clicks, and edit&#x2F;revert your list of rules whenever you want. You might be pleasantly surprised at how few times you need to fiddle with it after you set it up for your important sites.')
