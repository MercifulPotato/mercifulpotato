This has made things so much easier! We only have to gift something to a single recipient, making it less costlier, simplifying the gift idea hassle, and allowing us to focus less on the &quot;shopping bonanza&quot; and more on just enjoying our time together, etc.<p>I can&#x27;t recall exactly why we started this &quot;tradition&quot; during the Great Recession but it was my Mom&#x27;s idea...the funny part is that one might assume that one of us was hit by the recession (e.g. job loss, etc.), and that&#x27;s why we started it...but thankfully none of us was negatively impacted. So, it wasn&#x27;t because of any impact to any family member.  I wonder if my Mom was just being prudent ahead of time?  In any case, these secret Santa things are a good idea, not just for friends but also for family!')
