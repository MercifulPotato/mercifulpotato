But there’s a simple charitable reading as well. Gebru has recently and very publicly developed a reputation for behaving with hostility toward colleagues. Google is a company that prizes (or at least claims to prize) psychological safety of employees. I can see all of this being the chain reaction caused by a number of her coworkers expressing that they were unwilling to give an honest opinion about her work if she would be able to tie it back to them. If an ordinary employee caused their coworkers so much concern they would probably already have been dismissed, but Gebru is especially talented and was high-ranking.<p>I imagine some reviewers extracted agreement from management before giving negative feedback on this paper that the “anonymous” in “anonymous feedback” was a promise. This explains the unusualness of the situation, why the feedback flowed though a special HR channel, why specifically management was unwilling to let her have a written copy of the feedback (that could be closely analyzed to de-blind the reviewers), and why management accepted her resignation and the resulting fallout rather than agree to de-blind the reviewers.')
