Item(by='Proziam', descendants=None, kids=[25667668, 25666809], score=None, time=1609986750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661629, text='Here&#x27;s what I can say from where I sit as someone who did not vote in this election.<p>For the sake of intellectual honesty, I&#x27;ll post this on my main account. Strong odds it doesn&#x27;t go well, but transparency is worth striving for.<p>I have seen [3,4,5]quite a bit of evidence that there was at least some fraud taking place, and that the evidence of that fraud has been suppressed. Whether the fraud was enough to change results, no clue. I have also seen people attacking the character of everyone presenting or talking about said evidence, rather than addressing the actual content of the claims.<p>The above is concerning, but it doesn&#x27;t lead me to believe an election was <i>stolen</i>. However, the narrative that&#x27;s being played out is that Joe Biden, a 78 year old segregationist who was crucified publicly by his now running mate Kamala Harris for those policies, and who basically <i>didn&#x27;t campaign</i> or hold rallies, and who has [0]received most of his money from the &#x27;upper class&#x27;, won nearly <i>12 Million</i> more votes than Barack Obama in 2008. He did this while [1]winning in <i>substantially fewer counties</i> than Barack Obama.<p>However, most importantly, the majority of the lawsuits have [2]not been addressed based on their merits but have instead been dismissed based for procedural reasons (e.g. legal standing, injury). As a result, there has not been a transparent process through which the evidence that has been presented has been addressed.<p>One would expect that these dismissals, and the evidence presented would have become major news. That has not happened, and that leaves people who have seen some of the evidence or who have heard about it feeling concerned.<p>Now, I&#x27;m hesitant to bring up the Hunter Biden story because the media narratives on it are hyper-polarizing. But, many of the claims about the contents are true and some (many?) of the videos and emails have been leaked. This story was smothered by social media, just like the election-related concerns. This has led to a complete eradication of trust in the media as a whole by a huge portion of the population.<p>- PERSONAL OPINION -<p>The issue is not what happened, the issue is that we have become divided. Until we have more transparency we will not see people coming back together. There is no way to fix the division until the concerns of both sides can be addressed publicly, transparently, and without media (including social media) interference. Seeing videos of <i>raw footage</i> being marked as misinformation by twitter eradicates whatever trust people had in them.<p>This election cycle, and the way the media is operating, reminds me of the way we found ourselves in the middle east. Everyone <i>knew</i>([6,7]except our allies) there were WMD&#x27;s until there weren&#x27;t.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020-election-trump-biden-donors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020-election-trump-biden...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;fact-check-joe-biden-won-most-votes-ever-and-fewest-counties&#x2F;3865097001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;fac...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;dec&#x2F;10&#x2F;donald-trump-has-lost-dozens-election-lawsuits-her&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;dec&#x2F;10&#x2F;donald-trump-...</a>  (CTRL+F &quot;lawsuits been disposed&quot;)<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov&#x2F;Home&#x2F;ShowDocument?id=1896" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clerkofcourt.maricopa.gov&#x2F;Home&#x2F;ShowDocument?id=1...</a><p>[4] <i>DISCLAIMER</i> I am aware of the bias of the individual presenting, but the content is what is important here. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XH9ihoLi1NA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XH9ihoLi1NA</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;veritasvisuals" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;veritasvisuals</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2003&#x2F;03&#x2F;31&#x2F;who-lied-to-whom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2003&#x2F;03&#x2F;31&#x2F;who-lied-to-wh...</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Niger_uranium_forgeries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Niger_uranium_forgeries</a>')
