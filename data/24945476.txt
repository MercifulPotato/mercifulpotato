I quite liked working with Clojure at the time. My previous experience had been:<p>1. PHP<p>2. JavaScript (browser)<p>3. JavaScript (Node)<p>The introduction to functional programming was eye opening to me, and made me a significantly better programmer. Working with ClojureScript, on the other hand, was painful. Numerous hours-long debugging sessions where I discovered I was passing a different type to core functions than I expected, causing wildly unexpected and baffling errors. Reporting issues and having them closed with &quot;wontfix&quot; because &quot;don&#x27;t do that&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s what led me to TypeScript. And then of course the IDE. But I carried what I learned from FP with me. And now, having learned a powerful type system, it&#x27;s made me a much better programmer still.')
