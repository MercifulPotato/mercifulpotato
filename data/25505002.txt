Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=[25505165], score=None, time=1608634503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504972, text='Sony&#x27;s A6000 works perfectly well, but I recommend you also grab a NP-FW50 dummy battery as it will drain the battery even when plugged in via USB over time.<p>If you want better sound, grab the A6600 which can also sport the XLR-K2M microphone adapter.<p>Regarding HDMI capture: the Blackmagic DeckLink card series works just fine in a Thunderbolt case (at work I run a 2x A6000 system + external HDMI input).')
