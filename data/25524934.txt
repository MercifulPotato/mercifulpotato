Posting because I hope other SDEs read this; there is strength in voices.<p>I absolutely will join a strike if Amazon lays off unionizing unskilled workers <i>en masse</i>.<p>The pay is good, but I think you&#x27;re missing two things.<p>(1) A large portion of Amazon SDEs leave after a year or two <i>anyway</i>.  (The lack of vested RSUs in the first two years is typically compensated with an equivalent sign-on bonus, which pays out with each paycheck.  So the vesting schedule doesn&#x27;t particularly incentivize sticking around for no other reason.)<p>(2) Many Amazon SDEs (like that of any FAANG) are millenials, who skew progressive: worker rights are an issue I think many feel strongly about, and many probably have friends who are part of the unskilled labor pool or gig economy.  We know if it weren&#x27;t for software, we&#x27;d very well be in the same boat.')
