If I pitch a talk on homeopathy  to the American Medical Association&#x27;s next conference I fully expect them to reject me. Even if I was a fully credentialed M.D. - much less someone with just an undergraduate degree - I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to compromise with me.<p>Why do we not treat our general discourse similarly? Why don&#x27;t we demand a minimum threshold based on, say, the same criteria we use in a court of law: internal consistency, causal-based, preponderance of evidence, etc. If one can&#x27;t meet this minimum threshold then the others incur a penalty: being robbed the time and attention for those ideas that meet and exceed the threshold.')
