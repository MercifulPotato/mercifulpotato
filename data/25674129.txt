It would be simple cost minus benefit, without regard to technical merit or project milestones or other silly process-based evaluation. This is the opposite of most companies. Generally promotions have to do with the size&#x2F;cost of an employee’s piece of a project, not the benefit. Managers would be fighting to reduce their team sizes. I don’t know how you would back-propagate value though.')
