If you&#x27;re not an expert on concurrency, you might just share mutable access to a regular bool variable between threads and use it in that way (as in the article) and nothing would tell you it&#x27;s wrong. You wouldn&#x27;t <i>know</i> you <i>need</i> a specific library (or just &quot;to use std::atomic&quot; in this case) until you encounter the weird runtime behavior, try to debug it, try to formulate a google query that describes the bugs&#x2F;code well enough, and find the answers.<p>&quot;Hand holding&quot; (i.e. rejecting programs that don&#x27;t conform to more advanced correctness rules) is great. It&#x27;s what computers are good at. It&#x27;s foolish not to use computers for this!')
