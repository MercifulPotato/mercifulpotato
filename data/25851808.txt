Cropland area in the US covers 367 million acres in the US [0]. Even assuming that vertical farming is 10x more land efficient, the amount of resources (steel, power, plastics, etc.) needed to convert 36 million acres of land into vertical farms would have a staggering ecological impact.<p>Just covering that area with a 22 gauge corrugated steel roof, without any supporting structure, would be about 1.35 billion tons of steel [1], or about 75% of the entire world&#x27;s steel production for a year.<p>There are definitely products that would make sense to grow in vertical farms (eg. high value crops like tomatoes or bell peppers, which are already grown in hothouses in certain areas of the country), but staple crops tend to preserve for a long time, and wouldn&#x27;t see as much of a benefit from vertical farming.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nrcs.usda.gov&#x2F;wps&#x2F;portal&#x2F;nrcs&#x2F;main&#x2F;national&#x2F;technical&#x2F;nra&#x2F;nri&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nrcs.usda.gov&#x2F;wps&#x2F;portal&#x2F;nrcs&#x2F;main&#x2F;national&#x2F;tech...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=36000000+acres+*+(9.28kg&#x2F;m%5E2)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=36000000+acres+*+(9.28...</a>')
