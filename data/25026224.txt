Your comments are a mixed bag. Saying Trump brought war to American soil for example isn&#x27;t anywhere near true and also inflammatory.<p>2. Some of them are insightful but ires one side without delighting the other. The result is you get a downvote from those who are annoyed and no support from the other side.<p>I&#x27;ve been hit by this a lot. Don&#x27;t care to much.')
