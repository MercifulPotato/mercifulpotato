Though, I have to say, going from software to hardware was quite magical: You can suddenly affect the <i>physical</i> world, which is amazing. Plus, if you already know software, adding hardware to the mix rounds you out very well, and opens up a large array of things you can make.<p>&gt; Plastic or machined parts have always felt out of reach so I&#x27;m not in the habit of believing I can fix things that way yet.<p>I very strongly recommend designing a few things in OnShape or FreeCAD or SoveSpace and getting a 3D printer once you get the hang of that (it shouldn&#x27;t take you very long at all, maybe a few evenings).<p>Machined parts I find pretty hard, but then again I also found plastic things impossible before getting a printer and they turned out to be quite easy.')
