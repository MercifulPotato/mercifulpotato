But in &quot;De Zwart&quot;, the &#x27;D&#x27; is the first letter, and therefore capitalised, even if it normally wouldn&#x27;t be.<p>There might be an exception to that if that letter is not part of a whole word. &quot;De&quot; is a word, but I once knew a guy whose last name was <i>&#x27;t Zet</i>. The &quot;&#x27;t&quot; is not a word (it&#x27;s short for &quot;het&quot;, the neutral version of &quot;the&quot;, whereas &quot;de&quot; is gendered[0]), so probably wouldn&#x27;t be capitalised[1]. Now imagine 200 countries and languages with exceptions like that and imagine having to write software to handle all of that correctly. This stuff was never a problem before the internet, but I expect the next century is going to see a lot of simplifications in language.<p>[0] Yeah, in Dutch, there are two articles: &quot;de&quot; which is gendered, and &quot;het&quot; which isn&#x27;t. Compare to French &quot;le&quot; and &quot;la&quot;, which are both gendered, one male and one female, and there&#x27;s no neural article. In Dutch there is, but the gendered article doesn&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s male or female; it works for both and doesn&#x27;t actually care about gender, just that it&#x27;s there. So it&#x27;s gendered in a neutral way. Wrap your head around that.<p>[1] This is also true at the start of a sentence: always capitalised, except when it&#x27;s not a complete word. If you start a sentence with <i>&#x27;s avonds</i> (&quot;in the evening), you capitalise the &#x27;A&#x27;, not the &#x27;s&#x27;, which is actually the last letter of the archaic possessive &#x27;des&#x27;.')
