I noticed this when I changed my router to use NextDNS, which blocked the IKEA lookups. I was ready to return the device as broken until I realized this. I&#x27;ve also had issues with Bang &amp; Olufsen speakers in the past, and inclined to believe it&#x27;s for the same reasons.<p>I think it&#x27;s insane that devices can effectively be bricked if they can&#x27;t phone home. It&#x27;s nothing short of waste, and I think environmental legislation should require device manufacturers to supply ways of disabling or overriding these mechanisms such that devices can continue to operate regardless of whether home servers are blocked or otherwise out of reach, e.g. company goes belly up, censorship etc.')
