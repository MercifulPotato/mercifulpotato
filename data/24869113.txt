I did read some of it (I &#x27;owned&#x27; it in Adobe PDF form) before getting sidetracked, then my copy turned into a pumpkin when Amazon retired the Adobe DRM servers shortly after they introduced the Kindle.<p>Anyone interested in Vinge&#x27;s annotation scheme can get a sense of it from this interview with Norwescon [1], which includes a screenshot of his working draft for <i>The Children of the Sky</i>.  Short answer: he writes in Emacs, and uses a convention to incorporate reviewer comments, annotations, and his own tags intermingled with the actual text, and has a set of text processing tools for navigating it.<p>Edit: I just remembered a bit of trivia some readers might find interesting: there was a whole minor character he cut fairly late in writing, who survives in fragments &#x27;commented out&#x27; in the annotated version.  I think it might have been one of Ravna&#x27;s fellow librarians at Relay, and he cut the character to streamline the storytelling.  I think there might have been notes from his early readers supporting the decision too.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norwescon.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;norwescon33&#x2F;vingeinterview.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norwescon.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;norwescon33&#x2F;vingeinterview...</a>')
