But you need to somehow account for revenue above and beyond the amount of liquor you’ve actually served. So my hypothesis is that money laundering bars just pour stronger drinks than fully legitimate ones, or tolerate more “shrinkage” in general.<p>(According to a bar manager I once knew, bars inherently have higher shrinkage than other businesses anyway; in bartending, you don’t get fired for stealing the occasional bottle or giving away free drinks to your friends because every bartender will do one of those, but if you do both you will get fired. I don’t consider this guy a reliable source, but it seems plausible; stevedores were notorious for liquor theft prior to the invention of shipping containers, so why not bartenders?)')
