Think of it like a new sort of power tool. And it&#x27;s true there are a lot of steps for triple-A engines, but most gamedevs (like myself, once) simply don&#x27;t have any art assets, and need them greatly; a tool similar to MSPaint for models might enable the next Notch to emerge more easily.<p>On the other side of it, from the triple-A point of view, automating even one of the steps you mention will be a huge time saver. Artists tend to worry about machines replacing them, but I think it will only unlock more, better art. You&#x27;ll be able to do so much. So there is a big financial incentive to get this right; the first one to capture the market will be in a strong position.')
