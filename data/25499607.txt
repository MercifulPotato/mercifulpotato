Google is pretty clear that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to build cars, but rather develop sensor suite and software for self driving that can be installed in partnership with manufactures. Producing cars, on the other hand, is a much more complex operation than producing consumer electronics, even though Apple can afford it. Battery, setting up service centers, repairs and so on are complex. But I really hope they can pull it off.<p>Not to mention when it comes to self driving technology Apple probably lags Waymo by a number of years.')
