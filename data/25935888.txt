They also mostly use those words to describe themselves, and do it more as a nod to boiler room talk&#x2F;4chan.<p>&gt;Sometimes on the Discord server there are just people spamming the N word for no reason.<p>As far as I know, a lot of that is done by bots, though possibly set by other users to prank the discord.')
