So at least in terms of above-board money flowing around, they investigated and saw nothing untoward.<p>So, is it a he-said, she-said? No. The texts can&#x27;t be verified as they came from a laptop that no one can prove actually belonged to Hunter Biden.<p>From an outside infosec perspective, without the whole picture, it looks like the laptops are a mix of what happened with Podesta&#x27;s emails (hacked by a foreign intelligence agency in a disinformation campaign and laundered through WikiLeaks to make the lot seem credible) placed on a physical device and dropped off in a place with a tip-off to a susceptible target (Rudy Giuliani).<p>There&#x27;s no evidence Hunter Biden (a Delaware resident) traveled traveled to a no-name retailer in a city he doesn&#x27;t live in (!) to get laptops that were in-warranty (!) repaired there instead of the Apple Store (!), where they offered to do many, many hours of labor backing up those laptops for only $85 (in New York City?!), and then Hunter forgot the laptops and left them there (!) even though they contained allegedly damning images, allegedly child pornography, and allegedly damning business records detailing financial ties between his father and a foreign power, and that it just so happened that the retailer was active on social media as a Trump supporter (!) and somehow knew how to get in touch with Rudy Giuliani (!) to convey these laptops to Rudy, where they then sat for nearly 10 months unpublished (!). Even by the loosest standards for an evidentiary chain of custody, that&#x27;s pretty bad.<p>Rudy Giuliani also tweeted out alleged &quot;text messages&quot; from this laptop that were pictures taken of a blackberry showing a screenshot of a WhatsApp conversation, and in the top left corner of the screenshot showed a Russian telecom network.<p>Example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mikeemanuelfox&#x2F;status&#x2F;1319282091519922182" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mikeemanuelfox&#x2F;status&#x2F;131928209151992218...</a><p>So, no, I don&#x27;t think these claims are in any way credible. I think it&#x27;s very unlikely that Hunter Biden would do those things, and I think the entire story beggars belief. That&#x27;s why the story was shopped around to multiple outlets, that&#x27;s why the New York Post was the only to go forward with it, and it&#x27;s why the Wall Street Journal&#x27;s coverage of it was incredulous because the only records they could verify contradicted these wild accusations.')
