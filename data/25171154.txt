Assign dollar amounts to each course and course hour with a set amount per degree. Oh there will be gnashing of teeth of that I am sure but you can damn well bet colleges, and good ones at that, will create the programs by which they can rest assured of steady pay.<p>Now this may end leaving some degrees and courses by the wayside and this is a correct outcome.<p>Finally we should rethink how we treat endowments and tax breaks many colleges, private or public, receive. Many of the same receive very large property and other tax breaks which then fall upon the communities they are based in to make up by taxing the public.')
