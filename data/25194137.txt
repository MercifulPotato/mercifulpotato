But &quot;political&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily bad.<p>No, I assume that by &quot;quarrelsome people with pet issues&quot; you mean bad.  I thought that was pretty obvious.<p>&gt; In other words, to make something political is often to exercise power at the expense of others and to justify it by portraying your action as serving to overturn a status quo.<p>This is &quot;speech is violence&quot; level nonsense.<p>If someone challenges a status quo that you like (&quot;makes something political&quot; in your parlance), then actually defend that status quo.
