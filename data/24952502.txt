They are not the only measure but part of a set of small actions that are easy to take and -together- work.<p>For some further evidence, see Hong Kong;  \nNearly 8 million people live in some of the densest city of the world; from day one, hkers have been wearing masks en masse and implementing cleaning precautions -not just hands but also doors and lift buttons, etc;<p>The result is an infection rate proven to be extremely low: 700&#x2F;M infected and 14&#x2F;M deaths. That’s about 1&#x2F;40th the rate of the US.  \nThis without hard confinement.<p>There have been additional measures to stop the importation of the virus, like enforced quarantine and intermittent closures or early closure of some businesses.<p>There has also been a mass test of more than 1.5M people with only about 40 cases found, so the infection rate _is_ really low.<p>What has not happened because of the mask? no deaths, no marked increase in hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses or infections caused by masks, no-one got carbon dioxide poisoning...<p>Is wearing a mask pleasant? No, it’s a pain in the a<i></i> and I was quite sceptic at the beginning. I still think we may be overdoing it a bit in HK since there is so little infection, but no-one here is ready to live another SARS, so people do what’s right and don’t complain.')
