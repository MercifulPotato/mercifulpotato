They problem is we took our interlinked document space and built thin client applications on it.<p>Our crosslinked thoughtworld for intermingling intellects in practice is mostly an entertainment and shopping platform.<p>Really they probably should have split off when it was young ... Replacing HTML with something for the original lofty goals and leave the html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js triumvirate for the mainstream use we all see now.<p>Then there becomes no pretext that there&#x27;s any intellectual, educational, or documentarian use for the web because there&#x27;d be something else, let&#x27;s call it the Yeb for those purposes. It&#x27;d get two way linking, ontological markup, a WAIS like querying system (where the document author explicitly sets the search up separately from the document), etc.<p>But that never happened and the web has way too much inertia to successfully fork it at such a fundamental level without a monumental multi-year effort so here we are with one set of standards trying to serve all masters at once by layering stuff on top of each other, building a bigger russian nesting doll to stuff our existing web into (could you imagine if say jstor or citeseer required a &quot;yeb browser&quot; because it served content that was fundamentally incompatible with the web standards. Could have taken off in 1995 but not now)<p>The only engineering results those conditions ever produce is complexity since it inherently, by design, lacks the focus to remove it.')
