If you take &quot;200 miles of range&quot; as the hurdle to be cleared, then all those manufacturers you mentioned have exactly one model each that can acheive that. Except BMW who&#x27;ve got nothing with that range. Tesla have four.<p>I take &#x27;200 miles range&#x27; as the kindof benchmark of seriousness. Its easy to make EVs with 100 miles of range, we&#x27;ve had those for a decade. They have their uses as town cars but 200+ miles is much more useful.<p>The other challenge is to deliver that range at a reasonable price.')
