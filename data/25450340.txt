It&#x27;s a mix of free software under various licenses and logos and other oddball things that are protected by trademark or copyright and are non-free (the non-free part is mostly icons and images identifying the system as RHEL).  There isn&#x27;t a lot of that, but it all has to be separated out to be legal to redistribute.  If you go through all the work to do that, you wind up with the equivalent of CentOS.  But RHEL&#x27;s customers don&#x27;t have the incentive to do that work.')
