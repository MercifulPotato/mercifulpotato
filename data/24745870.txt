Item(by='soraminazuki', descendants=None, kids=[24745885], score=None, time=1602425237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745760, text='&gt; And why don&#x27;t you look at my comment talking about the header?<p>1. You only mentioned about it in an edit, it&#x27;s disingenuous to suggest that I intentionally ignored it.<p>2. It says &quot;DuckDuckGo News&quot; even before you scroll down the page.<p>&gt; You seriously think more than 10% of Internet users recognize the DuckDuckGo logo?<p>I find the accusation that DDG is engaging in &quot;astroturfing&quot; when they clearly identify themselves ridiculous.')
