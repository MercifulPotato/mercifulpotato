As a non-voter, such people being &quot;disenfranchised&quot; doesn&#x27;t really bother me, and is a small price to pay for Americans collectively being able to have confidence in their election results.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dmv.ny.gov&#x2F;id-card&#x2F;get-non-driver-id-card-ndid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dmv.ny.gov&#x2F;id-card&#x2F;get-non-driver-id-card-ndid</a>')
