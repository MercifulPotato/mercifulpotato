Others may be willing to have that argument with you, but I know how those go: Someone says something about another industry&#x27;s use, you say something about slow databases, they say something about another use case, you say something about why bitcoin&#x2F;blockchains are not the best solution for that use case, rinse repeat.<p>The amount of energy <i>without detailing the source of energy</i> is not a valid argument to support any argument you have about why it is being used. Move off of it, or criticize the sources in a more nuanced educated argument. It should be 100% renewable or part of a sustainable solution, not only will you get further in your argument by focusing on the market participants that actually are wasting industry, you will also be helping!')
