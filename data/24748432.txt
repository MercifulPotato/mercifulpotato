And then I feel embarrassed, because if I cringe, then I start to think how many other people would cringe if they would read it.<p>Trying to hedge against all these outcomes results in an unhealthy high level of expectation that my writings be timeless that it cripples my writing to the point that I stopped writing a long time ago. Any tips to overcome this?')
