It didn&#x27;t matter how many more phones all the other companies were selling compared to Apple - they were all about to become obsolete.<p>It took Blackberry like another 4-5 years to realize this, too, because they were still seeing a lot of growth in other countries where the iPhone and Android devices weren&#x27;t selling yet or people hadn&#x27;t heard much about them.')
