Item(by='Seb-C', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611153520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25836886, text='Brave is getting more and more my attention lately. I didn&#x27;t migrate yet, but I am very impressed. The freshness and innovation reminds me of Opera in the early 2000.<p>I have been a loyal user of Firefox ever since I quit Opera (ironically for it&#x27;s shitty extensions catalog at the time compared to Firefox), but now I am very frustrated by its lack of meaningful progress and the way they break things and regress quite often while ignoring the feedbacks of the community.<p>Firefox for Android is a joke, the tabs still behaves in a weird and confusing way, and half a year later I still don&#x27;t have my extensions back.<p>I&#x27;m also tired by the non-integration of the Chromecast on PC and the fact that it is not even possible to get this as an extension since they killed the ecosystem years ago and didn&#x27;t give back the features as promised.<p>Recently the synchronization stopped working on my Android, and like always with Mozilla, the only solution you will find from them to fix a bug is to reset your profile and loose everything.<p>If Brave implements extensions for Android, I&#x27;ll definitely migrate and quit Firefox.')
