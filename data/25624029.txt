Is it a setting in the bios? Or can it be done runtime?<p>On AMD, it&#x27;s a utility you run.  I believe you may require a reboot to apply it.  On some Intel platforms, it&#x27;s been settings in the BIOS.<p>&gt; It sounds interesting if I can run a beefy rig as a power efficient device, for always-on scenarios, and then boost it when I need.<p>This is what the processor is doing internally anyways.  It throttles voltage and frequency and gates cores based on demanded usage.  Changing the TDP doesn&#x27;t change the performance under a light-to-moderate workload scenario at all.<p>Ryzen Master lets you change some of the tuning for the choices it makes about when and how aggressively to boost, though, too.')
