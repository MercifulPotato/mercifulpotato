We launched the mvp a month ago.<p>With Bomi you can create an unlimited number of routines and you are notified when you need to apply them, you can track the products on your virtual shelf (when you opened them, you are notified near the expiration date), you can browse a database of products and you can add products to your wishlist so as not to save information all over your phone. \nWe also want to add a statistics module in which you can view the progress that your skin has made lately.<p>Here you can find more details: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bomiapp.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bomiapp.com&#x2F;</a>')
