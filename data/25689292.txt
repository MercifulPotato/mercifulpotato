Analogies are a stupid form of argument, but I&#x27;m trying to surface the problem here somehow. (In this analogy they&#x27;re not the conference call provider, they&#x27;re just the phone service provider which enables you to use the conferencing service over their lines, if that wasn&#x27;t obvious. They&#x27;re a pipe.)')
