Suppose I&#x27;m writing a program that uses autoconf, and it detects that someone is trying to compile my program on an Amiga using gcc 2.95. Well, awesome for them if they make it work, but I&#x27;m not willing to put in any effort to support that in my code.<p>What are the long tail of variants that people actually care about now? 32- vs 64-bit, OK, sure. 36-bit? No way. Big- vs little-endian, sure. PDP-endian? Miss me with that.<p>It just seems like the number of variations that people plausibly care to support is a lot shorter than it use to be. Why should the autoconf gang work themselves to the bone making sure their stuff works correctly on a platform that no one but a platform&#x27;s maintainers actually cares to target?<p>I&#x27;m not unsympathetic to people using old or odd systems. I&#x27;ve got some bizarre stuff squirreled away in my attic. I don&#x27;t reasonably expect anyone but me to put effort into keeping my SPARCstation 5 limping along, though.')
