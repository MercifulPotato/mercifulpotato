Even if you intercept a bunch of smiley faces followed by a wink, how do you figure out the contents of the message when the medium to decode is completely unknowable?<p>It was only when they captured a few Cuban spies were they able to break the number stations operating out of Havana but this is perhaps the only case in history.')
