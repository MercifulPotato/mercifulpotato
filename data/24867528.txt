For a simple example, considering something like a movie download - doing it from the home IP means a form letter information request from a lawyer to the ISP. Doing it through a VPN means an international request for legal support is required to get the name behind the IP. Costly and time-consuming and perhaps even impossible depending on jurisdiction.
