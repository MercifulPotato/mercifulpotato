Predicting climate change in broad strokes is not statistical guesswork, it&#x27;s just applying physics.<p>Likewise, we know apps are addictive because they are actively being designed that way. Maximizing user retention and engagement is what app developers <i>do</i>. It&#x27;s how they make money and it&#x27;s one of the core metrics that investors use to estimate the value of an app.<p>So you have someone showing signs of addiction after using a device that was specifically designed to be addictive.
