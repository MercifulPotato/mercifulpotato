If the full time job at the other end is interesting enough, the 6 hours of whiteboard&#x2F;takehome&#x2F;code review is just an annoying cost of doing business.<p>And, if we&#x27;re being really honest here, there&#x27;s a ton of informal backchannel talking that goes on, so your interview &quot;performance&quot; regardless of medium is affected by that at many places. I think if you aren&#x27;t actively working to make your interview process objective, it&#x27;s being strongly affected by many biases and informal relationships.<p>That&#x27;s all to say that on the balance, taking up &quot;some&quot; or &quot;all&quot; of a candidates time isn&#x27;t that interesting of thing to think about because the process is so broken in so many other ways and this one doesn&#x27;t have a huge impact.')
