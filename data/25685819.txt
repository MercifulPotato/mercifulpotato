While the doctors had merely skimmed the pages, my wife pored over them and found a suggestion of using a particular drug. After asking five different doctors about it, one finally agreed to prescribe it. It was strange how reticent doctors were to prescribe something and instead just told us she was going to die. If she’s believed to be terminal anyway, why not prescribe a relatively well known drug and see if it helps?<p>I’m happy to say our daughters prognosis has improved greatly since she started this treatment. Without SciHub she might not still be with us.')
