While the compiler _can_ infer the return type and the user can mouse-over the function to see what the language server has determined the type to be, I feel that explicitly noting what the return type is preferred. Yes, the compiler can act more quickly, but also it makes it more clear quickly to others working on the same project what the function does. Even in languages like Swift which are happy to use type inference, you still must annotate your functions.<p>The other two code-related sections seem odd, to write code that improves compile-time performance. It would be beneficial to see compile duration differences between projects that heavily use union types and projects that don&#x27;t. Otherwise, changing your coding style and not using explicit features of a language that are hard to find in other languages seems counter-productive.<p>That said, the actual compiler configuration changes that follow seem very useful, from someone who doesn&#x27;t write much TS.')
