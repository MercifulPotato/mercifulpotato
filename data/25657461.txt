The app is freemium, but it&#x27;s pretty cool and cheap so personally I&#x27;m not even bothered.<p>Also, Retroarch has a Dosbox core, and Retroarch with some cores works on the PS Vita handheld console, and as a result there&#x27;s Dosbox on Vita. However, it&#x27;s said to be quite a pain to set up for a particular game, with text configs. For jailbroken-PSP owners, Dosbox is apparently ported as a homebrew app. I&#x27;m vaguely looking forward to trying System Shock on Vita, but with my luck I&#x27;m not holding my breath.')
