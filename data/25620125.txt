I like that they compare power consumption too, and ultimately the GPU comes out well ahead. There are lots of other comparisons that show huge x-factors, this one seemed less likely to get called out for cherry picking, and @berkut’s critique of texture memory consumption for large production scenes is fair... we’re not all the way there yet. But, 50% faster is still “worth it”. In the video, Sam mentions that if you compare lower end components on both sides, the x-factor will be higher.')
