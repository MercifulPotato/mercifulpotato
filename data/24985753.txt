Buy most basic Â£45 canon with seperate ink cartridges and use dollar a cartridge third party ink. Lasts 3-4 years. Brother inkjets were good till they got too clever at chipping ink cartridges.<p>Bigger budget get one of the new Epson&#x2F;canon inkjets with refillable tanks. Even the quality official ink is dirt cheap!<p>Laser would be nice but finding a cheap one with cheap good toner availability is hard. Colour copying on a multifunction inkjet is nice too.')
