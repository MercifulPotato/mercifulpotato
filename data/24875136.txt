Item(by='reggieband', descendants=None, kids=[24876472, 24876549], score=None, time=1603493176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875041, text='&gt; This modern trend of needing to pay before you even know if you love the work<p>How modern do you mean? It seems to me that I pay for a movie ticket before I sit down in the theatre and watch it (trailer not withstanding). Same is true for plays and operas which preceded that. I would pay for a book before reading it (cover excerpt not withstanding). In fact, I&#x27;m trying to think of any media that I would consume before I paid.<p>&gt; Got any data to back up this feeling?<p>Meh, we&#x27;re only going to throw anecdotes back and forth. I recall bands like Radiohead and comedians like Luis C.K. experimenting with &quot;pay what you want&quot; ideas. I would suppose the fact that didn&#x27;t catch on (outside of humble bundle charity type things) would be evidence that it didn&#x27;t work for a large enough segment of creators.<p>Also, it isn&#x27;t like RIAA members are allergic to money. I mean, if there was any reasonable evidence that free sharing of content resulted in profits that are equal or greater (or even viable) rationality suggests that they would embrace it.')
