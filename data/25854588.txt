If you don’t recognize that colonization contorted indigenous peoples into conflict based on colonial prerogatives, you’re not telling yourself or anyone else the whole story.<p>It’s a shame for both sides of the shameful misinterpreted history that people don’t, yes, acknowledge that native peoples had real wars and conflicts, and also that colonizers instigated and coordinated other conflicts that were either less likely or more brutal or both than they would’ve been otherwise.')
