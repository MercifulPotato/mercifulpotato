So apparently there&#x27;s a fundamental misalignment between the work Dr. Gebru wants to do and the work that Google wants her to do; this was made clear with the suppression of the paper, and escalated as Dr. Gebru apparently (and understandably) did not want to work in a very different direction, (quoting her tweet) &quot;asked for simple conditions first&quot; which were totally unacceptable to the employer (&quot;We cannot agree to #1 and #2 as you are requesting.&quot;), so that&#x27;s it, if neither is willing to compromise on their primary goals, they can&#x27;t work together.<p>This does indicate that apparently listening to ethics researchers they hired is unacceptable to Google. Sad, but not surprising.')
