I once landed what I thought would be my dream job at my dream company. I quickly discovered that the position was open because all of the previous team had quit due to the extreme toxicity.<p>&gt; The primary lesson I learnt is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you work hard<p>Be careful about getting jaded and cynical. This is far from a universal truth in the tech industry. I&#x27;ve hired a few ex-FAANG who had burned out and become cynical on work altogether. We had to let them go because their negativity was dragging everyone down.<p>A similar thing can happen to people who go through difficult divorces. If they let themselves become cynical, they start believing that marriage is a doomed institution and that all members of their ex-spouse&#x27;s gender are equally terrible people and such. It can become very counterproductive to moving on.')
