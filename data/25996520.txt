This was already a few years after wiredtiger came out and fix a lot of issues.<p>Performance problems kept happening and we just started switching to postgres.<p>At my new job, DevOps people keep complaining about our mongo clusters on atlas.<p>It&#x27;s again, terrible perf and occasional weird issues.<p>We did a disk upgrade and the cluster took 3 days to move all the replica from starting up (and replicating data) to running. During those three days we were running with one less replica and everything was to slow. A complete nightmare.<p>Adding another replica wouldn&#x27;t have solved anything because it would have taken a day to finish booting.<p>They&#x27;ve been trying to migrate off mongo for years but there is never time, as usual.')
