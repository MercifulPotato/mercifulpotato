So it&#x27;s hard to know. e.g. Zen+ (Ryzen 2000) was seeing 10% in some gaming workloads going from DDR4-2400 to DDR4-3600, but it&#x27;s much less drastic on Intel CPUs or even Zen 2 (Ryzen 3000) because the memory controller is smarter so the slower RAM is less of a detriment. And then if you go above 3600mhz (or 3800mhz if overclocked) on zen 2 you start getting negative returns for a bit because the CPU memory controller can no longer run at the same clock as the memory and that induces overhead. But maybe a 4800mhz if it can be stable easier gets far enough ahead of that penalty that the improvement goes positive again. Or maybe Zen 4&#x2F;DDR5-lake just works with memory entirely differently and the performance gains are massive or neglible.<p>The short of it is it&#x27;s very hard to make predictions here.')
