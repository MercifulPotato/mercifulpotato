Everyone checks in source code but nobody checks in the crontab. It&#x27;s better if you rely on the application to do these things rather than the system, because the system could always change beneath your feet (i.e. management says we&#x27;re using Google Cloud now! Good luck porting a 200 line crontab to GCP) but you are in total control of your application&#x27;s source code.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobscheduler.net&#x2F;#&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobscheduler.net&#x2F;#&#x2F;</a>')
