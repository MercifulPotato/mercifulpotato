The winner of a women-only tournament is always a women and sponsors can show a winning woman to their customers. Furthermore it could help to recruit new female players. I&#x27;d like to hear from a woman about that because maybe knowing that they&#x27;ll win only in a protected area, or the very existence of protected areas, could actually discourage them to play.<p>BTW, the same principles apply to the game of Go (only one woman ever won a major open tournament), and even the anti cheating measures.')
