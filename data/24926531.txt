Most people are not trained to run them, but do so anyway, and that&#x27;s clearly what&#x27;s gone on here.<p>The committee that is responsible for judging COC violations must:<p>- operate transparently: no star chambers!<p>- have a real, actual, not-just-we-checked-a-box culture of engineering ethics where individuals on the committee can say &quot;no, this complaint is obvious bullshit, let&#x27;s move on&quot; without fear of reprisal from the committee members themselves, or the organizational power structure they report to.<p>&gt;CoC&#x27;s don&#x27;t give anyone more power than they already had<p>Nonsense. Formation of a committee as such is implicit power; formation of a committee to adjudicate politically sensitive and fraught matters is explicit power.')
