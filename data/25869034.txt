It was a privilege getting to know your family first as neighbors and then as friends back in SLC.  I was always humbled at seeing the effort that you and Christina put into moving heaven and earth out of your love for Bertrand.\nNot everyone can say they&#x27;ve made a lasting positive impact on the world, but you and your family certainly have.<p>- Andrew')
