Research has shown that illegal immigrants do not commit crimes at the same rate as the legal citizenry.  You can argue that the research is not conclusive, but it establishes nonetheless that there is no evidence to believe illegal immigrants are crossing the border to perform crime sprees.<p>Thus, when Mexico &#x27;sends&#x27; people across, they are, indeed, &#x27;sending you&#x27;, in that the crowd of presumably-legal Americans he&#x27;s talking to are just as likely to have rapists among them as a group of illegal immigrants.  He&#x27;s playing on peoples&#x27; notion that it&#x27;s self evident that a bunch of brown people crossing the border will be rabid criminals.<p>Sure, he&#x27;s willing to downplay his beliefs to the press, but even mainstream Republicans found his retention of Stephen Miller in a primary influencer position to be abhorrent.
