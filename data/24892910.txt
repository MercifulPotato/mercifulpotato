Nuclear just has too many characteristics that limit its ability to make use of that ISP.<p>Starship will have a dry mass around 85 tons including about 9 tons of engines, payload of 100 tons, and 1,200 tons of methane&#x2F;LOX fuel. At an ISP of 380 that gives it a deltaV of around 9.8 Km&#x2F;sec.<p>A similar NTR based Starship with a 750 ISP requires a lot more dry mass. The engines will mass at least 100 tons just to provide 1&#x2F;15th the thrust of Methane based Raptors. That’s ok in space, given you can just fire them longer but they will need hundreds of tons of radiators and shielding. And more mass to insulate the hydrogen tanks.<p>A dry mass of 500 tons would give the NTR a deltaV of 10.7 Km&#x2F;sec. That’s better, but it comes at a price. Your NTR Starship can’t land on Mars, it doesn’t have enough thrust. So you need dedicated landers, increasing dry mass further.  And it’s hydrogen leaks, so you lose some of that DeltaV on a long voyage. And you can’t use anything other than hydrogen, or your ISP drops precipitously, and you can’t use any reactive fuels that will corrode your engine.<p>NTR designs need dramatically higher thrust to Weight ratios to ever become competitive with chemical rockets, even in deep space.')
