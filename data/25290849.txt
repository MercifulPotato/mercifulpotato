In school Jamal works hard, studies, and puts his efforts first. Juan on the other hand decides football is the way to go and along with that partying, drinking and at one point gets a gal pregnant.<p>They graduate Jamal gets several scholarships and goes to school while working part time to try and avoid debt. Juan only qualifies for community college but spends several years &quot;finding himself&quot; aka partying, drinking and generally not doing much.<p>4 years later Jamal graduates from school and gets a successful software engineering gig making a decent salary with which he is able to afford a decent house for him, his wife and his 2 children.<p>Meanwhile Juan has just finished his latest stint in jail for another DUI and it is a wake up call to him. He decides to get his life in order so he cuts out the drugs and the bad friends and tries to find a job. Unfortunately he&#x27;s unqualified for anything decent because it turns out shotgunning a beer is a useless skill.<p>For many years Juan has made poor decisions, he has been a drain on society and it&#x27;s resources, but now wants to change. That is good however to claim that he should get the same privileges and standing as his brother who spent years working hard giving back and making better long term choices is asinine.<p>EDIT:<p>There have been a lot of great and informative comments. Several people have been calling this out as a strawman. I&#x27;d like to point out this isn&#x27;t a strawman this is actually remarkably close to what happenned in my own family, it isn&#x27;t a fantastic out of this world scenario, it&#x27;s one I lived. Dismissing this as a strawman, is to dismiss hte point without engaging with it.')
