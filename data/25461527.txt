I&#x27;m not saying you <i>should</i>, but it&#x27;s perfectly doable. Airflow works best when you&#x27;re free to restart jobs though, that&#x27;s probably something to keep in mind.<p>And Airflow is designed to spread tasks between a set of available workers, so while you can make jobs that trigger something remotely through SSH (for example) I&#x27;m still looking for a way to have a &#x27;remote worker&#x27; that runs airflow jobs on the remote system itself rather than through an SSH connection (mostly because of a rather peculiar use-case where we&#x27;d prefer to run jobs on a remote network without two-way communication).')
