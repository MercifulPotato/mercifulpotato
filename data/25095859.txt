I have great faith in what you&#x27;re doing and greatly anticipate what is to come. I also really liked the post on backdoors and the EU proposal.<p>I&#x27;ve managed to talk 6 people into making an account (matrix.org) and using element.  None of them are linux-y or tech-y and they&#x27;ve mostly managed fine (apart from help with setting up e2ee, exporting keys etc which I helped with).<p>Is the app dead easy to use (like WhatsApp, Viber, Signal)?
