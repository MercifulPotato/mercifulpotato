And this seems to be true for everything from the length of lines, to quality of life.  The allele that is most common in East Asia makes relative judgements easier, in America it is absolute judgements that are easier.<p>Politically, having the relative form of the gene encourages more community thinking while the absolute encourages more individualism.  This leaning holds within whatever society you&#x27;re in.  But when a culture is dominated by one form of the gene, it will naturally shift the entire society.<p>I learned this from pages 183-186 of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Whos-Charge-Free-Science-Brain&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0061906115" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Whos-Charge-Free-Science-Brain&#x2F;dp&#x2F;006...</a> and I&#x27;ve wondered ever since how many of my opinions are reason (as it feels) versus genetics.')
