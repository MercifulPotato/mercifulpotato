I have a little window into the world of drug discovery by a decade-long interest in nootropics (tl;dr: I don&#x27;t take them anymore).<p>These statements aren&#x27;t <i>wrong</i>, but they obscure the history. The way we discovered antidepressants was mostly like this:<p>- tuberculosis patients treated with hydrazines become &quot;inappropriately&quot; happy<p>- modified hydrazines first used to treat depression<p>- hydrazines shown to increase serotonin levels by monoamine oxidase inhibition, now called MAOIs<p>- serotonin hypothesis of depression developed<p>- serotonin-targeting drugs developed for depression<p>There are a few more steps here, but the point is: the low-hanging fruit was the hydrazine, then we climbed the tree and got SSRIs.<p>The problem is that we started climbing all the trees with low fruit but never developed a way to find new trees. We also stopped looking for low-hanging fruit, in that we don&#x27;t test random drugs on people the way we used to in the &#x27;40s. Everything has to be justified by an existing theory even though the existing theories are <i>nowhere near</i> comprehensive or complete.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should start testing random drugs on people, but I do think we need to avoid this framing of the problem. We <i>don&#x27;t</i> understand human biology that well. Our primary focus needs to be not on developing drugs <i>per se</i> but on understanding the extremely intricate hydrogen-bonded nanomachines they&#x27;re supposed to modify.<p>But relative to that, our efforts to find drugs should be tempered by a certain humility about the validity of even our most &quot;well-understood&quot; theories. Most of them were developed by accident. The whole risk-averse investing and management apparatus wants reliable theories, so researchers need to be louder about the fact that in many biology problems we don&#x27;t have reliable theories. We have moderately supported working models.')
