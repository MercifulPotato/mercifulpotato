So now there seems to be a niche opening for this in 2021.<p>Make an App Store platform everyone would love to be on. Get developers on board by giving them first 2 years for free, then a moderate membership fee. Take a reasonable cut from IAP&#x27;s against providing customer support for the payments&#x2F;chargebacks&#x2F;fraud. Just make it awesome, reliable and fair.')
