It is hard to work with UUIDs when multiple entities have them. You do not know if you are looking at a user or a group if both is just a UUID. We created our own IDs with prefixes and using base58 encoding for the random part, for example: user-AhnPpn7CbbwPykmux11LJ39Jk. It has the same amount of randomness in it and we can understand what we are looking at.')
