The biggest gripe I have with it is pairing&#x2F;connecting to my web of devices and music quality. This is one area that Apple routinely gets right. Bluetooth just works better on Apple devices. \nI can connect the headset to my windows laptop, play some music, and it will come through muddled. I then switch over to my Macbook Pro and the same music will come through noticeably better. I&#x27;m not sure if the Apple Bluetooth drivers are just that much better or if the built in Windows ones are that much worse?')
