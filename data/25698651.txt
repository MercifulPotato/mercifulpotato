If I go onto twitter and go to DPRK News (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DPRK_News" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DPRK_News</a> , quite a good parody account) it&#x27;s clear that DPRK News is the publisher of all the information and twitter is the hoster. I&#x27;m seeking the information in the DPRK News feed.<p>When I&#x27;m just flipping through twitter&#x27;s infinite scroll then I&#x27;m not really seeking anything in particular than twitter is acting like a traditional editor- choosing the content I see. It&#x27;s a different activity.<p>I think platforms that choose content on behalf of the user need to have a different set of obligations than those that serve content based on user requests, an those obligations go up with scale. It&#x27;s one thing to have a fake story or illegal content be seen by 100 friends, its another to feed it to 100,000 people.')
