They do have precision fresnels but they&#x27;re tiny.<p>The lenses I&#x27;ve seen at EO have focal lengths that aren&#x27;t much shorter than the side length---20cm for 25cm sheets. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a limitation on the refractive index plus maybe the precision required for steep incidence angles.')
