Instead they used more complicated examples for java which skews the results. Example if you translate their lisp example directly.<p>Their original lisp:<p><pre><code>    ( let ([ x 3])\n      ( let ([ f ( lambda (y ) (+ x y ))])\n        ( let ([ x 5])\n          (f 10))))\n</code></pre>\nJava:<p><pre><code>   { int x = 3;\n     { Function&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; f = y -&gt; y + x;\n       { int x = 5;\n          { return f.apply(10); }}}}\n</code></pre>\nThey argued that Java is less concise so they couldn&#x27;t have as many examples, but I feel that example gets the point across just as well and it has comparable number of characters.')
