Just like your business loan, you get into technical debt knowing that you will eventually pay it back (i.e. write additional tests, refactor etc.).<p>Not every software problem is technical debt.<p>While your problem seems much larger, the same problem happens in smaller scales in every software company when engineers quit and leave a complicated codebase behind for new hires to take over. You should be looking specifically for people who have experience working with legacy code in your next hiring round.')
