In between my fully remote positions I worked in an office, I was promoted and offered bonuses.<p>Maybe physically seeing a person working hard used to provoke some sympathy from management to offer promotions and pay rises?<p>The other thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it seems now everyone is going remote, people are just working 12 hour days without hesitation.
