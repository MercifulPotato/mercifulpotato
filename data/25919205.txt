Is it bad? They said 1%, it&#x27;s 5-6%. Should we count the early satellites? Why not? The newer ones haven&#x27;t been up long enough to tell how reliable they&#x27;ll be. He also said they want latency &lt; 20ms on Starlink. Again, not going to happen because of physics, but that didn&#x27;t stop people from repeating it over and over despite the service being 40ms+ on average. Sure, you CAN hit 20ms if you are next to a POP and your endpoint is a single satellite hop, but that&#x27;s not the norm.<p>To be frank, it sounds like you don&#x27;t understand the industry very well, and that&#x27;s ok. But not everyone forgets what was said in 2015 when the project was launching. Since you asked, here&#x27;s one non-truth:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;licensing.fcc.gov&#x2F;myibfs&#x2F;download.do?attachment_key=1158349" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;licensing.fcc.gov&#x2F;myibfs&#x2F;download.do?attachment_key=...</a><p>&gt;High capacity: Each satellite in the SpaceX System provides aggregate downlink\ncapacity to users ranging from 17 to 23 Gbps, depending on the gain of the user terminal\ninvolved. Assuming an average of 20 Gbps, the 1600 satellites in the Initial Deployment\nwould have a total aggregate capacity of 32 Tbps. SpaceX will periodically improve the\nsatellites over the course of the multi-year deployment of the system, which may further\nincrease capacity.<p>This ignores A) competitors who have first priority on the spectrum, B) 80% of the satellites are over water and completely unusable during that time, and C) more recently we know that the user terminal at best would perform lower than the 17Gbps low end they cite due to cost-cutting on the scan and G&#x2F;T of the antenna.<p>If you believe it&#x27;s okay to lie in FCC filings so that you win awards and change policies, then that&#x27;s a valid opinion to hold.')
