(Also Podman is developed by Red Hat.) I think they have rather high hopes there, and are more likely to just shoot themselves in the foot by being one of a small number of distros that don&#x27;t have Docker. In fact, rebuilders of RHEL (e.g. Oracle Linux) should maybe consider explicitly supporting Docker. &quot;We are 100% compatible with RHEL but additionally also support Docker&quot; definitely makes for better marketing copy than just &quot;We are 100% compatible with RHEL&quot;.')
