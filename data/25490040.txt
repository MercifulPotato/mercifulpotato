Mine barely lasted 3 years and had to be serviced multiple times as the screen hinges broke and the fan became super loud, among other things.<p>The T460p which I use now is much better. I&#x27;m currently testing a T490 as a replacement, which seems quite nice as well but has some annoying features (glossy display, integrated smaller battery) that might convince me to stay on the T460p for a while longer. Also, CPU performance hasn&#x27;t really increased in the last 4 years, the T460p has almost the same Geekbench score as the T490. The display is arguably better (nicer color rendition and higher brightness) and the laptop is 35 % lighter as well as signifantly thinner, on the other hand the battery is 30 % smaller and power usage hasn&#x27;t gone down compared to the T460p, so it maxes out at around 4 hours of usage.')
