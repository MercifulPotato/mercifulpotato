Microsoft (and Microsoft Research) has made it very clear in recent papers that <i>distributed</i> password spray (where the spray is spread out over large numbers of IP addresses&#x2F;countries&#x2F;etc) is the number 1 issue right now in passwords, and that detection and blocking are crucial. Steam <i>has</i> argued in the past that such things are impossible to do at their scale. (Microsoft would argue today that their scale in Office 365&#x2F;Azure AD&#x2F;Microsoft Accounts has easily now dwarfed Steam&#x27;s scale.) There&#x27;s enough evidence today (as I already mentioned) that Steam still doesn&#x27;t have those detections&#x2F;blocking in place (and are relying too much on Steam Guard&#x2F;2FA to keep accounts safe). (Not to get too deep into the woods of Steam criticism, but the argument may not be that it is impossible at scale but that it is impossible to prioritize it within Valve&#x27;s notorious management culture.)')
