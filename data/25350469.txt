It&#x27;s not some $XXX toy for notifications and whatever. Much like watches, it is as much about functionality as it about style. Much like watches, it both exists in a expensive, luxury form and in an everyday form. You&#x27;re buying a Swatch, with Rolex available if you want - not a fitibit.')
