Item(by='kmeisthax', descendants=None, kids=[24984277], score=None, time=1604437401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24981227, text='There is a pending legal challenge to parts of DMCA 1201 being spearheaded by the EFF (Green v. DOJ) but I have no idea if it&#x27;ll actually pass. I hope it does, as there is a legitimate conflict in law between free speech rights and DMCA 1201&#x27;s restriction on circumvention tools. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re automatically unconstitutional. It just means that strict scrutiny applies. That means it&#x27;s constitutional if-and-only-if:<p>1. The restriction is necessary to a &quot;compelling state interest&quot;;\n2. The restriction is &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to achieving this compelling purpose; and\n3. The restriction uses the &quot;least restrictive means&quot; to achieve the purpose.<p>So, I can give you some spoilers: copyright is explicitly mentioned and authorized by the US Constitution, it even gets it&#x27;s own separate clause. That means copyright is automatically a compelling state interest, and it follows that if we have code that enforces the law, we also have a compelling state interest in protecting that code, too. The EFF&#x27;s case (and, more generally, any constitutional challenge to DMCA 1201) is going to hinge on the 2nd and 3rd questions of the strict scrutiny test - could they reach the same goal of automated copyright enforcement with a narrower, less restrictive law?<p>Regarding your particular objections to treaty negotiation, the WIPO Copyright Treaty&#x27;s undemocratic negotiation process is immaterial to constitutional questions. This is because the US Constitution is explicitly opposed to that. It says the President negotiates treaties and the Senate consents to them. It provides no provision for further democratic control in international relations. In other words, international law is inherently and constitutionally undemocratic. Think about what it means for that to NOT be the case: we&#x27;d need every treaty to have a corresponding election in which the citizens of both countries have an up-or-down vote. Very few treaties work this way; the EU sits comfortably at top-of-mind but that&#x27;s about it.')
