It isn&#x27;t optimized for the beginner, and all the proposed fixes to issues don&#x27;t work due to that. We can&#x27;t just remove lazy IO or partial head without significant impacts, so we coexist with them - tutorials and all.<p>There are plenty of beginner-friendly resources already (more &amp; more every year), but they can&#x27;t erase worse ones from the Internet. The Haskell community lacks the sort of strong-fisted leadership to accomplish that by design.<p>That said, acting like a tutorial mentioning lazy IO or partial head&#x2F;tail is a killer is a little ridiculous. Neither of those things are atrociously problematic, so learning about them early is fine. You may get cut due to them, but getting cut is okay if you don&#x27;t flip the table.<p>Also I (and most of Haskell posters) do not gatekeep. The community will go well out of its way to respond to any questions beginners have with blog-post-quality comments in the various forums (mailing list, reddit, irc, slack, github issues, etc) There is definitely a teaching culture, which is the opposite of gatekeeping.')
