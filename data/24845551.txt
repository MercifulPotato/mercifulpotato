A lot of it is powered by things that either already are or should be illegal, from various abuses of monopolistic power to forced tracking without informed consent.<p>Fixing <i>those</i> issues would be a good start. Otherwise, nothing will change. Google has enough of its own moat with Pixel devices and Android and Chrome that banning or somehow restricting the sale of default search engine position will hurt sellers of those defaults like Mozilla much more than it will hurt Google&#x27;s monopoly.<p>Just because the lawsuit is on paper targeted at Google, doesn&#x27;t mean that their competitors (or the public) will be the beneficiaries of its results.')
