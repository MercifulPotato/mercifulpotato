He&#x27;d bring it home for school holidays, and I was fascinated by it.<p>I&#x27;d borrow books from the library that aimed to teach kids how to program. This was the late 80s, and the books were written a while before and referenced earlier computers which weren&#x27;t so common at the time .. TRS-80s .. VIC-20s.<p>The books had program code that you could type in to create simple games and demos. I&#x27;d spend hours typing in the code, only to learn the version of basic used wasn&#x27;t compatible with the green screen word-processor my dad brought home.<p>As an introverted kid, I found the possibilities provided by a computer incredibly exciting and exotic.<p>Once I&#x27;d got the bug, I&#x27;d spend pocket money on computer magazines for years. The first time I encountered Linux was in the 90s, when I bought a magazine with a CD-ROM containing a slackware distribution. After installing it, there wasn&#x27;t much I could do with it .. and I didn&#x27;t really understand it&#x27;s importance at the time.<p>I eventually saved up for a 486DX2 PC which cost me a small fortune at the time .. about Â£1600.<p>I switched to Linux full-time in about 2005.')
