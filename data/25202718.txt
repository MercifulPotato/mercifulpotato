I will note, that Wikipedia talks about both Cutter and Wyeth having problems, so it is possible the numbers are a sum of wyeth+cutter which would be compatible with your numbers being cutter only, but in the context of safety vs. polio wouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>&gt; You would also have to include further transmissions caused by wild polio if you would like to make such a comparison.<p>All wild polio numbers include those numbers by default - there actually is no way to get them otherwise, I guess you are saying &quot;you should probably debase by more than 200,000 because of secondary infections&quot;. I don&#x27;t know how to do that, exactly, but it will likely still be similar.<p>&gt; Even with your own calculation, which is inflated by also including transmission within the community for the vaccine but not for wild polio, the vaccine was very much comparable to wild polio (0.125% versus approx. 0.1%).<p>With this calculation, the vaccine was 25% worse than the wild type. No error bars, but, that&#x27;s easily worse, even much worse.<p>&gt; So under which assumptions would it not be false?<p>How kind of you to drop &quot;patently&quot;. If you didn&#x27;t mean &quot;patently&quot; false earlier, why did you use that word? twice?<p>From[0]: &quot;Patently: in a way that is so obvious that no one could disagree.&quot;. It&#x27;s nice of you to finally bring sources, but even these sources don&#x27;t make it &quot;patently&quot; false, given that they disagree with the sources I gave (which, I concede, reference more than just the safety of the Cutter incident which I originally mentioned, but which are definitely the subject matter under discussion)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macmillandictionary.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;british&#x2F;patently" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macmillandictionary.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;british&#x2F;paten...</a>')
