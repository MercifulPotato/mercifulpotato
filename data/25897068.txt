I use it for development and running apps with a lot of concurrent processes and hadn&#x27;t noticed any problems. These benchmarks [0] have it doing better than almost all linux distributions when it comes to compilation times (but I know benchmarks are not always as objective as they could be). My youtubes and media players run great :-)<p>It&#x27;s been a while since I did any heavy networking, but I never had problems&#x2F;surprises there as long as I spec&#x27;d out appropriate hardware, in particular the pf firewall and the hw accelerated ipsec and qos configs which I got pretty far into were outstanding, better than cisco hardware costing a lot more at the time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=bsds-phoronix-14&amp;num=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=article&amp;item=bsds-pho...</a>')
