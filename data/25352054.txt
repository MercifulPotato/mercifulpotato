They&#x27;re garbage compared to my Airpods and their app is absolutely terrible. It wouldn&#x27;t even let me connect to Zoom without upgrading the firmware on them which failed every time. Without the upgrade, it sounded like a crappy phone call whenever I&#x27;d get a Zoom call. After the upgrade, it sounds like a slightly less crappy phone call.')
