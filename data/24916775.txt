There&#x27;s not much to be added. It&#x27;s one thing if GitHub were forcing us at gunpoint from being able to use Master for the name of the default&#x2F;main branch. But they&#x27;re just changing the default. Make it Master or whatever if you feel so inclined, you&#x27;re still free to do so. Save your energy for when they do start banning repos which have Master as a branch name or something.')
