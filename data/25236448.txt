Back then, the limit was in available sockets. k6 now has support for multiple source IPs, so that limit has been effectively removed, and more VUs should be possible.<p>On the `k6 cloud` side, we have executed 500k+ VUs. The most RPS I achieved with k6 was 4 791 928 (~4.8 million requests per second). That test lasted for 6 min and generated 1.5 billion requests in total.<p>More is possible, but we didn&#x27;t push further.<p>Source: I&#x27;m one of the guys behind k6.')
