How does it explain bullet cluster, and several others, existing in the first place?<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a cosmologist even if I do have a background in physics. I do like following the field. It&#x27;s just not quite so clear as you imply.<p>And if we go into things like superfluid dark matter then it doesn&#x27;t really matter if its dark matter or some kind of modified gravity. One has bunch of equations and what matters is how they behave.')
