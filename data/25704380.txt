Their arrogance of the system, where in fact they all themselves could become poll watchers to make sure there isn&#x27;t fraud, isn&#x27;t a valid reason for them to be angry - though it&#x27;s understandable that they would be angry with the propaganda they&#x27;ve been fed, when instead of they were told that there were Republican poll watchers at ALL of the polling stations - then their reaction would be &quot;oh.. okay.&quot; Maybe if they didn&#x27;t believe it then they themselves could work as a poll watcher to see for themselves. Likewise there were people saying exactly what I have - however it&#x27;s highly unlikely the people watching Fox News (or other) would be putting that messages out, so who&#x27;s at blame? Arguably the treasonous Republicans trying to start a civil war and mainstream media channels who are inciting themselves. In this circumstance, yes, it&#x27;s predictable - but please do tell how you reach the ignorant people who will only listen to very specific sources and have primed for years, decades, to think Democrats are evil - and that the election is rigged, that is it&#x27;s only rigged if their pick doesn&#x27;t win.')
