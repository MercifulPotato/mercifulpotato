There was a longer than needed function that returned a list of unique items, and realizing the intent of the code, I simplified it to a one-liner using built-in data structures. Small moments of recognition like that feel great!<p>Your point about becoming more familiar with your language&#x27;s APIs is also a great one. After the aforementioned Leetcode practice, I didn&#x27;t have to look up things half as much as I did previously about Python. It was a good feeling :)<p>Unrelated to the above anecdote, I recently started following the Backend Engineering Show with Hussein Nasser [0], and he makes a lot of these kinds of connections to popular technologies like you described.<p>EDIT: forgot to add the link!<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;55pPBm0l75K28dIqoHIQIc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;55pPBm0l75K28dIqoHIQIc</a>')
