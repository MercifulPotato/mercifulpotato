Generally anyone in these spaces granted admin powers will be smart enough to keep their cert around.<p>Losing client certs is less of a problem for this space because nobody requires users register to connect. If their group is private, they keep the IP to themselves and don&#x27;t even bother adding a password. if its public, then its public and anyone can connect. Registration only necessary for mods or stopping hooligans from changing their names.')
