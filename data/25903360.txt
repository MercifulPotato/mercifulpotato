For most people, wine is considered a challenging topic to understand in depth, and so most feel they are initially at serious disadvantage before taking a sip.  Price is something everyone understands...and so is a powerful influence.  Trying to suppress that is awfully hard.  I would say that some expensive wine could taste better...subjective aspects of taste aside.  Some wines begin with hand-harvested grapes...and only the very best of those make it into the barrel.  Huge amount of labour and huge amount of grapes that don&#x27;t make the grade.  Perhaps the resulting wine will taste better...better grapes mean better wine. Perhaps it is only marginally better...but the costs to get that incremental benefit are enormous.')
