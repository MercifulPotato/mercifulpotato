Personally for me this means actually take-to-the-bank licensing that I could get through a legal audit, even if hypothetical.<p>Talk of “secret sauce” and future closed source and IP licensing of future maybe-must-have magic... that’s way too much future risk for me.<p>An example of what I think is good licensing is JUCE (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juce.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juce.com</a>). Everything from “free” to “paid with support”, all open source… but the point is I always know exactly where I stand legally, what I can and cannot do...  and what I can and cannot do in the FUTURE.')
