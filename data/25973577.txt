Without this easy money, colleges and universities could not have raised tuition like they have, because most people couldn&#x27;t pay it.<p>But with the loans, colleges and universities are flush with cash, so they build extravagant dorms, hire way too many administrators, VP&#x27;s, etc.<p>My idea to fix this is to make the universities provide the loans.  Then they have an incentive to make sure students graduate and have a career path that makes sense (and money!)<p>We have allowed and encouraged an entire generation to screw themselves with these outrageous loans.')
