I guess people started using baby monitors for that by now. When I was small, mum just left a window a bit open (1970-ish Sweden).<p>This is even done at daycare down to -15 degrees C. However they do have someone present next to the kids at most times.<p>There are lots of stories of swedish people going to USA and getting arrested for leaving their kid without supervision outside while being 5 meters away inside a store for five minutes. We are used to a bit more relaxed way of parenting I guess :-)')
