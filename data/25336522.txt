(and that would lead to what you want)<p>What people don&#x27;t realize about steve jobs was that he was the great integrator.  He got different folks to work together.<p>The mac pro from his era had pcie slots and worked with add-in cards from lots of vendors.  You could add 4 hard disks.<p>Another way of looking at it is to read that silly book &quot;The 7 habits of hightly effective people&quot; from decades ago.<p>Basically said the arc of maturity is:<p><pre><code>  - dependent (child)\n  - independent (teenager)\n  - interdependent (fully developed)\n</code></pre>\nI think pple, under steve jobs, got to interdependent and was working in the ecosystem.<p>After Steve Jobs, Apple regressed to independent.  Instead of using its market power to foster the ecosystem, it has regressed to teenager level and just does what is good for itself.  There are no other hardware manufacturers anymore and now their software developers don&#x27;t feel like partners and tread carefully.<p>Thing is apple can probably do well for itself independently but... It&#x27;s lonely at the top especially if you&#x27;ve turned your back on the rest of the ecosystem.')
