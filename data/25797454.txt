I <i>can</i> get it working—usually after a lot of crying and wishing I weren&#x27;t too lazy to try to improve it myself and contribute such improvements—and after I do, it&#x27;s actually pretty fulfilling to use the clunky, limited capabilities it offers. It could be a lot further ahead, or at least as good as pdb (which isn&#x27;t precisely the bee&#x27;s knees, but usually gets the job done), but alas, seems like most developers prefer to use the browser for debugging, so that gets a lot more attention.<p>Well, I&#x27;ll keep using it, dragging it along kicking and screaming... until it&#x27;s deprecated or improved, I guess.')
