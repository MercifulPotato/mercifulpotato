Then the data (including the social graph) really <i>would</i> belong to the users, and facebook would have to compete with multiple other “social network clients” that would rapidly emerge. Facebook would lose some monopoly profits, but in the long-run they might even make <i>more</i> money - they have a lot of very smart <i>practical</i> engineers (at least based on seeing their approach to writing libraries e.g. react vs angular, pytorch vs tensorflow etc.)  So if forced to compete, I think they would do just fine, particularly because I believe that the ecosystem would develop <i>faster</i> in the presence of real, and actually grow the market beyond what it would otherwise be.')
