You think the NYP story is as reputable as the dossier ?<p>All the same, I don’t know of any newspapers which published stories treating the dossier as a source. As an object of the story, IE this thing exists, yes. As corroboration: please share if you have any.<p>Actually I think what happened is Rudy etc got a little too desperate and excited and blundered tactically: surfacing the contents of the hard drive as continual leaks, like the DNC  emails, would’ve allowed for a similar dynamic to 2016. Wouldn’t have mattered politically if the contents were real or not.<p>By reaching and trying to drop the story as “real news,” the dubiousness of the source material got thrust directly into the spotlight. Blaming twitter, liberals, or whoever, for their poor smear tactics is just a coping mechanism at this point if you ask me.')
