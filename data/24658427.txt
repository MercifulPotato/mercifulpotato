This information can never be recovered without access to the true colors in the scene when the image was taken. You can tell that information is destroyed because there are multiple possible re-colorizations of a black and white image.<p>When you convert a black and white image back to color, you are not restoring the original true colors, rather you are filling them in based on your priors. It is logically impossible to &quot;restore&quot; the original colors by doing data processing on only the image itself. It is only possible to give the appearance of a restoration.')
