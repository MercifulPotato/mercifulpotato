Item(by='Zancarius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606425536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25223408, text='&gt; Is this fixed in php 8?<p>I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s one of those cases where fixing it to do the &quot;right&quot; thing would potentially break a lot of software depending on this sort of erroneous behavior. Part of me wants to say &quot;I hope so&quot; and part of me is kinda terrified at what might happen if they did. Shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to fix, but it would definitely take some time.<p>Someone should know if there&#x27;s a decent linter that would pick this up to make it easier to fix, I would imagine!<p>&gt; I did not think this was possible as there is no type coercion and not well documented.<p>I think when applying the equality operator (==) in lieu of the identity operator (===) between strings PHP uses heuristics to decide what to do. If it looks like a number, it coerces it into an int or a float. As an example:<p><pre><code>    php &gt; var_dump(&#x27;1e12&#x27; == 1e12);\n    bool(true)\n</code></pre>\nAs ridiculous as I think it is, I also take the approach that it&#x27;s just what PHP does. Weird, maybe a bit eccentric, <i>probably</i> a contributor to difficult-to-find bugs, but it&#x27;s just something we have to keep in mind. Perhaps I&#x27;m feeling charitable because it&#x27;s Thanksgiving!')
