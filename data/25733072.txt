Item(by='klyrs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610388503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732636, text='&gt; If Amazon is saying Parler hosted &quot;illegal content&quot; then they are saying they broke the law. How can it be any other way?<p>Because I&#x27;m not clear on the specific exemptions for section 230.  I can&#x27;t say one way or another whether Parler itself broke the law.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s kind of the point here. Society&#x27;s rules are clear on child porn. They are less clear on what constitutes incitement. That should be evident if you&#x27;re following these events.<p>Did people openly plan an armed attack on the capitol building?  Yes.<p>Did people follow through on aforementioned plans?  Yes.  Violence was incited.  Having read quite a few relevant posts on Parler, I&#x27;m reasonably sure that their users broke the law.<p>There is a lot of gray area between voicing frustration and incitement, but this is not one of those cases.')
