If you give someone enough constraints almost any patent will seem obvious.  The point of patents is when an entire industry is solving a given problem doing X, and someone comes up with a better option then you want that industry to use the better method.<p>To get that swap you need public disclosure in some industries, and to get public disclosure you need incentives.  For widely available products that disclosure may consist of the actual object without any patents. But, for say oil refineries people don’t just get to walk around and see what’s what.<p>Having said that the parent system could be changed in a vast number of ways with many tradeoffs.  Just consider the wider implications beyond just software or mass produced items.')
