While there&#x27;s definitely value in knowing you basically own the console market for the next few years, consoles have a much easier time jumping ship on architectures than PCs do, so having such a large portion of your revenue tied to two customers, both of whom are capable of jumping ship quite easily on the 4-5 year timeframe is maybe not great from a strategic point of view.')
