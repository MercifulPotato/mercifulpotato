The symbol was tested with 1,650 people from a wide variety of countries. I haven&#x27;t been able to find details on their results, but I can&#x27;t imagine they would have settled on this design without consistent understandability.<p>And it&#x27;s certain to be an improvement on the standard radioactivity symbol. In a global context, recognition of that symbol is poor -- it&#x27;s frequently understood as a propeller or a flower.')
