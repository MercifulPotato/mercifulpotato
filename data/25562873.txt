It could very well be that having an maintaining your TV room is more expensive than going to the movie theatre as well. If you were designing a domicile based purely on optimizing cost, as posed earlier, it is very likely that it wouldn&#x27;t be anything more than a small bedroom, with everything else more cost effectively provided by outside third-parties at scale.<p>But there is, of course, more to life than numbers. A small bedroom and nothing more does not seem like an overly desirable place to live. Being able to watch TV at home is nice. Being able to cook at home is enjoyable. However, the topic is what it is and as a result those factors don&#x27;t matter for the purposes of this particular discussion.')
