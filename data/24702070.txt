Not only would it be so expensive to be unfeasible, it&#x27;d also be an egregious waste of a vital resource (block space). The Bitcoin network is virtually the only way to transfer money uncensorably and it&#x27;s supported by volunteers like me. If I have to buy more hard drives, I&#x27;m less likely to keep my node online.')
