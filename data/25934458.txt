Bad OOP is bad. That&#x27;s like every other piece of coding. Some excellent examples of great OO code that I&#x27;ve worked with have to do with having an abstract class to define a data api, and then being able to switch providers seamlessly because the internal interface is the same, and all you need to do is write a vendor-specific inherited class.')
