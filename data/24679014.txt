Linux represented a big, mysterious system and I had nothing but time. I got a job working at Erol&#x27;s Internet when I was 14 and met some other (older) nerds there who were willing to let me tag along to 2600 meetings (and occasionally, raves) in Arlington and DC. I was active on bbs.l0pht.com and english.gh0st.net, and the folks I met on those boards genuinely helped point me in the right direction.<p>Eventually my interests shifted and I finally misspent my youth in my early 20s. Pushing 40 now and Linux and programming doesn&#x27;t feel all that mysterious or exploratory or new any more, but it pays the bills. I wish I could recapture that feeling of rebellion, revolution, or of doing something new. I know though that it&#x27;s just me who has changed.')
