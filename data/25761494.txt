Nice job!<p>I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time on Zoom, but the experience is all around miserable. Even a small improvement adds up to a lot over time. I think the point about the higher pixel density for the speaker is just one (important) part of why this is effective. For a class, it also mimics the teacher up front facing the students aspect. I suspect those two factors work together: you don&#x27;t perceive the backs of your fellow students&#x27; head as sharply as you do the teacher&#x27;s face because you&#x27;re focused on the teacher in an in-person class.')
