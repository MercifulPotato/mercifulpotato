The Turkish TV recently released the investigation footage - unimaginable brutality, tons of evidence, and NOTHING! Navalny is no threat to Putin. He wants to be perceived as one, but he is not. I am not an assassination expert, but I&#x27;m sure there plenty of ex-KGB people who can get rid of Navalny if Putin asks them. Car crashes, incidents, you name it - if he wanted him dead, he&#x27;d be dead long ago.<p>Thank you for the info about Novichok. It was airborne during Skripal&#x27;s case, but now I see it was powder released into the air and not gas.')
