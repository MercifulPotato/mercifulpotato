They are cheap because I can buy them in a brick and mortar store. Surely the military can just buy tens of thousands of them.<p>&gt;Itâ€™s basically been decided that we are going to spend silly money keeping a small number of absolutely cutting edge aircraft flying rather than thousands if not tens of thousands of of likely more efficient but less capable possibly drone aircraft.<p>Well, you&#x27;re missing the fact that there will be thousands of F-35s on earth (500 already built). Meanwhile there are less drones like MQ-9 Reaper (200 built) which are basically primarily to bully some ground troops than F-35s despite them only costing $40 million a pop. After all they are cheap. Because you see, the brick and mortar store sells them, so they must be cheap even when they are not.<p>&gt;than thousands if not tens of thousands of of likely more efficient but less capable possibly drone aircraft.<p>In a war less capability might mean the total loss of all aircraft. You only need a few F-35s and some anti air support on the ground and the drones will be shot down. Yes, you might be able to execute a saturation attack but once you lost your entire fleet how are you going to respond to the counterattack? Oh right, with your own 5th generation fighter that matches the F-35.<p>Honestly, the biggest benefit of drones is that you can equip your infantry with loitering munitions and thereby reduce the need for conventional CAS provided by a conventional air force. This isn&#x27;t a stupid lets build ten million drones swarm buzzword bingo to scare some people who barely know anything about the capability of military weapons. That&#x27;s nonsensical. It&#x27;s like plastering machine guns everywhere because &quot;cheap&quot;. As if militaries only care about stockpiling weapons with no logic behind mission objectives.')
