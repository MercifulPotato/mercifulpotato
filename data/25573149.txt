Then you could do &#x27;voice&#x27;. And after that threshold was crossed, you could basically do unlimited voice very quickly.<p>So Wikipedia - text only - is ballpark 50G - which is to say it would fit on a single mobile phone.<p><i>That is bigger than the first Google index!</i><p>I don&#x27;t know how old you are, but the notion that you could walk around with this <i>massive database</i>, literally the size of <i>all of Google right in their pockets</i> in 1999 - would have blown people&#x27;s minds. It was basically unthinkable.<p>The rate of growth of storage has slowed down a little in the last decade but there are still jumps to be had, and it&#x27;s not inconceivable that we get 100-500TB storage in the nex1 10-15 years in regular devices, meaning 10-100x that in a slightly large storage device.<p>While video data is expanding (4K is much bigger than original HD) it can&#x27;t go on forever, meaning, just like voice and text, once we cross a certain threshold, then it becomes irrelevantly small relative to storage as well.<p>So I think there&#x27;s some value in my point:<p>In 10-20 years from now, as video storage becomes &#x27;trivial&#x27; just as text is today (aka all of wiki text on your phone) - then huge amounts of data become available, instantly.<p>Though some data sources change a lot - others do not.<p>It&#x27;s not inconceivable that we put the &#x27;entire western canon&#x27; in everyone&#x27;s homes.<p>The other thing no so evident in my comment is that there&#x27;s only so much use for all of this data.<p>We are getting massively smaller marginal returns for all this &#x27;big data&#x27; we store, frankly, I question in many cases if it&#x27;s worth it at all. I think a lot of companies have been duped into saving every mouse click or whatever concerning every customer. The world is just not that complicated.<p>What this means - is as computers miniturize - and storage as well - we may see regular data centers shift away from the cloud back to &#x27;on premise&#x27;.<p>If you can fit &#x27;infinite computing power&#x27; in a little closet, and the parts are easily replaced ... then I can see companies doing that.<p>The promise of cloud computing today largely rests on the economies of scale of physicality: parts take up space, cables, power, heating&#x2F;cooling, you want a lot of flex&#x2F;headspace, configurations.<p>I don&#x27;t see why in 20 years from no, you can buy &#x27;off the shelf&#x27; a &#x27;box&#x27; that has the equivalent of 100Ec2s, 500TB of storage and multiple G&#x2F;s networking cards.<p>You could run an entire corporate office of 1000 people from just a single box.<p>The &#x27;physicality&#x27; of it all would be mundane and irrelevant. Obviously, it would be &#x27;super complex&#x27; and still need 200 IT people to admin all of the software, but physically it could be small and cheap.<p>&#x27;Big maybe&#x27; of course, but there are some possibilities in there I think.')
