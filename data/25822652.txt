We need to go back to a village mindset.<p>Raising kids IS hard in modern America. Agreed that it doesn&#x27;t have to be, and that the disintegration of societal structures is a huge part of why. Unfortunately, all signs point to it getting worse, not better.<p>I bring up his research a lot it seems, but Robert Putnam published Bowling Alone, which is about the utter collapse of American Civil Society and social ties, in 2000. The statistics were daunting then, and I doubt many people would disagree that we&#x27;re worse off today than we were 20 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m old enough that I remember living in a US that still had plentiful communities. I worry about the children being raised in our modern transactional society. I take comfort in knowing old men have worried about these things since the dawn of civilization though.')
