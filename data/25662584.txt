Real sockets perform better than webrtc since they can attempt NAT traversal or talk to the CPE to perform port forwarding, something that you can&#x27;t do from a browser. Otherwise p2p filesharing  wouldn&#x27;t work. You may not get perfect connectivity this way since not all NATs can be bypassed but on the other hand webrtc does not work at all without signalling.')
