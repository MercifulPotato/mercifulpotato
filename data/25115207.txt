Just because some people make a living doing Actual Things(TM) doesn&#x27;t mean that having a large portion of the economy be tourism related does not have negative effects for pretty much everyone.<p>&gt;this is how a lot of our food makes it to our tables;<p>And someone dicking around fixing heavy equipment in the mud is how the table became your table but you don&#x27;t see people romanticizing the timber industry because for the most part it isn&#x27;t associated with tourism the way waterfront communities (and by extension, their industries) are.<p>The fishing industry exists as much to give the tourists something to look at so the captains&#x27; wives&#x2F;friends&#x2F;relatives can run successful restaurants and bars (and fish the tourists wallets) as it does to pull edible animals out of the water.  On a community level this is all pretty soul crushing because your existence is predicated on your ability to basically put on a show for others (i.e. look quaint) but pretend that you&#x27;re just this quaint naturally.')
