Item(by='johnchristopher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610924363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809452, text='&gt; There is no &quot;main&quot; server. matrix.org is the biggest one, but it is circunstancial.<p>It&#x27;s not circumstantial at all. You can&#x27;t send off people to random server without telling them it might shut down because no one knows the owner or when he&#x27;s going to stop paying for his experience. @matrix.org is the only place where I&#x27;d feel safe sending relatives if they want to onboard because it&#x27;s the only place I know the matrix guys are going to keep running. Most posts I am seeing on HN these days stating registering a matrix account was easy did it on matrix.org.<p>I believe they should charge a fee. To avoid the GMail effect that got everyone a free email but trapped them in the end. And no, you can&#x27;t jump as easily from one @something to @somethingelse because you lose your message history and attachments (that&#x27;s where the often cited mail analogy fails us: with email you can take your email with you when switching). If this chat history doesn&#x27;t matter BUT you have to find a way to export your contacts then I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s better than Signal for regular joes.<p>Two years ago I could run my own matrix instance on a small VPS. Now it requires too much resources, especially when it&#x27;s federated. Also, the mail federation analogy falls short here because nothing prevents mail from circulating between @something and @somethingelse while matrix has it in its design to whitelist some federated servers.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communick.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;communick.com</a>, there you go.<p>Not what I mean. I am not looking to forward this to people asking me &quot;hey, how do I get on matrix ?&quot; &quot;here, set up or buy your own server&quot;. Where can I send them when all they want and need is a matrix address ? Where can they pay a small fee to keep their matrix address longterm without going through the hassle of maintaining&#x2F;renting a server ? Matrix.org But we don&#x27;t see a rush of new users on Matrix. I wish there were though but I am convinced Matrix and Signal don&#x27;t address the needs of the same people. And that&#x27;s certainly why every signal thread seem to attract matrix supporters and we get into that federated&#x2F;centralized debate. Which has been beaten to death.')
