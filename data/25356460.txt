Math (quantitative reasoning&#x2F;logic) is not the only area of psychometric intelligence testing (e.g., IQ) and not even a majority of it. So, it may be that it really is a bit harder for older mathematicians to make breakthroughs? I don&#x27;t know. At any rate, citing mathematics as an indicator is probably not ideal, because math ability does indeed generally peak early.<p>However, as of 2011[1] the mean age of physics Nobel winners at the time of their achievements across the entire period of the award was 37.2 and since 1985 the mean age was 50.3.<p>According to the same paper, by the year 2000, Nobel-level achievement in physics before age 40 was only 19% of cases. It also appears that awards in chemistry and medicine are similarly increasing in mean age.<p>Is this dispositive? Certainly not. Maybe the Nobel committee prefers to award old scientists because of some unknown bias?<p>However, it does indicate that high achievement is both possible and normal in middle age and beyond.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;108&#x2F;47&#x2F;18910.full" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;108&#x2F;47&#x2F;18910.full</a>')
