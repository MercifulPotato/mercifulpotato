The things you mention are already solved, have been for many years; it has been a specialty and major export product of our country for decades (as you indubitably know).<p>&quot;Bulk foods (more properly called staple foods)&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t use that word on purpose. What I roughly wanted to say was &quot;root crops, grains, tree crops, basically anything that isn&#x27;t herbs or salads&quot;, but that wouldn&#x27;t be accurate either (carrots are root crops but not a staple and can to some degree be grown in substrates). But probably it&#x27;s a distinction without a difference, in this context. I think it&#x27;s fair, for the sake of the discussion, to talk about &quot;leafy greens&quot; vs &quot;non leafy greens&quot;, even though &quot;but tomatoes&quot; etc.<p>&quot;Bulk foods do just fine in regular soil where ever they are being grown, and do so reasonably efficiently.&quot;<p>No they do not, at least under other circumstances than precisely the ones we want to get away from, with indiscriminate use of  nitrates and pesticides. I happen to have a yield model for various crops in the EU here open on my other monitor, that I&#x27;ve been working with for several months now. Agriculture as we do it today in the western EU cannot be done efficiently without intensive farming methods. Without fertilizer, yields are a factor of 2 to 4 lower. That is an absolutely game changing difference.<p>&quot;A vertical farm does not compete with in soil agriculture in open air, it competes with greenhouses.&quot;<p>Well I&#x27;m not sure any more what we&#x27;re arguing here. The OP&#x27;s point was &quot;Vertical farms don&#x27;t feed people. They are basically a solution to just in time delivery for restaurants and nothing else.&quot; Which, to some degree, holds for greenhouses (depending on definitions). The food production problems we have is not that we don&#x27;t have enough area for greenhouses, or that we can&#x27;t grow enough leafy greens; greenhouses are so efficient that we&#x27;re not constrained by land for the demand we have for food that can be grown in them. What we need is more space efficient production of high calorie foods, in ways that don&#x27;t degrade the environment in the ways and to the extent current methods do. Neither vertical farms nor greenhouses (I mean, &#x27;vertical farm&#x27; is just a marketing word for &#x27;multi story greenhouse&#x27;) will be of any use for that.<p>But maybe your point is something entirely different and relates to the OP in a different way, in which case our whole discussion is moot.')
