Remember that you&#x27;re your own person in the first place, period. You&#x27;re not your label, you merely &#x2F;have&#x2F; a label. TFA makes this mistake from the outset in the title. It should&#x27;ve read &quot;having&quot; not &quot;being&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s no cure for these labels, but one can recover. To quote Patricia Deegan:<p><i>Recovery does not refer to an end product or result.</i> <i>It does not mean that one is “cured”.</i> <i>In fact, recovery is marked by an ever-deepening acceptance of our limitations.</i> <i>But now, rather than being an occasion for despair, we find that our personal limitations are the ground from which spring our own unique possibilities.</i> <i>This is the paradox of recovery i.e., that in accepting what we cannot do or be, we begin to discover who we can be and what we can do.</i> <i>Thus, recovery is a process.</i> <i>It is a way of life.</i> <i>It is an attitude and a way of approaching the day’s challenges.</i> <i>It is not a perfectly linear process.</i> <i>Like the sea rose, recovery has its seasons, its time of downward growth into the darkness to secure new roots and then the times of breaking out into the sunlight.</i> <i>But most of all recovery is a slow, deliberate process that occurs by poking through one little grain of sand at a time.</i><p>Only you are the expert of you. That said, there exist recovery colleges that can provide peer support. You&#x27;re not alone.')
