No one is asking company directors to take a pay cut based on cost of living calculations, because company directors have power over their companies.  Similarly cleaners are paid peanuts even if they have to live&#x2F;commute to high cost of living cities to do the job, because cleaners have no power in the relationship.  This is also why workers who unionise can be paid more - the union has power over the employer.')
