A good number of them die by holding their breath. Very scary. It’s a complication of an already rare disorder. The medication has been around since 1966 though, it’s clonidine&#x2F;catapres. The first doctor she mentioned it to just rudely corrected her on the pronunciation rather than give any actual feedback on whether or not it could help.<p>I think you’re absolutely correct about having dozens of other patients.
