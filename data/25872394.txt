It&#x27;s leveraging it&#x27;s <i>own</i> resources, which it created at substantial cost.<p>People look at the money Amazon is making with ES, as if it&#x27;s making money off ES, rather than off ES &amp; AWS. The money Amazon would otherwise leave on the table wouldn&#x27;t necessarily go to ES, I doubt ES has an claim to being worse off. It&#x27;s &quot;unlimited&quot; service usage taps markets that might be out of reach for ES otherwise.')
