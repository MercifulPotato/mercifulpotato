But if you go overboard you differentiate yourself too much and make your product much harder to reason about and interact with.<p>As a user trying to get value out of a product I mostly don&#x27;t care what it looks like.  I do care a lot if slow animations or videos keep getting in my way.  Nice the first time, <i>fucking miserable</i> on the hundred and first.')
