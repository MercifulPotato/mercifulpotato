Item(by='edmundsauto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606077157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179488, text='&gt; science appears to be fairly poor at building universal belief, which is something religion excelled at with scientific precision<p>Can you elaborate on this?  What, exactly, is this universal belief?<p>On your statement of scientific precision -what do you mean by &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;precise&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m trying to follow what you&#x27;re saying in this discussion, but it&#x27;s difficult because we do not share the same definitions.  EG, you seem to be using science in place where I would use &quot;process for iterating to meet a goal&quot;.  To me, science is trying to prove yourself wrong a million ways, so you can sort of accept that the null hypothesis is wrong.<p>Put another way - I would be ecstatic to see undeniable objective proof of a deity.  Religious believers would not be similarly happy to have one of their core beliefs destroyed.  The difference is religious beliefs are fragile to disorder; scientific beliefs are anti-fragile.')
