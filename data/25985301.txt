Having an enemy always helps rally people to a cause. In the case of this GME saga, WSB’s juvenile hatred towards funds they perceive as their opponents actually ended up being their biggest rhetorical win. The media picked up the story of “Reddit vs hedge funds” and ran with it because it’s much more interesting than “amateur investors want to get rich quick”. That generated the huge public interest, and was helped by a large array of pundits and politicians(like AOC) who wanted to get their nose in the publicity trough when they saw the media feeding frenzy.
