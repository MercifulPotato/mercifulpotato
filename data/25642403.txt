In fact, most artificial sweeteners are considered &quot;free foods&quot; — foods containing less than 20 calories and 5 grams or less of carbohydrates — because they don&#x27;t count as calories or carbohydrates on a diabetes exchange. Remember, however, that other ingredients in foods containing artificial sweeteners can still affect your blood sugar level.<p>That said, it&#x27;s probably still not super healthy for my to be ingesting as much aspartame as I do. Eventually I need to ween myself off that, but one step at a time I suppose.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;diabetes&#x2F;expert-answers&#x2F;artificial-sweeteners&#x2F;faq-20058038" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;diabetes&#x2F;expe...</a>')
