I worked in south India earlier this year, and I found people there completely undisciplined on the road, but very friendly. Like line splitting in front of a bus with a friendly smile and a gentle press on the horn.<p>Exactly.  There&#x27;s local norms of conduct for traffic everywhere.  There&#x27;s standards for acceptable aggression and obliviousness (and other attributes).  Paris, India, etc are all low on obliviousness.  If you expect to be able to just blindly follow markings and signals and think that all you have to watch out for is the car in front of you you are going to have a bad time.  India is lower on aggressiveness because the nature of the traffic there really doesn&#x27;t lend itself to that.  Likewise if you try to drive like you&#x27;re in Rome in a wealthy American suburb or somewhere else where high obliviousness is the norm you&#x27;re gonna piss a lot of people off because you&#x27;re not gonna behave the way they expect.')
