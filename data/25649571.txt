AFAIK, the US has imposed sanctions on numerous countries since WWII and not in a single instance has it lead to a revolution in America&#x27;s favour.<p>Another possibility is that the US simply wants to isolate its geopolitical enemies and impoverish them. As it has been doing with Cuba since Batista was overthrown.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced US foreign policy were rational, but a possible rational explanation for US sanctions is to make an example of countries that refuse US dominance. Similar to how a gang running a protection racket punishes those who refuse to pay protection money.<p>Regardless of <i>why</i> US foreign policy has deemed it necessary to starve the Iranian people, it will not lead to a revolution in America&#x27;s favour. The Shah is not coming back. It will just lead to more death of Iranians.')
