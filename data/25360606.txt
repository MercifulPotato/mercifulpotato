I made this tool initially to clean messy customer data from spreadsheets.<p>I released the API endpoints this week for 8 data types: Address, Names, Company Names, Dates, Emails, Phones, Open Ended Notes and Currency.<p>Things I found myself constantly writing data cleaning functions for in ETL processes or my web apps.<p>The data cleaning is aimed towards North American and European data but test it out with your own values. The algorithms are broad and can maybe clean your data too if you are outside of those regions.<p>This is a tough endeavor so feel free to reach out to me with any feedback or suggestions!')
