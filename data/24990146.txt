Bank of America was a primary player in structuring withdrawls to maximize overdraft fines on their customers.<p>Chase has its own problems, but it would add a lot of inconvenience to your life to eliminate it.<p>Those three big players have purchased the majority of other banks in the country, leaving a scattered few credit unions and smaller banks around, which will be extra inconvenient when you travel and they absolutely will not offer the same range of credit cards with good rewards programs.')
