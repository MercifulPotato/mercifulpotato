But look at the incentives: CEOs are often terrible people because, to become CEO, you have to battle your way to the top in an increasingly machiavellian up-or-out pyramid and make awful decisions in the interest of the business (I&#x27;ve had to fire someone, it is horrible.)  So we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find many sociopaths there.<p>The offered solutions don&#x27;t address incentives, and rely on the board, which is filled with the same type of people who are in the C-Suite.  Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?<p>We are all aware that sociopaths are bad.  Tell us something we don&#x27;t know, Berkeley.')
