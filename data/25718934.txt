The initial plan is to build various categories, such as Podcast, Flight, Food, Shop, Math, etc. This approach will allow us to provide higher quality results compared to a general-purpose search engine, and it can hopefully allow us to slowly grow until we figure out how to handle the costs of Bing&#x27;s API.<p>We just launched a Domain category (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;domain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;domain</a>), which consist of a domain name finder that makes it easy to find great domains like FireFox, MailChimp, TaskRabbit, etc. by combining two words, searching through hundreds of domains in seconds.')
