For a start, this network observability requires fusion of data from multitude of sensors, parameters, entities, components, etc to provide accurate model for physical and&#x2F;or virtual world. For example if you are trying to develop level 5 autonomous driving system, comprehensive data fusion, integration and analytics is the very first step towards successful automation.<p>If you think that the term network observability is familiar, it is because the main reason eBPF is created was to perform comprehensive Linux OS observability. There is a wonderful website that you can see and observe (pun intended) how to perform network observability, and why it is really useful [2].<p>By supporting and representing data as &quot;versor&quot; natively in programming languages you can easily model and perform insightful animation similar to here [3]. There is also a recent post on HN about ObservableHQ website itself [4].<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25142528" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25142528</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@enkimute&#x2F;animated-orbits" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@enkimute&#x2F;animated-orbits</a><p>[4]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25161409" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25161409</a>')
