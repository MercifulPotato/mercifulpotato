It&#x27;s not like they switched to an inflation target of 20%.  Having inflation be below 2% for long periods of time is not something that ever came up before 2008, and the Fed is promising that they won&#x27;t remove stimulus too soon.<p>I don&#x27;t agree that companies failing in a recession is &quot;natural&quot;.  I guess COVID is natural, but a restaurant business that goes under because their customers are temporarily afraid of dying is not a result of being poorly run, but of bad luck.  I also don&#x27;t agree that there is too much risk taking -- rather I think there is too little.
