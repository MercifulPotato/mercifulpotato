I&#x27;ve always worked in big enterprises; one thing that always hit me was how easy it was for teams to turn inwards and become silos. People don&#x27;t bond outside their circles. Then, instead of one big community, what we had were many different little tribes plotting against one another.<p>So I build Pluckd. To help companies strengthen their employee relationships and skills in a way to keep everyone connected and motivated. Since this was the first big project I coded myself, so I used the languages I was familiar with the most. It&#x27;s a Django monolith with a PostgreSQL database. The design was from the bootstrap template I got at creative-tim.com.<p>I learned a lot while coding it, like using Wagtail as a CMS and how to use Django REST Framework to begin the transition to using APIs. Next, I plan on implementing notifications and email reports, which will allow me to learn stuff like Firebase and Celery, so I&#x27;m very excited!<p>I hope this can be valuable to you. And I&#x27;m really excited to hear your thoughts!')
