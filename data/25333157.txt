(Other frameworks such as React should work as well, I just haven&#x27;t experimented with them very much so far).<p>Munging these tools together has let me create my own &#x27;distributed back end framework&#x27;, so I can define back-end logic and front-end logic in the same place, but have the back-end logic run on whichever machine I choose, so e.g. an edge device can send a fragment of UI to a monitoring dashboard.<p>It&#x27;s all rather nice and I&#x27;m very pleased with myself. :-)')
