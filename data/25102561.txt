There are also several gears and bearings to support their functions. Far easier to strap 4 motors with props to a cross and drive them using a solid state SBC integrated with RF,6 axis gyro and 4 power transistors.<p>Many of these new hobby drones use all the same parts across several different manufacturers so there is an economy of scale to considet too.')
