All of your points are good, there was just one I wanted to follow up on.<p>&gt;I think that&#x27;s a better use of my money than taking care of one human being.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily true.  Your child(ren) (and their child(ren) and their&#x27;s, etc.) also have the potential to earn and donate money to effective causes.  Those donations might end up greater than the ones you can accomplish in your own lifetime.<p>Of course, &quot;net good to current and future humanity&quot; is only one part of the equation.')
