This is the same as was done in Stan&#x27;s predecessors, BUGS and JAGS.<p>A Stan program can be run in any of our interfaces in Python, Julia, R, MATLAB, Stata, etc.  But you can&#x27;t mix any of those languages into a Stan program.<p>The C++ toolchain is required because Stan transpiles its programs to C++, then compiles those against the Stan math librarym, which does autodiff.  But you don&#x27;t need to write any C++ to use Stan, just to develop extensions for it.')
