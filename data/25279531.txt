Lo and behold, Trump lost the election, and he&#x27;s on Twitter bitching about it.<p>What I don&#x27;t see is any evidence of Trump supporters rioting, or engaging in violence, or Trump trying to usurp power like crazy people said was going to happen.<p>Perhaps you should take a chill-pill? States are certifying election results (including Republican majority states). Trump is pursuing legal options, as he is entitled to. Pretty clear that Biden will officially become President-elect when the Electoral College meets later this month (By the way, remember when crazy people in 2016 were trying to get electors to not vote for Trump even though he won [1]?).<p>So what&#x27;s the problem? That Scott Adams is calling this election fraudulent? That&#x27;s par for course. For example, every election that Democrats lose, is also labeled fraudulent, due to &#x27;voter suppression&#x27;, or Russian meddling or Diebold machines being hacked (remember that one from 2004? [2]). It&#x27;s a &#x27;meh&#x27;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0z0iuWh3sek" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0z0iuWh3sek</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2004&#x2F;03&#x2F;diebolds-political-machine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2004&#x2F;03&#x2F;diebolds-politi...</a>')
