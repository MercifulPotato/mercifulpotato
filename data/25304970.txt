Item(by='reificator', descendants=None, kids=[25305476], score=None, time=1607102228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302132, text='I&#x27;m trying to read the article but I&#x27;m distracted by the awful body text justification on mobile.<p>I usually justify my ebooks so I&#x27;m well aware that automated justification is hard, but this is a whole new level.<p>There are lines with two four letter words stretched across the line, while the next line has spaces large enough to fit two more words comfortably or vice versa.<p><pre><code>    anineliminable aspect to learning\n    that                      takes\n    place after the glorious flow state.\n</code></pre>\nThere are lines with large spaces between words followed by lines with no justification  whatsoever that just end before the right side of the screen.  The unjustified lines aren&#x27;t even the last line in the paragraph, and when the next line isn&#x27;t the end of the paragraph it goes back to being justified!<p><pre><code>    attention to the material at hand is\n    essential. Graspingcomplex\n    information is hard.\n</code></pre>\nThen there&#x27;s the words with no spaces between them, like  graspingcomplex or anineliminable from the previous examples.<p>It all adds up to make the post very difficult to read.  I hope it&#x27;s not something intentional, like &quot;I&#x27;ll force the speedreaders to slow down and think about what they&#x27;re reading.&quot;. Intentional friction never seems to have the intended effect unless the intent is to drive people away entirely.')
