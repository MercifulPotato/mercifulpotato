Lol. As blockchains are the worlds most expensive and slow databases, that also have silent bit-rot... You must run your own computer that verifies that what you&#x27;ve written stays written, and doesn&#x27;t get forked away, and that it even wrote in the first place, as the block could be full or your 1st block you are &quot;in&quot; gets orphaned.<p>Thus, you must really, truly need censorship resistance to accept that sucktitude. So what are people censoring? Financial transaction, social media posts (but they must for moderation anyway.) Websites are also censored, which is layer down the stack from social posts, The low throughput of blockchains makes them inappropriate for this purpose. Probably also for the social posts as well. Good luck!')
