Item(by='brian_herman__', descendants=None, kids=[24991658], score=None, time=1604507188, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988018, text='Acommmenter on Seeking Alpha Debunked this article here it is as follows:<p>David Haggith<p>The article is a total fail.\nThe fact that the author has &quot;gold&quot; in his name is telling. It&#x27;s an attempt to sell gold. He&#x27;s talking his book.\nAlmost the entire article that claims in its title we already have hyperinflation is really an article about hyperinflation in money supply. We all know we have had that to the tune of trillions of dollars for an entire decade. The author&#x27;s claim is that, since we have hyperinflation in money supply, it is almost a foregone conclusion we have it in prices (dollar-value loss). It&#x27;s an article that essentially says, &quot;It is theoretically supposed to happen; therefore, it is happening.&quot;\nThe author, however, does almost nothing to justify any claim of devaluation of money or inflation of prices. We&#x27;ve seen stocks inflate and bond prices, and now we are seeing housing prices inflate. All are assets so not exactly cost-of living, except with housing it becomes both-- a rise in the price of a highly valued asset that is also essential for living.\nHe mentions some obscure inflation index most of us have probably never heard of as if we should accept it at face value. It&#x27;s almost irrelevant anyway. Outside of housing, you can quote any inflation gauge you want, and it doesn&#x27;t matter. Each of us can look to our own lives and say, &quot;How bad is inflation hurting me? Is it worse than any other time in my life.&quot; Outside of housing, I do NOT experience that price inflation (dollar value deflation) is hurting me any differently than it has for most of my life. It is nothing compared what I felt during the Nixon years; and even that was far from hyperinflation.\nSo far.\nSo, the article is almost click-bait because it does not prove or even present much realistic evidence for the kind of inflation it is talking about that erodes our standard of living -- price inflation &#x2F; dollar-value deflation. Inflation is always a loss for all of us, so I&#x27;d rather not ever have inflation; still, it is so far still percolating along as usual, except in housing right now. (edited)')
