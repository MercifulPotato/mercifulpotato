Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610174328, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25697138, text='&gt; Why would I want to tell people they are wrong about how they experience the world when they disagree with the way I do?<p>This is about facts, not experiences of the world, or opinions.<p>Factual statements can be wrong.  If you don&#x27;t believe in telling people they are wrong when they are plainly wrong, what are your criteria for telling people anything at all?<p>Granted, the relationship between facts, truths, experiences, opinions and voices is a complex one, but somewhere in there are still the underlying concepts of <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>, <i>right</i> (correct) and <i>wrong</i> (incorrect).<p>More pragmatically, pertinent to the recent USA election, unfounded ideas that are hypothetically possible but unlikely, investigated by many independent minds of good standing, and found to be lacking anything approaching adequate evidence have to be treated as settled for the purposes of moving forward on an issue.  As &quot;no, seriously, we have looked at this hard enough now that we have move forward treating it as a checked truth even while acknowledging the now-unlikely possibility that we are incorrect&quot;.<p>People disagree about how much effort to put into investigating such things and how to assess evidence (or lack thereof), but for democracy and social stability (safety) to continue, most of them need to agree that sufficient process has been followed at some point.  The quality of process and conclusiveness are essential.  This is one of the hallmarks of effective democracy.<p>If you want to be especially respectful of people who you believe are wrong about key significant facts, then I think it best to acknowledge their facts are not literally impossible, but have been investigated and are looking strongly unlikely as a result.')
