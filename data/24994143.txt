Sure it has to be done in the application, but overall it will result in better outcomes for AAA titles.<p>For other apps using higher-level OpenGL&#x2F;DX11 the existing multigpu drivers are still available - for now - but NVIDIA just want you to buy a single faster 3xxx-series card, that will almost certainly outperform implicit multigpu on an older card. They aren&#x27;t updating SLI profiles after January, and aren&#x27;t supporting them at all on the 3xxx series cards.')
