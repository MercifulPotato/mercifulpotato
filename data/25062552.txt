That&#x27;s why &quot;warrant canaries&quot;[1] exist, a company will release a regular statement where they include a line like &quot;We have never been forced to comply with the US federal government.&quot;. That way if it does happen they can simply remove the line from future releases to make it clear without violating an injuction.<p>Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t get you any sort of specificity in terms of what happened with what data or why so it&#x27;s a pretty crude method. Also a court could force you to keep that canary statement active which renders the whole thing moot.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Warrant_canary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Warrant_canary</a>')
