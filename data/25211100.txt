We can improve political issues and we do it by defending our opinions in the public sphere, which has the power to change others&#x27; opinions. If you don&#x27;t work to present your ideas to the world in the best possible light then you will just allow other, weaker ideas to become more convincing in comparison, thus doing a disservice to anyone who could have been convinced otherwise.<p>I am sorry that politics is tiring but I think that is just a reality of politics being a manifestation of natural forces. The natural world is competitive, it&#x27;s competitive on the cellular level, the food chain is competitive, and human societies are competitive too. Looking the other way doesn&#x27;t change the reality, it just guarantees that the opinions of others will become more significant to the world than your own. Just like how our cells compete to form the best possible body, I think we are obligated to compete with our ideas to form the best possible society.')
