Solutions which come to mind are Medicare for All, UBI, free public college, and an end to Homelessness; all paid for by higher income taxes on the top 10% (we can start with ending the absurd FICA cap, and then raise rates).<p>It&#x27;s not at all obvious to me how coders at an Ad company putting an intermediary between themselves and an employer changes... anything. I get that Unions <i>were THE answer</i> in the past - The Jungle and all that. But it&#x27;s a different world and I just... don&#x27;t get it!<p>(Just to add - some of the &quot;pro capital&quot; comments are just as silly. I don&#x27;t think Unions will ruin the world, I think they&#x27;re just sort of &#x27;fine&#x27; and super tangential to more important policy topics)')
