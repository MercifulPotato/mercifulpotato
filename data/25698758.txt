They have a VERY extreme slant to the left, so much so that news casters were even becoming anti-vaxxers against the Covid-19 vaccine simply because Trump was the president at the time trying to push for people to take it. Their handling of Covid-19 early on was also atrocious. I don&#x27;t mean to demean them if they&#x27;re your favorite news source, but they&#x27;ve lost a lot of faith in the past few years.<p>The others, NPR, NBC, etc, I think you&#x27;d be surprised how many Republicans watch them for a differing point of view. There are many republicans who are more libertarian, classical liberal, or independent leaning than classically conservative leaning.<p>That&#x27;s part of the problem though with this argument, is that the &quot;right&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;republican&quot; can actually be very different things. It seems that most people on hacker news lump them all into the same category.<p>Also, not every conservative is an over-the-top Trump supporter. I&#x27;m definitely not. It doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t like some of the things he did, but he&#x27;s got a lot of issues and was FAR from my ideal candidate.')
