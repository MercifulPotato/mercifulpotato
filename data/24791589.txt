We feel that this leads to a different dynamic when having conversations around topics, and is much more intimate.<p>I started building Sqwok to scratch my own itch after a period where I was reading a lot of news online, and working in the news industry. I couldn&#x27;t find many places to have open, public, realtime discussions about what was going on in the world. The best web-based chat sites right now were built to target gamers, the gaming community, streaming, enterprise, or solely as private messaging apps.<p>Sqwok is built for a general audience who want to have ephemeral, long-lived, and engaging conversations with others across the internet, with low friction and ease of use.<p>All features developed for sqwok will only be to enhance the conversations.<p>Feel free to ask me any questions, thank you.')
