I can vividly remember all sorts of smells from back then - how different rooms smelled differently, how opening a closet, cupboard, book, bag or whatever would flood my mind with different sensations. \nToday I have to stick my nose directly down to things to smell them properly.<p>Then once in a while, some days my sense of smell magically works a lot better. I then go around smelling everything almost like a crazy person and I get extremely nostalgic with all the memories that comes flooding back. Then the next day it’s gone. Doctors at a loss and I’ve found no connection to what I eat. It’s infuriating.<p>On the flipside my mental imaging skills have always been very good. I’m quite good at following maps and it’s like I always mentally knows which way is north&#x2F;south&#x2F;east&#x2F;west. I can mentally “fly through” entire 3D scenes (between cities, through 3D maps in computer games) and I visualize most algorithms I program in some abstract 3D space. If asked to recite a license plate I have to bring up a mental image of the plate and then read it off of that. For things I know by heart I don’t have to of course. I used to (badly) remember birthdays as an arrow pointing on a date on some circular disk representing the year. Because I had so little interest in remembering birthdays when I was younger, my sisters made a disc for me with the birthdays on it - but my sisters mental view of the year wasn’t the same (rotated) so it confused me even more than it helped.<p>During preschool we were introduced to the various ways people learn (visual, aural, verbal, physical, logical, social, solitary). It is probably not a very accurate representation of how we actually learn but it was an eye opener to me that not everyone saw the way that I did.')
