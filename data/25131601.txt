Item(by='mjrbrennan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605658194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25129396, text='&gt; Does anyone really need to be warned that they are using the passive voice? Does anyone actually do that by accident?<p>Yes, all the time. I write a lot and still fall into the trap, and it is hard not to do it sometimes especially if you were only introduced to the concept later in life. I try hard not to use the passive voice, but there are times when I think it is acceptable, and there are occasions where the alternative is more confusing. The quoted speech &quot;Now we are engaged in a great civil war...&quot; sounds perfectly fine to me!<p>Honestly, I have trouble thinking of an alternative sometimes, even when I can identify a passive voice sentence.')
