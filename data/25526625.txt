On websites you often can&#x27;t navigate just with the keyboard and shortcuts does not work at all. An a really terrible new UI thing are these on &#x2F; off sliders. So often is not clear where the slider is, because it&#x27;s not clear if the slider or the background is colored. Also a lot of new software comes with shortcuts, but you would need 3 hands to push all buttons for it.\nAlso for me, all the Google style, round, flat, to much color, I just can&#x27;t see it anymore. I hate the look so much.')
