Item(by='makeworld', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606097530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182834, text='&gt; SaaS company is breaking no American laws and ICE isn&#x27;t either<p>That doesn&#x27;t make it apolitical. Politics is more than just what&#x27;s legal and what&#x27;s not. ICE is a political organization, and there are different political stances that support it or don&#x27;t. A company doing business with ICE supports it in some way, and is therefore political.<p>&gt; The fact you even think its morally correct to deny them service screams how ideologically possessed you are. Here&#x27;s a hot fuckin&#x27; take for you... don&#x27;t illegally come to America.<p>Sounds like you have your own political stance on ICE and the work they do, and whether it&#x27;s okay for a company to provide services to them. This only proves the parent&#x27;s point.<p>&gt; Maybe you&#x27;re not doing politics, maybe you&#x27;re just not a shitbag.<p>These are not mutually exclusive, in fact they are often closely related. The example the parent gave about worker pay, unionization, etc, are political issues -  they are associated with political stances, and have been since the beginning.')
