Paul Graham and Peter Levels both seem to advocate for this approach.<p>My problem is that I rarely get any ideas I notice. Maybe I&#x27;m not doing enough stuff? Maybe all my stuff is very basic? Is there something else that I could do everyday that will &quot;exercise my mind&quot; for coming up with business ideas?')
