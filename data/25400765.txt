Sure, initially one would be slower using a shell driven workflow as opposed to someone using an IDE. However, the more you stick to it, the more you find out that the skills you&#x27;ve gathered are very transferable and are applicable across languages, projects, types of projects, tasks, types of work, and even whole industries.<p>If you know the shell well and are well versed in a good CLI text editor such as Vim or Emacs, the programming language of the day doesn&#x27;t matter. Whether you&#x27;re coding or setting up some environment doesn&#x27;t matter. Whether you&#x27;re on your computer, connected to some server, or an embedded device doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>EDIT: And eventually, you&#x27;re not slower than someone using an IDE either.')
