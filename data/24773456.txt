But in practice they create inflationary pressure.<p>&gt; Also, a bank is not limited by reserves to lend. In fact, in practice, banks first lend and then search for the reserves in the inter-bank market. Those demand-offer dynamics between banks determine the interest rate. If the Central Bank doesn&#x27;t want to loss control of the interest rate, it has to increase reserves in the system when there is demand.<p>This is exactly what my original post said. Of course they search for reserves in the inter-bank lending market. But the more reserves there are in that market, the cheaper they are to borrow, which reduces the rate that banks have to charge to earn their spread, which increases demand for credit, which increases the money supply.')
