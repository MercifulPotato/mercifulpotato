Beyond the fact that your interpretation doesn’t follow from the evidence you’ve provided, as pointed out by the neighbor post, you’ve misstated what CrowdTangle is measuring.<p>All of the top 10 links shared on FB in a week typically consists of NPR&#x2F;NYT&#x2F;TMZ etc. Recently the left leaning website MoveOn was in the top 3 (source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tomgara&#x2F;status&#x2F;1310314212078620680?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tomgara&#x2F;status&#x2F;1310314212078620680?s=21</a>).<p>Shapiro or Bongino are never near the top 10 in terms of link engagement - the metric they do well on is sum total page engagement. Which makes sense - anecdotally, most of me and my left leaning millennial peers are getting our online political engagement from Twitter and Instagram. AOC is a sensation on Insta, Bongino is not.<p>I see you’re relying on Kevin Roose for your information -  unfortunately he’s an absolute spigot of misinformation. I made the same mistake in the past, until I took a deeper look into these issues, and found most of what he says to be totally wrong. I hope you, and others, will reconsider taking him at face value in the future.')
