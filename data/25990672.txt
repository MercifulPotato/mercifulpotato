I watched The Big Short yesterday for the first time, as it&#x27;s trending on Netflix and was suggested, and this moment feels similar to exposing a weakness in the system that needs to be addressed - and hopefully not to strengthen the wrong position; I didn&#x27;t realize the incredible actors cast for it, obviously they took on the roles as it&#x27;s an incredibly important story for the general public to be educated about, to understand.<p>Feels like a good day to watch The Wolf of Wall Sreet.')
