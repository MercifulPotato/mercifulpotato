What&#x27;s that word for revenue minus expenses again?<p>A more honest explanation: Accounting depreciation != the actual change in value of things, and the cash flow statement can let you know when GAAP accounting isn&#x27;t giving an accurate picture of success.<p>And about Malone&#x27;s insight on leverage: Leverage ups your return on investment (when things don&#x27;t blow up). Paying interest doesn&#x27;t help you hide money from the tax man any better than setting dollar bills on fire would, but leverage can make big things happen from small amounts of investment.')
