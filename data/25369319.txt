The type of people who want to be perceived as smart, etc. Don&#x27;t enjoy it intrinsically. Of course they make other moronic decisions like stay at a job. The job was the first moronic decision. I know a guy like this who&#x27;s dream is to have a yoga studio, but that&#x27;s perceived very differently than a Director of Software Engineering. He totally has enough money (and passion) to do it well. You can&#x27;t force people to be happy.')
