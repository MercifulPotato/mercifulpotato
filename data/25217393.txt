My friends and I spent countless hours playing this in school, though my interest in it far outlasted theirs.<p>Line Rider was (is) such a great avenue for artistic and tinkering spirit. Someone else here called it a &quot;demoscene&quot; and that&#x27;s a perfect comparison. It&#x27;s a very easy game and community to get sucked into.<p>This track is pretty cool, and that ending is incredible. Nice to read that you were able to come back to a revived community and finish the project. I guess I&#x27;ll go watch all my favorite tracks now, thanks :)<p>As an aside, it&#x27;s great to see many here on HN who also love(d) this game. Not that I&#x27;m surprised the two communities would overlap, but there were at least a few years between the last time I built a track and the first time I came to HN. There are such strong common threads of interest across the internet.')
