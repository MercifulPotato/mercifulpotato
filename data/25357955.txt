Most users might not directly care about the license of the software they use, especially between free software licenses, but they might care about the consequences even if they are not aware of the causal relation.<p>You might not know anything about how the engine works in your car but it is still important that it is made correctly. The whole Free Software movement targets end users and works on the assumption that these questions are important for them.<p>Licenses might look like non significant technical details to most end users, but they are not, and many people not in the field are able to understand the subtleties. We should consider  people&#x27;s ignorance inevitable. This is not a fact we can&#x27;t do anything about. Software is omnipresent in our societies and as massive effects on them.

Nvidia seems to the exception here, and only concerns Nvidia&#x27;s hardware anyway.
