Item(by='8fingerlouie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606127829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185265, text='&gt; Was that because the dog was the only part of the environment, that was alive &#x2F; uncontrollable<p>When i got my current dog i built an outdoor dog kennel (12m2) for it. My previous dog lived inside in a temperature controlled environment, so i never wondered if it would get too hot or too cold. It did however destroy most of our stuff when it was alone.<p>Living in Scandinavia, temperatures can vary from +35C to -18C during the year, and while most of the range is &quot;ok&quot; (27C - -8C), the extremes was the reason for building it in the first place.<p>Had the dog been living outside all the time this wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem, but when confined to a (relatively) small space, and living indoors for half it&#x27;s day means that in the summer it cannot move to a better&#x2F;cooler place, and in the winter it may not have a thick enough winter coat.<p>It has an insulated dog house there, approved for all year usage for guard dogs, and unlike my previous dog, this one actually uses it - though mostly when it rains.')
