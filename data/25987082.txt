I know a bit about this but I&#x27;m not an expert on this. Naively, those put options are effectively offered by those providing a short (they think the price is going to go down, or have a way to hedge the price decrease). Those don&#x27;t get represented as shorts either. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corporatefinanceinstitute.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;trading-investing&#x2F;put-option&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;corporatefinanceinstitute.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;tr...</a><p>The other thing to consider here: if some entity needs to provide the put option, how does one hedge (risk manage) a put option ? They need to consider what would happen if the price drops, and as the price drops their hedge needs to increase in price. There&#x27;s undoubtedly more to this, but that relationship sounds awfully like a short.<p>Any experts want to wade in here?')
