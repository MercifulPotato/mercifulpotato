California has had huge fires every year &#x27;since forever&#x27; just like Australia, but awareness of this is low because living memory of the past hundred years is of an aberrantly wet period.  Being hot, dry and on fire has been California&#x27;s typical climate for two thousand years at least and the past 20 are a return to that.  If anything, California is still <i>wetter</i> than usual, not dryer.<p>Clear all the brush you want, California will almost certainly continue to get hotter and dryer than it was a century ago, and the fires will continue.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel for California, only an orange glow on the horizon.  Fire management strategies that worked a century ago for wet California will not continue to work.  That was never maintainable.')
