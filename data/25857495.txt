All of a sudden as they round a corner, the brakes fail. After a few terrifying moments, the car skids to a halt and they emerged unscathed.<p>The physicist thinks for a second, and says &quot;It must be the lower pressure due to the air, it&#x27;s made some of our brake fluid evaporate, we should get some more brake fluid before we get back in the car.&quot; The mathematician says &quot;No if we calculate the rate of a evaporation we&#x27;d never lose that much. It must be a leak in the lines. We should fix the leak before we get back in&quot; The programmer says &quot;Let&#x27;s get back in the car and see if it&#x27;s reproducible.&quot;')
