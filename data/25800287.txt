I know that Zig isn&#x27;t at a v1 yet (or wasn&#x27;t at the time, at least) but that&#x27;s no excuse to shut down conversation about security.<p>I also don&#x27;t like that the discord is run like a cult. If you say anything bad about Zig, you&#x27;re berated until you ultimately have to leave. It&#x27;s the Rust community all over again.')
