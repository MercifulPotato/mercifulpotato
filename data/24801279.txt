I’m just bristling at the parent comment who seemed to be saying that in our new AI-driven world, free speech is no longer an intrinsically valuable thing.<p>Those are all good points.<p>I didn&#x27;t understand GP to be claiming that ML algorithms trump free speech, which may explain why we&#x27;re actually in violent agreement WRT YouTube&#x27;s recommendation algorithms.<p>I&#x27;d note that I avoid the big social media sites like the plague, and not even primarily for the toxic atmosphere.  Rather, I find the business model to be inherently cynical, exploitative and destructive of communities (cf. sites like nextdoor.com).<p>As long as the incentives (maximization of advertising dollars) favor pushing for ever higher engagement, the cycle that creates increasingly fine-tuned filter bubbles and &quot;targeted&quot; advertising, we&#x27;re going to see less focus on free expression from large corporations, because their primary goal is to maximize profit.<p>I believe that this model will eventually collapse and be replaced (with something better or worse, I don&#x27;t know) with a different one.  My concern is in the damage that this will do to our discourse and societal cohesion in the meantime.<p>Which points to larger problems with our economic model.  Maximizing short-term profit is fetishized as all-important, regardless of potential downsides[0].  That focus legitimizes predatory behavior based on the (incorrect) idea that captialism is <i>necessarily</i> a zero-sum game.<p>This distorts the economy and the culture, pitting us against each other in surprising (and very destructive) ways.<p>I am most certainly <i>not</i> advocating that we abandon capitalism, as its had a largely positive effect on health, wealth, technological advancement and a host of other areas.<p>Rather, I believe we need to change the <i>incentives</i> around markets to encourage a broader, fairer capitalism that creates increased prosperity for <i>everyone</i>, rather than those already at the top.<p>[0] From a long-term perspective, focusing primarily on short-term extraction of value from the economy is self-defeating.  Primarily because our economy&#x27;s success is based on consumer spending (~70% of the US&#x27; GDP is consumer spending).  Through wage suppression, rent-seeking and (a good thing) automation, we&#x27;re reducing the ability of larger and larger segments of the population to contribute to that 2&#x2F;3+ of the economy.  If unchecked, we&#x27;ll eventually get to the point where wealth and income are so concentrated that we won&#x27;t be able to sustain that model and <i>everyone</i> will lose.<p>Because there are only so many pairs of jeans, lava lamps, snow globes, raisins, cars, houses or pizza pies that any one individual or household can use.<p>This argues for a much broader distribution of economic resources (wages, access to capital, safety nets, infrastructure, etc., etc., etc.) than we have now.  This <i>could</i> provide enormous benefits to those who have the least and, in the long-term, those who have the most.<p>Beyond that, it can create a stronger, more resilient economy for <i>everyone</i>.')
