This is why you can find the best information from &quot;indie founders&quot;, people who are 5-6 steps (not 1000 like Altman) ahead of you and outline their experiences. I&#x27;ve been collecting&#x2F;summarizing their experiences in a project I currently do on acquisition channels [2] and most of it is WAY more concrete than your-average-TechCrunch-article.<p>For example, for a company that had success with Google Ads (and they started with it 10 years ago), the founder probably forgot how it&#x27;s like to be a beginner. When interviewed, they&#x27;re likely to say more abstract things like &quot;Make sure you have a good user experience&quot;. It makes sense, because these things work OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. But your-average-founder simply wants to know what WORKS NOW, what keywords can he bid on, etc. This is where experiences from founders who got started months (rather than years) ago comes useful.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curse_of_knowledge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curse_of_knowledge</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a>')
