The average person likely has beliefs that would fall on both sides and this incessant need to categorize someone as either left or right just leads to more polarization and more extreme views. When people are told they must be one thing because they have certain views about one issue, meanwhile their views on other issues lean more to the other side. But because of this strange all or nothing paradigm going on, there&#x27;s no room for common ground or compromise, it&#x27;s all or nothing one side or the other, you believe one thing, so you must believe all the things or you&#x27;re on this side or the other.<p>That&#x27;s utter nonsense, political spectrums aren&#x27;t all or nothing, take it or leave it, all inclusive things. A person is capable of having a range of views on different issues that may fall on either side and it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable for this to be the case.<p>Politics like everything in life isn&#x27;t black and white  all or nothing, take it or leave it, it&#x27;a a bunch of shades of grey like everything else and as with most things the average person, when asked about issues without the context of left or right involved, will likely express views that fall across both sides of the political spectrum.')
