The reason why several major media outlets ignored the story is that they didn&#x27;t want to play ball this time. They have written about this. They don&#x27;t have an obligation to present strategically-crafted stories as if it were real news.<p>Do you think Trump is throwing pardons around just for shits and giggles? This is the first time ever that a US president has been using pardons as get-out-of-jail-free cards for his friends and allies. And he&#x27;s throwing them around because he has a habit of associating himself with criminals who commit crimes (on his behalf) and therefore need pardons.<p>Trump wants to pardon his family, Giuliani, and potentially even himself. Which would not make the slightest bit of sense unless they had committed serious crimes. And if you argue that he wants to use the pardons to prevent those pesky democrats from setting him up, I want you to imagine a scenario where Biden was doing the exact same thing.<p>Biden and Harris will be scrutinized in much the same way presidents and their VPs have been traditionally. Trump is an anomaly.')
