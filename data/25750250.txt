They are ill-preppared to deal with hate speech and often will act as the very propagators of it. (See FB in 2016). The real issue to be found is the massive control they have in light of their blindness to the context of their product and inability to enact real censorship of things that are truly intolerant. Personally looking from the outside in, I think that makes them a long-term risk to themselves rather than just a risk to society. It&#x27;s worth noting that this will likely lead to a platform that intentionally &#x27;free&#x27; to intolerant behavior that will compete and likely compete well as it will be additive to those looking for hate.')
