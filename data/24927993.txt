Those highly-paid tech workers will bring lots of tax money to wherever they go, so cities will likely try to court them however they can. I also think that software engineering salaries will be somewhat overvalued without the burden of coastal rent pushing them up. This may cause some level of inflation, as non-technical positions have to raise their salaries to keep everyone from going back to school for a CS degree.')
