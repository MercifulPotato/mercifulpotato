Suburbs reaching further out, without the infrastructure to support them, are not a happy ending.<p>So cap how far out you can build. Generally, of course, that already exists.<p>&gt; High risers in the wrong places cause infrastructure overload too.<p>More houses means more residents means more jobs means more tax revenue.
