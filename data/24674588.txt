I&#x27;ve done plenty of optimizations for performance-critical systems and have never known any of these numbers. Certainly, I know general principles like &quot;disk is a lot slower than memory&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t block the UI on a network call&quot;. But knowing whether an L1 cache read is 0.5ns or 5ns has never been necessary. You can optimize so much &quot;highly optimized&quot; code out there without those numbers. I&#x27;m sure there are <i>some</i> people that have to know that stuff, maybe a couple people on an AAA video game title, or computer engineers at Intel. But it&#x27;s the exception and not the norm.')
