Citations are what advance a scientist in their career, and anything that could be tossed off as an unfortunate statistical anomaly or error is unlikely to end a career.<p>In such a world, &quot;optimal play&quot; would be to intentionally or unintentionally P-hack, or just slightly embellish results such that the work is interesting to cite, but not interesting enough to replicate.  People who do this will eventually move up ahead of everyone else, ultimately favoring incremental but bogus resuls.')
