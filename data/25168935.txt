I am doing this now using Linux&#x2F;sway and Linux&#x2F;i3. The i3 (X11 based) I use for work and the sway (where some video conf apps are still not supported) is for playtime. One has a rick+morty theme the other a sober business one.<p>But for when I still had family and kids this set-up would be not strict enough. Now with WFO everyone is a &quot;freelancer&quot; and work time bleeds into private time. Here is the only thing that worked for me.<p>1) hardware separation: My private laptop is upstairs, no access to my work world. My work laptop is chained to my work desk.<p>2) my work desk is in my office<p>3) my office is downstairs<p>it has taken me some decades to refine that because initially I was sitting in the living room coding while also attending to my toddler kids. later I started hiding away in the &quot;study&quot; which was in the same flat but another room and I was still reachable to whenever my partner felt like popping in with a questions such as &quot;what do you want for dinner dear?&quot; or &quot;do you think my black shoes go with my grey shirt&quot;, etc. After moving I hid away downstairs. In the past years I made sure there is 100% hardware compartmentalization in all my gear, and ideally that also includes modifications to location.<p>Finally I have managed to train my surrounding so that they no longer ask why I didn&#x27;t bring a phone. To which I usually respond, so that I can be here in the moment. I don&#x27;t judge others for doing it but when I sit down for a cup of coffee with anyone or am in a meeting, I would never disrespect them by browsing on my phone while pretending to listen to them.<p>Even more extreme my partner has stopped sending me updates on messenger because they know I prefer talking about what happened in person, and I do not want to dilute the moment. I&#x27;ve gone from burnt out, unfocused and distracted to in-the-moment, hyperfocused and it had a huge effect on how people treat me and how I remember things (most importantly I am able to form long term memories which multi-tasking has killed).')
