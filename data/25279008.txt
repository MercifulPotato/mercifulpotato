Usually, if a disadvantage is discussed in relation to a &quot;minority&quot;, it generally has less to do with the real world diaspora they belong to and more the fact that they are in the minority.<p>For instance, the fact that &quot;minorities&quot; are more susceptible to COVID in the first place (in the US, at least) isn&#x27;t because of racial makeup or ancestral heritage, but rather because marginalized people in the US are more likely to be in &quot;front line&quot; jobs that come in contact with large groups of people (service workers, hospital janitorial staff, food workers, the like) and much less likely to be in a position to remove themselves or work from home.')
