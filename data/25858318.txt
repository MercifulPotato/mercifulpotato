I personally experienced how easy is to make a typo on a website and how hard is to spot it afterward. So a logical solution for me was to find a tool that can help to catch errors on a website, but I was not able to find a good tool to do the job.\nSo I&#x27;ve built SiteInspector so that developers or regular website owners can keep their website errors-free with a modern and convenient website scanner app.\nSiteInspector app can be hosted on Heroku or in Docker and launched in less than 5 minutes with a single command.\nThe app was written in Ruby&#x2F;Rails and uses Vue.js on the front-end, also it support arm64 architecture.\nYou can check a read-only demo UI using this URL: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.getsiteinspector.com&#x2F;reports" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.getsiteinspector.com&#x2F;reports</a>\nI&#x27;ll be very happy to answer any questions you may have and get your feedback.')
