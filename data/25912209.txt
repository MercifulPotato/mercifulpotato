I suspect Dominion does not want to take it that far because any good lawyer can make a case for whatever they want given what discovery they get.<p>Discovery is a two-way street, and if “any good lawyer can make a case for whatever they want” with it, that gives Rudy as much motive to avoid discovery as Dominion.<p>In reality, facts matter, and even the best lawyer needs something to make a case out of (and even an unimpressive lawyer can make a case out of a smoking gun).')
