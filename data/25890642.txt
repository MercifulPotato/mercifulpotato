It really depends on the context as much as the PM. In an agency environment, I love PMs. Lots of the things they do on the developers behalf just aren&#x27;t in my job description. If I had to do them, I&#x27;d get half as much code written.<p>I think PMs also get a bad wrap, because they are essentially the interface between a developer and the client. When the client is bad the PM can help shield the team from much of it, but ultimately the developers are going to feel the worst of a client through the PM no matter what.')
