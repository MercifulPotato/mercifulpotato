Coronavirus<p>The hype<p>I have a Chinese girlfriend, and when the coronavirus was breaking out in China, she was freaking out, buying masks and so forth.  She was really hyping it as a big deal!<p>Needless to say, it&#x27;s been a big deal.<p>2. Election fraud<p>The hype<p>Before the election, the President was massively hyping mail-in ballot fraud.<p>It didn&#x27;t happen<p>For those living in the world at large there really was none (dozens of lawsuits were thrown out, the attorney general said there was no evidence.)<p>But for me it lived up to the hype<p>But for those living in the President&#x27;s filter bubble (like me), this election definitely lived up to the hype, and keeps living up to the hype. Those of us in the filter bubble wrongly think we&#x27;re seeing a massive conspiracy to hide a total of literally hundreds of thousands of fraud ballots across many states in a coordinated collusion. So for me personally (even though I am wrong and living in a filter bubble of proven lies) the voter fraud definitely lived up to the hype!<p>(I am a conspiracy theorist and everything I believe on this subject had been disproven.)<p>It is definitely living up to the hype though!')
