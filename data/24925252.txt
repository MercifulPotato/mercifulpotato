My mind is often too noisy to filter out the signal, let alone put into a structure suitable for tractability. I happened upon George Polya&#x27;s &quot;How to Solve It&quot; book several years ago, which contains a very wholesome (and very useful) strategy for tackling problems. It&#x27;s ostensibly about math problems, but you can apply it to anything.<p>Here are a few portions of his method that I always come back to:<p>---<p><i>Understanding the problem:</i><p><i>- What is the unknown?</i><p><i>- Draw a figure. Introduce suitable notation.</i><p><i>- Separate the various parts. Can you write them down?</i><p><i>Devising a plan:</i><p><i>- Have you seen it before? Do you know a related problem?</i><p>---<p>You can see the whole method at this link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;document&#x2F;68994766&#x2F;original&#x2F;75c4919037&#x2F;1593695954?v=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgv2-1-f.scribdassets.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;document&#x2F;68994766&#x2F;ori...</a><p>I use this approach in conjunction with an A4 piece of paper, or a note program capable of &quot;outlining&quot; functionality (expandable nodes). The latter works great for containing and structuring lots of information, and you can selectively show and hide different parts depending on what you&#x27;re focusing on. Again, helping with filtering out the &quot;noise&quot; factor.<p>Another good approach is falling back to a plain-text editor such as Notepad.exe when you want to write anything down. I got that tip from the Pragmatic Programmer book. You can easily extend this to Markdown if needed.')
