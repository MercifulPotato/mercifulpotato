We&#x27;re super excited to open up Raycast to everyone and share it with the HN community today.<p>We built Raycast because we&#x27;re fed up with chasing around browser tabs and tools to get work done. The simplest things take way too many clicks. Not to mention the time spent in front of loading indicators on websites. With Raycast, you can control your tools with a few keystrokes. The command line inspired interface unifies tools as commands to cut through the noise.<p>We launched a first version of the app a few months ago [1]. Since then we revamped the entire user interface, added new extensions and made it possible to extend the functionality with scripts. Here are a few examples what you can do:<p>- Launch apps or search files on your Mac\n- Create, search and close issues in Asana, GitHub, Jira or Linear\n- Check upcoming meetings\n- Join conference calls with a single keypress\n- Approve, merge and close GitHub pull requests\n- Convert units, check dates and solve equations with a powerful calculator\n- Much more and if that isn&#x27;t enough, you can extend Raycast with scripts<p>The app is built natively for macOS (100% Swift) to be simple, lightweight and efficient. No login is required to get started. We hope you join the Raycast community and we&#x27;d love to get your feedback.<p>Also, I&#x27;m super happy to answer questions!<p>â€”<p>As a little gift, we added a Hacker News command to Raycast to quickly check the latest tech news. You know, when you have some minutes while waiting for the compilation of your app to complete.<p>[1] Previous launch: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22466994" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22466994</a>')
