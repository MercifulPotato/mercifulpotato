I&#x27;m on an officially unsupported Lenovo Ryzen laptop. I&#x27;ve just hot-plugged and unplugged an external display, a gigabit network interface, a mouse. Everything is smooth. Applications run. I can move them to the external display. When I pull the HDMI out, they move back to the laptop display and resize accordingly. I plugged in the USB gigabit interface, my network switched to the wire. I unplugged it, and my youtube video went on playing without a glitch. I turned on my BT headphones, and the video played through them without stopping.<p>Seriously, I don&#x27;t get it. What doesn&#x27;t work for you that would work better on Windows? I have absolutely no experience of windows (the last version I used somewhat regularly was 98SE).')
