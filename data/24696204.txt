Making a nano machine like a B cell, possibly by re-engineering a B cell with genetic therapy. It is a challenge in the realm of synthetic biology.<p>2. Making a smart detector for viruses, something that is done already in the innate immune system, but obviously it should be better and be equipped with a &quot;stop&quot; system.<p>3. Producing an antigen&#x2F;antibody.<p>A difficulty is that not all humans react in the same manner to antibodies. This is why designing vaccines is so hard. You should look at MHC I and II complexes. There are hundreds or more MHC subtypes and each subtype roughly means  a different antigen. There are prediction servers that help to design antigens [0].<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbs.dtu.dk&#x2F;services&#x2F;NetMHCpan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbs.dtu.dk&#x2F;services&#x2F;NetMHCpan&#x2F;</a>')
