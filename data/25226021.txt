Based on experience, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s arguing about preferences while demanding that code be coupled because &quot;that&#x27;s how we do things here&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s certainly not been my experience (and I get the exact opposite impression from people involved in the formal readability process).<p>&gt; Academia is actually based on research and correctness to a much higher degree.<p>This depends, greatly, on what part of academia you&#x27;re in. In many ways, Google is much better about correctness than much of academia (reproducibility, for example, is often near trivial at Google but uncommon in most non-theoretical areas of academia).<p>&gt; The lack of focus on correctness in code worked on at Google is, honestly, appaling<p>There are tradeoffs here. On the one hand, you have tens of thousands of engineers, you&#x27;re not going to be able to enforce perfection by every single one with the tools available today with a reasonable cost. On the one hand, I see evidence that Google is willing to invest huge amounts into improving software correctness at the lowest levels (like proposing and upstreaming changes to languages to improve correctness-by-default).')
