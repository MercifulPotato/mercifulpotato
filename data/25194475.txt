A couple years back I had a similar issue where I couldn&#x27;t get my WiFi card to work because I&#x27;d have to recompile the kernel while including nonfree libraries... which is pretty hard to do if you know nothing about Guix!<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll try it again in a while.  Not sure if it&#x27;s available for raspberry pi, but it would be great to try it there and eventually switch to it on my laptop (once JJ change WiFi card!)')
