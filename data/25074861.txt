We don&#x27;t want to even try to charge for things that customers don&#x27;t feel they&#x27;re getting good value from.<p>There&#x27;s obviously heterogeneity, though, and we&#x27;ll be as reasonable as possible. If this would be really disruptive for your business, or if you need more time to plan a migration (if you don&#x27;t think Billing makes sense for you), or something like that, I&#x27;d be happy to connect you with the team -- we could extend your current pricing through the end of 2021.')
