India was in this new one until last year when they got cold feet about reducing tariffs on milk and meat products.<p>The main points are standardising goods classifications, paperwork, and procedures at point of import. This simplifies things a lot for exporters. There is some loosening of restrictions on services exports (I guess things like insurance, finance, business services, software) also.<p>For the United States, it continues a slow marginalisation in world trade. Unless the US harmonises its rules with everyone else, it&#x27;ll be too much bother to try to export there.<p>Uniting against China... Here&#x27;s an accurate if unsparing description of the US: &quot;a crisis-wracked, oil-rich, nuclear-armed country in which an aging would-be dictator for life tries to stave off replacement by his popular successor amid large protests, while heavily armed groups roam the ethnically divided interior&quot;.<p>China looks like a model of stability and calm by comparison.<p>Edit: I forgot to attribute the quote: Kenyan comedian Gathara.')
