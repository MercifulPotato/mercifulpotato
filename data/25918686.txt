Such issues could be potentially alleviated by replicating microstructures of natural materials or applying different architectures, where printed layers are arranged into unique and unconventional patterns.<p>&gt; The addition of steel fibers leads to noticeable improvement on both compressive and flexural strengths of samples in any pattern compared with their counterparts without fibers. Besides, the inclusion of steel fibers into unconventional layups (cross-ply, quasi-isotropic, and helicoidal patterns) leads to the alleviation of directional dependence of mechanical properties, which is a limitation of the unidirectional samples with fibers.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rmit.edu.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;all-news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;lobster-concrete" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rmit.edu.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;all-news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;jan&#x2F;lobster-concr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.liebertpub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1089&#x2F;3dp.2020.0172" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.liebertpub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1089&#x2F;3dp.2020.0172</a>')
