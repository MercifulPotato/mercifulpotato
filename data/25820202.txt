But, I agree if a language has all the features you need, and  is mainstream, you are well off using that than jumping in for another language for the heck of it and reinventing wheel is not helping anybody.<p>I am repeating myself, but different people might have different working style. And have different communities have different taste and ways of doing stuff.<p>Language is not the only barrier in communication. It is just one parameter. I honestly think, different languages allows different ways of doing things (not better), with different tradeoffs. My preference to some language is not just about language I know, but also with respect to what I want to do. And how I want to do solve the problem at hand.<p>Even if a language, supports all possible styles of programming, will that result in a coherent language? Then, might the language be language not get very big that different people working in different styles resulting either in monstrosity of code base or fragmentation in language community. Else, the language itself might not represent the problems succinctly as the user wants. Features are not the only issue here.<p>If the language is just needles and redundant, there is not going to be difference in its absence. Yet, I have seen people who have very strong opinions on how to organize code, OOP or not OOP, and of course tabs vs spaces. The fragmentation is inevitable and going to exist as long as strong opinions exist.')
