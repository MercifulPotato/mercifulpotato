Item(by='red_admiral', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603978211, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928833, text='Damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t in that case.<p>A lot of the 1st generation open source CoCs were not hypotheticals, but &quot;here&#x27;s things we wish Richard Stallman would stop doing&quot;. As head of GNU&#x2F;FSF, he had tremendous influence in shaping the culture of open source, and one result of that was that it ended up a lot more male-dominated than other areas of &quot;tech&quot;: one figure I&#x27;ve seen was around 2% women in prestigious open-source projects vs. around 20% in programming as a whole.<p>Open source CoCs started as far as I can tell as a combination of a reaction to specific incidents and to address the general problem that women were [choosing to stay out of the community](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rachelbythebay.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;moat&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rachelbythebay.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;09&#x2F;moat&#x2F;</a>). That link talks about CoCs specifically, but note that her argument is not &quot;and therefore they should be shamed in public&quot; but &quot;and therefore I&#x27;m staying out&quot;. Hence, 2% vs. 20%.<p>So yes, CoCs can have downsides - what happened to Jeremy here could well be one of those - but the pre-CoC open source scene had a culture that ended up with 2% women compared to 20% in programming&#x2F;tech in general. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the right solution to simply roll back the change so we&#x27;re not disadvantaging people like Jeremy any more, and return to disadvantaging people like Alice and Sarah and Rachel and Yasmin.')
