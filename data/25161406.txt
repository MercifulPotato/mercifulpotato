I think that it is absolutely <i>vital</i> for culture to be <i>modeled</i> from the top.<p>Also, owners and corporate stakeholders are often so married to their work, that they have a difficult time understanding folks that aren&#x27;t (like most of their employees). That means you can hear things like &quot;I sleep in my office every weeknight, so I expect you to, as well.&quot;<p>Part of modeling culture is to understand others, and that&#x27;s where most people fall down.<p>But I also think that cynical employees often grow into cynical, toxic managers, and that&#x27;s where a lot of damage is done.<p>For myself, I have followed a path of personal growth, for my entire adult life, and I brought that with me to work. It helps me to feel decent about myself, my peers, and the world, in general (and I can still be a cynic, but one with a significant vein of love and tolerance).')
