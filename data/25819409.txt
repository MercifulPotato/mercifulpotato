If you want to pick up seafood which is not heavily contaminated by heavy metals, various regional spills, factory drains, near deltas of biggest rivers in Asia&#x2F;Africa etc. you will find out you just play russian roulette with your food. Mercury poisoning with ie tuna can be achieved relatively quickly depending on the brand. Pregnant women should probably avoid things like salmon &amp; tuna completely, the benefits are far outweighted by the crap. Farmed sea fish are properly bad food.<p>Freshwater fish can be better but they are almost 100% farmed, and good luck trusting some farmer with what he feeds them, since infections in overpopulated ponds are very frequent. Fish meat reflects what its being fed, so crappy food makes previously healthy fish into more bacon one.<p>Also meat is not an uniform substance, cheap beef is most probably less healthy than lean bio free range turkey. Also depends on the cuts, pork has very lean and very fatty tissues in the same animal. And so on.<p>I&#x27;d say for the food the quantity, timing, being active every day for longer stretch, calm peaceful life and obviously not much poisons&#x2F;addictions makes up more than rest. We have centenarians in the west too. At least that&#x27;s the best effort, if one has crappy genes with high probability of cancer or heart attack before 50, there are sadly some limits these days. But one can and should still maximize their own potential.')
