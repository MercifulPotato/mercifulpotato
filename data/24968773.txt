How is Git supposed to be decentralized when you push and pull from one place? Would you just set up multiple “origins” with each one pointing to a head maintainer’s computer (and named appropriately)? Because that sounds like a massive pain compared to a centralized system like GitHub.<p>Of course, there is the benefit of a VCS built on the idea of decentralization: not having to be online to make commits (<i>cough</i> SVN <i>cough</i>). But, in theory, could a centralized system work in “offline mode” like Git?')
