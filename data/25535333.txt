I still have the release day controllers and the only thing that has happened is that the sticker have become white. Not a scratch otherwise and I am one of those that take the PlayStation out to friends to game pretty often. Out of these friends I have only seen one controller damaged, by a kid who destroyed an analog stick.<p>Of course I can&#x27;t prove it but I bet that close to all damaged PS4 controllers are &quot;it just broke! I totally never threw it or hit it against the wall in a fury because I died....&quot; damage.')
