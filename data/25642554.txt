A current is applied and a metal oxidizes. It’s pretty well known that as a metal oxidizes, it’s resistive properties will change.<p>As most people know batteries have a limited number of cycles. Every reaction cycle adds some entropy&#x2F;side reactions, and eventually it will become irreversible. Magnetic storage reorients a crystal or metal, which is more repeatable than a chemical reaction. Our neurons have similar systems to “clean” themselves so they can reset.<p>I imagine finding a viable memresistor is more about its ability to cycle.')
