Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610208581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25698260, text='&gt; IMO when you decide to start disconnecting parts of your country because they are inconvenient, you&#x27;re one step from disconnecting the disagreeable, undesirable, or just different. The disconnected form their own beliefs and eventually take actions that are destructive to the whole because they haven&#x27;t been connected to the whole.<p>I had to read this twice to realize that you were disagreeing with me, because of how well what you said maps to the ongoing forced segregation of the political parties onto separate social media sites.<p>Where I would disagree with you with respect to the Post Office is the assumption that not having universal direct home delivery is actually disconnecting people. Even historically, having mail delivered to your nearest town rather than directly to your house adds a few days of latency to a form of communication that already has about a week of latency in it. You&#x27;re still participating in the same network, with the same people. You receive the same information.<p>Which is the thing that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> happen if we purposely segregate people with differing political views from communicating with one another.')
