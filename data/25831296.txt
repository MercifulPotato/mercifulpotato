The whole reason for the public TV and radio to exist is to create independent media, especially also independent from the state. So while the government is involved as far as it guarantees the system, it has no further control about it. So the government can&#x27;t threaten to cut funds, just because they don&#x27;t like critical reporting. And guess what, the right wing extremists are constantly asking for the end of that system.')
