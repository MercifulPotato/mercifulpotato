It&#x27;s a great idea, and I bet police officers would love this as well.<p>&gt; <i>“Policing has always been about keeping down marginalized people, from its origins, and that has included Black folks and other folks not considered ‘white’ and poor people,” Bliss said. “You cant have racial justice without economic justice.”</i><p>This is an extremely reductive and strange quote to me.
