Item(by='logifail', descendants=None, kids=[25224047], score=None, time=1606421704, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25222686, text='&gt; exciting<p>(Full disclosure: two working parents, three young kids, not a lot of spare time and even less spare money...)<p>We own two (ICE) cars, a seven-seater that&#x27;s diesel-powered and a four-seater that&#x27;s petrol.   Neither of them are even remotely &quot;exciting&quot; (both have the smallest, most economical engines that the manufacturer offers for that model).    We would not be looking for &quot;exciting&quot; in a replacement for either of them, either.<p>What I <i>am</i> looking for is a like-for-like replacement that isn&#x27;t hugely more expensive.<p>With electric, I&#x27;m struggling.<p>We [very briefly] sat in the battery version of the four-seater in the showroom when we bought the petrol, it cost more than twice as much, range was dire, and the sales guy pointed out that it wouldn&#x27;t hold its purchase value as battery technology is changing so rapidly.   So that was that :(<p>I would love to switch to electric, but right now we don&#x27;t have the spare cash to throw around.<p>&quot;Exciting&quot; might be great for persuading petrolheads and&#x2F;or the wealthy and&#x2F;or the virtue-signallers to switch, but for everyone else, what can pure-electric offer?')
