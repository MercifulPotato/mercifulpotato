Linux has a wide range of apps.    BSD is reserved for very specific use cases.   If I want to run Unix on a very weird hardware maybe NetBSD.   If I really care about everyday useable secure hardware then OpenBSD.  I might explore FreeBSD for networking if I&#x27;m really convinced that network is the bottleneck and I&#x27;m hitting scaling issues granted I almost feel it&#x27;s cheaper to just throw money at the problem and get more Linux boxes.')
