There is no evidence of anything even close to that happening in this or any recent elections.<p>&gt;For me I fully support having many polling places that are easy to get to for many people in multiple locations and that on election day we should make it as easy as possible for people to vote; however I also think there should be tighter integrity checks on who is voting and on the counting of votes itself.<p>The first half of that goes against the policies of the Republican part and Democrats aren&#x27;t going to disagree with the second half.')
