Anyways, if given the choice, I think I&#x27;d prefer GAFAM for the lower burnout risk alone. Comp is definitely more than enough, and likely higher than what you&#x27;d get in finance. I&#x27;m getting offtopic but if I start a company and it fails and I have a burnout then I feel like I&#x27;ve done a meaningful journey. If on the other hand I join a company where tons of people burn out then I burn out... that&#x27;s just stupidity :).')
