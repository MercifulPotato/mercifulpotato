If we&#x27;re talking about an election in Venezuela, the courts would also laugh accusations of election rigging out of the room.<p>To be clear, I fully side with the U.S. courts here. What I&#x27;m saying though is governments and officials lie, you can&#x27;t always just trust the official story.<p>If parler were used for inciting civil disorder in Venezuela over the election result and the government comes to AWS and says shut them down, what do they do?<p>Now suddenly they&#x27;re the arbitrators of what is true in the world.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get too hypothetical here, because I think this time it was pretty black and white.')
