Compare with modern sequential languages which have near-perfect denotational semantics: anything which compiles means something.<p>If you want practical guidance, my best is to avoid all of the concurrency constructs that are taught in schools. Use log-structured single-writer multiple reader, wait-free, processes and shared memory.')
