That has been the case for almost two years I think. It used to be Red Hat guys doing it, but it&#x27;s not their priority anymore.<p>There is a pile of new features that only exist in master with no clear path to users&#x27; computers. Notably some big VR enablement thingies commissioned by Valve and written by former X lead Keith Packard. I think freesync too.<p>I rely on Synergy&#x2F;Barrier to use my mouse&#x2F;keyboard between computers. They only support X and I am not aware of any Wayland alternatives.<p>As a desktop user I am currently stuck in a bad place because Wayland is not ready but the powers that be have moved on from X and don&#x27;t care anymore.<p>Maybe Valve could pick up X release duty for a while? That&#x27;d be quite more good karma on their part, additionally to all what they&#x27;ve already done.')
