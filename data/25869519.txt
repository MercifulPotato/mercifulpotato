I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of hours reading it and losing myself in intellectual rabbit holes, I&#x27;ve been introduced to many interesting topics, books and authors (such as Scott Alexander, G.K Chesterton and GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach (which I have on my nightstand)), and I&#x27;ve come to truly believe in God.<p>The comments section is usually very interesting as well.')
