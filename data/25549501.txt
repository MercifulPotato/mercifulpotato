That&#x27;s quite a stretch! You&#x27;re attributing direct and explicit actions taken by a specific subset of site operators as caused by the device manufacturer, which it is clearly not!<p>The sites disabled those methods because they were no longer secure.<p>We <i>know</i> that TLS implementations lose security over time.<p>Anyone locking in a specific implementation and specific certs <i>knows</i> it will stop being fully secure after a while, even in a world where sites try their absolute hardest to be compatible.<p>So yes, I mostly blame the manufacturer.  Sites could allow older ciphers, but to have non-broken HTTP <i>Secure</i> requires the manufacturer to update things.<p>&gt; if you&#x27;re running the latest User-Agent software in December 2020, access to pre-TLSv1.2 sites is likely already disabled<p>It&#x27;s not the worst plan in the world to wait for clients to forcibly disable old ciphers, but it means that even if all your site&#x27;s visitors support a new version, they won&#x27;t all be reliably using it.<p>Maybe now that browsers can enforce things better, and downgrade attack detection is better, it&#x27;s safe enough to reenable older ciphers on some servers.  But there <i>were</i> good reasons to disable them.<p>&gt; actual need<p>All sites should have crypto.  No sites &quot;actually need&quot; it if you&#x27;re willing to work around it hard enough, but all sites should have it.<p>&gt; The evidence appears to show otherwise. Capitalism -- Google, Bing, Amazon -- doesn&#x27;t care if anyone still uses TLSv1.0; they&#x27;ll still serve everyone to make a sale. Ironically, it&#x27;s the non-profits &quot;socialists&quot; -- Wikipedia, Mozilla, EFF -- who (inadvertently?) promote planned device obsolescence by intentionally deprecating all backwards compatibility on the internet.<p>Oh, I thought you were saying capitalism causes obsolescence.  But now I&#x27;m confused.  When you said &quot;this also proves the point about capitalism&quot;, what was &quot;the point&quot; being proven?')
