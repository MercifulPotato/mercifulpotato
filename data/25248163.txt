They are fun to think about. I wanted to dive into the first application you mentioned. As mentioned in my post, even the most basic manipulation tasks on human-centric objects and spaces are actually full of little details.<p>I hope people think more on that low-level dextrous manipulation when designing robot hardware rather than the fairly high level &quot;open door, pull package inside, close the door&quot;, which might make robotics people receptive to the idea that a humanoid is truly the only viable solution.<p>What if your door has a step down to the porch where the package is delivered? The robot can&#x27;t &quot;just&quot; pull a large box inside, it would get stuck. You&#x27;d need to lift it up, and at this point you&#x27;d require two arms or a gantry that can extend outside of the home above the porch. Obviously the home can be re-designed around this, but my point is that there are really two kinds of robotics - ones that try to solve a human problem, and ones that try to do everything a human can.')
