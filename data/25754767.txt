The caterwauling from our airlines was just ridiculous.<p>The negative test requirement is <i>only</i> for air travel, and in spite of your assertion, there is (limited) non-trade travel allowed across the border. I&#x27;m driving across the border in a few weeks, and for some reason don&#x27;t need a test that I&#x27;d need if I flew.')
