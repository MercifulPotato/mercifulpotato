But perhaps a fun thought experiment.<p>If you had access to a small satellite, what would you do with it?<p>We&#x27;ve managed to drop the price-point and expertise overhead required for having&#x2F;operating a 5kg-class satellite to a point where a &quot;somewhat wealthy software engineer with a laptop&quot; could have one (i.e. $250k all in, including launch).<p>This is not the market we&#x27;re targeting by any means, but I&#x27;ve just realised the Venn diagram has crept in that direction. And I thought it might be worth thinking about â€¦ if just for fun.<p>Anything beyond hobbyist astronomy&#x2F;photography, kudos, etc?<p>Example satellite: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orbastro.com&#x2F;satellites&#x2F;orb-3&#x2F;')
