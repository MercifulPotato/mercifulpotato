Were the people killed by those emissions not worthy for some reason?<p>Why were the new emissions targets the &quot;right&quot; ones? Why not make them half again and save even more lives? The answer is that they are numbers pulled out of the ass of some CARB or EPA bureaucrat.<p>In reality it&#x27;s impossible to say that &quot;1200 early deaths&quot; were caused by VW emissions. It&#x27;s statistical smoke and mirrors and doesn&#x27;t even show up as a blip in the normal variation of total mortality of any given year.<p>How many early deaths were caused by California&#x27;s refusal to allow or perform proper forest manangement, resulting in this year&#x27;s devastating wildfires and the pollution they caused? Sorry for the whataboutism. Deaths are deaths.')
