I believe we&#x27;ve already reached the point of no return and the greenhouse effect is out of control (north pole ice not recovering, permafrost melting, etc).<p>We&#x27;ll see drastic climate change happening everywhere. It&#x27;ll probably have little effect on &quot;us&quot; in the west; probably limited to local tragedies because of extreme weather and a price increase in food.
