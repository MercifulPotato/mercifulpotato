No?<p>At work I&#x27;m learning to trust more and be kinder. I actually have colleagues today that are smart and seem to be kind too. Not always the case though before. Most people have been rather dumb so far. And I&#x27;m not particularly bright if you ask me.<p>Road: I&#x27;ll let the guy in. I know how to do zipper style traffic. If the next guy tries to take advantage I&#x27;ll be sure to try as hard as I can not to let him in. Eff him! The guys that get real close on the highway even though I&#x27;m already going 10% over the speed limit? I&#x27;ll make sure to drop to exactly the speed limit or on the highway Match the speed of the truck right next to me. Back the eff off dude! If he does I&#x27;ll accelerate and get out of the way. Most don&#x27;t get it even with gestures. The guy coming on with 30% over the speed limit from behind but I see them or they slow down and stay 3 car lengths behind? I&#x27;ll make room as soon as I pass the other traffic and might even go 15% over the limit. I&#x27;m not unreasonable.<p>Companies? I&#x27;ll expect you to be unreasonable. You have to prove to me that you&#x27;re worth it. Sorry but too many bad apples. You don&#x27;t deliver in the time you said you would and then you don&#x27;t answer the phone or call me back? Sorry but I will not assume that you are just having a family situation and it&#x27;s taking you a while due to that. I will assume that you&#x27;re out to gouge your customers and try to use the get out of jail free card all the time. If you don&#x27;t call me back the day you said you would I&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;re a scumbag trying to cheat me out of my money or you don&#x27;t want my business.')
