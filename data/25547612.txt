If one of them is gasoline, then you&#x27;re replacing half of their gasoline consumption instead of all of it.<p>What those people will not do is buy two electric cars plus a gasoline car for their 1% needs. Many people also would rather not hassle with rentals on a regular basis.<p>But in fairness, it&#x27;d be great progress just to get to the point where most two-car families choose electric for one of them, and by the time that happens, batteries will probably be a lot better anyway.')
