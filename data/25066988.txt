Online dating is perfect for finding guys like that.<p>The biggest problem with OLD is that nearly everyone actively using it has problems. Problems that need to be addressed with time, effort, therapy, psychiatric counseling, and&#x2F;or medication. Also potentially surgery, if a pitbull mauled your face as a child or something.<p>Don&#x27;t feel bad if you aren&#x27;t finding what you want on OLD, because you don&#x27;t actually want to date the people who don&#x27;t want to date you. And they&#x27;re completely justified in not wanting to date you. You shouldn&#x27;t want to date yourself either. You&#x27;re both using dating apps, after all. That means there&#x27;s lots of room for self-improvement, for everyone involved. Just being on the app is a red flag.<p>If I had to succinctly describe the vast majority of people who aren&#x27;t using OLD for hookups (without digging into underlying causes), who spend extended periods of time unhappily single, searching in vain for a partner on dating apps:<p>men: too shy<p>women: too picky')
