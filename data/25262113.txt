I think your -test and -dev are this, but it’s not clear how you are maintaining all of these, and building for prod.<p>This is the main complaint, most modern languages have a standard set of tools and flows for achieving this. Python doesn’t, and everyone does it a bit differently, and when starting a new project, you have to hand roll your own flow.<p>Or, use something like poetry but the python community as a whole doesn’t have a commonly used solution.')
