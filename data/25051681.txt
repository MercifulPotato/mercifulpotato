Everyone just agrees that it does, and once that has been true for a while you can trust that it will continue to be true tomorrow and beyond.<p>Bitcoin seems to be entering that domain, at least in my opinion. Like gold it can&#x27;t be inflated on a whim, and it&#x27;s a good reserve store of value that can be stored and sent anywhere in the world much more easily than gold.<p>There&#x27;s definitely a vocal subsection of the crypto community that wants to spend BTC or some other cryptocurrency for everything they buy down to a cup of coffee, and FWIW I agree with what you&#x27;re saying and I also don&#x27;t understand that line of thinking. It solves no problem for me, buying a cup of coffee in a developed country. But like gold, BTC doesn&#x27;t need to be used for that purpose to be useful.<p>And then of course, it&#x27;s also an alternative store of value for people in other places who can&#x27;t trust their own government&#x27;s currency. But I think even this (very real, very useful) use case is dwarfed by its use as a store of value in rich countries which is the largest factor in driving its valuation, since the majority of the world&#x27;s wealth is held in rich countries.')
