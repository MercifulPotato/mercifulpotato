Tracking people&#x27;s location <i>in aggregate</i> to make decisions about which roads are usable at which speeds is okay, but as soon as you get to the levels of &quot;only one guy went along this road in 2020, should we mark it as private&quot;, it becomes a privacy issue.<p>It&#x27;s a privacy issue to use that kind of data, because the employees who build the map shouldn&#x27;t be looking at one guys GPS traces.   So instead the traces are cut into tiny chunks and aggregated and only shown where there are more than 50 people at the same spot.   That effectively means there is no data available to make decisions on the most rarely used roads.')
