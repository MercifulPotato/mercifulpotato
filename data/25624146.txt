But I’ve recently discovered that 99.9% of the website visitors to my new startup’s website are just random @gmail addresses from India and China - most of which are coming from Google ads. We don’t spend much, about $100&#x2F;m mostly to keep our #1 ranking in Google (which I think helps), but it does seem fraudulent. If I turn the ads off, the traffic from those IPs drops off a cliff.')
