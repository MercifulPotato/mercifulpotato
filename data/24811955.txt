The outcome was that the government can’t punish a small non-profit from making a movie critical of a candidate within 90 days of an election.<p>You can read whatever you want into the implications of the rule articulated in the case. Folks on the other side can say that, if the decision had gone the other way, nothing would stop the government from regulating how the New York Times uses its corporate funds.<p>But it’s important to look at the actual case, legally because it is really the only thing that’s decided, but practically because it is <i>an actual conduct the government decided to prosecute.</i> The government didn’t think the law just covers billion dollar advocacy campaigns. It prosecuted a small non-profit entity for publishing a movie. It’s not a “parade of horribles” hypothetical consequence, it <i>actually happened.</i> The “alternative” would be allowing the government to prosecute this non-profit for publishing a political movie.')
