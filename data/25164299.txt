I have not had any of the typical issues - my machines just work very well.  I&#x27;ve got a system for software development, and another for Audio (yes, Linux is a functional DAW - digital audio workstation), and they are both just pleasant and joyful systems to use.<p>Of course, the fact that I have the chops to fix things is key, because I really, really do (Systems Programmer, 30+ years building OS and system-level things), but for the Ubuntu experience key factors have also been: pick your hardware nicely (e.g. Presonus=great Audio for Linux), use package management, do frequent manual updates, and use containers&#x2F;virtualization for anything where ones hacking around might be dodgy - i.e. keep the <i>work</i> part of workstation in mind with all system updates&#x2F;installations, etc.<p>Decades of Linux desktop usage means, to me, the cliche is over.  Linux is an awesome desktop workstation.  Everything just works, audio, video, graphics .. WINE is perfectly functional .. and there is <i>zero</i> bloatware or concern about walled gardeners.')
