I think this wasn’t a matter of Apple or the employee paying a bribe, but of the employee receiving one in exchange for stealing hardware from Apple.<p>I read the story as:<p>- Head of security team contacts police to get concealed carrying permits for his employees<p>- Police officer says “if Apple gives us 200 iPads, that can be arranged. On top of that, you’ll get $X”.<p>- Head of security team agrees, signs of for the Apple hardware, and receives a bribe.<p>If so, Apple was the only one paying, but the company probably wouldn’t have known about that (possibly, multiple employees would)<p>If this were the police asking for iPads in exchange for permits, I would call it extortion, not bribery.')
