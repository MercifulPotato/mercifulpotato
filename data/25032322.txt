A heavy deadlift is one of the most &quot;focusing&quot; exercises I know. You can&#x27;t lift 500lbs+ barbell without complete, singular focus. That&#x27;s part of the value I derive from this exercise.<p>Also, squats are harder to learn, require good shoulder mobility (which a lot of desk jockeys don&#x27;t have), and, at a minimum, require a squat rack, which you&#x27;re unlikely to have at home. Better yet, I&#x27;d advise to use a power rack, which will catch the barbell if you fuck up your balance and fall forward.<p>TL;DR: while I agree that squat is a better overall exercise, and one that the author of the article should be doing if they don&#x27;t have the time to do anything else, it requires a lot more gear and training than a deadlift. It is, therefore, not very practical to do barbell squats at home. And if the choice is between a deadlift and no lifting at all, it&#x27;s deadlift all the way. It hits the posterior chain and core pretty well, and all you need is a barbell and a set of cheap-ass plates.<p>One way to not overdo it out of the gate is to not use straps on the barbell - you&#x27;ll be limited by grip strength which is pretty slow to build. You also get to build a truly crushing handshake that way, for when we&#x27;re back to handshakes. :-)')
