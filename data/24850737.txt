Armbian already supports at least one such device (ODROID-C2) using the current kernel, so once the device tree configuration is worked out, NAS software support ought to be practically the same as any other linux box.<p>It has at least one advantage over the Raspberry Pi for NAS applications: a real SATA bus. That means no mucking about with USB-to-SATA bridges, many of which do awful things like meddle with SMART reporting or spin down disks when they should not.<p>The barrel connector for power is also an advantage IMHO, since mysterious failures due to voltage sags turn out to be very common with USB-powered single-board computers. (USB power can be done without such problems, but extra care must be taken to avoid the many cables, power supplies, and connectors that are not up to the task.)<p>The S905 system-on-chip might not be capable of maxing out the throughput of an SSD, but for people who want a spinning rust server that&#x27;s light on power consumption, it could be a pretty good fit.<p>Thomas Kaiser, as usual, has some good insights over in the CNX Software comments:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnx-software.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;odroid-hc4-low-cost-dual-nas-comes-with-4gb-ram-supports-2-5-inch-and-3-5-inch-sata-drives&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnx-software.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;odroid-hc4-low-cost-...</a><p>Also worth mentioning: The RockPro64 has a faster CPU, a PCIe slot, a NAS enclosure, and mainline support in Debian unstable (though the Debian installer doesn&#x27;t yet install a boot loader; that must be done manually for now).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.pine64.org&#x2F;ROCKPro64" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.pine64.org&#x2F;ROCKPro64</a>')
