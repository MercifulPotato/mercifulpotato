And yet, something irks me...<p>* An industry that can&#x27;t produce robust software has produced several server operating systems capable of uptimes that far exceed the expected life time of the hardware they run on. [0] Writing this, I checked in on a random server I&#x27;ve got access to. The uptime is 350 days.<p>* I reboot my personal Linux laptop only when I myself want to install the latest kernel update. The current uptime is 46 days and I use that machine for programming, watching movies, surfing and whatever else I feel like doing.<p>* I&#x27;m willing to bet a few bucks that there are more C and assembly language programmers around now than there has been at any previous point in time.<p>* I&#x27;m pretty sure Blow couldn&#x27;t have made his presentation slides, recorded his talk, uploaded it to a web site and then watched it in a web browser using Ken Thompson&#x27;s three week Unix, even if it was running on modern hardware.<p>* It&#x27;s true that the OS in both abstract and concrete ways removes capabilities from the CPU, but it also adds a lot of capabilities such as multitasking.<p>* Pretty much all of the things listed on his &quot;You Can&#x27;t Just...&quot; are perfectly doable in E.G.

I can (and still do) write software in a simple editor without a language server in sight, etc.<p>Meanwhile, my old Amigas - which I love to bits - crash fatally all the time. Just a few weeks ago, one of them pulled a hard drive partition along with the crash and I actually had to reformat it because re-validation failed (luckily I had nothing of importance on it).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;epic-...</a>')
