And how to treat these kinds of platforms with regard to freedom of speech is an ongoing legal discussion â€” far from being over.<p>Let me make it simple for you: Sticking to your (in my opinion very limited) model of looking at the world, how do you make sure Google doesn&#x27;t become a puppet of some government now or in the future? Do you really think the people in that organization are able to handle the amount of power they have over a reasonably long time without getting corrupted? Would it then fall into your narrow definition of freedom of speech?<p>Our current state of law is not equipped to deal with that kind of behemoth and needs to evolve.<p>Btw.: It would help your argument to avoid provocative statements like implying that I might not be grasping a concept. Your text looks like you are trying to defend a political position.')
