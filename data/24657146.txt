Item(by='cassianoleal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601593874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24654442, text='I&#x27;m Brazilian and live in the UK.<p>I constantly hear jokes about football. Having played football and being a person with &quot;two left feet&quot;, I have heard numerous jokes about that, and about how I must not be Brazilian, since I don&#x27;t command the ball like Ronaldinho.<p>I&#x27;m fine with that. It&#x27;s playful. It&#x27;s fun. I make jokes back and everybody is a friend.<p>There&#x27;s also the Samba jokes and stereotypes. They are fun. They are ice breakers and can make an awkward social interaction more fluent.<p>You know what offends me? When people from the USA call their country &quot;America&quot;, like they own the whole continent.<p>Amerigo Vespucci, the man whose name served as the basis for naming the so called &quot;new world&quot;, didn&#x27;t even arrive in the northern part of the continent, much less in what is now the USA.<p>Cripstopher Columbus, who arrived in the continent even before Vespucci, didn&#x27;t arrive there either, but at Guanahani, in the Bahamas.<p>When America was named America, there was no USA.<p>Calling that country America is the equivalent of uniting a few European countries, calling them United States of Europe and then culturally pressuring the rest of the continent (and the world) into calling them Europe, pretending the rest of the continent never had that name.<p>The cultural, military, pollitical and economical power play that the USA have been imposing on the rest of the continent since at least the 1940s is by far worse than any stereotype joke that you might have heard in your workplace.<p>I was born in America. The USA can never take that away from me.<p>Uncivilised is to impose your views upon the rest of the world with zero regard to cultural differences.<p>As my late grandfather would say: &quot;don&#x27;t judge others as though they are yourself.&quot;<p>Edit: Even before I posted, I was aware this was going to be downvoted. That&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s not easy to admit you&#x27;re not as holy as you might think. It&#x27;s far easier to use your own power to crush the &quot;subordinate class&quot; rather than actually acknowledge them. Downvote away. I will still be an American, born in America.')
