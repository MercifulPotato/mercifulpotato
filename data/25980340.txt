Lots of industrial inputs are priced based on value they provide the consumer. That’s not what makes land special, and there are many mechanisms to have non-developers capture the value of land (cf. LVT, inclusionary zoning, impact fees).<p>2. Focus on developers is misplaced. There is no reason developers are structurally incapable of making their profits by building lots of units at low margins instead of a few units at high margins. The fact that 100% subsidized nonprofit developers deliver projects at nearly the same costs as for profit developers suggests that the drivers of costs are not developers themselves.<p>3. San Francisco is majority renter yet makes no local policy changes to alleviate the supply crisis. The incentives at play have a lot less to do with greedy developers than you describe.<p>4. Low interest rates can either manifest as lots of units offered at cost or high multiples on ownership vs rentals. Which one you get is a policy choice. I don’t know what you mean by “artificially low” and how that’s even relevant.')
