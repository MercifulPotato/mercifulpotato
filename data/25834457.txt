Not saying I fully agree with Elastic&#x27;s approach, especially the license uncertainly it creates as noted elsewhere in the thread.  But Amazon seems to have gone beyond &quot;hey, this open source, nothing to stop us offering it&quot; here.  From The CTO&#x27;s suggestion Elastic was a partner, to questionable trademark infringement, to potential copying of closed source code.  If you read the article, it&#x27;s notable that Elasticsearch continue to have working relationships with Azure and Google among others.<p>So there&#x27;s more to this than just &quot;should&#x27;ve used a different license&quot;.')
