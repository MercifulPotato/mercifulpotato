I definitely learnt a lot from your comprehensive replies. Personally, I am just getting started in web development and I have traditionally written everything with the help of frameworks like ReactJS and the like and the abstractions these frameworks provide means I actually don&#x27;t know the nitty gritty of how things work. Cross browser compatibility or efficiency was definitely not something I considered and they are definitely very valid considerations. And HTTP redirects via service workers sounds damn interesting! I will go read up on those now! Thank you for the comment I did learn a lot and will work these suggestions into the code base when I do have the time :&#x27;)')
