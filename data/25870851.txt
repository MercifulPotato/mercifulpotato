My Nextcloud was only for myself and my family, and we only used it for &quot;files on the go&quot;.<p>Calendar&#x2F;contacts is handled by iCloud (Apple household, it&#x27;s a Danish thing...)<p>Notes are handled by whatever each person finds the easiest. My wife defaults to the iOS notes app, i switch between various clear text editors.<p>File synchronization on desktops&#x2F;laptops is handled by Synology Drive, which syncs beautifully whenever the machine is connected to our LAN, either directly or through VPN.<p>The only problem i needed to solve was ad-hoc access to files on mobile devices, preferably without opening ports, and since VPN doesn&#x27;t always work from other private networks (ip scope clash usually), i chose not to use Synology tools for this. Besides, Synology Drive doesn&#x27;t support selective sync, and while documents probably wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, synchronizing gigabytes of books to my phone isn&#x27;t really an option :)<p>Resilio on Linux does have a nasty habit of doing disk IO all the time, a habit that syncthing doesn&#x27;t have. When i look at running processes, Resilio on linux is constantly using 2-5% CPU.')
