In fact, Freud was a &quot;real&quot; doctor who studied neuroscience in medical school and had a career as a doctor working in hospitals. The most interesting thing about psychoanalysis is that it was invented by neurologists like Freud and his mentors Jean-Martin Charcot and Josef Breuer, not by psychologists. The &quot;talking cure&quot; was originally used to cure people who had been hospitalized with various physical symptoms and ailments.<p>The popular myth holds that psychoanalysis is a non-science trying to mimic science, but in reality it is the other direction. It was originally closer to biology and moved away from that.')
