It made a world of difference and cost something like Â£25 for 5 chef&#x27;s knives, scissors and a serrated bread knife.<p>The guys I went to (in south London [1]) do most of their business renting knife sets to restaurants: each chef has two sets of knives; every few weeks they come by to drop of the newly sharpened set and take the other set away to sharpen back at their workshop.<p>Their tip is rather than paying full retail price for quality knives, buy knives through them. They&#x27;ll recommend what&#x27;s best for your needs and budget. You can save even more by buying from their restaurant rental stock, freshly resharpened, for something like 1&#x2F;8th of what you&#x27;d pay new in a store.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.collini.co.uk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.collini.co.uk&#x2F;</a> in Balham (55 Fontenoy Road, SW12 9LX). If you take your knives to them for sharpening, you can watch them do it, on large, 1950s era motorised grindstones. Absolutely fascinating.')
