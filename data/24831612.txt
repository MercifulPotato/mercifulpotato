A few others are not uncommon, but more situational.<p>(I&#x27;m using their Slack codes here, since I&#x27;m not sure I can just embed them directly in an HN comment...)<p>I tend to come across in text as very detail-oriented and precise, so some careful emoji usage helps recover some of the consideration that would normally be carried by tone or body language.')
