If you take Einstein relativity at face value, there&#x27;s no priviledged spatial slicing (contrasting with, say, Lorentz ether theory), and the balloon is not really a thing.<p>The most obvious interpretation of general relativity is in terms of B-theory of time: Spacetime is some &#x27;pre-existing&#x27;, &#x27;eternal&#x27; thing over mich matter is distributed. This also fixes the geometry (things like lengths and angles) via Einstein&#x27;s equations, which more or less state that energy-momentum ‚àù Ricci curvature.<p>In our universe, that distribution comes in layers, ie there&#x27;s a spatial slicing where the matter distribution appears homogeneous. In that sense, there is a priviledged slicing, which has the unfortunate side effect of making people forget the lessons of special relativity.<p>Now, the average density of matter changes from layer to layer, and, if our universe were described by the &#x27;closed&#x27; Friedmann model, so would the (finite!) volume of the slice. That change is not arbitrary: The layers can be labelled by cosmological time, and with its increase, the average proper distance between galaxies increases as well. That&#x27;s called the metric expansion of space, because in our idealized model, the metric (a thing defining distances and angles) within a given slice is just a scaled version of the one in a different slice.')
