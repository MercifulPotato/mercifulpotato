Like producing half a million tons of steel or something. If you extract more value than the market generates then you have to take that value from someone else who made a mistake. Therefore maximum upside by &quot;beating the market&quot; is limited by the amount of mistakes other people are making and that upside is much smaller than you get from simply taking market returns.')
