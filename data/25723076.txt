Item(by='titanomachy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610328944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720228, text='&gt; Direct engineer -&gt; engineer communication between teams is O(N^2) to organize things between N engineers.<p>This isn&#x27;t true in my experience. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like a binary search than a fully-connected network. I talk to my immediate team first. If they can&#x27;t help, I dig through the company-wide documentation and codebase, then message people who have done or considered something similar to what I&#x27;m trying to do; they either give me the information I need, or direct me to someone more likely to have it. Each hop gets me closer to an answer, and I typically end up having to talk to 1-3 engineers rather than the O(500) who work in my organization.<p>Part of the reason this works is because there are a handful of very senior engineers who have a good sense of what&#x27;s going on across a big part of the company. Complex requests often get routed through one of these people, and they always seem to know who to talk to. I guess that&#x27;s a form of hierarchy, but without the &quot;command-and-control&quot; aspect. I see it as an occasional escape hatch rather than a primary means of problem-solving.')
