The author was a young broker, and had a truck driver client. The truck driver was pretty adamant about investing in this factory that kept growing every time their route took them out there. It was a tampon factory, and there was institutional bias about dumping millions into women&#x27;s products. Truck driver ended up retiring early.<p>Another was Pep Boys, the name is stupid, hard to pitch to an institutional investor, but made tons of money when someone got over their embarrassment.<p>Aside from biases, He called out La Quinta, you experience doesn&#x27;t have to be super deep. The guy recognized it was clean, inexpensive, not the Ritz but a solid deal for what you got.<p>The last strategy that I thought was sorta odd (but makes sense) is companies that own big chunks of other companies. Their example was AT&amp;T being cheap, but owning big chunks of cell phone companies. We sorta saw the same thing play out with Yahoo and Ali-baba.<p>Peter Lynch! One up on Wall Street!
