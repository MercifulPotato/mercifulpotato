Item(by='imgabe', descendants=None, kids=[25312391], score=None, time=1607148787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311970, text='&gt; Assume that Congress can edit a database of every citizens&#x27; net worth by legislative fiat. Answer the question about how lessening economic inequality is going to negatively impact the average American.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m diagnosing the problem, and asking what you think would be the negative impact if we simply took away 73% of the wealth each billionaire holds, which you won&#x27;t answer, because you know the answer is &quot;nothing bad&quot;.<p>Ok, in a hypothetical fantasy land where the government has a magic database and they can manually edit anyone&#x27;s net worth at will and it is further specifically stipulated that this causes nothing bad to happen, then yes, I agree nothing bad happens in that scenario.<p>Back in the real world, such a thing doesn&#x27;t exist. So if you want to talk about real things that could actually impact the net worth of billionaires you have to consider what other secondary effects they might have. Here&#x27;s one: stock market crashes. Billionaires lost a lot of wealth in 2008. In your opinion, was this a generally positive event for the rest of the country or not? Bezos&#x27;s net worth could easily drop by 73% on Monday without any government intervention at all, do you think that would help anyone?<p>To the extent that governments do have the ability to manipulate people&#x27;s net worth via printing money, this has a long history of disastrous consequences like the Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe, etc. In your hypothetical world where the value of anything can be changed at a whim by a bureaucrat, how would anyone even conduct any business at all? How am I supposed to sell you a bag of potatoes for $5 if tomorrow the government might decide it&#x27;s &quot;more fair&quot; if my $5 is $0 instead?<p>&gt; Disagree. I&#x27;m proposing a return to a previous status quo that was more broadly equitable.<p>Dude, literally one paragraph ago you&#x27;re talking about a magic database that can edit anyone&#x27;s net worth at will. That is not a status quo that has ever existed anywhere in human history.<p>Are there possible scenarios in which billionaires have less money and everyone else has more money and everyone is happier and healthier and better off? Sure. Is a wealth tax (the closest thing to a policy that you&#x27;ve mentioned) a path to get to any of them? I think probably not. Is a legislative fiat where the government just flat out declares that someone has less money a realistic thing that could happen that wouldn&#x27;t be a tremendous overreach and huge magnet for corruption and abuse? I think definitely not.<p>If you want to theorize about potential policies and what their impacts might be, then cool, I&#x27;d love to brainstorm about what things might happen. If you just want to fantasize about &quot;Like..what if rich people had like...less money...and we had like...more?&quot; I mean, I&#x27;m not sure where to actually go with that.')
