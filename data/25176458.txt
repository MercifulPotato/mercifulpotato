It certainly is possible to get good deliverability, but you gotta play by the rules (which is: all the RFCs). But when you do, there are also a lot of poorly configured email servers out there that don&#x27;t comply to the RFCs at all, so email services need some tolerance to processing email from badly configured sources. It is almost always a compromise.<p>It is easy to get an email server running initially, but hard to get all the auxiliaries (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, MTA-STS, TLSRPT, BIMI, etc) set up correctly. It&#x27;s even harder to debug deliverability issues, since there is 0 feedback on why your email is not being delivered. To a point where it inspired me to build an email hardening monitoring&#x2F;validation service [0].<p>At the risk of being downvoted by people who are frustrated by email deliverability (and it <i>is</i> frustrating, I know): when you have email deliverability issues, it is almost always because you did something wrong on your end.
