You don&#x27;t have the keys to sign such an APK yourself, but you can get tools that will tell you exactly what&#x27;s inside the one you have.<p>I believe the Java source in GitHub is designed to be capable of a reproducible build, where you get the exact same Java binaries out as Signal&#x27;s own builders did and thus you can compare that to confirm the Java code in your APK matches a specific Git checkout.<p>The media files (e.g. images, labels) are just straight binary copies so that&#x27;s easy enough.<p>However there is native code to make stuff like video calls work, and when I last paid attention there was no reproducible build for that component. So you could imagine that somehow the native video call code is actually a secret backdoor or something.')
