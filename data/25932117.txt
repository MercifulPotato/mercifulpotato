I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called &quot;users&quot; (which is accurate) and that there&#x27;s a timestamp field called &quot;signup_time&quot; for when a user signed up.</i><p>I am definitely impressed by the fact that it could get this close without knowledge of the schema, and that you can provide additional context about the schema.  Seems like there is a lot of potential for building a natural language query engine that is hooked up to a database.  I suppose there is always a risk that a user could generate a dangerous query but that could be mitigated.<p>Not related to the article but what exactly is &quot;open&quot; about OpenAI?')
