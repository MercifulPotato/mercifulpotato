I&#x27;m just saying that it&#x27;s absolutely possible to have it done in a respectful manner. No one, ever, under any circumstances, likes or wants to be manipulated, be it overtly or by having their subconscious played with — period. Adding non-configurable extra <i>anything</i> into people&#x27;s newsfeeds, be it recommended posts, ads, or &quot;people you may know&quot; blocks, is a crime against user-frendliness. Those who do want to discover new things, will simply open the &quot;discover&quot;&#x2F;&quot;explore&quot; tab that contains a dedicated recommended content feed on their own. There is no need to nudge anyone to anything.<p>People aren&#x27;t stupid if you don&#x27;t build your UI&#x2F;UX around the assumption that they are. They also like transparent, understandable algorithms. Chronological feed of (only) the people one follows is as transparent as it gets. A chronological feed with some recommendations mixed in is more opaque and confusing. An algorithmic feed is an epitome of opaqueness. Opaqueness naturally drives users away because it doesn&#x27;t exactly instill confidence that their posts will reach their followers.<p>Another example: do you understand what the &quot;see less often&quot; button in Twitter does? No one does. No one likes cryptic algorithmic bullshit forced on them with no way to disable it.<p>Choice is very important.<p>&gt; versus what they actually do.<p>Do manipulations work? Of course they do. Are people happy when they are manipulated? Of course they are not.<p>&gt; Recommendations aren&#x27;t advertisements, sites don&#x27;t make money off them<p>They absolutely do. Recommendations aren&#x27;t there because Twitter wants to be helpful — they&#x27;d be more user-respecting as I said above if that was the case. They&#x27;re there because they drive engagement metrics up, and those in turn translate into someone&#x27;s KPI.')
