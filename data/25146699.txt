Recent years I have stopped writing open source software, like mye command line filewatcher, and taken up song writing. It is a hard challenge to find an audience, atune to their taste, and produce some original songs. While I like to sit by the piano or play the guitar, my main instrument is the iPad. After the kids have gone to sleep, I play garageband with headphones.')
