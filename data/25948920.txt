Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25949276], score=None, time=1611866690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25948017, text='&gt; RobinHood wouldn&#x27;t care or know anyway. Why would they care that a market maker is having a bad day? Why inconvenience their clients while other brokers keep serving theirs? For all they know, the market maker is too far long and would really appreciate offloading some inventory.<p>RobinHood&#x27;s business model appears to be getting kickbacks directly from the market maker (Citadel Securities apparently), so of course they care if the market maker is unhappy because that&#x27;s their own profits they are eating. The fact that the discount broker and the market maker are so buddy buddy is the extremely shady but currently very legal problem.<p>(Supposedly Citadel Securities at this point is the same market maker putting the same pressure on at least TD Ameritrade in this specific list.)')
