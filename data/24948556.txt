I have a condition that&#x27;s barely a condition; it causes minor, barely pain but it&#x27;s always there. The problem for me is I am also pre-disposed to catastrophizing and that makes everything worse. My problem is as much (if not more) mental as it is physical. I&#x27;ve received help on both ends (for physical and mental health) but eight months of living with this discomfort and I can&#x27;t help but think that it&#x27;s forever, will never go away and in fact will get worse. I fear that the physical activities I love will disappear from life and that I won&#x27;t be able to play with my kids.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s nothing more than future snakeoil but claims that humans will be able to CRISPR pain signals away in the not too distant future gives me hope. Opiates scare the living sh*t out of me.<p>I love Scott, I&#x27;ve followed and read him for a long time. From his involvement in the diabetes community and his glucose tracking projects, to advocating for .NET and MS, and just opening doors for others, it&#x27;s clear he&#x27;s a wonderful person.<p>From his posts, he&#x27;s got an amazing family and I wish him and them all the best.')
