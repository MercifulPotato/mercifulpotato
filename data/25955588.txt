This is not about the main executable - this is a misdirection. The comments you make about the &quot;main binary&quot; are 100% correct. But, they do not address my comment at all.<p>My comments were entirely about the shared cache region and how it can be moved.<p>I again ask you to do the homework - please calculate how it could be done better given the address spaces involved. Address spaces going from 32bit to 64bit have gotten better, but this does need to be kept into consideration given the size of the object involved and the API &#x2F; CPU instructions available (please, I ask you to consider all of the addressing modes available to the ABI for all of the currently supported platforms)<p>[added]<p>It is likely the individual objects that compose the share cache region are compiled independently. There are lots of individual objects! Resolving the dependencies of the composite shared object are likely expensive.<p>Historically I observe that the contextual data available to a static or dynamic linker has been very constrained, which makes relinking &#x2F; reallocation objects a challenge.')
