There are multiple suppliers and gas stations are owned by private entities.<p>To own a gas station you need to get several licenses and permits from the gas companies which are mostly government owned like Indian Oil. These companies will not give licenses to anyone unless you are politically connected and willing to pay huge sums of bribes. Last time I checked the bribes for a highway patrol pump camp to around USD 900K not worth it. Of course if you are son in law of the right minister you get this for free giving you a $900K head start over your competition.<p>&gt; there is always a shortage and you will see huge lines to fill up gas<p>I mean shortages of gas stations and not gas. I can give anecdotal evidence but the oil companies have a plan to double total number of gas stations in India from 65K to 120K in next 5 years that alone should tell you a lot about current state. (USA for example has declining number of gas stations).<p>&gt; Almost all apartments constructed for past 10 - 15 years, and that is a lot mind you, have designated parking spaces for each and every apartment.<p>I hope so, and I hope they have the ability to retrofit these spots with charging stations with mechanisms to pay for that electricity.')
