I would probably say most of the time it&#x27;s a combination of stress, bullshit, and someone(s) in denial.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_mass_hysteria_cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_mass_hysteria_cases</a><p>If I had to guess most of these went down because the child or relative of someone powerful, authoritative, and very disconnected from reality (gullible), did some bullshit the powerful person couldn&#x27;t reason about. Literally, leaving their brain unable to compute reality instead choosing (and very likely believing) &quot;bat shit&quot; as the reason... Depending on how powerful the person who just skipped-a-beat of reality; the narrative might never be questioned. <i>cough</i> trump <i>cough</i><p>I mean; like with UFOs, most of the imagery people use to describe are _known_ to them before the event. They&#x27;re related to what the person knows and is capable of imagining.<p>With all that said, I&#x27;m not trying to explain them all as bullshit or nonsense; but, the list without the bullshit is a lot smaller. I do think it&#x27;s a bit unfortunate though as I&#x27;d love to speculate and wonder about something besides the trite psuedo-hallucinations all these stories contain.')
