A $40k Mercedes C-Class has better interior than a $100k Model S.<p>But what Tesla does well is the UX. While I&#x27;m not a huge fan of fully touch controls for essentials like AC, wipers and so on, the software feels really polished including their navigation, mobile integration, OTA software updates to improve them. It feels like software coming out of a Silicon Valley software company as opposed to clunky stuff you are used to seeing in cars. Until other manufacturers catch up with this aspect, it&#x27;s hard to compete with Tesla because the full experience is superior.')
