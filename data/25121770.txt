I don&#x27;t know the internals, so they may be elegant and extremely logical, but the UX is terrible.<p>Git&#x27;s UX, like a famous programming language, was never designed in a strict sense. It&#x27;s clearly been written to solve immediate requirement, one by one, without a vision (again, from a UX perspective).<p>Result: the horrible checkout command, which does a zillion different things, and I bet only few users know all of them. Same goes for reset.<p>I don&#x27;t remember all the checkout forms, and I couldn&#x27;t use git without aliases.<p>The porcelain interface is another one. Excerpt:<p><pre><code>  This is my fault, to some degree.\n  The &quot;short-status&quot; form is meant for human eyeballs, and was designed by Junio.\n  Some people wanted a scriptable status output, too, so I slapped a &quot;--porcelain&quot;\n  on the same format that turns off configurable features like relative pathnames\n  and colorizing, and makes an implicit promise that we won&#x27;t make further changes\n  to the format.\n  The idea was to prevent people from scripting around --short, because it was never\n  intended to be stable.\n  So yeah, while --porcelain by itself is stable and scriptable, it is perhaps not\n  the most friendly to parsers. The &quot;-z --porcelain&quot; format is much more so, and I\n  would recommend it to anyone scripting around &quot;git status&quot;\n</code></pre>\nNote the &quot;slap&quot; here; it&#x27;s not random.')
