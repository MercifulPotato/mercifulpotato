Having done 4 intercontinental moves, some on tight budgets, I have donated&#x2F;dumped boxes of books and now mostly read on my e-book to avoid repeating that. The only downside I have seen to this is the &quot;display case&quot; which is such a great way to find out when you share fringe interests with visitors.<p>One technical solution I have given a lot of thought is to achieve a tangible representation of books, music and photo albums as small printed cards. These cards should then be recognizable by your media devices (e-readers, audio-players,...) via QR codes or RFID tags. Think putting on a playlist by dumping a bunch of music cards on your player, etc.')
