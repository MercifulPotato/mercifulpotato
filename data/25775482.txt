Item(by='xenocratus', descendants=None, kids=[25775525], score=None, time=1610626520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775407, text='&gt; Your assertion falls apart when I ask you if there is a Rightâ„¢ answer to &quot;Is the Earth flat?&quot;.<p>No it doesn&#x27;t, I didn&#x27;t claim there are no issues or questions where we know the answer. The empirical kind, like the one you  present, are a good example for that. But policy isn&#x27;t about whether the Earth is flat or whether climate change is real, but about how to tackle them in the best way possible, which depends on what you value.<p>&gt; There are irrefutable answers to some questions.<p>I didn&#x27;t claim that wasn&#x27;t the case, though you can continue with your strawman if you&#x27;d like.<p>&gt; Most of them are not perfect, immutable or immortal, but even if not, no rational person can accuse them of being wrong.<p>So what happens if we have multiple theories that no one can accuse of being wrong because we simply don&#x27;t have enough insight into some very complicated matters? Which one do we put in practice? Or do we wait years before we gather the data for it, by which time it might be irrelevant anyway')
