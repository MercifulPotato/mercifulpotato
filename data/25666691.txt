Reach has it&#x27;s own independent queue and the phone can be off and you&#x27;ll still receive messages on the desktop client.<p>I would also state that it is unfair to compare an app that doesn&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy and solving real engineering problems vs basically making a web app that can easily sync your data because it&#x27;s all stored on someone else&#x27;s computer.<p>If that&#x27;s the level of privacy you&#x27;re setting you may as well use email for communicating. It&#x27;s federated, it&#x27;s easy to use, and everybody has one.<p>All that said, I do agree the Signal desktop app needs some work, but they&#x27;ll get there eventually, and in the meantime I don&#x27;t have to wonder if any of my data will be leaked to anyone outside of my intended recipient.')
