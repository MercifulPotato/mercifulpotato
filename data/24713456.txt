Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[24714046], score=None, time=1602109115, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24710615, text='(Replying after your clarifying edit.)<p>You seem to have a very narrow definition of what &quot;love&quot; is and want to deny people the ability to love in whatever way makes them happy, which is a bit uncharitable of you.<p>I think maybe I get the root of your complaint; there are some people who drink the kool aid and get stuck in what amounts to an abusive relationship with their job, and stay there out of some sort of warped &quot;love&quot;.  That is genuinely bad.  That is also not what anyone in this thread is talking about when they say they love their job.<p>I have at times loved my job.  I have at times only liked it.  And sometimes actively disliked or hated it.  I&#x27;ve also loved romantic partners, family, and friends.  My love for a job is different than my love for a romantic partner, which is a different love than the love I have for family, which is also a different love than the love I have for friends.  That doesn&#x27;t cheapen the value of any of these kinds of love, and neither does broadening your horizons to accept other kinds of love that you perhaps don&#x27;t feel yourself.<p>There are many different kinds of love, and no person has any business telling others how to love or how not to love.  This has nothing to do with &quot;conditioning&quot; or &quot;defensiveness&quot;.  You just don&#x27;t get to decide this for anyone but yourself, and complaining about how other people love is as meaningless as complaining that the sky is blue.')
