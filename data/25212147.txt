To me, it becomes obvious that it&#x27;s a platform then, because users need integrations to properly codify their business processes. SFDC probably has more integrations than any other piece of technology that I can think of.<p>When you codify your business processes, actual code is going to be needed as well. Enter Apex and heroku.<p>Slack is a way for SFDC to codify another part of your business processesâ€”communication.<p>That said, SFDC does a lot of things that fairly give it a bad rap. Their developer experience is really bad, their apps are not that great, and lightning is still not adopted at many companies years after its release.')
