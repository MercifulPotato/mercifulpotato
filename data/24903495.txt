I would choose the same, and I know many others who would.  For the people who would prefer to live what they consider to be a &quot;normal&quot; lifespan, they can simply choose to end their life when they want, or not avail themselves of whatever treatments become available to increase lifespan.<p>So many &quot;anti&quot; arguments against so many things boil down to &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want that so you shouldn&#x27;t get to have it either&quot;.  Those arguments are tedious and annoying.')
