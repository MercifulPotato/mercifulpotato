This is anecdotal of course, but all the companies I have worked at and all the companies I know of use Slack and are fairly happy with it. No plans to use Microsoft products at all. But as I said, this is anecdotal and I&#x27;d be interested in knowing more.<p>I don&#x27;t see actual numbers for comparison anywhere. Slack has published concurrent users count while Teams has published DAU, which are obviously different.')
