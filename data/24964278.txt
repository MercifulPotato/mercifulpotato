The omission was my mistake... one I made because I was assuming that offering voice calls isn&#x27;t particularly credible with the isolation technique used in the device.<p>The isolation technique AIUI is not really any different from what purism does with the librem; hang it off the USB bus, expose power control to the user.<p>But that still provides convenient first-class software integration as a cellular modem when that&#x27;s functionality the user wishes to access.<p>A wifi hotspot your device uses over wifi which just <i>happens</i> to be reaching the internet via a cellular network has absolutely no software-level integration as a cellular modem providing voice&#x2F;SMS&#x2F;MMS services.<p>&gt; For SMS&#x2F;MMS do none of the wifi hotspots offer a similar interface to serial cellular modems?<p>Not AFAIK, my experience is limited to a ZTE mobile hotspot on at&amp;t prepay, but it&#x27;s a bog standard wifi hotspot.  Sure I can do the sms-over-email dance through the data link, but i could also use voip or skype or whatever over data, that&#x27;s besides the point.  To be useful as a hardened even basic feature phone substitute, it needs to be able to make&#x2F;receive calls and sms&#x2F;mms, at most requiring the flick of a switch toggling the cellular modem.')
