Your information will have changed multiple times between requests. The IP problem is larger, but can be mitigated by the use of VPN, TOR, or shared connections (school, workplace, public wifi etc). I think the real takeaway is that there is no perfect solution, only means which make the work of people attempting traffic correlation more difficult. For services you&#x27;re already logged into (facebook, steam, reddit, insta, youtube, HN) the battle is already lost. Blocking trackers and ads helps prevent 3rd parties from building a profile of your actions across the web, but all we can ever hope to do is make the record less complete. We&#x27;re all vulnerable. Now that ISPs are able to decrypt much of our traffic and sell our entire browsing histories alongside our names it&#x27;s not something I see being solved anytime soon.')
