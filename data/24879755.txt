Some years ago, I did some freelance work.  I made a good faith effort to do all the tax paperwork.  In my naive zeal, I fucked up the forms, and somehow reported the same income twice.  What they were asking me to pay was basically the profit I made on the project after expenses.  I think I spent 80 hour assembling materials and corresponding with the IRS to try to explain what had happened.  Every time it seemed like I was about to get through to a real human who could understand, I was starting all over.<p>I did go to a professional when I was about halfway through the saga.  They did not really know what to do.  They just wrote another one of the same kinds of letters that I had been writing.  Maybe the extra tax jargon in it helped.  I don&#x27;t know.<p>Ultimately I only had to pay a small fraction of what they were asking, but it left me with a phobia of taxes.  The rules appeared to be arbitrary and unknowable (to me) and yet I was still responsible for complying.')
