Without Crouton I never had that problem, but I did occasionally have to rebuild because my kids would reboot it and press the spacebar like the scary boot message told them too :facepalm:<p>With Crostini something did happen that horked the VM and I had to remove and reinstall it.  That is pretty annoying.  Not sure if I did something to cause it, but I also respect that the feature is still &quot;Beta&quot; and I guess I&#x27;m so overjoyed that they&#x27;re doing it that I&#x27;m willing to accept some brokenness :-)')
