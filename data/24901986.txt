There is little space that you can move your mouse without it tossing up some panel on mouse over events. It is adds a lot of visual clutter and most of the popups add nothing in the movement. Why does every name and date generate a pop up with more details on mouseover? I can click through if I want more.<p>It is particularly troublesome when you move your mouse to click on something and pass over a hotspot that pop us up another panel just as you click. Suddenly you’ve missed your click target and clicked something else.<p>I suspect that all of these popups are also why the page now consumes so much RAM. If facebook is loaded it soon consumes 2GB or more of RAM. The CPU usage also rises. This is a site with “big bones”.')
