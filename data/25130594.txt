I don&#x27;t know how PyCharm works internally. I don&#x27;t even know what language it is written in. I know that it provides syntax highlighting, smart replace, code completion, etc.<p>Similarly, my car mechanic has a bunch of tools that he doesn&#x27;t understand in detail; they have interfaces (like a gauge on a pressure sensor).<p>Progress requires these interfaces, it requires these abstractions, and over time I&#x27;m pretty confident that we&#x27;ll get a better VCS than git that has better, more user-friendly abstractions and it will take over the market.')
