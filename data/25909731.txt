A short list includes:<p>* Shelters not allowing pets - many would rather remain homeless than give up their dog\n * Shelters not allowing drugs\n * Social services officers looking too much like cops (many homeless have had bad enough experiences with cops to keep them away from anyone cop-like)\n * Spending on &#x27;discomfort&#x27; measures (eg deliberately-hostile architecture to discourage people from being homeless)\n * Effective mitigations being politically unpopular.<p>For instance: cold-calling people who have just separated from their spouse to offer counseling substantially reduces the number of people you have to lift out of homelessness at very little cost. However, &quot;free therapy&quot; is a wildly unpopular suggestion in the USA.')
