On mobile devices, the &quot;double tap&quot; concept never was very important, I think (at least not in the web context).<p>Therefore my feeling is that this issue is mostly a thing from the past.<p>Nevertheless I sometimes see forms which implement this &quot;disable after submission&quot; principle.
