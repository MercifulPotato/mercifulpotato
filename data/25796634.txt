If one&#x27;s design requires certain runtime constraints (ability to hook into interpreter execution and memory allocation, no per-process global restrictions), packaging (e.g. static linking), and ease of portability, then starting off on the minimal side (Lua) is better than trying to strip things off of a larger (Python) runtime.<p>You can also get to a middle-ground state between &quot;no batteries&quot; and &quot;just enough batteries&quot; to get a large portion of the expected work done if the problem space is understood and has some bounds.  E.g. including a library to make HTTP requests, parse JSON and work with an embedded SQL database will be enough for a lot of use-cases in the &quot;user-defined glue logic on an existing application&quot; space.')
