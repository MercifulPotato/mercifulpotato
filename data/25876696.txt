The more interesting thing always wins and the other thing gets forgotten about or &quot;I&#x27;ll come back to it&quot;. Trying to do more than one thing feels conflicting pretty quickly.<p>When I was younger in my mid 20s before I was diagnosed there was a period where it was amazing. People around me couldn&#x27;t understand how I was able to get on the level I was able to get on. But if you zoom out and look at my life on the whole from 17 to 27 I had 5 different jobs and _in aggregate_ only managed to be gainfully employed for 1 year out of those 10. My early adult life was a wreck.<p>Now I&#x27;m in my early 30s Ive got a decent career because I hyperfocused on that and instead now my health is a wreck. After suffering a brush with burnout last year I&#x27;m now trying to focus on my health.<p>I think I cycle back and forth on it being a burden. Pre-diagnosis I just had no idea why I felt consumed by what I was into to the point where some days I felt like I had no agency because I was starting to get that burny-outy feeling and wish I could do something else with my time but was always find myself sucked into &quot;just. one. more&quot;. Though there are times when you just are constantly in this deep flow state and nothing else matters. It&#x27;s just impossible to balance. There is no balance.')
