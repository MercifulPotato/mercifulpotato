Yes, there are definitely a few people who absolutely have to be in the lab for hardware dev, but there&#x27;s a shockingly long tail of people who would have been in the lab some of the time but didn&#x27;t really need to be.<p>I generally preferred working in the office pre-pandemic, but it wasn&#x27;t strictly necessary. I also hated living in the bay area. I finally got all the i&#x27;s dotted and t&#x27;s crossed and I&#x27;m now living somewhere I vastly prefer (far fewer people and a whole lot cheaper). I&#x27;ve only been here 3 weeks and it&#x27;s already hard to imagine going back.')
