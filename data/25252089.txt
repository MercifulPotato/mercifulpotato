Only you or your team might care about which particular brand of sawing machine or editor you use. And they are not an integral part of the end result.<p>A component for a woodworker would be a hinge or drawer rails. You would probably not appreciate it if your woodworker uses hinges that they made themselves. They are not worth the time to build. They&#x27;re probably not very reliable. And if they fail they might not be easily replaced or repaired except by the person that made them. So you would only use custom components if the part you need is otherwise unavailable or does not meet specific needs.<p>Are you a woodworker and making a cabinet for yourself? Go ahead and make your own hinges, but for paid projects you probably should rely on standard components as much as possible; only doing custom woodwork or software engineering where it adds value.')
