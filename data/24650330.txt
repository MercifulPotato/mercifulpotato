What about guitar tabs? I remember simplified math as a kid.<p>I don&#x27;t remember different notations for math and music as a kid...<p>Music was always sheet music, even when I learned classical guiter; Chord names were &quot;procedures&quot;, at times spelled out, and sometimes only referenced. Guitar tabs exist, but were only for people who wanted to play without taking the time to actually learn the craft (at least when I was growing up) EDIT: This was the attitude of <i>every</i> teacher around me growing up, not mine.<p>As for math - other than having variables written down as empty squares, circles, triangles and stars which were later replaced by letters, I think the first real simplification of math notation that I met was Einstein summation; Everything else was just building on previous things, sometimes with new concepts (like complex numbers) and sometimes as shortcuts (limits and infinites). But they were all shorter than what they replaced, and compatible.<p>&gt; I think this hits on the right approach, which already exists: different languages with different complexity levels for notation.<p>There was a guy who proposed something along the article&#x27;s lines in 1958, which went even farther - instead of &quot;single word descriptions&quot;, he chose a single symbol graphical description, because -- though ignored by the author of this article -- most of the world does not have English as their first language. I like the result of that 1958 suggestion a lot; most people place a SEP field over it. The guy is called Kenneth Iverson and the language is called APL with modern descendants J and K.')
