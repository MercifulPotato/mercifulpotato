The twitter thread only mentioned that a few people&#x27;s <i>domains</i> were hijacked, and that the victims all had their emails (and hence domains) exposed in a recent hack&#x2F;leak of Ledger. It&#x27;s conceivable that after hijacking a domain, you can gain access to the victim&#x27;s cryptocurrency exchange account via password reset email and steal coins that way, but most exchange I know require multiple factors (eg. passport scans, phone&#x2F;sms verification, waiting periods, security questions, etc.) so a hijacked email isn&#x27;t going to do much.')
