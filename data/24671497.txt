Item(by='aranelsurion', descendants=None, kids=[24671896], score=None, time=1601727630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24667342, text='Might be wrong, but from online discussions it seems to me Xecuter&#x27;s SXOS goes a bit farther than merely being a rooting tool, it also seems to include some functionality that ties to Nintendo&#x27;s proprietary code &amp; keys, which would be a big no-no if it&#x27;s indeed the case. In that sense they&#x27;re probably not the same thing as open-source Atmosphere and homebrew ecosystem around it.<p>Apart from this, I just couldn&#x27;t help but notice the overall negativity in the comments. It&#x27;s thinly veiled in excuses, like opportunity cost for law enforcement or whatever, but it&#x27;s there.<p>Maybe the real concern here is that we simply don&#x27;t agree with the law. DMCA was enacted 10 years before Spotify started business. If I hazard a guess many of the people here in HN, and out there in your neighbourhood were downloading mp3&#x27;s back then. These laws were not made by popular support. They weren&#x27;t made by the people, or for the people. It seems to me, majority of the people here and outside haven&#x27;t really internalized IP laws, and would rather live in a world without them if they could.<p>I think it&#x27;s fine if our moral compasses don&#x27;t align with the law. It&#x27;s one thing to obey the law, and another thing to actually agree with it. No amount of pressure from anti-piracy groups can turn a law into a holy commandment. So we don&#x27;t have to beat around the bush. If you can&#x27;t symphatize with the massively profitable huge gaming company and if your symphaties lie elsewhere, maybe it&#x27;s time to discuss why reality, laws and government don&#x27;t reflect your will.')
