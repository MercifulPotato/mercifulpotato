Often creating very long decision paths.<p>And it&#x27;s not only the time you spent but sometimes also the delay incurred that messes with this approach. Often enough even with buy in you get the answer that it can be planned for next year&#x27;s budget.<p>One year delay later, you might get the approval, but it may be too late.<p>And if the company is large enough often they&#x27;ve already built a subpar internal solution that everyone is convinced you should use. Since it&#x27;s &quot;already working&quot;.')
