Item(by='vonmoltke', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603233696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24841227, text='I believe I have posted this before, but one of the big problems with this industry is the mashing of a whole bunch of different roles into the same bucket.<p>I used to be an electrical engineer.  In the traditional engineering world there are mechanics&#x2F;assemblers (high school with maybe a vocational certificate program), technicians (two-year Associates or vocational degree), engineers (Bachelor&#x27;s or Master&#x27;s degree in a specific, relevant discipline), and researchers (Ph.D.+ in a specific, relevant discipline).<p>In the Valley-oriented tech industry, the first three all get squashed into &quot;software engineer&quot;.  It&#x27;s often not clear what a company needs, even to the company.  Some companies seemingly don&#x27;t care; Google, for instance, seems to hire all software engineers to the same bar then sorts them internally into the mechanic&#x2F;technician&#x2F;engineer bins based on what teams will take them.  I think hiring is going to remain fundamentally broken until companies start making an explicit distinction between these roles when they open reqs and interview candidates.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying my former industry&#x27;s way of doing things is all good.  I have effectively left it for good by virtue of not having touched a circuit card or JTAG debugger professionally in 14 years.  I do think this industry could learn from the separation of roles, though.')
