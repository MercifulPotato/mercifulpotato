As a platform abstraction layer, using the arduino.h C++ header provides an excellent embedded development experience and there is a large number of compatible libraries online. But the scope is very, very small and limited. For features like parallel IO however you often have to drop down to inline assembly&#x2F;invoke platform sdk.')
