So they have to follow the laws and rules but don&#x27;t have a voice in the rules. I have no idea what the benefit of the EEA is for it&#x27;s members other than political that they can say they&#x27;re not in the EU but there must be some, maybe they don&#x27;t need to pay in like EU members do?')
