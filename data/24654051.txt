Oh boy, it&#x27;s hard to track down what will make a difference. Is it the font, the CSS sizing of the element, the images in it... help on diagnosing what&#x27;s causing the LCP time would be great.<p>But by far the least helpful metric is when I&#x27;m told that analytics.js could be optimised further. A (I assume) Google-sponsored tool is telling me I should improve the result from another Google tool. I appreciate why it happens, but it&#x27;s frustrating :)<p>* Only to learn earlier this week from Paul Irish that some sites can&#x27;t reach 100 due to the way the scoring curves are set.')
