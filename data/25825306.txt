You have the freedom to adopt countermeasures. You can drive defensively and stay alert when behind the wheel as a countermeasure against other drivers possibly being drunk. You can wear a mask (properly), social distance, avoid crowds, etc., as a countermeasure against other people possibly having an infectious disease. That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s <i>supposed</i> to work in a free society.<p><i>&gt; While Prohibition failed miserably in aggregate, its ongoing legacy of (American!) laws against drunk driving and public drunkenness are perfectly good examples of how this ethos works and why it&#x27;s important.</i><p>The reason why the laws you refer to work reasonably well in America is that <i>they are only enforced when someone has already made a mistake</i>. We don&#x27;t have roadblocks everywhere with cops forcibly administering breathalyzers to all drivers to make sure none of them are drunk. We don&#x27;t have cops going around cities forcibly administering breathalyzers to everyone walking on the streets to make sure none of them are drunk. We only enforce those laws when someone has already done something like cause an accident, or drive erratically enough to get a cop&#x27;s attention, or behave in public in a way that is obviously due to drunkenness.<p>And that very method of enforcement means that <i>you, the individual citizen, cannot depend on it to protect you individually</i>. In other words, those laws are <i>not</i> shielding you, individually, from the consequences of other people&#x27;s bad decisions. You <i>still</i> have to adopt your own countermeasures when you drive, because you can&#x27;t assume that every other driver is sober. And, again, that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s <i>supposed</i> to work in a free society.')
