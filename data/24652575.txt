I generally know to a pretty good degree of accuracy the cardinal directions (N,S,E,W) and if I&#x27;ve been somewhere once I can generally find it again. It would be interesting to do brain scans on people of different ages while they&#x27;re doing spatial navigation to see the differences in the brains of those who grew up with GPS vs those who didn&#x27;t.')
