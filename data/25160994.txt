A ZFS pool stores data in VDEVs. A single VDEV can be:<p>- a single disk (no redundancy, but same error checking)<p>- N disks in a N-way mirror<p>- N disks in a RAID-Z (single for disk parity, min 3 disks)<p>- RAID-Z2 with 2 disk parity<p>- RAID-Z3 with 3 disk parity (much slower than other two RAID-Z&#x27;s due to complex math)<p>You can always _add_ VDEVs to a pool, and ZFS will start using it. It will try to be clever about it, so for example if existing VDEVs are quite full, it will redirect most of the writes to the new VDEV.<p>What you cannot do (yet) is _remove_ a VDEV.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to replace _all_ the disks in a single VDEV to larger disks in turn (important!), and once the final disk is replaced the VDEV will suddenly appear to have the added capacity.')
