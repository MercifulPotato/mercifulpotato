Each component in the chain, from trigger button to storage I&#x2F;O, had presumably been tested and its tolerances documented. Responding to such a query could (should?) be as easy as checking the specs. “In theory this camera can support up to N triggers per second, which is the limit for part X, but you will need your storage to sustain writes at speed S or the buffer will fill up, and by the way this wasn’t tested end-to-end and will void your warranty.”<p>It’s more likely they just wouldn’t tell for whatever reason. A mass manufacturer probably doesn’t want to give an impression that they encourage a way of using the units not explicitly mentioned in the manual to avoid any complaints&#x2F;lawsuits. Also, some companies require tech support staff to respond to a certain minimum number of tickets per hour (effectively penalizing personnel for doing anything beyond provided checklists, which consulting part specs definitely would be).')
