Depends on what you mean &quot;absolutely gigantic&quot; and how you define &quot;serious competitors&quot; etc.<p>Also, almost every sentence in your reply uses exaggeration, so it does seem you allow that to yourself but insist others speak accurately. Maybe this is just a case of that, not to be taken literally. It seems so. And nobody apart from you mentioned limiting that matter to &quot;great&quot; pianists - a straw man.')
