He&#x27;s on the record as saying that the approach he applied in SF failed. I&#x27;m fairly certain he&#x27;s said it more straightforwardly, but from a quick Google search with a 2014 quote,<p>&gt; &quot;There’s a mythology that you can — quote unquote — end homelessness at any moment, but there are new people coming in, suffering through the cycles of their lives,&quot; he said. &quot;It’s the manifestation of complete, abject failure as a society. We’ll never solve this at City Hall.&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfchronicle.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;item&#x2F;A-decade-of-homelessness-Thousands-in-S-F-30431.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfchronicle.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;item&#x2F;A-decade-of-homeles...</a><p>And here&#x27;s what he said in a recent state of the state address:<p>&gt; &quot;Of course, the fundamental building block of California’s solution has to be more housing. A comprehensive response to our collective failure to build enough of it. When we don’t build housing for people at all income levels, we worsen the homeless crisis. It’s a vicious cycle and we own it. And the only sustainable way out of it is to massively increase housing production.&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sacbee.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics-government&#x2F;capitol-alert&#x2F;article240435521.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sacbee.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics-government&#x2F;capitol-aler...</a><p>Also noteworthy in that speech is that he spends more time discussing health care and mental health issues than housing, per se.<p>Newsom&#x27;s talking points on homelessness are often annoyingly vague (owing to his very ambitious career goals), but note what he doesn&#x27;t say and what he doesn&#x27;t support. Notably he doesn&#x27;t support a legal right to housing, and is on the record saying so. His complete silence on Senator Wiener&#x27;s bills was also deafening. Following his politics over the years it&#x27;s fairly obvious he supports Weiner in principle but 1) knew it would never pass and 2) didn&#x27;t want to burn his political capital on a loser.  Also note the sums in his spending proposals for new, publicly subsidized construction; they&#x27;re ridiculously paltry if the actual intent is to literally use public funds to build homes for all the homeless. Rather, it&#x27;s obvious he&#x27;s placating the far left without burning real cash--a strategy that many centrist SF politicians are actually quite adept at.<p>The sad fact is that plenty of California politicians know exactly what needs to be happen, including and especially Newsom. But California <i>voters</i>, both liberal and conservative, don&#x27;t want to loosen housing regulations state-wide (including overriding local restrictions), and far too many on the left unthinkingly assume it&#x27;s feasible to publicly fund or exact, dollar-for-dollar, enough construction to &quot;fix&quot; the homeless issue. Newsom definitely no longer believes, and he, like Brown and many others, are also perfectly aware how hopeless the situation is in terms of electoral support for meaningful reform and choose to stay clear of attacking the issue head-on.<p>Don&#x27;t blame the politicians for failing to produce solutions according to the electorate&#x27;s inconsistent and incoherent preferences. And especially don&#x27;t blame a man who successfully[1] implemented a widely popular but destined to fail policy and then publicly went on the record as admitting to the fundamentally flawed premise. We need more politicians capable of doing that and fewer that simply point fingers.<p>[1] He promised to create beds for every homeless person at the time, and by the time the program wrapped up it succeeded in creating that number of beds. Of course, for every homeless person given a bed and taken off the street someone else replaced them on the street. And he admits it--lesson learned.')
