I wonder if decentralizing the hardware into people&#x27;s homes or putting it in very cold places that need to generate heat during winter would be a way to cut down on some of the excessive waste of energy and thus emissions.<p>EDIT: Some good points down below WRT heat pumps.  I have a window unit AC&#x2F;Heater for just my room so that I don&#x27;t need to run the whole house&#x27;s AC&#x2F;Heater the vast majority of the time.  I&#x27;m not sure about heat pumps in such a small scale.  Would it be more efficient to run a heat pump for a whole house than to mine to heat my one room?')
