The net diameter of the hole behind the TBM is less than the diameter of the TBM, particularly the shield, which is the business end. Maintenance is done in place.<p>Fun Chunnel fact: when the TBMs driving from England and France met, they drove one below the other and abandoned it in place. The other was dismantled and removed in pieces.')
