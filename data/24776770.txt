Today it is 10.  Tomorrow someone looks at the production process the machines give groups of 11, so the bulk discount should be multiples of 11 (if you order 12 you get 11 at the bulk rate and 1 and the regular price).  Then next week management says small orders are too hard to serve, and so the minimum bulk order is 100, but bigger discounts if the total order is a multiple off 11.  Then the week after...<p>Point is that your implementation of the discounts is expected to change. I should not have to change my shopping cart tests at all just because the discount requirement changed - it makes the costs of those tests too high.<p>Of course this is domain specific. I expect discounts to change all the time.  Likewise I expect taxes to change often.  In both cases they need to be mocked&#x2F;faked just to keep my test code sane.  there are many other domain specific things that won&#x27;t change. I&#x27;m always going to store the shipping mass in KG, and for some customers convert it to lbs. It is reasonable to hardcode the weight in lbs as that won&#x27;t change. (future me who has to ship to mars will disagree, but I don&#x27;t know what the requirements are)')
