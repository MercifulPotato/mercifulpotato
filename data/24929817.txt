If someone acts like a jerk tell them to stop, and if they don&#x27;t, take action.<p>There are lots of reasons.<p>Ideally forces you to think ahead of time what kind of conduct you are OK with or not OK with, so you don&#x27;t have to decide at the moment when someone you actually have a relationship with does something.<p>Ideally you think ahead of time how you would respond if someone did one of those things.<p>Ideally you think about a process for people to follow that balances several contrasting goals:  Namely, to avoid doxxing or blaming the victim, but also to prevent the system from being used against innocent people (which it seems what happened here).<p>Ideally people who are prone to act like jerks decide not to act like jerks at all: Either they behave themselves, or they don&#x27;t join your community.<p>If you don&#x27;t do a Code of Conduct, and just &quot;tell the jerk to stop, and if not take action&quot;, then it&#x27;s a crap shoot whether you overreact (as happened here) or underreact (as has happened in many cases).  If you deploy a Code of Conduct properly, there&#x27;s at least a better chance that you&#x27;ll respond constructively.')
