Also, first 3 months you will have to support your wife, take care of many thing and you will learn a lot of life lessons that you couldn&#x27;t learn anywhere. Be less on the phone and in front of TV and take care of your sleep and mental rest (meditation). Look at it as the Life University, because since I got my first kid, I have learned so much about life that helped in business and in every other segment of being a human. Just relax and learn from everything. And whatever happens, be supportive to your wife, because if she is feeling well, with baby and you will be well.')
