Switching was <i>super</i> easy because of the way they keep the accounts in sync.<p>One thing that hasn’t been a problem but which causes me a little anxiety is that with GSuite I felt I had basically infinite storage; I sorta wish Fastmail had a tier that was a “you don’t ever have to worry about storage space” type thing. Maybe I’m worrying for nothing and I’ll never even get close to their limits.')
