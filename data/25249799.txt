Your comment presupposed the reason us nerds (how is this an insult on HN of all places?) didn&#x27;t think the name was a good idea was searching and branding. I was saying my problem with it was overlapping executable names. This wasn&#x27;t new information in the comment section as a whole, but judging by your comment it seemed to be new information to you.<p>It makes sense that you wouldn&#x27;t use TeX at Redhat, but as a professional mathematician, I&#x27;ve never met anyone in math who <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> use it. Different fields use different tools.<p>&gt; we can all be better<p>Sure, but I didn&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t, directly attack you or your work. My sin was 1) omitting that it is ubiquitous <i>in mathematical sciences</i> in particular, and 2) simply not realizing you already knew the info about the executable name I brought up and just didn&#x27;t care.  Since you didn&#x27;t even mention the only part I cared about with the name I thought it <i>was</i> new information for you. Show some charity.')
