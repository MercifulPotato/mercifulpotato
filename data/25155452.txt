They closed shop mid 2020, but their tech-blog 0x65.dev is still up. There are a lot of posts from last December that explain its inner workings.<p>User-agents really do contribute their history, containing which search terms led to which pages. From this data (they named it the &quot;human web&quot;) the search engine had a page model of which search terms led in higher frequency to the page. Related search terms were normalized. Only later did a &quot;fetcher&quot; really index high frequency content and consider it again in a later stage of search. Interesting bootstrap, more energy efficient maybe as it can run on less information.<p>Sending the search and browsing history offsite needs explaining and trust. But ultimately, any centralized search engine will see the search data too. Cliqz approach was trying to piggy-back on the result sets on search terms by established search engines, the search term + choosen result combination a donation of the user. Not any less invasive then other search engines. Would I send off the whole corpus of my browsing history? this raises good questions. Thanks for the links!')
