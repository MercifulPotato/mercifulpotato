From Summer onwards, it was quite clear that Biden was going to be President, and his team had 6 months to come up with a coronarecovery program to be implemented day 1 of his presidency. Instead, we are seeing a reliance on the vaccination program that was instituted by Trump (and works better than expectations) but nothing else. No word about elevated and long-term unemployment, branches of industry that are not coming back, low salaries and high asset prices. Everyone is worried about the stock market bubble, yet Biden&#x27;s economic team is the usual Wall Street subjects.')
