Item(by='akersten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601924040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24690215, text='I don&#x27;t know if there is a single perfect resource out there, but the thing that helped me the most was understanding CSS as a shift from programming with an imperative mindset to a declarative mindset. Treat CSS as a medium for expressing &#x27;what you want&#x27; instead of &#x27;what to do.&#x27; My guiding principle is that &quot;less is more&quot; and if you find yourself writing a ton of super-specific and messy CSS, it&#x27;s one of two scenarios: there&#x27;s an easier way to do it, or you have a very picky project manager who wants things to be pixel-perfect to the mock-up. If it&#x27;s the latter, you have my sympathies.<p>Focusing on the box model is important because it sets the right overall mindset for working with CSS layout. At the risk of being too patronizing, I would highly encourage everyone to at least read the MDN article on CSS basics[0] just to set a baseline for CSS terminology, the idea of the box model, and a few other things.<p>You should then read more detailed documentation [1] on the box model and start to get a feel for how it works in depth. Most pedestrian &quot;spacing issues&quot; should be solved at the level of adjusting margins and padding.<p>The other arm I mentioned was specificity, and this tends to be where a lot of folks get caught asking why their rules aren&#x27;t applying and those sorts of issues. The documentation is fairly &#x27;academic&#x27; but worth a read-through[2].<p>MDN overall is a great resource for a motivated learner, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have any &#x27;CSS the right way&#x27; sorts of articles in my hat at the moment. Maybe others will post some.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;Getting_started_with_the_web&#x2F;CSS_basics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;Getting_start...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Building_blocks&#x2F;The_box_model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Learn&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Building_...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Specificity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;Specificity</a>')
