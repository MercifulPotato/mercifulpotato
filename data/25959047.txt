On settlement risk, a key point is that there usually <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a huge amount of risk. This is why DTCC is nearly imperceptible for retail players. In this case, the volume and short situation is so extreme that clearinghouses are getting antsy that there may not be enough of the securities available to actually make good in the end, so they&#x27;re twisting arms at brokerages and requiring they have 100% of it on-hand so that there&#x27;s no surprises when they go to officially give the buyer their security and the seller their money. This is obviously very expensive, which is why brokerages started limiting buying of volatile securities, have had to take out money to get 100% hedge on these trades, and why RH is allowing trading of volatile securities but only in volumes of 5.<p>Market makers buy stock for delta hedging because if they don&#x27;t, they could get caught out and either deliver at a loss or not be able to deliver at all. Figuring out how much you need is a trick of the trade; if you or I knew what their strategy was, their position could be in danger.')
