In the readme the author stated that they hadn&#x27;t yet written support for wildcards (globing) so each file needed to be included manually. There were surprised and pleased when I raised an &quot;issue&quot; pointing out that actually they get globing for free with their $SHELL.<p>That experience really made me appreciate just how varied developers experiences were with the command line and also appreciative that people are still writing tools and happy to share them with the community even when they&#x27;re not 40+ year old UNIX grey beards. It&#x27;s good to see fresh folk adopt TUIs.')
