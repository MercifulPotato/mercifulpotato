Item(by='DanBC', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611577872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901815, text='&gt; You can use additional money to do basically do poverty relief programs on the medium and long term homeless and from a humanity point of view that&#x27;s really important - but I don&#x27;t know of any programs that have consistently shown reintegrated of these populations. That is, they are working other than in services aimed at the homeless population.<p>I feel like you&#x27;ve created your own definition of &quot;homeless&quot; and are using that to say that schemes to prevent homelessness are not working.<p>When you look at official definitions (eg, &quot;statutory homeless&quot;) you see much greater &quot;churn&quot; in the homeless population. Many people become homeless, are helped, and stop being homeless. There are a smaller number of people who are trapped in vulnerable housing or in hostels or rough sleeping.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting the support is good though. There are many problems in England. For example, the way that people are forced to be evicted before councils provide help, or the use of very expensive and very low quality B&amp;B accommodation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;923123&#x2F;Annual_Statutory_Homelessness_Release_2019-20.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a>')
