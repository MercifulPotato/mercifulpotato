It would be very poor historiography to use a book written about somebody as raw data about that person. This sort of thing is taught in intro college classes and makes it very clear that people who claim to be interested in defending history are not trained in the field and haven&#x27;t actually made an effort to learn it. The conclusion then is that there is some <i>other</i> reason why they insist that said statues must remain up.')
