I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m responding to anecdotal evidence with an anecdote myself here, but I come from a fairly small Southern town myself, and I&#x27;ve been harassed here before for &quot;sounding foreign&quot; (my family are Irish, so my accent is a little strange, despite living in England for my entire life). Conversely, having moved to the North for university, no-one&#x27;s ever remarked on my accent. I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily a regional thing.')
