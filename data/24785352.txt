If they do, then everyone&#x27;s worried about censorship or blamed to be politically motivated.<p>There could be simple legislation that defines what is and what isn&#x27;t to be censored, then these platforms can adhere to that and check a compliance box and leave it at that.<p>Perhaps a better response would be, what do you think these platforms should do, really? Maybe we can crowdsource a good idea. And, while at it, also think how to thread the needle of keeping these platforms as less scammy etc. as possible, so that the people won&#x27;t stop using the platforms.')
