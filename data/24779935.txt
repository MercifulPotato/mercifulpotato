I learned how to build blocks (and the f- me, they totally changed a ton of stuff about how that works).<p>At this point, I have some pretty deep knowledge about WP and how to make it do all kinds of funky stuff it shouldn&#x27;t do... but holy hell if I could get the sales folks to start selling about any other CMS I&#x27;d do that in a heart beat.<p>But I&#x27;d still have 600 or so legacy WP sites to support.  I&#x27;m grateful to have work, and WP can be a real shit show when you look at that many sites.')
