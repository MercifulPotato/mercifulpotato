Unfortunately my emergency spinal operation was 2 months prior to the bill going into effect, so I got hit by this.<p>The part that pissed me off was I KNEW about the practice and specifically made a fuss about making sure everyone in that OR was IN NETWORK. I went to an in network facility, my surgeon was in network, and so was the anesthesiologist and every person that entered my hospital room I asked if the OR staff was in network (the answer was always yes). 1 month later I get a bill for a neuro-monitoring team and an assistant-surgeon that were both out of network.<p>The assistant surgeon charged me about $500. The neuro-monitoring team sent a ~$20,000 bill with the promise that they&#x27;d lower it to a reasonable value when I called to pay. Furthermore Blue Cross sent me a letter saying it wasn&#x27;t pre-approved (even though the procedure was) and they would not cover a cent of it. Imagine the feeling of doom wondering just how low could these shysters possibly go from 20k. Thankfully that turned out to be true, the final bill was $800. Which still made me furious because I made such a huge deal out of not getting into this situation.<p>So that was $1300 total out of pocket that I was not expecting to pay. Luckily I&#x27;m a software developer with a huge savings, but I made several angry calls anyway and even sent an appeal twice to blue cross (which they denied both times). I&#x27;m so glad this crap is finally coming to an end, but the right-leaning supreme court makes me afraid some of these laws will get reversed.')
