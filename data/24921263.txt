With the separation between the server and composer, bugs might need to be fixed in multiple places. Some window managers use wlroots, so maybe some bugs can be fixed there, but others have their own forks and implementations.<p>The hotkey thing is big and it&#x27;s annoying because it&#x27;s another thing that might need to be implemented&#x2F;fixed in each and every composer and environment (and it could be different in every environment).<p>I&#x27;ve seen the X11&#x2F;Wayland talks and I agree Xorg has tons of old crufty garbage in it, and screen locking in Xorg is not very secure. But the Wayland team seems to have made little effort in addressing even the most basic things like hotkeys, screenshots, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if &quot;user hateful&quot; is the right term, but they don&#x27;t seem to be prioritizing the most basic things people are asking for.')
