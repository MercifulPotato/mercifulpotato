Psychiatry was tried to be a branch of medicine, but it didn&#x27;t work that way. Freud came as a kind of a doctor for mind, calling his clients &#x27;patients&#x27; and mimicking &quot;real&quot; doctors in any way he could. It didn&#x27;t work either. But  while psychoanalysis and psychotherapy were a luxury for the rich, psychiatry often worked with people who didn&#x27;t asked for a treatment or even resisted treatment.<p>I mean, the struggles of a psychiatry to become a science are shared by a psychology. A psychology mostly was nicer to people, because it was kept further from extreme cases, it had a freedom to keep an ethical stance by ignoring ethically difficult cases. I guess it is hard to remain human while forcefully treating a patient on the basis of some shitty theory of mind&#x27;s diseases.')
