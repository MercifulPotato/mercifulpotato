Accept that everything else is true?  Accept that nothing else is true?<p>My position is that I am happy to continue as before, but I won&#x27;t overstate my case.  I won&#x27;t say &#x27;I know&#x27; when I don&#x27;t.  I can accept that what is presented as true, may in fact be true, but I don&#x27;t know it.  I would be lying if I did.<p>So, when you say viruses, or atoms, or whatever exist, but you have not personally verified that, you should be clear that you do not know.  You may think such-and-such is the case, but if you state something without personal verification, you run the risk of repeating a lie, and misleading the next person.')
