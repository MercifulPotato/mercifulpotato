Item(by='svat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607540213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25358332, text='The issue is not really specific to this pair of LaTeX styles, in my experience.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you call the style broken: the final result looks fine, and DJB didn&#x27;t have to fix any errors in the style itself, only in his document. (Also, the author of the style is a translator and co-author of IMO the best introductory book on TeX—comes highly recommended by Hans Hagen in the ConTeXt manual too, as “the book that turns every beginner into an expert”—though of course LaTeX conventions are a different beast and it&#x27;s possible that the expertise doesn&#x27;t carry over.)<p>Rather, my experience is that for any nontrivial document, simply changing the LaTeX style (\\documentclass) from one to another (like amsart to msripub here, or just one journal&#x27;s house style to another independent one) is unlikely to be enough; the amount of work required is likely to be much more than the indicated “two minutes”.<p>So what that story points out is that one of the promises of LaTeX (that particular one, of being able to change styles easily) doesn&#x27;t hold up too well in practice (not many people try it), and the fact that this page starkly shows the typical results one would get on trying is what makes it sting IMO. Or at least so I imagine (I&#x27;m not much of a LaTeX fan, more of a plain TeX one).')
