They wouldn&#x27;t understand why they oftentimes poorly designed, full of bugs, etc. Tracing own &quot;from scratch&quot; steps, with self-reflection, is the best way to be prepared to &quot;professional&quot; programming. First, make and find mistakes yourself, only then you will be ready to find mistakes in, and improve on, other people&#x27;s stuff.')
