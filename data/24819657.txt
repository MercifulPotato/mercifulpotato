We&#x27;ve got 3 teenagers doing online high school or university and no issues.<p>Once in a great while I get a message from a site that says &quot;we&#x27;ve detected you&#x27;re using an adblocker&quot; but really no issues.<p>There&#x27;s no control over what is blocked or not blocked.  That worried me but has turned out to work just fine.  There are other solutions that do allow you to maintain a list but charge an annual fee.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?t=ffab&amp;q=adblocking+dns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?t=ffab&amp;q=adblocking+dns</a> shows a lot more options than there were six months ago.')
