I also assume I&#x27;m not the only one doing that, so for the restaurants, a significant part of their profit dries up.<p>They&#x27;ll have to adjust to that somehow, most likely by increasing food prices, or by cutting into the extra profit from rent differences that you have laid out. If they do exist, I&#x27;m not yet convinced.')
