The knowledge becomes irrelevant in a few years, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to pick it up by reading docs&#x2F;papers if you know the fundamentals.</i><p>Well, kind of. You teach one or two instances of such things as a case study in how to learn a framework. Usually Software Engineering courses are the best place to do this. The point is, your ML course should probably not be spending any time on things like pytorch. A sophomore level engineering course should have already taught students how to go through the process of learning a new framework.')
