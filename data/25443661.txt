So to aid collaboration mainly, but also to try out the environment - I was curious. In matlab matrices (arrays) are 1st class citizens of the language, so having them be just another set of objects with some libraries operating on them - that feels like a step back to me. Quite a few things easy in matlab, I find less-than-easy in pandas. Hope it will get better in time. I was hoping to move from matlab to julia, but noone else I know uses it. (I do quant trading)')
