The characters felt real and the world very fucked up and interesting.<p>Season 2 was good, but I didn&#x27;t understand why they kept the drug dealers plot on ice. It seemed like filler.<p>By season 3 it turned into every other TV show where characters are just tools used to express a story rather real people.<p>I stopped watching a few episodes into season 4 because I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to care.<p>I would understand the heaps of praise The Wire gets if it were limited to season 1 (maybe 2 as well), but the reset doesn&#x27;t seem that good.')
