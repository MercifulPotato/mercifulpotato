Item(by='tchaffee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604151535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24946802, text='&gt; there was a time when you could organize a conference or group or project without conjuring a set of rules governing social interactions<p>Yes there was a &quot;magical&quot; time of a couple decades like that, I remember it well!<p>No rules were needed because it was an ivory tower of almost all white men. Who far too often would act inappropriately towards the very few women who would come to a tech conference. Making the sexism problem in our industry even worse by driving women away from these events.<p>Is a code of conduct all on its own going to fix these problems? Probably not. And as we have seen in this case, they can even be misused. The important thing to me is that people are working to solve the long-existing problems of sexism and racism in our industry. And learning in the process about what works and what does not work. Making mistakes is part of the learning process in improving anything in life. If you think the tech industry and conferences don&#x27;t need to be improved, then the ivory tower worked for you. Not so much for others.<p>&gt; If people enjoy being treated and treating everyone like babies<p>The sexism and racism didn&#x27;t fix itself, did it? Clearly some people in our industry do need loads of hand holding, clearly defined rules, and consequences, in order to act like respectful adults in a social setting.')
