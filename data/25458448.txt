Can you defeat gravity by somehow energizing matter to affect its spin and acceleration? And if so, could this not only be a technology for space travel, but potentially be an explainer for something like dark matter - maybe there are parts of galaxies that are energized differently than we assume, thereby affecting their gravitational pull?<p>I&#x27;m sure this all sounds dumb, I&#x27;m not a physicist, but it&#x27;s fun to think about.')
