And it is second time in decade I&#x27;ve tried Wayland.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; why is it being marketed as a X11 replacement? Why is there a constant FUD-included push to dissmis Xorg in favor of Wayland compositors?<p>&gt; Wayland is intended as a simpler replacement for X, easier to develop and maintain. [1]<p>&quot;Intended&quot; is not &quot;ready&quot;. Could please cite your claims?<p>&gt; replacing X with Wayland<p>Would you prefer if X.Org developers just abandoned it? We would have &quot;X.Org is Abandonware&quot; ten years ago.<p>And it is not zero sum game. These are different projects. People tried to fix X and failed. No one on this thread is going to maintain X.Org. But hope is not lost â€” another project have risen to maturity in last ten years.
