I ask because I wouldn&#x27;t want new contributors, or folks considering a contribution to shy away from one after reading a comment like that. In the large projects I&#x27;m a part of maintaining, even small typo fixes are welcome (and encouraged) because as maintainers we just can&#x27;t see everything. Will people abuse small PRs to try and raise their profile? Sure. Do I believe everyone has ill intent? Not at all.<p>I really appreciate small Pull Requests that come in to fix small things - it&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t have to do as maintainer, and it lets someone take a small step towards a larger contribution.')
