If the photo they were referring to was handheld, I guess I agree. However, the subsequent photo which is the same landscape is captioned &quot;on tripod&quot; so it&#x27;s not clear if the previous one (which isn&#x27;t captioned) is handheld or not.<p>If both were shot on a tripod, then I disagree with the original statement. Any sensor will do better in low light with a longer exposure, and if phones simply let you expose for however long you wanted to then many &quot;night&quot; photos would look amazing - on a tripod, of course.')
