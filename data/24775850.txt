I found a project on Github called AppImageInstaller which will create a Gnome&#x2F;KDE integration shortcut for you and move the AppImage file to a &quot;programs&quot; directory of your choosing.<p>I usually just &quot;Open with AppImageInstaller&quot; when I download them, it pops up and asks if you want to run once or integrate. When you get a new version you can right-click the old one&#x27;s shortcut&#x2F;icon and AppImageInstaller&#x27;s integration give you a &quot;remove from system&quot; type option.<p>I use Cura as an AppImage, FreeCAD, Lens (Kubernetes &quot;IDE&quot;) Zettlr, and a few others as AppImages. It&#x27;s really clean and convenient.<p>It really upsets me when I find tools I want only have snaps, because like any sane person, I kill snapd the second I install an Ubuntu system (Laptops) and I run Manjaro on my desktop so snapd isn&#x27;t going anywhere near it.')
