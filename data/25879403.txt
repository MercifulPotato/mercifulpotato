I used to take weekend trips to Whistler and the increased travel time from charging would be much more noticeable, as the entire trip timeline is pretty tight as it is.<p>I think charging infrastructure like superchargers will have difficulty scaling up to large potions of the population owning electric vehicles. This is of course my opinion, but if there are a factor of a hundred more Teslas or equivalent on the road than there currently are, and supercharging stops regularly are 30-60 minutes, I suspect the convenience factor of supercharging may decrease substantially.')
