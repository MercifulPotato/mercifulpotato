Microsoft can emulate a stable kernel&#x27;s ABI for a long time before needing to update, so it&#x27;s not the &quot;fast paced dev&quot; of Linux. The problem that Windows simply can&#x27;t 100% emulate the behavior of all syscalls with the way NT functions. As a result, WSL1 will always be a subset of the syscalls available on WSL2. It won&#x27;t matter if they don&#x27;t keep up with new ones, however it starts to make WSL1 less useful over time.')
