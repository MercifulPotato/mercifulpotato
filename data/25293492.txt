Apparently Chang&#x27;e 5 sample module needed just 1,67 km&#x2F;s to reach lunar orbit for example.<p>Still, I think there are definitely cases where atmosphere helps (even if it causes issues elsewhere).<p>So even if you used propulsive breaking to get captured into orbit of a body with atmosphere for safety reasons, you can still capture into a very eccentric orbit &amp; then carefully use aerobraking (as demonstrated many times at Mars already) to lower and circularize your orbit before landing. And with a bit better aerosurfaces you could even use the atmosphere to tune your orbits inclination as needed.')
