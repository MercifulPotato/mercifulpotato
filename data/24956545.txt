The outer story is told in Fleming Macliesh and  Martin L. Krieger&#x27;s 1962 book <i>Fabulous Voyage</i>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;43457686-fabulous-voyage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;43457686-fabulous-voyage</a><p>Fabulous Voyage is an odyssey reconstructed from Woodes Rogers&#x27; <i>A Cruising Voyage Round The World</i> and Edward Cooke&#x27;s <i>A Voyage to the South Sea</i>, both published in London in 1712, and the writings of William Dampier published in various volumes between 1697 and 1701.<p>British privateers fund the ambitious pursuit of an elusive Spanish galleon that shuttled treasures on the high seas between Manilla and Acapulco.  The 5 year hunt is a thrilling romp in which the avarice and greed are tempered by character and guile, as an unlikely collection of men match their wits with and against each other and the unpredictable forces of the high seas.<p>Selkirk&#x27;s falling out and banishment, which lead to his exile on an island, possibly Masafuera, is but one branch of this adventure. The pursuit of the Spanish Galleon is a deeply engaging a tale which informs us as richly about late 16th century international commerce, law and social hierarchy as Defoe&#x27;s book did contemplate an individual&#x27;s propensities of introspection and character.')
