There are a lot of dogmatists out there who preach that unit tests should have &quot;X % coverage&quot; no matter what, but that&#x27;s a ridiculous claim. Different projects will require different mixes of testing strategy, and part of the engineering process is arriving at your verification and validation methods, codifying them, ensuring that they provide valid output, and making sure you&#x27;re using your time efficiently. If most of your time is spent fixing tests, re-evaluate whether those tests are worth doing that way. Your time might be better spent testing at a higher level or even manually.')
