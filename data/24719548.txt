From the way I see it, virality is an emergent phenomenon.  You cannot “make” it viral. Virality happens—except with artificial virality via ‘bots.<p>So to get back to the question I don’t think one can choose natural (uncoördinated) virality.  A celebrity takes advantage of their graph on a network but it does not ensure virality at all.  Virality is a property assigned by the ephemeral viewership as that item strikes a harmony with the mood of the network members —which isn’t predictable.  Obviously if something natural catches on, you’ll have copycats trying to replicate the effect to ride the wave of the original.  For that to work you have to weave your message to fit into the phenomenon without seeming too artificial.')
