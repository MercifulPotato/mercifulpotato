It wouldn&#x27;t be hard to imagine a universe where all consumer computers were locked-down appliances, and general computing was limited to a small number of credentialed researchers and professionals. In such a universe, similar claims would be made about the only purpose for general computing being piracy, crime, etc.<p>At any rate, while I&#x27;d prefer fully open devices, it&#x27;s also a false choice: strategies like Apple&#x27;s code signing on MacOS could allow for authenticating binaries for the purposes of detecting piracy&#x2F;malware, without requiring a monopoly on distribution.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boingboing.net&#x2F;2012&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;lockdown.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boingboing.net&#x2F;2012&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;lockdown.html</a>')
