There are extensions to Wayland that add missing functionality, but those are compositor-specific. Meaning effectively that each compositor has its own incompatible variant of the Wayland protocol. In that sense, it is not one Wayland protocol but a whole cesspool of them...<p>It will also get worse, because the architecture of wayland forces an implementer of a compositor (which replaces an X11 window manager) to implement a lot of the display functionality all over again. Wayland itself is just a lib that helps a little with it. In X11 terms, just imagine every window manager developer doing development against their own fork of X.org or a reimplementation of it. Wayland is designed in such a way that it causes incompatibility and fragmentation.')
