Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607199169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25317556, text='&gt; <i>You&#x27;ve never had a problem which was fixed by an update or something which added support for, say, a new model peripheral</i><p>For embedded devices? No. I can imagine it happening in general, but I don&#x27;t think I would ever buy into a proprietary ecosystem so hard that there would be <i>peripherals</i>, and newly released ones at that. Still I would be cautious about doing said updates, lest they ruin the device I already have. Like I&#x27;ve got a newer Marantz receiver that works great and hasn&#x27;t seen the Internet in several years. Even if they developed some new desirable feature, why would I want to let it reflash itself and possibly break, or even just get slower (software bloat)? I&#x27;d rather just continue using it as I bought it.<p>&gt; <i>there are many other things which legitimately need connectivity and there&#x27;s no good way to prevent that</i><p>I sort things into categories. A TV would be in the category of &quot;wtf would you ever hook that up online&quot; - Internet access can only enable anti-features. A Chromecast is a different category - single purpose disposable device that if it turns into shit you just throw it out. Ads and surveillance are part of its price, and if your goal is to avoid them, you should just setup a Kodi box and call it a day.<p>Legally I don&#x27;t really see what you&#x27;re getting at here. I can see a law for my TV category, but leaving it disconnected or pulling the 5G modem will also solve that. How would you even begin to solve the Chromecast problem with a law? Maybe in the EU you could convince them to mandate unbundling ads from a service, but in the US exploiting consumers by shoving ads at them is one of the most popular business models. I don&#x27;t see that ever changing via the legal system.')
