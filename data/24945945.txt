It was the release of some of the laptop&#x27;s contents that made it clear (in his mind) that Joe Biden was in fact receiving bribes from foreign governments through his son.<p>2) Given his own involvement in Sinohawk, the leap to portraying the emails as part of &quot;Russian disinformation&quot; cast a shadow over his own reputation, and he asked the Biden campaign to issue a retraction of that characterization.  I think many people naturally don&#x27;t want to be involved in controversies like this because of the personal costs, but he felt it was necessary in part to protect his own reputation.')
