[2]):<p>&gt; RESULTS<p>&gt; Fifty laparoscopic appendicectomies were performed. Median operative time was 60 min. The median total operative cost of laparoscopic appendicectomy was £906. Median equipment cost for laparoscopically completed cases was £254. Median total in-patient cost was £1617 (range, £880–£3360). This compared with a mean re-imbursement of £1981 representing a [hospital] cost benefit of £233 per case (P = 0.0009).<p>&gt; CONCLUSIONS<p>&gt; Despite a liberal use of disposable equipment, laparoscopic appendicectomy can still be performed within the confines of the national tariffs. There is a considerable variation in the cost of this procedure, and it may be possible to reduce costs by more stringent use of disposable equipment and standardising recovery protocols.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2966171&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2966171&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;society&#x2F;ng-interactive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;feb&#x2F;08&#x2F;how-much-have-i-cost-the-nhs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;society&#x2F;ng-interactive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;feb&#x2F;...</a>')
