I&#x27;m working through:<p>Edward Lee et al&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to Embedded Systems - A cyber-physical systems approach&quot;<p>Edward Lee et al&#x27;s &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Signals and Systems&quot;<p>Ricardo Sanfelice&#x27;s course at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;cyber-physical-systems-1<p>Three books that I&#x27;m considering to go deeper into modelling, verification, and simulation are Rajeev Alur&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Cyber-Physical Systems&quot;, Andre Platzer&#x27;s &quot;Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems&quot;, and Francois Cellier&#x27;s &quot;Continuous Systems Simulation&quot;. What are your opinions on these books?<p>Do you have any recommendations for other books, online courses, or other resources for going deeper into modelling, simulation, and verification of cyber-physical systems?<p>Thank you.')
