Many of Bitcoin&#x27;s flaws (energy usage, easy to lose, slow transactions) have been solved by other cryptocurrencies, many of whom aren&#x27;t even intended to be used as money, which is good because I don&#x27;t think cryptocurrency&#x27;s best application is as a form of money, at least not in the long term. For what it&#x27;s worth, I am not a right libertarian, or a fan of the gold standard either.')
