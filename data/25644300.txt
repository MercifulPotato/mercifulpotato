If you look at that protein alone, the most-likely proximal hosts are primates. If we seriously believe in zoonotic transfer, we should be looking at those populations, and understanding how orangutans and bonobos infiltrated Wuhan and transmitted the virus to unwitting humans.<p>The other recent coronavirus spillovers actually have rather low infectivity that increases with the course of the epidemic through adaptive mutations. But amazingly, with SARS2, it appeared already fully adapted.<p>The phylogenetic tree makes a clear statement about how long SARS2 has been circulating in humans. At the publication of the genome sequence there were only a handful (~4?) of mutations known and most SARS-CoV-2 genomes were, incredibly, nearly identical. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextstrain.org&#x2F;ncov&#x2F;global" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextstrain.org&#x2F;ncov&#x2F;global</a>. If we tend to see one mutation per transmission, that would mean that the spillover happened in October or November 2019, and almost certainly in Wuhan. All SARS-CoV-2 we&#x27;ve observed fits into this single tree, and there is no evidence of any previous progenitor strains. This means that SARS-CoV-2 was fully-adapted from its most-recent common ancestor. What are the odds of that happening directly from a bat?<p>We&#x27;re only now seeing, with b1117, a big phenotypic jump related to changes in the spike protein. It has arisen in a context that suggests that it may also be the result of strange environmental conditions for the virus that are capable of accelerating its exploration of the solution space. A widely-considered hypothesis is that it arose in an immunocompromised patient receiving antibody treatment and convalescent plasma, both standard practice in the UK. In this context the virus could have achieved extremely high population (~ many candidate solutions, faster evolutionary computation) and feedback about the immune response of the entire population (to the degree that they would have received multiple donations of plasma).')
