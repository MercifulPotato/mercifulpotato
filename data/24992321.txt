The blog post got me thinking as well. If by extension developers aim to please by releasing features as fast as I (the user) wants them, is the act of requesting feature a morally wrong?\nTherefore, my demanding the company (who puts pressure on the developers to churn out code) would therefore be in direct conflict with protecting the environment, as I am then the driving force behind this evil behaviour.<p>Moreover, the storage requirements continue to increase as I save more personal videos, photos, and other media content and save them to the cloud. This then produces even more data centres situated along dams, causing more local area flooding and environmental damages.<p>Of course, we know there&#x27;s no right answer to all of this. My demanding of these products and services also help hundreds of thousands (if not millions as we work up the supply chain) as it employs them in the overall IT industry. The money they get is used to pay for bills, save for children&#x27;s college funds, and more.<p>If we look at the scope of the argument within itself, it is possible that inefficient code is morally wrong. Weighing it against the factors that gave rise to that code (ie. real world), it is a byproduct of society&#x27;s demand on technology -- of which one could argue there are many more morally questionable cogs in the machine.')
