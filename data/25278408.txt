There are 9 Essential Amino Acid&#x27;s (EAA&#x27;s) that human body can&#x27;t synthesize from other amino acids.<p>A food&#x27;s biological value is determined (primarily) by it&#x27;s amino acid profile. It&#x27;s also not just about the overall amount, but also the ratio, since the way that amino acid absorption works is on a first-come-first-serve basis and so the proportion matters almost as much as composition.<p>There&#x27;s a list of common foods and their biological value on that page if you&#x27;re curious.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;When I looked in to this for myself, it seemed like it&#x27;s very unlikely for vegetarians to have protein deficiencies as long as they ate enough calories to sustain themselves and ate a decent variety of food (which they should be doing anyway, to stave off other health issues).&quot;</i><p>Ah, yeah. For the average person, it doesn&#x27;t matter. You can pretty much eat anything and be alright. The grand majority of people have god-awful diets and seem to function just fine.<p>I recreationally bodybuild so my dietary requirements are kind of an edgecase scenario.')
