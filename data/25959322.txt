Item(by='0xbadcafebee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611938938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25943393, text='I have said this before, and I&#x27;ll keep saying it: A corporation controlling an open source project is antithetical to the purpose of Open Source, which is a project designed for the collaboration of a community of users. Licensing issues are just a tiny part of the problem. Open Source is a license type and philosophy, but that license type exists solely so that users can get fixes for their bugs&#x2F;problems incorporated into upstream.<p>Corporate Open Source doesn&#x27;t give a shit about a user&#x27;s problems. The corporation only exists to further its own interests, and it uses Open Source as a tool to do so. Its sole motivation is profit, and so it is unwilling to accept the changes that users want to make if they&#x27;re not directly benefiting the corporation.<p>Community-driven Open Source is about the users. Sometimes the project leads are a little too dictatorial and micromanage the project, preventing user fixes for stupid reasons. But most of the time, if you have a useful thing to contribute or change, they will accept it, even if it doesn&#x27;t benefit them personally.<p>I think the current trend with Corporate Open Source was natural given the selfish nature of corporations. It&#x27;s only going to get worse from here. In 10 years, most Corporate &quot;Open Source&quot; projects will go one of two ways. In one, they&#x27;re donated to Corporate-aligned &quot;Foundations&quot; and all the development is done by the corporation, but &quot;management&quot; is done by some generic board [of people in corporations]. In the other, it&#x27;s just a thin API layer over a proprietary system, like kernel drivers.<p>I think the only <i>real</i> Open Source left will be the old school variety. The projects led by a random chick in her garage who just needs a tool that solves her problems. Nobody&#x27;s going to pay her for it, and she&#x27;s fine with that, because she just needs this damn code. And that will be how Open Source survives: the hobbyist who donates their work to the world, just because it&#x27;s a good thing to do.<p>The only salvation I can see in all of this is a new form of Open Source that enables corporations to safely donate their work. Note that I said <i>donate</i>. They can&#x27;t have any expectations of holding onto IP or copyright. But perhaps they can find some way to use it as a tax write-off? So the project is run by a chick in her garage, but she takes patches from corporations, or maybe even a small yearly &quot;donation&quot; just to keep managing the project. In this way you could actually have a thriving community, even if that community is made up of corporations.')
