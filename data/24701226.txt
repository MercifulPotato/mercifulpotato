I&#x27;m not &quot;laundering&quot; anything, there are multiple statements there. I didn&#x27;t get the link between &quot;someone is always happy to butt in&quot; and whether or not OP experienced racism in the Midwest, but I am speaking of the generalisation of those experiences to the whole area, which jacobriis covers in the above quote.<p>&gt; how you can&#x27;t make generalizations about anyone, when he was the one making a generalization<p>generalisation in original post:<p><pre><code>  people are friendly, as long as you look like them\n</code></pre>\ngeneralisation by jacobriis:<p><pre><code>  when people say things like this they *often* do so to feel virtuous\n</code></pre>\nunless that&#x27;s a silent &quot;often&quot;, the generalisation is qualified, versus the unqualified generalisation in the first case.<p>But it&#x27;s not just that - &quot;generalisation&quot;, or specifically &quot;bad&quot; generalisation takes a particular form, otherwise how do you distinguish it from a metaphor? The way the first characterises a specific area based on personal <i>experience</i>, versus the second which talks of &quot;people&quot; in general based on some personal <i>judgment</i> makes them different kinds of statement: the first as an <i>objective</i> account, the second an explicitly <i>subjective</i> opinion.<p>&gt; that people who say that they experienced X are making things up<p>No, he said they &quot;do so to feel virtuous themselves&quot; i.e. their motivation, they didn&#x27;t say anything about the actual truth of the statement. They did <i>not</i> say anything to suggest that they are &quot;making things up&quot;.<p>Given you just accused jacobriis of saying this, I now have to wonder about your original statement: &quot;someone is always happy to butt in to say I&#x27;m making it all up&quot; - did they specifically say that, or was that your interpretation?')
