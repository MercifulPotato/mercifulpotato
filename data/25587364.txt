That is inter-hub transports. Even more optimally we would have rail infra for this, but sadly that is not cost or space effective.<p>I don&#x27;t see humans going away for last 10 miles, that is delivery. Possible to make automatic, but there is an other layer of robots to be involved. And the environments like stores and private business in cities are much harder to design for this than hubs themselves.')
