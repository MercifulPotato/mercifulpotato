I sort of use it as a way to build up to eventually having a full blown commercial grade piece of software that I can then just pivot the domain into one I want to compete in and launch a product again. By that time it really would be a good few years working on it. Software really is a team sport. It&#x27;s crazy how much effort it is to go it alone.')
