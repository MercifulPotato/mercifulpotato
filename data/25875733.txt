Twitter that are still there.<p>1.) Twitter was not there and is not there yet. They will be there tho.<p>2.) Twitter was literally closing accounts and deleting tweets that called for violence. There was quite a lot of complaining where twitter done it in ambiguous situations. Twitter was not perfect. But twitter was definitely at least trying. Twitter would not had issue to delete clear calls for violence that Amazon would point to them for weeks - the way Parler acted.<p>The fact is, it is simply not true that twitter would be acting as parler regarding censorship of calls for violence. In fact, it is a lie.<p>Parler did not done even token pretend you are trying to effort. Twitter does much more then that.<p>3.) Parler is not little guy, they have Mercer money.')
