I was able to do this for craigslist, so I could run it every couple days and check the nearest 75 cities, the list of truck ads, filtering on&#x2F;out certain keywords, and the pages for the interesting trucks, making a report for myself to help find the vehicle I want.<p>I could not do this for any of other several large sites advertising used trucks, like commercialtrucker.com, truckpaper.com, and machinio.com. I kept bumping into artificial javascript and captcha limitations that were not worth my time to try to work around.<p>The thing is that I will probably find what I want on a craigslist site that I can scrape, I&#x27;m getting a lot of great info from them, and I&#x27;m not going to bother with any of the ad-based sites, it takes to olong to run all the manual searches. They have effectively done a disservice to their (presumably paying) customers who want to sell their vehicles.')
