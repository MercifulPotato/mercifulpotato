For instance, if an American happened to actually apply to one of these jobs, and be qualified, they allege facebook would just abandon the process.<p>But honestly, I think for the same reasons that what they did was sketchy, I find myself agreeing with it more. I think that the complaint really buries the lede because not only did they have someone in mind with these PERM positions, according to the complaint, it looks like they had someone in mind <i>who already worked for them</i>.<p>Once again, I can see why the government is mad, facebook seems to have hacked their process. But while there is an accusation of a systematic dark pattern, I don&#x27;t view it as a pattern of abuse. If the law is so spinlocked that you can&#x27;t in good faith hire your own employees at market rates since they aren&#x27;t American, I can&#x27;t really blame companies trying to take their destiny into their own hands.')
