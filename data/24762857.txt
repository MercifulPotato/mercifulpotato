A year or two ago, it was finally decided the free for all needed to end and all the developers saw their SSH root access removed.<p>My team of 5 SREs is now facing a constant backlash from developers frustrated at the rotten infrastructure, constant bugs, and impossibility to ssh into machines. We&#x27;re slowly fixing the mess, migrating to Kubernetes and things are starting to get better, but god, how painful it is.<p>So yea, in its infancy a startup&#x27;s infrastructure can&#x27;t be perfect, but every single shortcut you&#x27;re taking now, you&#x27;ll pay double down the line. Choose your path wisely.')
