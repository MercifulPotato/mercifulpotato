Usually the one from Microsoft, the vendor with specific state-of-the-art expertise in locking down the platforms on which they operate stores (xbox).<p>Apple is simply ahead of the curve here; Microsoft (and the entirety of the PC market they run on) will get there soon enough.<p>I hope you&#x27;re right and I&#x27;m totally wrong, but everything I see with regards to platform stores, DRM, and &quot;cryptographic integrity of software&quot; as it&#x27;s termed leads me to believe that in a relatively short period of time (10 years, +&#x2F;-5) basically nothing cheap and performant off the shelf will run open OSes or common software without significant difficulty.')
