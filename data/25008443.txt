The government is super flexible. There were 3k fintech p2p lending companies in last few years, because it is a new thing, the government don&#x27;t know how to regulate it. Rather than waiting for regulation, it allows companies to run, and slowly put out regulation to fix problems. There are 15 fintech p2p lending companies now. The policy does not come out just for Ant, I am sure it has been for a few months at least in preparation. Ma definitely knew this is coming, that&#x27;s why Ant is rushing to IPO now. In government, there might be people supporting relax regulation on finance industry, and people supporting more restrict regulation. Although I am sure Ant group&#x27;s business is very profit, I don&#x27;t really like how they push a credit card culture to young people. I would argue a loan is not something should be done in a few seconds, and that is not something you should be proud of.')
