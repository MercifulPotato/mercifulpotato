In the long term I chose the latter\nand now after 2 years it&#x27;s the longest time I&#x27;ve not reinstalled\nLinux, and I&#x27;ve had fewer issues than with Windows 10 and\ndistros like Ubuntu. One or two times a year it&#x27;s had problems\nbut nothing a few quick googles couldn&#x27;t fix. For development\nit&#x27;s great because I get almost all the libraries and utilities\nin the current version right from the package manager.<p>All that said when you want Free software you&#x27;ll have to make sacrifices unfortunately.')
