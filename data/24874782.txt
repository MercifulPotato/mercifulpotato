For example, 1st tone is a (usually higher) flat tone.  But it doesn&#x27;t matter what pitch you use.  2nd tone is a rising tone, but it doesn&#x27;t matter what pitch you start at or end at; it just matters that the two pitches differ enough that your listener can tell that there was a change, and that it was rising.<p>I wonder why that sort of thing <i>also</i> leads to a higher prevalence of absolute pitch.')
