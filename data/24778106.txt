The &#x27;screen door&#x27; effect is all but gone the new controllers are very comfortable and the tracking is stellar. The index is heavier than the original oculus but the way the weight is distributed and the way the strapping works makes it a non issue. My only complaint is also a problem in the &#x27;gen 1&#x27; headsets. Reflection off the fresnel lenses can cause some banded &#x27;flare&#x27;, especially noticeable when most of the screen is very dark but there is some portion of very bright light.<p>Sadly I have no experience with the &#x27;upstart&#x27; headsets from Microsoft, HP, etc.')
