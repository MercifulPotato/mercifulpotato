But multinational corp where IT is viewed as purely an annoying cost centre, <i>every</i> day is meeting day. On top of 100% project allocation (3 in parallel), which run side by side various maintenance&#x2F;troubleshooting&#x2F;support roles. On top of that any production issue takes first seat. I skip what I can, but there are limits.<p>Recently tried pair programming, it was a joke. Or I wish it was, rather a frustrating experience for both parties. Maybe one day virtual reality will take it closer to real experience, but we were far away from that.<p>I hate my work now more than ever. Meetings certainly don&#x27;t help. Kind of death by thousand cuts.')
