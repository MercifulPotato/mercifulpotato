Ever<p>That sure sounds like it is discussing the present and the future.<p>&gt; I posted the article to discuss land use and management&#x2F;urban planning of that time. Would you like to comment on that?<p>I did.  Read my first comment above.<p>Also the article literally concludes by asking the question about how the ancient text is applicable to the present:<p>&quot;How much do we alter the policies for growth of the human settlements, the basic\nprinciples are bound to remain constant so long as they address a wholesome\ndevelopment of the human kind. What do we learn from the past surely depends\non how we look at it. Kautilya Arthashastra, also commonly known as the Kuta-niti,\nhas been referred mainly for its significance in the political history of India. Hence\nthere is a common misconception that it deals only with the tricks and tactics\npertaining to the state politics. Secondly, with the changing face of politics in the\nmodern times it is seen as a great document only for all those in the field of public\nvote capturing. The few principles discussed above may seem very general but the\nway they are proposed to be implemented follows the principles for making a\ncohesive society.&quot;')
