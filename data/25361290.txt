Item(by='tunesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25362473, 25362273], score=None, time=1607535837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357669, text='I think the argument he&#x27;s knocking down is more flawed than he&#x27;s letting on - specifically, just because the extra cash makes it <i>easier</i> to make bad decisions doesn&#x27;t mean that those bad decisions will be made. The argument treats those as inexorable. If the argument had been passed through a truth checker and given a few more eyeballs, that flaw would have been obvious. That particular inner syllogism just doesn&#x27;t inexorably flow from the truth of its lemmas.<p>More generally, the &quot;flaw with first-principles analysis&quot; is generally as you&#x27;d expect. Your premises might appear true when they&#x27;re not, or your inner reasoning structure might appear valid (logical definition) when it&#x27;s not, or you might be making assumptions (in the omission of other premises) that are false. It&#x27;s just really <i>hard</i>. So that&#x27;s where a slow painstaking process of repeated review will help you. And it&#x27;s also not a panacea - first-principles analysis does not guarantee your solution, it&#x27;s more a process that helps you surface your assumptions and learn your argument.')
