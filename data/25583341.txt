Apple is one of the few companies who is remotely transparent about their supply chain. As much manufacturing as Apple does, they are bound to end up buying from some of these vendors. But unlike most of their competitors, we&#x27;ve seen Apple adjust their buying from suppliers who get caught doing this.')
