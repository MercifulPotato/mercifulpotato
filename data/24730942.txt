The whole world relies on a new gcc release not to introduce new severe bugs in good code. Mistakes need to found and fixed before the release, but not 3 years after. Then the mistake becomes incompetence. I wish I would not need to sprinkle my code with<p><pre><code>    #if defined(__GNUC__) &amp;&amp; defined(__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__) &amp;&amp; \\\n       (((__GNUC__ == 9) &amp;&amp; (__GNUC_MINOR__ &lt;= 3) || \\\n        (__GNUC__ &gt; 9)))\n</code></pre>\nAlso their arrogant attitude. Incompetence is rarely the only problem, it only gets problematic if paired with disfunctional management or arrogance.')
