Did the MacBook Air ever have a Touch Bar? It seems like this particular MBP has one mostly because they used the exact same case and keyboard and screen and webcam and ports and etc from the previous MBP. Every review I&#x27;ve seen says other than the processor, it&#x27;s exactly the same.<p>So there&#x27;s a chance that this MBP has a Touch Bar merely because the previous one had it and they did not change the case for the M1, which would mean they could still make the change whenever they come out with a new case.')
