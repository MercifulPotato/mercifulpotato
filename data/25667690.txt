Their solution is to wrap the ID in a type, which is correct, but did not continue writing that the function signatures in the backend code should be updated as well.  Something like this should close the loop in the blog:<p><pre><code>    ban(id: UserId):\n        pass\n</code></pre>\nWhere the compiler can now check that a Team.id is not being passed in the method, only a User.id can be passed into the method.')
