But this should be subject to limitations under overarching laws that regulate these companies: something that even democratic candidates campaigned on (Elizabeth Warren et. al.) and Republican candidates are warming to (Lyndsey Graham et. al.).<p>By tolerating Donald Trump&#x27;s insane tweeting for so long, only to ban him when he&#x27;s definitely a lame duck, Twitter and other such companies have lost the moral high ground: they have shown that they have cynically accepted his campaign money, enabled subversive and misleading political ads, but have decided that a tenuous link to &#x27;inciting violence&#x27; is reason enough to ban him. I&#x27;m sure the public has noticed. Public opinion will turn against these companies, and when the Republicans come back in the next midterms, they will, justifiably, have an axe to grind. We shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when they pass draconian legislation that will affect not just the giants but also the minnows.')
