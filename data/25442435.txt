This means your data always exists separate from the applications and you can do with it what you want. If you want to run a script every Monday at 3PM that sifts through your ~&#x2F;downloads folder and uploads the top 10% largest files to a server, except in January, on Easter, when when your drive is below 70% capacity, if it&#x27;s not hooked up to power, and also not if Kanye West tweeted something in all caps, you can do that. You can make it retry every 42 minutes if conditions weren&#x27;t met, email Bob and message Alice in Slack about it. You can make it machine learn your behavior and pick a window within 3 hours after sunrise, log the bandwidth usage, and have it play a tune for your friend&#x27;s MPD server on the other side of the country.<p>Why you would want to do all of this is beyond me, but odds are you want to do one of these things at some point. Then Hazel won&#x27;t be able to do it because they didn&#x27;t consider your use case, that functionality is only available in version 6 (pay up for the upgrade!), Apple didn&#x27;t provide the right API, or they recently took it away in the name of security. Surely there&#x27;s <i>another app</i> that <i>can</i> do it, but that one can&#x27;t do the other thing! Oh well, maybe the next version?<p>On Linux, you dream up the code in the language of your choice and it will work <i>forever</i>. Your learned skills will transfer one-to-one to programming you do for your job or hobby, instead of being weirdly specific and locked down to this one, overpriced app&#x27;s clickity click interface. The OSS mentality of interoperability and doing one thing well almost guarantees there are battle-tested tools available that can solve pieces of your specific puzzle, while not locking you in to their way of doing things.<p>Of course scripting is not exclusive to Linux, but it is the only OS that was and is built with it in mind.')
