It’s a mathematical fact which carries far more weight than your hand wavy generalizations.<p>The extraction has decimated US communities, empowered slave labor across the globe, and entrenched power in hedge funds.<p>Do the actual research instead of parroting cable news sound bites.<p>The same pattern happened when manufacturing was pulled from cities to rural areas 100 years ago. This time the capital was pulled from rural areas and sent overseas simply to improve profit. We can decimate the planet on any continent. We do it in Asia to externalize real costs and boost financial margins.<p>You’re talking in a pure emotional abstract.')
