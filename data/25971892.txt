I didn&#x27;t measure the SSD temperatures, but the I&#x2F;O rate didn&#x27;t drop over time. I was bottlenecked by CPU when doing small I&#x2F;O tests, I monitored the current MHz from &#x2F;proc&#x2F;cpuinfo to make sure that the CPU speeds didn&#x27;t drop lower than their nominal 3.9 GHz (and they didn&#x27;t).<p>Btw, even the DIMMs have dedicated fans and enclosure (one per 4 DIMMs) on the P620.')
