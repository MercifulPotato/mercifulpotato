Basically, it&#x27;s kind of wiki-like, except links open in place by default so you don&#x27;t lose your place jumping between pages.<p>I got it working well enough to use for the entirety of my PhD but don&#x27;t really use it anymore just because it&#x27;s still fairly clunky in certain ways.<p>I have zero time to continue working on it, but I do still kind of like the idea and would be thrilled if someone else picked it up!')
