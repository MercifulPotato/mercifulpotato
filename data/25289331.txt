After some preliminary testing I always run into the same issue: can&#x27;t create a hypertable if there&#x27;s a unique index &#x2F; primary key that doesn&#x27;t include the &#x27;time&#x27; field.<p>For example my data looks like (row_id, user_id, time, data), where row_id is a unique ID, and time is a non-unique time field. Timescale will refuse to create a hypertable like this because it causes partition issues.')
