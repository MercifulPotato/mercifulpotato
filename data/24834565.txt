A $750 million dollar loan that the people of Mt Pleasant took out for &quot;improvements&quot;. In addition to about two or three hundred million spent on things like highway construction, wastewater infrastructure, stuff like that. My own hope is that we walk away from the table. You have to know when to fold a bad hand.<p>Oh, I forgot the best part. Even though the people of Mt Pleasant <i>unilaterally</i> decided to take out the loan for 3&#x2F;4 of a billion dollars, the now former governor Scott Walker guaranteed that taxpayers from the rest of the state would pay the loan off. So Mt Pleasant got 3&#x2F;4 of a billion in what is effectively free money, because people in Green Bay and Superior are obliged to pay it back, not them.<p>We got a new governor, but he&#x27;s been prevented from unwinding the loan guarantee by the state legislature that stripped the governorship of pretty much all powers before he could take office.<p>The corruption in Wisconsin runs deep. We can&#x27;t catch a break up here. So remember, no matter how bad you think things are in Florida, or Texas, or New Jersey with respect to corruption, you could always be worse off. You could live in Wisconsin.')
