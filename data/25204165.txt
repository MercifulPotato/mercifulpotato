Item(by='creddit', descendants=None, kids=[25204824], score=None, time=1606259844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203677, text='Brew is only slightly a mess, in my experience.<p>I&#x27;ve installed brew both in the historical &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local location as well as the future home of &#x2F;opt&#x2F;homebrew. I then created these two aliases:<p><pre><code>  alias armbrew=&quot;&#x2F;opt&#x2F;homebrew&#x2F;bin&#x2F;brew&quot;\n  alias intbrew=&quot;arch -x86_64 &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin&#x2F;brew&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\nMy PATH selects for programs installed in the &#x2F;opt&#x2F;homebrew location first and then &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local. I try to install with the ARM version first with `armbrew install -s &lt;PKG&gt;` and if it fails, I move to using the `intbrew` alias as normal. I haven&#x27;t really had any issues.<p>It&#x27;s obviously still messy but not in a way that is too bad!')
