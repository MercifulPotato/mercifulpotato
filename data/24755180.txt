The FBI has been corrupted before. Whitey Bulger. Richard Hansen. Epstein. Or they can be honest, but can&#x27;t intervene because they are on the world stage and arresting a Cuban or Chinese spy running everything would start a world war.<p>It&#x27;s a lot different when your number is called, when you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s going to be shot to death by a criminal. You want everything you have and it&#x27;s nowhere near enough. It&#x27;s the opposite of what you think. Police just contain as much as they can.
