Their portfolio margin feature lets you trade with a margin maintenance rate as low as 15%.<p>If you don&#x27;t want them to sell your order flow (and offer you the industry&#x27;s best margin rates by far) IBKR Pro is your thing.<p>A lot of people like Think or Swim, Schwab, Fidelity. If you compare, you&#x27;ll see what I mean about fees though!')
