I often find it useful to have a concept of &quot;smallest representable positive number,&quot; specifically for handling edge cases such as the one I gave up-thread. I see how that doesn&#x27;t map to infinitesimal as defined in the shared link.<p>There are other instances where I&#x27;ve had a need for such a smallest positive number, where logic is simplified as opposed to checking for 0 in a special way. Whether there&#x27;s an agreed upon term for that, I know where I&#x27;ve found value in programming tasks.<p>When I need such a thing, it is almost invariably in comparisons, so I am not doing arithmetic with multiple instances of that smallest representable positive number.')
