I also saw a few early episodes as a kid, but didn&#x27;t really have a chance to get what they were trying to do; it wasn&#x27;t until years later, when I had a chance to watch the full series straight through thanks to a friend&#x27;s carefully made VHS tapes, that any of what I was seeing really made sense to me. Nothing since then has even come close to replacing B5 at the head of my SF TV affections.<p>Reflecting on that experience, I think the major flaw of B5 is that, in structure and intent, it was twenty or more years ahead of its time. Given the handicaps under which the creators then had to labor, it&#x27;s even more remarkable how much they accomplished - B5 might have been the very first example of what we today call the &#x27;binge-worthy show&#x27;, made on a shoestring in a time when syndication and time slots and missed episodes were still problems that a show could have. This show overcame them admirably - even so, I can&#x27;t help but wish a little for the chance to see what the same people could&#x27;ve accomplished today, with the kind of resources available for something like <i>Stranger Things</i>.<p>That won&#x27;t happen, of course, not least because the show is niche even by comparison with something like Firefly. For the same reason, even a Trek-style HD remaster is unlikely - a shame in its own right, since the then-revolutionary CGI space effects are by far the part of the show that&#x27;s aged most badly, and a shame all over again because the creators were looking far enough ahead to shoot in 16:9 and 5.1 surround throughout, which would give an HD remaster the kind of payoff that, if we&#x27;re being honest, the ones done for old Trek shows never really have.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s a small miracle the show got made at all, and another that it ended up being so close to what JMS intended it to be. Anyone who can enjoy TNG or DS9 today can, I think, enjoy B5 at least as well, and on that basis I recommend it without the slightest reservation.')
