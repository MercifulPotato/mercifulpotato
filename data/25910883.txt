Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25911718, 25911500, 25911408], score=None, time=1611621008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910424, text='&gt; I donâ€™t think their argument was particularly strong<p>The lower court seemed to indicate they were going to win on it before it was dismissed on procedure.<p>&gt; disenfranchising 6 million voters who voted in good faith per their individual US Constitutional right would never be a sensical remedy for an error in procedure by officials.<p>The problem is that once the election has been conducted in violation of the law, that has already happened. The total you have is inaccurate and you don&#x27;t actually know who won, so choosing anyone based on it is disenfranchising anybody who voted for someone else.<p>Now, I think at one point they were asking to just throw out all of the mail in ballots, which is ridiculous. Some kind of sensible remedy might have been to hold the election again or have the state legislature decide. But then when they started asking for that, people were calling it <i>a coup attempt</i>, as if voting for electors who then vote for President is perfectly democratic and reasonable, but voting for legislators who vote for electors who vote for President according to the constitutional procedure is some kind of seditious tyranny.<p>And what&#x27;s the alternative? State officials can violate election procedures with impunity because there is no remedy? Surely you can see how that could be abused for partisan advantage by whoever is in control of the state government.')
