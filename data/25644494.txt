The players will never be able to access the seed, therefore the best they can do is make decision based on the value of the generated random numbers they observe and their probabilities.<p>Bell inequalities are a consequence of this modelisation. They are a refurbishing of Boole&#x27;s inequalities, a theorem about probability which only bound those who use probability.<p>The usual fallacy forward is telling QM is a non-local theory, classical local theory can&#x27;t violate Bell inequalities, Bell inequalities violations are observed in the real world, therefore the world is not local...')
