This is a practice where Putin supported a number of contradictory political actors to produce &#x27;the Zone&#x27;, a condition where you couldn&#x27;t really know who was real and who was being supported by Putin and putting forth fake argument.<p>THAT, not the Cold War style micro-management, is what ended up doing the real damage, and it&#x27;s been dismayingly effective.
