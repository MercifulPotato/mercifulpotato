People are unhappy because ports were removed. I want my microSD port back, and I don&#x27;t think it will hurt you if you don&#x27;t use it. Even if you pour coffee in it, it will just fuse itself off as long as there&#x27;s a properly engineered rubber gasket in it.<p>You do bring good points about usb-c&#x2F;magsafe.
