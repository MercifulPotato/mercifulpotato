There have been breaches of data protection law (GDPR as implemented in the Data Protection Act 2018), e.g. players did not consent to data transfer, the data isn&#x27;t accurate, etc. and it&#x27;s done on a commercial basis.<p>2. These breaches were injurious to the economic prospects of the affected players and therefore damages should be awarded.<p>I would imagine that the cause of action will be the tort of negligence against whoever sold the data on, and&#x2F;or the gaming, betting, and data-processing companies. This is because they arguably had a duty of care to the players, the duty was breached, and the players suffered some harm -- based solely on the facts in this article.<p>Regarding personal compilation of statistics, that&#x27;s fine - there&#x27;s an exemption for activities of a purely personal nature in the GDPR - which is why you wouldn&#x27;t get caught, but commercial exploitation of the data falls outside of that.')
