If you put 2 identical products in the retail world and charged +42% for one of them no one would buy it.  My impression is that it’s tough to sell a much better product at higher prices.<p>The only way I can make it work in my mind is that from the users’ perspective there are no alternatives.  IE: They don’t know it’s 30% off at the store down the road.')
