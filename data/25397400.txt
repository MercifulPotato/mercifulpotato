First, since it isn&#x27;t developed the paper effectively acts extremely slowly. Whereas normal photographic paper would be around 6 or up to 20 ISO, doing it this way is almost immeasurably slow. Getting similar results without a pinhole and just something layed on top (photogenic drawing), it would take several hours in direct sun to get a decent image. The next contributing factor is that some papers &quot;print out&quot; easier than others. The hard ones will take hours in direct sunlight, while the easier ones might take &quot;only&quot; 30 minutes or so. The final factor is that pinhole is a very slow and low contrast method of exposure. Silver halide paper suffers from &quot;repricocity failure&quot; where basically during a very long exposure, the material becomes massively less sensitive. This is why film is so hard for astrophotography. A 100 ISO film over several hours can become something more like 1 ISO. Either way, the end result is that the paper gets very slow and gains a very wide exposure latitude, nearly impossible to over expose.')
