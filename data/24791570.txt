Section 230 gives civil immunity to &quot;information service providers&quot;. If someone libels you on Twitter, you can&#x27;t sue Twitter. But if Twitter starts making editorial decisions as to what is fit to publish and what isn&#x27;t, then they could lose their section 230 protections and open themselves to tons of lawsuits.')
