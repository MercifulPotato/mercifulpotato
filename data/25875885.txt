Not a scientific test but I found them to be good but nowhere near the performance per core as the intel offerings. As a comparison they are nowhere near the Apple M1 either. But that doesn’t mean they’re a bad option.<p>I think they end up close to same price&#x2F;performance as the Intel offerings as well once you invoke the compiler optimiser. The main benefit is better core scalability and lower energy usage which may work out as a net gain for database workloads.<p>As always it’s best to measure these things yourself with your expected workload.')
