Still, there&#x27;s no doubt that they handily outsold Apple II&#x27;s.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagetable.com&#x2F;?p=547" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagetable.com&#x2F;?p=547</a> (includes some neat serial number analysis)<p><pre><code>    Then why did the C64 sell 22 million units and \n    the Apple 2 only sold 5-6 million if consumers \n    had a bad impression of it.\n</code></pre>\nThis is bad-faith arguing on your part; it&#x27;s beneath HN. I clearly didn&#x27;t say they had a &quot;bad&quot; impression of it. I typed something a lot more nuanced about the <i>different</i> impression folks had regarding the two machines. Feel free to agree or disagree with the points I actually made, but there&#x27;s no need to make up words and put them into my mouth.<p>I said it was viewed as a less serious computer; more of a games machine.<p>I can think of a few reasons for this, in addition to the ones I&#x27;ve named, such as <i>being sold in literal toy stores.</i> Do you think perhaps that influenced peoples&#x27; perceptions?<p><pre><code>    And pretty much everything else. Seriously, in college, \n    everyone in engineering used TeX. I used TeX on my Amiga. \n    It produced superior output for math and engineering papers \n    compared to the best you could achieve on a Mac with WYSIWYG. \n</code></pre>\nYeah, no doubt. Again, and I&#x27;m not sure I can state this explicitly enough given your posting spree here, but I&#x27;m not disputing that the C64&#x2F;128 and particularly the Amiga were better at so many things.<p>However, the initial simplistic assertion that &quot;[Apple] made up for it <i>only</i> in superior marketing&quot; (emphasis mine) ignores quite a few other factors.')
