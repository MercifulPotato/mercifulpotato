Item(by='raziel2701', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606096309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181996, text='My understanding is that tether is printed (by Tether the company) and used to buy btc at just a couple exchanges (one is bitfinex, I forget the others) who are in on it.<p>This initial purchase drives btc-usdt up, arbitrage bots then buy btc-usd so that it matches btc-usdt. The media and people notice the price increase and jump into btc-usd because it&#x27;s going up, narratives are created to justify why the price went up (paypal, fidelity, rich investor), btc-usd further increases, and now Tether (the company) sells its btc for dollars, so that they make a profit, and also to cover whomever else wants to redeem tether for usd, thus maintaining the illusion that tether is fully backed  by dollars. Tether then decides to start the cycle again after a certain amount of time.<p>So, if the above is true then yes this is a scam and there&#x27;s gonna be a lot of bagholders if&#x2F;when tether is kaput (they are under investigation by NY AG).<p>Note, that since March 2020 Tether has printed $13 billion in tether. Is this really a result of organic growth&#x2F;demand?
