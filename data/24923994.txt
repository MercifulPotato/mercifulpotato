If you have skills and feel like you&#x27;ve hit a ceiling for advancement then shift companies - a lot of organizations have limits of how much they&#x27;ll pay technical employees that are far below the limits on management but there are organizations that would treasure your skills and compensate you appropriately.<p>I will say that it&#x27;s hard to avoid moving into leadership positions as your gain seniority - if you have issues mentoring others, estimating project and leading a discussion then your options are more limited but there are still some good opportunities out there for you especially if you&#x27;re willing to be frank about any social anxiety that contributes to those weaknesses.')
