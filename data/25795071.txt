Item(by='mikestew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610738619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794871, text='Same boat, but my iMac is from late 2019 (bought in November, IIRC). And even then it was looking likely (but not as &quot;for sure&quot; as August 2020) that something was in the works. But my 2012 MBP was looking long in the tooth, and like you I&#x27;m willing to wait a year or two for the bugs to shake out. And despite the M1 having been subsequently released, the iMac is still a good machine. :)<p>By the time this machine gets released (if ever; remember, this is &quot;Chinese are in your firmware!&quot; Bloomberg) and gets some reviews, I&#x27;ll be ready for a new machine.')
