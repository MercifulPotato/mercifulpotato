I entered the industry in the mid-90&#x27;s, so I have no reference from before that period. But I&#x27;ll cherrypick a few items:<p>&gt; Microsoft is building VSCode for the cloud. Few people own desktop computers anymore.<p>I heard the same thing in my early years about these newfangled HTML email clients. Email should be consumed using Pine or Eudora, just as God intended.<p>&gt; People job hop for promos, raises, and resume fodder, not because there&#x27;s an actual interest in the product.<p>Oh yeah. I did this for the first 15 years of my career. It was faster to get a promo by changing jobs. I didn&#x27;t care where I worked, as long as the company name had prestige. I kind of still do, but I transfer internally. Same effect, but I get to keep my vacation accrual.<p>&gt; Companies are trying to hire more outside of California<p>In my early years I worked for a company that used Russian developers for some non-critical parts because it was cheaper to fly someone out there once a quarter than it was to hire the staff in CA. This was before the massive rise of outsourcing in India. See the Dilbert cartoons about Elbonia for more.<p>&gt; The web is turning into shit.<p>Heard the same argument about MySpace. And Geocities before that. And AOL before that.')
