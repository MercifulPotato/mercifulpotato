Censorship would prevent the information from being accessible, make it illegal, come with repercussions for those who publish it, or other such things.<p>Platforms like YouTube, Google Search, Twitter, Facebook and all have a problem of amplification through algorithms that don&#x27;t promote well proven, high quality, trusted content. You could almost see these platforms themselves as a kind of censorship through obscuring and creating noise around quality information.<p>I think because of the way content is amplified on such platforms, that&#x27;s why they need policies like this, to limit the possible damage and liability they might face if they&#x27;d promote something that caused a lot of damages.<p>This is very different from someone choosing to host their own content which is equally accessible to all other content. But as soon as you rank content, as soon as you have an algorithm pick and choose content to shown you, in what order to show it to you and all that, you actually have a propaganda problem, because you become a propaganda machine, and that&#x27;s really what these platforms have become.')
