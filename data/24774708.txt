We actually almost can&#x27;t tell when we run out of oxygen, it&#x27;s why pilots are fine one second and pass out the next when they don&#x27;t notice that the oxygen runs out (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kUfF2MTnqAw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kUfF2MTnqAw</a>).<p>Hyperventilating reduces your CO2 but leaves oxygen saturation almost unaffected, which for an unexperienced person is equivalent to doing a blind walk next to a cliff, and removing the barrier.')
