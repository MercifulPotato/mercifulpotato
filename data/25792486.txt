Here, it&#x27;s still being used to mean &quot;somebody else&#x27;s servers&quot;, but in a domain that could reasonably use &quot;serverless&quot; to mean &quot;without a server&quot; instead.  Caching to a local hard drive is, almost by definition, serverless.<p>It&#x27;s a very neat application, but the terminology erks me.')
