Whenever I&#x27;ve resigned HR always required an explicit, dated letter. Your statement that they were &#x27;forced&#x27; to &#x27;accept&#x27; her resignation at &#x27;gunpoint&#x27; is all-round ludicrous.<p>If they were really &#x27;forced&#x27; to accept her resignation, what harm would informing her that they couldn&#x27;t meet her demands do? It seems painfully obvious to me they didn&#x27;t want to risk working it out and just used this as an opportunity to get rid of her.')
