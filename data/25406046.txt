Deprecation says “we don’t recommend this any more, and it’ll probably be removed in the future”.</i><p>At AWS, I was &quot;put on a pedestal&quot; for stating (in an internal forum) that <i>X</i> was deprecated (I meant it in a sense it was &quot;not recommended anymore&quot; and wasn&#x27;t updated at all)... The management thought it sent the wrong message (that is, deprecation == removal).<p>People often associate wrong meaning to deprecation (ironic in my case given Amazon is a Java shop).')
