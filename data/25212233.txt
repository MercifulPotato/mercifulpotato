But nothing happens in isolation.<p>Rails requires a lot more effort to keep a team in sync than an equivalently sized codebase in a typed language.<p>To get the same quality deployment in production we needed extensively customized linters, a broad suite of tests, and much more frequent QA review with Rails.<p>None of those are bad, but they&#x27;re a lot of effort to corral folks away from the (sometimes awesome) but usually frustrating amount of variety Ruby allows in expressiveness.  Plus you need the testing&#x2F;qa to stop a larger and larger number of bugs, particularly in cross cutting concerns, that are introduced by the lack of type checking.<p>Rails is 100% the &quot;Solo developer goes &#x27;Brrrrr!&#x27;&quot; framework. It genuinely starts to be a drag compared to the alternatives on large teams.<p>Of course you can make it work. But generally companies &quot;Make it work&quot; as they migrate to a more serious solution.<p>When I was younger, that tended to be Java&#x2F;C#, but lately seems to be more towards either Typescript if performance isn&#x27;t likely to be an issue or GoLang otherwise. Recently worked with a Rails team looking into moving to Rust, but they eventually settled on Elm instead.<p>Would still love to get information about how Sorbet is going.  Seems like it might be a viable answer at some point.')
