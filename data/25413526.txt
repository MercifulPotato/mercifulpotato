If the car didn&#x27;t look maintenance friendly then I&#x27;d let it go because I wasn&#x27;t rich enough to pay for a garage.<p>The last decade I&#x27;ve had two modern cars and I absolutely hated them. Nothing - and really, I mean it - was user serviceable. Every little thing required a trip to the nearest dealership eating up half a day or more. Anything made after 1990 or so is so locked up that the &#x27;right to repair&#x27; is mostly meaningless, yes, you have the right. But you don&#x27;t have the $200K in special tools, besides the complexity and the number of sensors make it super hard to work on these anyway.<p>There are some pretty gifted people out there for who this is not a hindrance, but your average &#x27;wrench&#x27; type of person is without a chance to work on anything but the most superficial parts of a modern vehicle.')
