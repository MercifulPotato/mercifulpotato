There&#x27;s a tendency for a superiority complex to creep in where one who takes undue pride in one&#x27;s &quot;reasoning&quot; sees only one mode of reasoning as the one true reasoning (one true value system).<p>Ancient cultures had value systems that were entirely different than ours, this doesn&#x27;t make our scientific reasoning &quot;better&quot; it makes our reasonings incommensurable until you commit to some system of <i>shared</i> values as the one true system of values (e.g. self-preservation, but there&#x27;s nothing saying that&#x27;s what humanity should value and in fact one could argue that one of the important facets of being human is the capability to reject this value).')
