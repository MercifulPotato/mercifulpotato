Item(by='woops', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610140159, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25677111, text='I agree with some of this, but out of all the things that are definitely destroying America, the mindless opinions and think pieces in the NYT are one of the least harmful.<p>&quot;Whiteness&quot; is a term I don&#x27;t use and don&#x27;t really like, but it just plain <i>was</i> white Republican activists[1] who were rioting to stop the election and intimidate representatives two days ago. The Confederate symbols, presence of neo-Nazis, and the bizarre American Viking guy gave it away.<p>I live in southern Oregon and was born in Missouri, and I don&#x27;t really understand what you&#x27;re point is, below, about these areas culturally. The best parts of the culture in Missouri were sports, music, literature, food, river life, and fireworks. The worse parts included the notorious white racism. The &quot;whiteness&quot; discourse in Missouri was already asinine well before the NYT lost its mind. My grandparents had to elope out of state because their marriage was illegal, and when they came back the scandal of what they had done was featured in about a dozen papers.<p>And Oregon is an entirely different story. For someone who lived in St. Louis and then the Bay Area most of my life, the uniformity here is astonishing. It was officially a no-blacks state by constitutional amendment. My county today is &lt; 1% black, and just got around to renaming &quot;Negro Ben Mountain&quot; in November.[2] Not having to think of yourself as white here is helped along a lot by the demographic homogeneity.<p>I think that the blame for your aunt feeling attacked for being white lies more truly on Breitbart. If you show non-liberal whites the NYT tweet&#x2F;article, and also the Breitbart piece quoting the same NYT language, my bet is that &quot;I feel attacked by the media for being white&quot; is a more common and more intense response among those who read only the latter.<p>My parents were Democrats, and I am a Democrat, but one of my brothers is a Republican. We&#x27;re both from the same place, the same upbringing, and are the same race (whatever it is). He watches Fox News personalities religiously, and categorically refuses to click on a link to the NYT. I read a local paper, the NYT, and wherever else the news comes from. I&#x27;m annoyed every day at the presentation of facts and looses writing standards, but I make my way through it. But this idea that the whites are under attack really connects with my brother in a way that it doesn&#x27;t for me -- even though I&#x27;m the one supposedly encountering the brunt of the media&#x27;s attack on white people, since I read main stream news and opinions and he doesn&#x27;t.<p>Could he simply identify as more white than I do, and so feel more attacked? It&#x27;s possible but I doubt it. I think it has more to do with this feeling of insecurity being one that the right wing media is nurturing for him.<p>[1] I mean &quot;white activists&quot; here not just in the sense that they were white people.\n[2] Renaming it for the second time. :(')
