With current platforms, the minimum requirement is an existing 3D model - this is actually quite a high barrier - 3D modelling is hard, and modelling for printing has its own requirements.<p>Makely eliminates the need to have a 3D model ready and any knowledge of suitable materials. You just need to post a description of your project and the creators on the platform will send you a quote of how much it would cost.<p>If you own a 3D printer, you can start earning by taking on projects.<p>Happy to answer any questions!<p>- Petar')
