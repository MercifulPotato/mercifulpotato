A vaccine injected subcutaneously will mostly induce an IgG response, a type of antibody present in blood and extracellular fluid. This could still possibly allow a virus to infect mucous membranes, which rely on a different type of antibody, sIgA[0], to protect them. If this is the case, you could be protected from having a serious systemic infection, but could still suffer a mild upper respiratory infection, and be infectious until the immune system mounted defense in the mucous membranes.<p>Some flu vaccines come in the form of a nasal spray, which does induce an IgA response. I don&#x27;t know why COVID vaccines are administered parenterally instead, I&#x27;m sure there are good technical reasons. Given the virus&#x27;s possible neurological involvement, maybe it&#x27;s a bad idea to deposit it so close to the olfactory bulb.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Immunoglobulin_A#Secretory_IgA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Immunoglobulin_A#Secretory_IgA</a>')
