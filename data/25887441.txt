I&#x27;m not sure why so many people are under the impression legislation will be able to keep up with perversely motivated individuals or groups. Who are these legislators with motives so pure that they will never be bribed to only look out for my interests? Let&#x27;s never forget there is only one person in jail for the 2008 crash this article is trying to convince us was the result of too little regulation. There was never enough incentive to protect us from the people who created that market crash.')
