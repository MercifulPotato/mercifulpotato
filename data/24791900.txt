This is the one falsifiable action Twitter clearly took. Twitters official policy is to not allow publication of hacked material <i>or</i> information with Personally Identifying Information - and this material was hacked <i>and</i> had unredacted personal email addresses. I haven&#x27;t seen any reasonable arguments against these policies, instead I&#x27;ve seen nebulous accusations of biased censorship.<p>Twitter is clearly okay with the discussion of these emails - no hashtags or keywords are being suppressed: it was a link to a single story that was blocked since it violated stated policy.<p>Incidentally, the NYT reports that the US intelligence community heard chatter of the GRU using hacked Burisma emails as an October surprise before the NY Post story broke (a trick so nice, they had to do it twice). I guess no one cares for facts anymore, as long as they see patterns that fit their preconceptions')
