Maybe it is because I live in Denmark where I would claim we are close to a de facto digital currency: a large group(most people under 40) use credit cards or a phone based payment solution for all purchases, use a phone based solution for settling smaller (&lt;3,000$) amounts between persons, and use online banking platforms for transferring larger amounts. We are charged negative interest rates on deposits if they total more than 50,000$. Sure underlying this we have a physical currency, but for many it is more a historical curiosity than a practical consideration in day to day life.<p>While I understand the technical differences, I cannot see why from a policy perspective the government or the central bank would be interested in a cryptocurrency like solution? Rather with the current system and Know Your Customer regulation for the banking system, they have tighter control with money transfers since they are all ultimately between bank accounts tied to named entities. I think it is more likely that we abolish physical cash than migrate to a more decentralised currency.')
