Against a Dark Background was also good although strictly not a Culture book.<p>Other sci-fi I have enjoyed which has a very different feel: Dune (amazing), The Diamond Age (also amazing), Ancillary Justice (pretty good).<p>Thanks for other recommendations!<p>Incidentally, that goodreads review you posted is self-indulgent prattling at its worst.')
