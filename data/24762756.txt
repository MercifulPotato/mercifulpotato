Before Spotify the vast majority of small bands couldn’t make a living off it either.<p>If a band outside the mainstream could live off their music, it was concerts and merch, and that was usually already only for bands at decent labels.<p>I know and love a band that exists since 1997, not even once were they even thinking about giving up their day jobs.<p>I don’t like Spotify (I usually listen to specific albums of bands I like), but I feel it’s more of a problem for the middle-class of bands, not the small ones.')
