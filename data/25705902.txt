I&#x27;m thankful for the open source work the folks at Purism have put out, but the reality of the situation is that I can drop $800 and wait a few months on a Librem, or I can drop $150 and wait a few weeks on a Pinephone. If I splurge and spend $50 more ($200), I even end up with a Pinephone with more RAM than the Librem.<p>The only real wins for the Librem are aesthetics (it&#x27;s pretty), an ever so slightly higher clock speed on the ARM64 cores, and a GPU that is historically better supported by open source software. The final point is of less and less concern every day now that Mali is seeing open source support.')
