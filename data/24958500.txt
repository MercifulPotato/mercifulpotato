It undeniably works well as a way of placing pixels precisely on a page but then so does PNG, and PNG is far simpler and compresses better for computer generated content.<p>Sadly some information I only get as PDF&#x27;s, so I have to scrape them.  Easy right?  It can be, if the PDF is structured sanely. But PDF isn&#x27;t some well defined data structure for laying out the page, it&#x27;s a Turing complete stack based computer program that can do whatever it damned well pleases.  The font tables don&#x27;t necessarily have &#x27; &#x27;=32, &#x27;A&#x27;=65, &#x27;a&#x27;=97.  Why not optimise it and get rid of all those gaps, so now &#x27; &#x27;=0, &#x27;A&#x27;=30?  And it doesn&#x27;t have to be drawn in any sane order.  It can be just a mess that makes even copy &amp; paste near impossible, and some are.<p>Did we really need to invent a DSL that has to be executed every time we wanted to view page?  I remember it being pushed as a cool solution at the time.  It doesn&#x27;t look so cool now.  SVG would be an improvement.')
