Sounds highly counterintuitive.<p>In Germany that&#x27;s the case. Up until four years ago, it was legally impossible to offer free Wi-Fi for restaurants and other venues; and they now have to track at least every legal name of customers that use their Wi-Fi in order to not be held responsible as the Wi-Fi owner.<p>Technically they would have also to track a photo&#x2F;ID of each customer if there weren&#x27;t the GDPR&#x2F;DSGVO in place that prevents that.<p>There&#x27;s also still debate whether or not you have to have passwords in place in order to be not held responsible, which means that customers would have to &quot;register a personal Wi-Fi account&quot; as it&#x27;s the case with city-provided Wi-Fi access points that are linked to your legal name and address.<p>That&#x27;s what the EuGH decided with [1] and [2], the German Bundesgerichtshof before that decided that it&#x27;s enough to track names only which led to the case being escalated to the European court by Sony Music.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dejure.org&#x2F;dienste&#x2F;vernetzung&#x2F;rechtsprechung?Gericht=EuGH&amp;Datum=15.09.2016&amp;Aktenzeichen=C-484%2F14" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dejure.org&#x2F;dienste&#x2F;vernetzung&#x2F;rechtsprechung?Gericht...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curia.europa.eu&#x2F;jcms&#x2F;upload&#x2F;docs&#x2F;application&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2016-09&#x2F;cp160099en.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curia.europa.eu&#x2F;jcms&#x2F;upload&#x2F;docs&#x2F;application&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;201...</a>')
