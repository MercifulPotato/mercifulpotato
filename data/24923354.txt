Item(by='r34', descendants=None, kids=[24923885, 24924499], score=None, time=1603914611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922309, text='I don&#x27;t think that &quot;immersive experiences&quot; are going to play huge part in our lives. The other side of &quot;immersion&quot; is escapism from the real world, which is the most complex RPG, so &quot;immersion&quot; would be rather likely to be absorbed by current economical mechanisms to deepen that escapism. Information access is so trivial even with current technologies, that it&#x27;s not something that makes anybody high (as with everything: what makes one high is acceleration, not speed, so new technologies are charming at the beginning, than they are absorbed as habits).')
