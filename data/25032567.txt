Your country has drifted so far right, every opposing voice may look like &quot;extreme left&quot;, but it&#x27;s not. Nowhere close.<p>If you want to argue about the actual extreme left, go right ahead. I&#x27;m as left-leaning as they are, but I&#x27;ll probably agree with you. There&#x27;s some idiots.<p>But the extreme left isn&#x27;t really that vocal at all in the US right now. It&#x27;s the moderate leftists trying to restore some sense of normalcy.')
