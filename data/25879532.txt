It took me a minute to realize that I was sorely mistaken and that we haven&#x27;t sent a human to the moon at ALL in my lifetime. I was taken aback.<p>All this history about Neil Armstrong and the Apollo missions and the space shuttles -- we even got to see from Cocoa Beach a shuttle launch on a family vacation. So much of it even from MY DAD&#x27;s youth, him telling us about when he got to hear the famous &quot;One small step for [a] man&quot; live from his Scout Jamboree trip. All of that, and we haven&#x27;t actually been to the moon in decades? It totally blew my mind.<p>I think before that moment, I must have assumed that it was Real Soon Now before we&#x27;d have a permanent base with people living and even being born. And to learn that we sort of gave up...<p>It&#x27;s not unlike when I was six and remembered reading about fully autonomous cars that were coming Real Soon Now, too. Thirty+ years later and that reality actually seems farther away than I had imagined despite the actual progress we&#x27;ve made.')
