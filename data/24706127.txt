Subsequent numbers are greater than the previous ones vs. subsequent numbers are lesser than the previous ones.<p>What should really matter is how you&#x27;re &quot;talking&quot; in the code. If you&#x27;ve defined some relationship as y being greater than x, then that&#x27;s how you should phrase the comparison as well: (&gt; y x). (&lt; x y) would be the same thing logically, but we don&#x27;t read logically: it requires another mental step to understand that (&gt; y x) and (&lt; x y) are equivalent. It&#x27;s avoiding those extra steps that gives code a really big readability boost.')
