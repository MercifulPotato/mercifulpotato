There&#x27;s certainly nothing in that price range that&#x27;s better.<p>And even before the M1 Macs shipped in November, Mac revenue hit an all-time high of <i>$9 billion</i> in the quarter that ended September 26, 2020 [1]. Apple often highlights that about 50% of Mac customers are new to the Mac, a trend that&#x27;s likely to accelerate.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-reports-fourth-...</a>')
