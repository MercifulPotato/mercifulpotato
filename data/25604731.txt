First of all, what they mean by &quot;leaders&quot; are management positions. However, the professional choices that lead to these are mostly based on your family background in many countries,  e.g. the connections of the parents, how much parents pressure their children into certain career paths that are more likely to lead to leadership positions, and the necessary money for expensive education. To you give you an example, one of my close friends from school is the CFO of a successful company. His father was a manager, too. He had good contacts to the media business, so when this friend of mine was studying economics his father&#x27;s contacts gave him an internship as the personal assistant of a board member of one of the worlds top five media concerns. The contacts from this internship later allowed him to get a five million Euro loan just to cover the advertising costs of a co-founded startup (which failed, btw). This friend of mine is not special in any way. He&#x27;s kind, reasonable and an overall intelligent person like many others. I really don&#x27;t think leadership positions have much to do with character traits or parenting. You can find all kinds of different people in elevated positions, from sociopaths to sensitive people with a kindred spirit.<p>As another example, if you study at Harvard in certain areas and come from a wealthy, well-connected family, then you are way more likely to end up in a leadership position in business or politics in the US than if you study at a non-Ivy League university or abroad. The same is true for Oxford in the UK, or one of the Grands Ecoles in France - and, of course, unless you&#x27;re a total failure money and special tutoring will get you into those places.')
