Mozart&#x27;s pieces are amazing, but they&#x27;re so powerful and distinctive I don&#x27;t find drawn to them over and over. Haydn&#x27;s pieces are often just as prodigious, but more modest; he calmly draws you in and paints the main themes. I find hearing Haydn a journey. Mozart is more catchy, viral, virtuosic. To me Mozart is miraculous in his operas of course, but also when he set sights on &quot;modest&quot; forms of the string and piano quartet (learning from Haydn no doubt).<p>K 458 is a good example to me:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pYTuXWxNhxo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pYTuXWxNhxo</a><p>I encourage everyone to discover Haydn as well! He had much more time to develop the techniques and depths of composition, and it shows in his later works. Mozart is good, but mature Haydn pieces... I can hardly believe it&#x27;s music I&#x27;m hearing and not a beautiful story.')
