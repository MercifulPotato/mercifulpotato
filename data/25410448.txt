We can play out the premise described by the OP, and it just doesn&#x27;t add up.<p>If some schmuck with California&#x27;s minimum $15,000 per person injury insurance disables you, what would you do? Sue them for their additional median $97,300 net worth? Which might be less than $10,000 liquidated? That is you&#x27;d expect to get, somewhere between $25,000 and $112,300, for your lifetime injury. Perfect enforcement with 100% liability legal system would get you $25,000-$112,300 in my estimate, for the rest of your life. If you&#x27;re permanently disabled, it&#x27;s peanuts.<p>It&#x27;s a shitty outcome. The problem is in part, clearly, that people are really poor.<p>And then suppose it&#x27;s a totally recoverable injury. Out of $112,300 you recover $25,000, realistically, and the driver is bankrupted. You could put a whole family on the street. It&#x27;s not Europe, they will go on the street! Is that justice? They&#x27;re all completely broke dude. They have nothing besides their car.<p>People are living paycheck to paycheck, and you&#x27;re comparing European countries where neither disability nor bankruptcy condemns you to a life of poverty. 20% of Americans claim some disability. 20% of Americans have zero or negative net worth, which is 4x the EU + UK&#x27;s 5%. You have a 1 in 5 chance of getting hit by someone in their car, and recovering a maximum of $15,000, or $0 if they&#x27;re uninsured.<p>The simplest answer is that only people who are rich enough to pay the remedies of death by vehicle accidents should drive. That can be as simple as either requiring self-insurance (i.e., you must have a net worth more comparable to death settlements, or $500k-1m), or at least an insurance that covers that kind of injury (which poor would not be able to afford). I don&#x27;t think that sounds like justice either, think how disruptive it would be if you had to be that rich to drive? It would certainly impact rich people too, because they&#x27;d be underwriting their nannies, cooks and, checking my notes, teachers, firemen, nurses, etc. to get to work.<p>It&#x27;s pretty crazy too, the degree of wrong in the comments to this. At least bring some facts to this discussion. People are just trying to survive, of course they are going to go with the cheapest possible lowest coverage insurance. On top of that, &quot;about 15% of California drivers have no insurance, according to the Insurance Research Council.&quot; (1) Like what do you think those people with negative net worth (20% of Americans) are doing? Buying $2,000&#x2F;yr auto insurance policies? It boggles the mind.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;advisor&#x2F;car-insurance&#x2F;state&#x2F;california&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;advisor&#x2F;car-insurance&#x2F;state&#x2F;californi...</a>')
