The rest was just sitting in the office. And I&#x27;ve had jobs that legit took 40 hours of head-down working (with no horsing around slack time) to barely keep my performance acceptable. I can tell you the &quot;needs 40 hours&quot; jobs did not pay 4x the &quot;needs 10 hours&quot; jobs. It would be tempting to take multiple low expectations jobs if it were allowed by all the jobs&#x27; employment agreements.')
