The bad apples in the military officer corps get removed very quickly, I bet your example will be court martialed and ejected with dishonorable discharge by springtime. If I had been his CO, I&#x27;d have him on literal bread and water on his way to federal prison for life for his acts, and most officers I know would do the same; the rest would probably want to shoot him.')
