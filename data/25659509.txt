Of course, it is an essential skill for them to have, but that&#x27;s something for a school exam and not job interview for someone with verifiable credentials. Or do you think that surgeon didn&#x27;t suture in their previous job and just &quot;winged it through&quot; for years?<p>Yes, absolutely, I think that some surgeons can be less skilled at suturing after years of experience, and it&#x27;d be wise to have them demonstrate these skills in an objective way during a job interview rather than relying on credentials. eg:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S1878875015006300" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S187887501...</a><p>&gt; Most methods currently used to assess surgical skill are rather subjective or not adequate for microneurosurgery. Objective and quantitative microneurosurgical skill assessment systems that are capable of accurate measurements are necessary for the further development of microneurosurgery.<p>and<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;well.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;a-vital-measure-your-surgeons-skill&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;well.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;10&#x2F;31&#x2F;a-vital-measure-yo...</a><p>&gt; To the researchers’ surprise, there were huge variations in operative skill between the practicing surgeons, with the lowest ranked surgeons working at what the reviewers considered a level only slightly better than a trainee at the end of residency, and the highest-ranking surgeons working like “masters” in their field.<p>Software engineer interviews are absolutely imperfect, but I don&#x27;t think other professions have this figured out either.')
