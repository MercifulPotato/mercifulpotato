Most of the vets in Europe wouldn&#x27;t suggest neutering, only if it&#x27;s a medical necessity or the dog&#x27;s being overly aggressive. And if you really need to, wait until he&#x27;s grown up.<p>Our dog is a rescue and was neutered at a very young age before he came to us. His development was rather delayed and he&#x27;s definitely behind. I really can&#x27;t imagine doing this just because it makes your life &quot;easier&quot;. I would never do it without a good reason.')
