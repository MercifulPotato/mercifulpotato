So tell me, what companies are you excited about and why? Who&#x27;s actually making a positive difference and changing the world for good these days?<p>* Non-profits count too.<p>* Yes there are some exceptions (e.g. Apple&#x27;s M1 chip; Google&#x27;s Go language continues to get better) but on the whole these advances seem minor considering the companies&#x27; nearly infinite size and resources.')
