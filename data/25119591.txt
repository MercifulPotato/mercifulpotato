(In fact we just went from one disaster to another here, the second being C19).<p>This is just the beginning. It will get far worse and then worse again, thanks to people denying it and saying we might think about maybe reducing our emissions gradually next decade sometime..<p>In South Australia they&#x27;re talking about taxing EVs because they don&#x27;t get to tax their owners by way of the fuel excise. There&#x27;s zero regard for pollution, it doesn&#x27;t even have a monetary value - high polluters aren&#x27;t taxed at all, so they&#x27;re taxing the solution not the pollution instead. (Contrast Norway).<p>This is why I said it&#x27;s going to get far far worse. There&#x27;s so many thick skins to get through, blocking and impeding what <i>needed</i> to be immediate action decades ago and still isn&#x27;t.')
