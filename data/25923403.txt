The WSB today is a fascinating read, kind of a small window into that mind. One thing when crowd decides to virtually character&#x2F;twitter assassinate somebody, and another when they intentionally impact several $B losses to hedge funds (classic asymmetry - a bee can lose all its money, few grands, etc. and the loss of a number of bees wouldn&#x27;t really affect the power of the hive while the single loss of a few $B can be a mortal wound to the bear). A power just a couple steps below say changing a government. No wonder that the best minds in tech are working on harnessing that power.')
