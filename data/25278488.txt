Mobile phone batteries at sub-zero temperatures lose voltage, and as a result can incorrectly think they have depleted the battery. If cold enough, they will shut down completely. Observing that the same phone, when under certain conditions of high load, can exhibit significant increases in overall temperature; could there be a net positive in terms of usable time, by intentionally ladening a sub-zero degree phone with redundant tasks, with the intention to create sufficiently distributed heat in the phone housing, and therefore warm the battery to the point it performs nominally, resulting in a net positive in terms of being able to use the phone for a longer time - or in extreme cases - at all?')
