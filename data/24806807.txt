The book grew out of a philosophy course at Stanford that devoted a semester to working through the implications of lying.  Since taking that course at Stanford, Harris admits to only telling one lie since, an odd situation that otherwise would have endangered his young child.  For example, his friends always know that if he gives an opinion, it is real and not told to make them feel better, which leads to rather deeper interpersonal interactions.<p>It is not at all clear why a sociopath would be better at detecting lying.  Is this a skill that can be transferred?  How can the absence of emotion better detect an emotional act (lying)?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Lying-Sam-Harris&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1940051002" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Lying-Sam-Harris&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1940051002</a>')
