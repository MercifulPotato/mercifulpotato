The dev team is just working on the bits of code they think need it, cleanup, test case, formatting, all those little things - that have no direct customer facing value.<p>And then we do a Feature Friday so folks can work on the fun new stuff (of their choice).  It&#x27;s all company project related tho - sometimes loosely - we don&#x27;t yet have a business case for AR&#x2F;VR or using templates on a Remarkable 2 - but maybe - and they are used to spread knowledge around the team')
