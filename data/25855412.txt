Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611203456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25850837, text='&gt; How about this argument. Say I have a restaurant. Typically that means there is some landlord, and I pay them utilities and rent in exchange for using the space. Now some guitar-strumming, crooning ape wants to perform in the same space. If he and I are to be considered part of the same organization, we are on the same level of the &quot;org chart&quot;. We are sharing the space and doing our thing. Why would I pay him anything? He should pay part of the rent and utilities. Or, why not the other way around?<p>Owners are allowed to do a lot of things that would be considered exploitative in an employment relationship: they can work excessive hours, below minimum wage, etc.. If they&#x27;re a genuine owner getting their share of the upside, it&#x27;s fair enough.<p>&gt; Now if I give the hot dogs and sandwiches for free, so that many more people come, and those people pay to get into this music venue, then there is a case that I&#x27;m increasing the business, and doing it out of my pocket. Still, that is my problem; I shouldn&#x27;t be doing such a thing. Maybe I know what I&#x27;m doing! Or maybe I&#x27;m trying out new product to see how people like it or whatever (market research).<p>You&#x27;re not allowed to do form relationships that are indistinguishable from illegally-exploitative employment, for the same reason you&#x27;re not allowed to run the shell game even if you do it 100% honestly. You&#x27;ll find a lot of similar rules around charities that don&#x27;t make sense on the surface, but are the only way to have a regulatory regime that protects people: you&#x27;re not allowed to volunteer for or donate to the same organisation you work for, volunteers aren&#x27;t allowed to be paid, volunteers can&#x27;t do the exact same activities that they do for the charity but for a non-charity business...')
