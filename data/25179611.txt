Sometimes when the public is ripe and there&#x27;s no current work of art to match the public, you can see old movies, books and music that went mostly unnoticed for years suddenly become popular.<p>So, it&#x27;s not like movies&#x2F;books&#x2F;music push public opinion but they can become icons of an idea. A materialisation of a thought that people were trying to put into words but they couldn&#x27;t until they read a book, watch a movie, listen to music.<p>Sometimes the creators of the art hate it when their work becomes an icon of something they do not support.')
