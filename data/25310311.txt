The problem space does not fit into either of those so cleanly.<p>Yes, you can turn a molecule into a graph, and there are graph ml techniques, but how that interacts with a protein also does not have a lot of source data (real or synthetic) nor is the interaction space obviously reducible into a differentiable form.  Either would be sufficient for today&#x27;s breed of ML to excel at this.')
