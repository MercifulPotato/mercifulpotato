It&#x27;s not only a shrewd business decision but it is also good for anyone watching the platform. Censorship is even done to comply with the law, as is the case with child pornography. Censorship is not the inherently bad thing you make it out to be. By saying the word &quot;censorship&quot; as if it&#x27;s synonymous with &quot;bad&quot; you are piggybacking off the idea that our legal rights are being violated, as if someone is experiencing a tremendous loss because they can&#x27;t post their specific brand of hate speech on a popular website.
