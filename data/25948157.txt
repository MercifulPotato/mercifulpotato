Item(by='backzerman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611864021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25944174, text='&gt; The customers are the businesses on the other end, in Robinhood&#x27;s case the market makers who are paying for the right to front-run trades.<p>Front-running is super illegal. You&#x27;re referring to payment for order flow (PFOF), in which a sell-side party like Citadel pays Robinhood for the right to route your order to the exchange. But there&#x27;s a catch: Citadel is allowed to take the other side of your trade without routing it to an exchange, but it legally has to match the exchange price or cut you a discount. If Citadel can&#x27;t do either, your order MUST be routed to an exchange.<p>PFOF makes up a somewhat negligible source of revenue for no-fee&#x2F;discount brokerages. The bulk of revenue comes from a much more mundane source: interest rate spreads. Earn X% interest on customer cash deposits while providing customers less than X% interest on their deposits.<p>If your order isn&#x27;t making its way to an exchange, PFOF isn&#x27;t your problem, and you shouldn&#x27;t be day trading. Your real problem is that the professionals think you over-bid&#x2F;under-asked to such an extent that they&#x27;re willing to cut you a deal just to take the other side of your trade. Unless you&#x27;re a professional options trader, betting against professional market makers will cost you a lot more money than the imaginary transaction costs would have.<p>(This is just a summary of an old HN favorite: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;6&#x2F;26&#x2F;how-brokerages-make-money&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;6&#x2F;26&#x2F;how-brokerages-make-mone...</a>)')
