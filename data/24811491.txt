And I don&#x27;t mean that as an insult - I mean that when confronted with that they&#x27;re clearly irrational. And something&#x27;s gotta be going on their heads that makes them cling to this hypothesis.<p>This thinking is dangerous. You open the doors to labelling every opinion that isn&#x27;t considered rational or part of the status quo to be a product of mental illness.<p>e.g I find those AI generated pictures of people that look like real photos to be mildly disturbing. It is clearly irrational, however I don&#x27;t think people could claim I am mentally ill because of it.<p>Currently there is a push to make racism a mental illness. I see no evidence of that at all. I&#x27;ve spoken to some people that have gone on the &quot;Iron March&quot; and they aren&#x27;t mentally ill (tbh they are just losers IMO but they are pretty harmless as most of them are NEETs living with their parents).')
