It seems like it depends on what you mean by &quot;implies.&quot;<p>E.g., you could have A -&gt; B, <i>and</i> A -&gt; C, and B != C. Then C is not B, but implies A just as much as B might (in the very least it doesn&#x27;t imply not A per se, as A might be true). It seems like there&#x27;s some implicit assumptions going on.')
