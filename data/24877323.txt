Both checksums had to match or the file was rejected.<p>It seems obvious that that&#x27;s at least as strong as using sha1 by itself. I&#x27;ve always assumed it was significantly stronger than sha1 by itself, but you&#x27;re saying it isn&#x27;t.<p>Creating an md5 collision isn&#x27;t terribly difficult these days, but I&#x27;ve never heard of an md5 collision that&#x27;s also a sha1 collision.<p>Can you cite a source with more information on this?<p>(I&#x27;m not doubting what you say, I&#x27;d just like more information.)')
