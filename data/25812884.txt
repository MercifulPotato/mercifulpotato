To wit: there is no time or culture in the history of the world where humans have <i>not</i> been in contact with some kind of &quot;otherworldly&quot; intelligence.<p>Personally, (not that anyone asked) I think we&#x27;re in quarantine.  I think that most intelligent species rapidly reach a peaceful &quot;win-win&quot; equilibrium, that we humans are rare or even unique in our violence, that this is because of some specific but forgotten event (maybe the Younger Dryas, I don&#x27;t know) that traumatized us and triggered the development of agriculture and cities, that those are degenerate forms of civilization that perpetrate the trauma that leads to our current malfunctions, and that we are essentially in a hospice-type situation <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the little green men.<p>So, um, there?  Have a nice day y&#x27;all.')
