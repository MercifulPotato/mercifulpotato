And much nicer&#x2F;simpler. It does that by creating a shared inbox. And it creates an entire workflow around that. Even though it&#x27;s a shared inbox...who gets what.<p>It basically makes your support@ address better. I&#x27;m super unsure on why it&#x27;s even being called as &quot;slackifying email&quot;, because that&#x27;s not what it does. I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;ephemeral conversation&quot; means...but Front treats a support email as a ticket. So your internal teams can comment on an email and discuss what action to take,etc.')
