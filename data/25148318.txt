One thing I am wondering is, do you offer some sort of simple status panel where I can see the amount of data transfer that I have used for the month?<p>Also, another thing. I might want to use this service for storing copies of important data that I download from the net. But rather than first downloading it to my own computer and then sending it to your servers, does the account on your servers have a shell so that I can run for example wget directly on the server and is it able to connect to arbitrary remote IP or only to whitelisted IP addresses?<p>Also, your page lists IPv4 but not IPv6. Any word on IPv6?')
