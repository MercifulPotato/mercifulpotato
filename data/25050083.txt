By comparison here the 2060 Max Q is around 4x faster than the Vega 8 in the 4800U.<p>Although that 2x faster than anyone else&#x27;s integrated also has some really big question marks on the claim. The fine-print on that claim includes:<p>&quot;Integrated GPU is defined as a GPU located on a monolithic silicon die along with a CPU and memory controller, behind a unified memory subsystem&quot;<p>Which sounds a bit weasel-y like it&#x27;s trying to specifically exclude what&#x27;s commonly thought of as integrated graphics like the two-die approach in Tigerlake. Which how the product is packaged shouldn&#x27;t really matter?')
