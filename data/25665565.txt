I&#x27;m not waiting until the tables turn from bad to worse to be horrified. I&#x27;m horrified now. Sure, I&#x27;d be horrified even if people I generally agreed with were the ones censoring. It&#x27;s might-is-right level stuff.<p>Twitter&#x27;s censorship is just one aspect of the issue. Talented philosophers, scientists, etc. are being excluded from mainstream society (forced out of their education, employment, etc.) for having the wrong opinions. Many of the smartest people I know exist almost entirely outside of established institutions. Not a good situation. Very sad that people have so much respect for those in power.')
