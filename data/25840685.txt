Could this be the next distributed manufacturing revolution? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</i><p>&gt; <i>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</i><p>... We&#x27;re not there in time for COVID19, but technologically, I think we&#x27;re less far away than this article presumes. Cost of both sequencing and synthesis has been dropping like a rock, albeit not very smoothly. I can get DNA synthesized for less than what I was paying for amateur PCBs as an undergrad.<p>A lot of the other complexity, I suspect, is specific to getting this out in &lt;1 year. It&#x27;s worth remembering the earliest vaccines took no technology beyond what I have in my garage. With a little more time and patience, I&#x27;m sure some of the other complexity will go down.
