Here&#x27;s an example of some of them working in harmony to maintain an essential electrochemical gradient across the lipid bilayer that encapsulates the mitochondria:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LQmTKxI4Wn4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LQmTKxI4Wn4</a><p>It&#x27;s a 7  minute video, if you only have a little time, skip around, but make sure you listen to the part starting at 6:17.<p>DNA isn&#x27;t just the blueprint for the machine or the blueprint for the factory that makes the machine, it&#x27;s the blueprint for the entire supply chain required to build and operate an entire chemical industry of mind-bending complexity.  Like doubling grains of rice on each square of a checkerboard, if you wanted to create a complete catalog of all possible combinations of a string of DNA that&#x27;s 150 base pairs long, you would have to marshal all of the estimated matter in the observable universe and you&#x27;d still end up short.  Most of the genes that create these proteins are tens of thousands of base pairs in length and the entire human genome is ~3 billion.')
