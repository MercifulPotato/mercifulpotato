Though I guess many people do; back in the day, I think AMD cpus were on par with intel CPU’s running 200MHZ faster. But all people saw was AMD 1.7Ghz and intel 1.9Ghz. The result, the AMD chips at 1.7Ghz were called Athlon 1900. Which is the same thing as the equivalent feature length for FinFet.\nThe people in the know should actively be discouraging reliance on single dimension (frankly misleading) terms.')
