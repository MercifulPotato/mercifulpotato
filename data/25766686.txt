I have no idea if this could fit into your roadmap (and this is probably the kind of feature request you should absolutely say no to) but my partner and I made a thing called TagTime that does time-tracking via random sampling (pinging you at random times) and I&#x27;m offering the domain tagtime.com to whoever subsumes the janky Perl-scripts-plus-Vim version we use and makes a proper TagTime-in-the-cloud. There&#x27;s a pretty decent community of users to tap into but, again, it would probably entail a substantial pivot.')
