There is no mention of any concrete team&#x2F;company size where issues do&#x2F;might occur in one or the other setup. There is no mention of successful or failing companies adopting one or the other setup.<p>And just to mention a single concrete counter-example to the groundless side taken here, take Apple. Apple&#x27;s organization is _based_ on specialization, for the simple reason that the more specialized teams are, the higher their expertise is. Look at Spotify, Microsoft, and others; they moved away from the simplistic feature-squad model advocated here, because it simply didn&#x27;t scale.<p>Certainly, communication across team members, and communication across teams are subjects of attention. It does not mean it should be ignored&#x2F;avoided. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;scaling horizontally is too difficult, just stick to scaling vertically&quot;; sure, it&#x27;s easier, but the power is not the same.')
