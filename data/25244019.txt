East Asians face a lot of racism when they move to Europe &#x2F; America. Racial slurs, distrust from authorities, unwillingness to rent premises etc. No doubt about that, I was a kid in the early 90s and Vietnamese in Czechoslovakia were obvious targets, unfortunately. You could see it on a daily basis back then.<p>But that does not prevent them from growing very rich and successful. The so-called &quot;systemic racism&quot; somehow fails to prevent them from reaching elite status in large numbers.')
