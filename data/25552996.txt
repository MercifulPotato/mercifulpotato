Never assumed you were American.<p>Of the provided links [1], [2] and [3], two of them show Honk Kong, Japan, Macau, Singapore and South Korea in the top 10. Europe gets 3 with Israel and Australia rounding out the 10. You&#x27;re not incorrect by saying * <i>some</i> * but with Asian countries outnumbering European, lol at how wrong I am.<p>Your condescending tone is merely a eurocentric insecurity of the decline in your population. With birth rates plummeting, centuries, if not decades, from now, Europe won&#x27;t be as white, as homogenous as it is (or was) so I understand your response of lashing out instead of accepting Asian countries might lead in anything of consequence.<p>I&#x27;ll concede that what I meant by continent, I was actually referring to (specific) Asian countries, not the continent as a whole. Due to lifestyle and diet, Asian countries are more homogenous than other continents hence my lumping them together.<p>&gt; Not interested in anecdata or hocus pocus.<p>Meat loving countries have higher obesity rates thus poorer health outcomes. No hocus pocus re: this observation. For someone not interested in anecdata, you miserably failed to do a simple query: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;start.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=life+expectancy+by+continent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;start.duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=life+expectancy+by+continent</a><p>&gt; See, the difference between you and me is that I don&#x27;t care what you choose to eat. Meanwhile, you feel the need to shame and lie and impose your preferences on others. It&#x27;s why &quot;annoying vegetarian&quot; is a meme.<p>Neither do I. I&#x27;m shaming Americans and any person who thinks it&#x27;s okay to eat meat without acknowledging the consequences it has on our environment. Basically what I take issue with is how your diet affects climate change which affects all of us!<p>PS: I eat meat regularly. I could quit given the need to but don&#x27;t see myself consuming &#x27;meat&#x27; grown artificially.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;270861&#x2F;life-expectancy-by-continent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;270861&#x2F;life-expectancy-b...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;demographics&#x2F;life-expectancy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;demographics&#x2F;life-expectancy&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_life_expe...</a>')
