Having done both Linux and mobile development, I don&#x27;t believe that the entirety of the answer is going to be &#x27;just throw a more powerful SoC in the device&#x27;.  Sure, that will help to a degree in some areas but there is a lot of work that has been put into iOS and Android to achieve a balance between battery life and performance that most developers who have only worked in&#x2F;on Linux haven&#x27;t appreciated.  Which is understandable since it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;their&#x27; problem... now with the Pinephone&#x2F;Librem 5, it is.<p>Something I have found worthwhile has been listening to the UBports podcast over the last 6 months or so.  They really do seem to be &#x27;getting it&#x27; faster than most re: what&#x27;s left to be done.  That&#x27;s partly because they&#x27;re in the rather unique position of coming from a place of having the Android kernel (which isn&#x27;t just a vanilla Linux kernel) do a lot of things for them (i.e. UBports on Android phones) and now that they&#x27;re running on bare metal (i.e. UBports on Pinephone) with (mostly) the same code base they are able to see &#x27;oh, yeah... the kernel and&#x2F;or apps need to be able to do Y&#x27; in order to replicate the functionality they get on Android phones.')
