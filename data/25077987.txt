At no point was I told that I would later be charged extra for doing so. On the contrary, I was later told that my account was &quot;upgraded&quot; to Billing for free.<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m sorry that it feels that way.</i><p>It&#x27;s not just that it <i>feels</i> this way. It <i>is</i> this way. I&#x27;m still on the Subscriptions API and haven&#x27;t seen anything in Billing compelling enough to rewrite my code to implement.<p>I&#x27;m not saying any other payment processor is better. They may not be. It&#x27;s just that while I <i>deeply</i> respect some of your broader ethical stands, this kind of behavior is dismaying.')
