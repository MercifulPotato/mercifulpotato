I think you should probably note that this isn&#x27;t just DataFrames.jl but also in conjunction with Queryverse tools. the reason is because it&#x27;s somewhat known that the Queryverse tools are very nice to use but not as performant as other parts of the Julia programming language (performance is a result of the language and how it&#x27;s used). For example, the Parquet to DataFrame conversion that you&#x27;re using has known performance issues: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;queryverse&#x2F;ParquetFiles.jl&#x2F;issues&#x2F;32" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;queryverse&#x2F;ParquetFiles.jl&#x2F;issues&#x2F;32</a><p>In general, very nice benchmark contribution and thanks for helping showcase the performance landscape.')
