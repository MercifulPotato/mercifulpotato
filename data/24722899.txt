Hopefully Purism can build on their recognition to funnel resources toward FOSS-mobile applications because this will help us all.<p>This reminds me of something else. What would be the best model for a FOSS &quot;app store&quot; with mechanisms for compensation? Lowering the barrier for transactions to FOSS projects really helps their survival and sustenance by individuals who cannot contribute code.<p>Here&#x27;s a very half-baked thought: One can imagine users supporting community servers (matrix, activitypub&#x2F;mastodon, etc.) and applications through a cryptocurrency wallet that is loaded in the same way that people load their g--gle&#x2F;a--le wallets. One can also imagine applications that can tie into this wallet to compensate publishers based on some model (a transaction API like g--gle&#x2F;a--le or something like what brave is doing with the BAT). My question is what are the failure modes of such a model?<p>For example, this still wouldn&#x27;t stop the perverse incentives of:<p>- Content publishers going for the types of bait that generate the most clicks. Clicks=compensation regardless of it&#x27;s from ads or some sort of attention token.<p>- Application developers casing addiction mechanisms that go after whales. The same loot-box mechanisms can be implemented with a FOSS game that uses a crypto wallet API.')
