Or you could have 1 choice do +10 to corpo.<p>Then at the end, whichever had the highest score would be your ending.  Or you could do if highest was 10-30 points, you&#x27;d get 1 ending, but if your highest was 40+ youd get super ending. Like if you were mostly corpo, but still a bit others, maybe you become middle management in final cinematic at corpo X, but if you were like ALL IN on corpo choices, maybe you&#x27;d become new president of some corpo Y.<p>That way every choice matters, and you can still have a few different endings.  And the &#x27;vanilla basic ending&#x27; being where you are choices were mostly neutral, or what they guessed majority of playerbase would choose.<p>But what OP was saying, is that 98% of questions have 0 impact on anything.  Which makes them not impactful and not matter at all, and that often is boring.')
