Item(by='athms', descendants=None, kids=[25368982], score=None, time=1607555134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25365635, text='From Kristof&#x27;s article:<p>&gt;Its site is infested with rape videos.<p>Not illegal in the US. In fact, there is plenty of consensual porn made to look like women are being assaulted or coaxed into sex.<p>&gt; came across many videos on Pornhub that were recordings of assaults on unconscious women and girls. The rapists would open the eyelids of the victims and touch their eyeballs to show that they were nonresponsive.<p>If I come upon an adult being assaulted, including sexually, and recorded the incident, this is perfectly legal in the US.  That said, there is consensual porn that falls into this category, made by professional outfits.<p>&gt;It monetizes child rapes, revenge pornography, spy cam videos of women showering, racist and misogynist content, and footage of women being asphyxiated in plastic bags.<p>It monetizes all content, even illegal content which hasn&#x27;t been reviewed or reported.  This is how it works for all sites that allow user generated content, including YouTube.<p>Racist and misogynist content isn&#x27;t illegal in the US.<p>There are plenty of BDSM videos including footage of women being asphyxiated in plastic bags.  You can find men and women with hot wax being poured on their genitalia or needles piercing their genitalia.  You can find golden showers and scat too.  None of that content is illegal in the US.<p>&gt;Unlike YouTube, Pornhub allows these videos to be downloaded directly from its website.<p>Really?  We all know this isn&#x27;t true because of youtube-dl.  Restricting downloads will not work for the determined.  If the browser can see it, it can be downloaded.<p>&gt;A search for “girls under18” (no space) or “14yo” leads in each case to more than 100,000 videos. Most aren’t of children being assaulted, but too many are.<p>By the author&#x27;s own admission, most of the results were not true.  Of those that have illegal content, report it.  There is only so much a site can do to weed out illegal user generated content.  PornHub doesn’t encourage illegal content or turns a blind eye to it.  The company uses many of the automated tools that Microsoft and Google developed for fingerprinting pictures and videos of child pornography.<p>&gt;Depictions of child abuse also appear on mainstream sites like Twitter, Reddit and Facebook.<p>You can find videos of adults beating children with all manner of household items. You can find videos of vehicles  running over people with their twisted, mangled bodies laying in the street. You can find killings of rival gangs in Mexico and Brazil, or state executions in Iran and Iraq. None of this stuff is illegal in the US.<p>It would be nice if the author focused on the illegal content, rather than the stuff he finds distasteful.')
