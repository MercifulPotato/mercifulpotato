If that&#x27;s not acceptable to the officer...well, too bad.<p>(Though, the hilarity of it is, I am in a position where I can even <i>say</i> no to an officer and the officer will likely respect it.  I &quot;look like&quot; I have the resources to push back on police abuse, so police are less likely to abuse me.  If I didn&#x27;t look like that, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even have the chance to say no, at least not without a lot of pressure.)')
