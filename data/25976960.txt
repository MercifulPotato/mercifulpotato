In a just society some ought to be better off than others.<p>I&#x27;m disinterested in &quot;global&quot; anything, and also any redistributionist nonsense. I don&#x27;t care how much wealth Bill Gates has and I don&#x27;t want any of it; I care how to live given my own circumstances.<p>Maybe I don&#x27;t even want to be &quot;wealthy&quot; or &quot;average wealthy&quot;. In any case, I reject any attempt by some self-appointed redistributionist busybodies to act on my behalf and steal from others.')
