It&#x27;d simply separate the frontend from the backend. They could still provide their own clients and people who love the Apple brand and trust them can use them, I wouldn&#x27;t even object to them shipping as the default experience on their phones. (something windows got punished for heavily when they bundled browsers, but think about how much less serious that was compared to the restrictions on phones)<p>All it&#x27;d do is offer up an alternative of stores or apps to interface with Apple for people who want it. For example have a chat app that seemingly bridges Android services and iMessage.')
