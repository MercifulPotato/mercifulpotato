I’ve been prepping while working full time for 6 months. I was really quite bad at doing the problems initially and now can pretty much knock out most problems without too much trouble. Planning to start interviewing in a month or two.<p>IMO comparing against yourself  over time would be more productive. I say that cause it would definitely stress me out personally if I knew I was in the 10th percentile or whatever. And then that negative attitude could snowball into stopping practice.<p>If you do want an objective measure for FAANG I think Facebook recommends being able to complete 2 Medium level LC problems in 35 minutes. But again, it’s real hard to mimic the real interview environment of explaining yourself, being able to ask questions, etc. I did find mock interviews helpful early on to refine my process before just grinding problems.')
