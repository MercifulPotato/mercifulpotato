Item(by='outworlder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603324687, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24841402, text='&gt; AWS has probably millions of physical servers by now (they had ca. 1,4 million servers by December 2014 it seems) each with probably hundreds of services each needing an IP.<p>Why would any significant fraction of these servers require public IPs? And services for that matter.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if most of them are in private VPCs with only very few endpoints exposed.<p>If you are referring specifically to AWS, having servers in public subnets is actually an anti-pattern. You may want to do so with bastion hosts and a handful of more specialized services. For everything else, put them behind a load balancer. A single NLB will take one IP per availability zone and will be able to service hundreds of servers, if not more.<p>Then you have things like Cloudfront and the like.<p>Not many IPs are needed, overall, compared to the number of actual servers.')
