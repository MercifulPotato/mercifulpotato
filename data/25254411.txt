It doesn&#x27;t fully implement _all_ of Play Services&#x27; APIs.<p>The point of MicroG is to make Android usable without having Play Services installed. With neither MicroG nor Play Services, many third-party apps fail to function. For example Lyft and Uber depend on the Play Services API for maps and many other apps depend on Google&#x27;s network location service. If you try to use these apps without some replacement, the apps complain and shut down. MicroG gives you a way around that.<p>I&#x27;m quite happy with my MicroG-based phone but I use:<p>- OSMAnd or the open-source equivalent of Maps.me for maps<p>- My country&#x27;s public transport app for public transit directions<p>- FairEmail for email<p>- Element for messaging<p>- Slide for Reddit<p>- Firefox for web browsing<p>And actively avoid all of Google&#x27;s apps and services (except the occasional search and YouTube).')
