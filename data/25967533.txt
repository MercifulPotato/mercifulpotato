You aren&#x27;t going to solder stuff only by eyeballing the component packaging either.<p>On-line information? That&#x27;s another question entirely. This would be a more interesting test: can you make a basic webapp (or other type of app representative of your experience) <i>without Internet access</i>?<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with an older stack and toolkit, you probably have many books&#x27; worth of manuals already installed. Unless you&#x27;re unlucky and didn&#x27;t notice the documentation isn&#x27;t installing along with your tools. Or you&#x27;re on Windows[0]. You can use them to work out most of the problems you&#x27;re facing.<p>Newer tools though? There&#x27;s this annoying trend of under-documenting things, and relying on people on StackOverflow to fill in the gaps. Or even worse, setting up a Slack&#x2F;Discord for the project, and getting people to help each other there.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just old, but when I&#x27;m working with computer tools, I prefer to solve the issues myself, instead of chasing around the Internet and <i>talking to people</i>. I also like to be able to continue to work when my Internet dies, or I&#x27;m out of range, or the site hosting the docs dies (happens more often than one would expect).<p>And to answer my own question: yes, I can write basic apps of the type I work on (and bunch of others, including games) without Internet access, as long as you let me use my computer - where I have access to heaps of off-line documentation <i>and</i> lots of prior source code to supplement it.<p>--<p>[0] - Someone at MS had the bright idea to ship PowerShell without help for its commands by default, so that the first thing Get-Help tells you is to download the man pages...')
