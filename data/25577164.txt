People imagine there is an apolitical body that makes grants to physicists based on the merits of their work ... but that&#x27;s not the case.<p>In any resource allocation scheme where the grantors have no skin in the game, politics and cronyism will dominate in the long term.<p>That&#x27;s probably what&#x27;s happened here.  String theorists get grants not because string theory produces practical results, but because there is now a network of string theorists and sympathizers in charge of the institutions that control professorships and grant making.<p>That&#x27;s why resource allocation should be left to those with skin in the game.  A market is one mechanism for forcing allocators to expose themselves to the downsides of bad investments ... but there are other mechanisms if people have an allergy to markets.')
