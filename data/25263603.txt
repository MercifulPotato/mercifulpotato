Some of our dependencies do not yet fully support PEP517, which means we&#x27;re stuck on 1.0.10 for now (e.g. mypy, which had a fix merged but not yet released, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;python-poetry&#x2F;poetry&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3094" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;python-poetry&#x2F;poetry&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3094</a>).<p>The poetry lock file also seems to get ignored for git dependencies. Say I depend on package Foo, on branch Bar, as a git dependency. At install time I get revision 1, which gets added to the lock file. Now let&#x27;s say the head of branch Bar moves to revision 2. If I re-run poetry install, I now get revision 2, even though revision 1 is still mentioned in the lock file. The solution is simple: depend on revisions &#x2F; tags, rather than on branches (and this sounds like good practice anyway), but it is surprising behavior.')
