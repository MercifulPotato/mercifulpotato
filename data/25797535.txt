Having a kid tell you him and his mom sleep in a car this weekend is a heavy burden to carry.<p>We treat teachers like these magicians who should find a way to make economically stressed kids fantastic students.<p>I myself went through tons of housing instability , and an eviction while in high school. In no universe was I going to get into some type of premiere college.<p>But you just keep seeing more and more pressure to make kids college ready. Kids who can barely read English are now told to take a foreign language( I&#x27;ve always hated foreign language requirements because I think it gives a big leg up to people growing in bilingual homes).<p>Your wife is a saint. I can&#x27;t imagine how much stress this reopening drive is causing your home.')
