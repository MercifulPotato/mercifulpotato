This is the translation of proofs from one structure to an isomorphic one.<p>For example, if I have, say, a group, and I prove something about it, you would think that the proof would hold for all isomorphic groups.  Under ZFC <i>this isn&#x27;t true</i>, or at least we don&#x27;t get it for free.<p>Under HoTT, we get this for free.')
