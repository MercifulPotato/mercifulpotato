One is that the way we determine the &quot;quality&quot; of the code is based on the current scope of the project.<p>If the scope right now is pull a bunch of values out of spreadsheets and generate reports on them, the highest quality code would be the most terse: it looks up the files, get the information, then displays it. If tomorrow the scope changes to &quot;do that, but in realtime, across multiple machines&quot;, the highest quality code is the one that implemented a database and REST API.<p>Since scope changes all the time, we can never evaluate which set of code is the highest quality.')
