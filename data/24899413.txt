The abuse of minorities in the US spans generations and has consistently been relegated to the margins of mainstream news. It has been typical in the US -- for decades -- for the NY Times to grant a single death in Israel front page coverage while a death of an African American at the hands of police in NYC would barely get coverage. My point is not that either is acceptable -- but rather that both are bad. Perhaps non-coverage of an incident in NY is worse because a NY paper might want to consider the atrocities happening right down the street.<p>The BLM movement finally came to the forefront not because of the &quot;liberal&quot; media but in spite of it. The BLM movement was enabled by <i>Social Media.</i> If Twitter did not exist, there is no reason to assume we would have made any progress.<p>The media overall and the liberal media have lost part of their control over the narrative (and the power that selective coverage conveys) and trying to blame things on social media. But believe this -- what we have seen in 2020 is progress. As messy and as ugly as it is, we&#x27;ve actually moved forward with minority rights.<p>Consider also how hypocritical the coverage has been. Liberal media tells us that &quot;Silicon Valley lacks diversity&quot;. TBH it does, but you know the real problem is not SV, it is a national media controlled by four families with zero minorities on their boards and executive staff -- telling an industry with huge numbers of minorities (including many brown people in senior&#x2F;CxO ranks) they lack diversity.<p>SV does need to get better, but saying SV is the start and end of all problems is absolutely false.')
