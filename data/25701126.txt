I don&#x27;t believe Taiwanese want to be part of the US. They already have their own country.\n2. The US shouldn&#x27;t counter the Chinese imperialist ambitions of annexing Taiwan by doing something that could be viewed as the same thing.\n3. It&#x27;s not really necessary for what you want. The US could enter an open alliance with Taiwan if it wanted to making a Chinese declaration of war against Taiwan a declaration of war against the US.\n4. The US should make a stand that the independent country of Taiwan has a right to exist and support that right alone not precondition on joining the US.<p>I could go on, but I think this &quot;Taiwan becomes a US state&quot; thing that I see repeated a lot is just plain silly.')
