There are children and good people trying to live in those crime-ridden neighborhoods. The police is not the problem. I feel for the cops there because you can&#x27;t take one of the most violent cities in the world and expect to police it like Sweden. As such, I wish they maintained their surveillance program because it works and it would result in more perps being taken out of that victimized community.<p>Victim-rights trump criminal-rights.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_cities_by_murder_rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_cities_by_murder_rate</a>')
