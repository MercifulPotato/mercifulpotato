I also experienced the battery expanding (it was last changed in 2018 just as the AppleCare warranty expired).<p>The replacement battery killed the GPU.<p>The screen turned blank when waking from sleep. It survived another week, but after that, would crash whenever switching to NVIDIA graphics.<p>I can&#x27;t just replace the battery now - I need to change the logic board ($500). Repairs for the 820-3787 are possible through Louis Rossmann, Paul Daniels, etc - but cost a similar amount to a replacement board.<p>Original batteries cannot be bought from Apple - the laptop is obsolete. I don&#x27;t know which batteries to trust.<p>Non-Apple devices lack MagSafe, Thunderbolt, iSync USB, and Time Machine. Newer Apple devices lack most of these too, and can&#x27;t even upgrade the SSD. The latest M1 MacBooks can&#x27;t even dual-boot, or use Target Disk Mode for recovery. In the end, I&#x27;m probably just going to have to learn how to use OpenBoardView, buy a better soldering iron and microscope, and go for the real full-stack, hardware as well as software.')
