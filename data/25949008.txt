The risk of this is proportional to volatility. Due to high volatility, DTC increased its settlement costs. This isn&#x27;t usually a big deal to a clearing firm or a brokerage because retail brokers don&#x27;t usually have huge exposure to a single equity.<p>My bet is with the entire world suddenly memed into buying GME, settlement for retail brokers suddenly became very expensive and there wasn&#x27;t an existing mechanism to pass on this cost down the chain, so halting orders was the only option on short notice.')
