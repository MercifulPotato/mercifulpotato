Item(by='Impossible', descendants=None, kids=[25448127], score=None, time=1608149744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439490, text='<i>Estimates of total hardware sales vary depending on what is considered VR hardware, but most estimates I&#x27;ve seen have worldwide unit sales at around 5-6M in 2020.</i><p>His sales estimates are a little low, unless he&#x27;s only including PC VR.  PSVR alone has sold ~5M units by most estimates.  In the most recent Steam hardware survey, about 2% of users that completed the survey have VR devices, which is roughly another 2M users.  That doesn&#x27;t include Quest and Quest 2 sales (many people never use the link cable), or the few Rifts out there that aren&#x27;t on Steam.  So while it&#x27;s highly unlikely that 6DOF VR devices have sold 10M units, its likely cleared 8M units and could easily surpass 10M in 2021.<p>The biggest issue right now is lack of software.  There isn&#x27;t much to play at all in VR, and there are very few great VR titles and only a handful of good ones.  For HN commenters that want the infinite screen experience, I unfortunately believe that will be relatively niche (you sell to a bunch of programmers) and none of the current players are really focused on enterprise as games have been the stickiest thing so far.  Quest 2 is pretty high resolution and eventually a tracked keyboard and infinite office will ship, so it might still be the best option for a while for people looking for VR productivity.')
