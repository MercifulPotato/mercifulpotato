I can (in theory) run the stack on various HC emulators (e.g. [1]), but a) it&#x27;s a bit cumbersome and b) I would love to be able to modify it as I see fit.<p>The stack seems to have plenty of algorithms and other internal functionalities which can&#x27;t be easily reconstructed from just using the UI, so I would love to be able to have access to the source code and extract them to another language.<p>Does anyone have a suggestion how to approach this problem? I&#x27;ve looked into LiveCode [2] but wasn&#x27;t able to get it to run (and it&#x27;s apparently not fully compatible with HC anyway). Any suggestions would be more than welcome.<p>[0] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lopac.net&#x2F;weather.html<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;hypercard_weather_2<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livecode.org&#x2F;')
