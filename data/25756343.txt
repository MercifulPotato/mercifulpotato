There is probably something illegal they suspect of happening at that point.<p>In this particular instance though, with the Capitol falling, it doesn&#x27;t help. Because I have to imagine that when the Capitol fell, there were a lot of feds knocking on Amazon&#x27;s door. But, yes, as long as you&#x27;re not doing anything that feds are at the door flashing badges about, you should be golden. If you are doing something feds are asking your landlord about, worrying about your landlord is a poor use of your time. You have bigger problems. (In fact, it&#x27;s probable that your landlord also has bigger problems at that point. Feds generally don&#x27;t make courtesy calls.)')
