No pretending is necessary.  It&#x27;s true.  I run multiple computers with different resource constraints and operating systems.  I neither have the patience nor the time (not to mention the system requirements) to install an IDE on all of them.   However each one has an OS that comes with a POSIX-like shell, e.g., NetBSD&#x27;s sh, FreeBSD&#x27;s sh, OpenBSD&#x27;s sh and Linux&#x27;s sh, which is derived from NetBSD&#x27;s sh.<p>The author of this blog post begins his demonstration of shell wizardry with the &quot;history&quot; command.  This command does not exist in POSIX sh.  On NetBSD I use &quot;fc -l 0&quot;.  Go figure, it is more portable (nevermind fewer keystrokes).  The scripts I write in NetBSD sh run on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, and a number of other OS without any modification.  I do not have learn multiple shells to do work.  On BSD, I also use the POSIX-like scripting shell (sh) as the interactive shell.<p>The best part is I do not have to install anything, it has already been included, no worries about system requirements.  All these OS require a POSIX-like sh.  None of them require an IDE.')
