I uninstalled Firefox immediately on all my machines.<p>They did not &quot;artificially limit&quot; the extensions available, you are misinformed.<p>They rewrote the engine of their mobile browser, and swapped the old engine for the new one before the new one had 100% support for all of the extension APIs. They have been working on this, and over the past few months I&#x27;ve seen several of my extensions which were previously disabled start re-enabling themselves as support for those APIs has been added. The eventual goal is to support all of the extensions that were supported before.<p>You can track that progress here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Mozilla&#x2F;Add-ons&#x2F;WebExtensions&#x2F;Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Mozilla&#x2F;Add-ons&#x2F;Web...</a><p>It sucks that, for the span of a couple months, I lost a couple of my addons, but as someone whose team has struggled for years supporting two very different versions of a piece of software simultaneously, I understand why they did it. And the new browser is so much faster and more responsive that my annoyance about the addons was tempered somewhat.<p>&gt;Now they&#x27;re firing the Rust team? Are these people stupid? Rust is pretty much the only thing Mozilla has going for it. I guess it&#x27;s time for Thunderbird to go as well.<p>They did not fire the Rust team. They laid off a few of the people who had been working primarily on Rust, and retained several others. But significant components of Firefox are written in Rust, and the people who are working on those components are still employed. And significant amounts of new code is being written in Rust - but essentially they can&#x27;t swapping out hundreds of thousands of lines of code at a time anymore.')
