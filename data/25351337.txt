It is a well-known ambiguity in how we hear space along that narrow axis. How you arrange the sound sources doesn&#x27;t matter much. Research has demonstrated that human perception of a sound being &quot;front&quot; or &quot;back&quot; is determined by non-aural sensory cues. Specifically, if you can <i>see</i> a plausible sound source in front of you, you will <i>hear</i> it in front of you. Front-to-back spatial discrimination is based almost entirely on the visual cortex providing a model of the space in which the sound notionally exists.<p>In practice, humans subconsciously compensate for ambiguous front&#x2F;back spatial positioning by turning their heads, putting the sound source on an axis where they do have excellent spatial discrimination. For obvious reasons this doesn&#x27;t work well for headphones. Unless, of course, you have some kind of head tracking built into them.')
