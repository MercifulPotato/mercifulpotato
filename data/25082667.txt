Since Starship will be fully reusable, it&#x27;s upfront building investment (the ~100M price-tag you are referring to), spread over the lifetime of the vehicle, plus staff&#x2F;maintenance&#x2F;fuel for launches.<p>Falcon 9 was already a +10x reduction (~~1.5B per launch -&gt; ~70M, likely cheaper for reused boosters), and Starship will be another +10x cheaper than F9. This means Starship will be &gt;100x cheaper than competitors (excluding small-sat rockets like the Electron)')
