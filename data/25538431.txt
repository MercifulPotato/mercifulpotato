They assume uniform distributions in the interval [0, x] where x is somewhat like the current best guess.<p>It is well known that the product of variables with an uniform distribution has a result that has not an uniform distribution, but some distribution that has more values closer to 0. So there is no surprise that multiplying almost 10 variables with uniform distribution you get something that almost 0 almost all the time.<p>But it is not realistic to use an uniform distribution. All the variables depend on a lot a subparts, so a realistic distribution must be something that looks like a log normal distribution with a peak near the current best guess <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Log-normal_distribution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Log-normal_distribution</a>')
