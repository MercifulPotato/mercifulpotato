His stance was exactly what you describe: that government did not have a right to force private parties to conduct business against their will.<p>There&#x27;s a good-faith debate to be had about positive rights vs. negative rights; or the potential backlash from forcing individuals to do the right thing; or the usual right-libertarian arguments about the sanctity of property rights. But I&#x27;ll bet dollars to donuts, that the vast majority of those cheering for tech media giants booting out those with <i>verboten</i> views, based on private property rights, would also be horrified at the idea of even questioning the CRA under the same logic.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delong.typepad.com&#x2F;sdj&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;barry-goldwater-declares-that-the-1964-civil-rights-act-is-a-dire-threat-to-the-liberties-of-african-americans-and-will-creat.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delong.typepad.com&#x2F;sdj&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;barry-goldwater-decla...</a>')
