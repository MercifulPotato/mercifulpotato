Taking away a person&#x27;s email address could easily mean that they will have to spend a tremendous amount of time changing it with various parties that have it in their records.  At least those of them that can actually accept to talk to you (e.g. your bank or the IRS).<p>An non-optimal approach would be to actually own the domain name of one&#x27;s email address and then use one of those providers listed there as the &quot;backend&quot; mailbox, by forwarding the &quot;real&quot; email address to the &quot;backend&quot; mail address. Most domain name providers will actually provide this kind of email forwarding for free. And it would be much much easier to switch between the backends. Or even use two of them simultaneously.')
