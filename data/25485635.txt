Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608465060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25485335, text='I have found SO to be quite useful, but I don’t go there to <i>answer</i> questions.<p>I go there to <i>ask</i> questions. I’ve asked nearly twice as many questions as I’ve answered.<p>I have gotten some very rapid, useful, answers to vexing issues.<p>I’ve also been treated quite badly. They seem to have a culture that assumes people that ask questions are a “lower caste” than ones that answer. Look at the folks with five- and six-digit scores. Most have single-digit question counts; with that digit frequently being “0.”<p><i>Shrug</i>. Whatevs... I don’t lose any sleep over it. I haven’t been asking as many questions, lately. That’s because I haven’t been getting answers lately. Maybe part of the issue is that my current questions are a quite difficult and “production-related,” compared to my older ones. I have noticed that many answers tend to be rather “academic,” in nature, which I like, but that tell me that the person answering may not have experience applying the answer in the context of a shipping application.<p>I have learned to improve the quality of my questions, over time. One of the by-products of the way I’ve been treated, is that I have gotten better at doing self-research, and figuring out the answer on my own.<p>I’ve always been quite good at arriving at solutions on my own, but it takes time, and, quite often, a response to an SO question, even if done so in a condescending manner, would deliver an astonishingly quick answer; frequently with some orthogonal viewpoint that makes the answer more valuable.<p>I’ve also learned not to “slap back,” when someone is a bit snotty to me (I’m quite capable of doing so). Even if they aren’t being nice, they are doing me a favor, and I appreciate it. I don’t go there to make friends. I go there to get problems solved.')
