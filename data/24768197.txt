The interesting bit is if you rotate them a bit the correlation varies like cos(the angle) between them. So correlation 1 at 0 degrees, 0 at 90 degrees, -1 at 180 degrees and about 0.98 at 10 degrees. But how does nature or whatever know the angle between them when they are far apart? In most &#x27;hidden variables&#x27; scenarios the correlation at 10 degrees is more like 0.89 or a linear change and that is basically the essence of Bell&#x27;s theorem and experiments - you can&#x27;t get the correlations without the particle at one end kind of knowing the set up at the other, or &#x27;non locality&#x27; as Bell called it.')
