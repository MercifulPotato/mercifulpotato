Having worked with C#&#x2F;.Net where almost everything in the box, Node, where very little is in the box and a miniscule amount of rust which is more towards the latter, I prefer the latyer.<p>Now, I am somewhat supposed that say tokio or similar hasn&#x27;t made it in the box yet, it allows for much greater experimentation.<p>Aside, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see MS generate a massive sure if libraries if they shift more internals development to rust.
