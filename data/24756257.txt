SCTP has solved both of those problems and is now 2 decades old. I have in the past harped on what a shame it is that QUIC was built, basically reinventing features of SCTP poorly. SCTP could still be viable over the open internet on IPv6 if it&#x27;s done before the inevitable protocol ossification happens on IPv6 just like IPv4 when middlebox vendors can&#x27;t be bothered to support passing traffic other than TCP, UDP, and ICMP.')
