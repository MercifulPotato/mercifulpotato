ITER will not be able to simulate the neutronic environment of a full reactor (and so will not be able to confirm adequate breeding), nor subject the modules to the cumulative neutron loading they will have to withstand.<p>For this reason, a Fusion Nuclear Science Facility has long been proposed as something that will be needed before DEMO is built.  This could be a small, Q &lt; 1 DT fusion device, as the goal would not be plasma physics related.  It itself will need to breed its own tritium to operate long enough, so there&#x27;s a circular dependency in the development.')
