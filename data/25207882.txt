It&#x27;s a great laptop, but I can&#x27;t wait for my m1 air with 16 gigs, because for mobility, I&#x27;m missing the outrageous stability that macos and Apples hardware are delivering.\nI&#x27;ll keep the xps as a daily driver for work (wsl 2 and vscode are just unmet in apples ecosystem), but for the couch, conferences, trains etc., it&#x27;s going to be the mba 100% of the time.
