If you&#x27;re really paying for the software and not the support, it isn&#x27;t a neccessary business expense because you can have it for free. Same for the support. If others can get support for free — and it&#x27;s easy to observe it happening — chances are you can get it for free. Someone down the line might notice it&#x27;s a donation and not a <i>necessary business expense</i>.<p>And if you really need <i>extra</i> support, we&#x27;re back to the old paradigm where open source can help you land a project but you still need to do the work and it&#x27;s in addition to the work you do on the project, and it&#x27;s not easy work. For example, a week-long training course, or custom code.')
