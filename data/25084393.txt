No enforced values by one or another interest group.<p>Like any craft, it takes years to master, and efficiency comes from doing it so often, that it becomes inculcated. Nowadays, I make massive architectural decisions every day, without writing down a thing, and, here&#x27;s the &quot;hit&quot;: <i>these decisions turn out to be correct</i>, even though they often mean a lot of work (for example, this entire week has been spent re-testing -and fixing- an app I&#x27;m working on, in response to an internal refactoring job). It&#x27;s like a wood carver, encountering an unexpected knot in their material, and having to work around it, or maybe even incorporate it into the design; treating it as a nice surprise and advantage.<p>I enjoy writing software. I think I&#x27;m fairly good at it. I&#x27;d not want to stop.<p>But the rant reminds me of this old gem: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.internetisshit.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.internetisshit.org</a>')
