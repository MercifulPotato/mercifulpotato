So I wouldn’t consider this implicitly safer than any particular C++ library that has been through some basic static analysis. If anything, there probably have been way more eyes on STL. I would be even less confident in this case since the author of Actix who probably actually knew what he was doing was harassed out of his own project by the friendly community.<p>I get the safety for performance trade off, but Rust evangelists pretend this trade off never happens, and it’s very pervasive in important libraries.')
