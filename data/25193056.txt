That is nonsense.<p>Wealth outside these is gigantic. We constantly see economic growth that creates wealth, and new fortunes for people. Somebody in tech should really understand this, and these new rich often actually more influential and richer then some of these dynastic elite.<p>&gt; Their mere existence as dynastic families proves that wealth does not always flow downwards<p>That&#x27;s not what me or parent argued, nice straw-men.')
