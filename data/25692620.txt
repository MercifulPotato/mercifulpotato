Is that really the world you want to live in?<p>You have things backwards: they haven&#x27;t and in fact I do and already do.<p>What gives Twitter the right to decide what can be said <i>via its software</i> is the first amendment to the US constitution.  Which is a world I live in and do want to live in -- it&#x27;s stronger and better than the &quot;free&quot; speech guarantees in Europe.<p>The first amendment prevents <i>elected</i> people from deciding what people can and can&#x27;t say in public.<p>And twitter banning someone doesn&#x27;t actually control what they can say &quot;in public&quot;, merely on Twitter.  I don&#x27;t use twitter and I heard about this from one of those other channels.<p>Throughout US history the person with the press has been able to decide what is printed <i>on its press</i>.  Today there are more opportunities to be heard than ever before.')
