I know what it’s like to work with people who _care_ about what they’re doing, and what it’s like to work with people who don’t, and I (personally) would pick the former over the latter even if it meant more hours, less money, whatever.<p>At the end of the day, what makes me feel good is leaving the workday feeling like I got good work done with a good team, and we all tried our best because we care about what we’re doing, instead of just punching the clock. I’m not crazy or indoctrinated, that’s just what makes me feel satisfied by my work. But people are different and value very different things, so I’m glad there are companies that work well for each type of person.')
