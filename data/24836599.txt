It was also the time when software just worked.<p>Except when it didn&#x27;t. Keeping with the Encyclopedia theme, it was usual back then to buy an yearly book to update your paper encyclopedia; once we stopped buying these (the last one we have is from 2009), the vendor convinced us to buy a &quot;Grande Barsa DVD&quot; (version 6.0).
