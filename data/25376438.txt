People saw the issues that were placed on a national stage, then looked inwards and saw similar issues much closer to home, and these things started coming out as people were no longer OK with keeping quiet about it.<p>For the other half of your comment: I personally think many companies have issues focusing on non-technical problems. From the thread, the issues were clearly that they were writing far too much code, it seems like they were not testing enough, they lacked a person who would tell them how their changes would be perceived by the public. This is not unique to Uber in any way, these problems show up to various degrees across companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others. And you can see the solutions: while highly technical and &quot;awesome&quot;, they are obvious band-aids. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s much easier to slap on technical band-aids than fix the root, non-technical problem.')
