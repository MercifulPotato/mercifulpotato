Item(by='cushychicken', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603806292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901512, text='&gt;Is there any healthy place or way or method &quot;juniors&quot; can learn through experience without being screwed over?<p>That&#x27;s a great question. I agree that mentors aren&#x27;t the catch-all answer. I will say, though, having been on both sides of the mentorship divide, that a good mentor is a powerful positive force in your career. Doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it only gets you so far.<p>When it comes to money, I&#x27;m afraid there isn&#x27;t a whole lot junior technical candidates can do to get more. In my experience, technical experience and negotiating leverage are the two surest paths to getting paid more. Junior engineers straight out of college have neither of these things. Jobs beget negotiating leverage. If you have a job, a new job has to give you a better deal to convince you to leap. That&#x27;s something that a fresh college graduate, inconveniently, lacks.<p>There seems to be a lot of advice here that suggests taking the best job you can straight out of school, and then switching jobs as soon as you reasonably can. That&#x27;s what I did - I spent a year at a big chip company, decided it wasn&#x27;t for me, and left for a consumer electronics company. That one year of credible work experience netted me a ~30% raise on switching.')
