Sometimes we have to be fine with the fact that not all the goals we want to achieve are in fact goals we can achieve. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we failed in a broad sense - many people don&#x27;t even step up and give it a shot.<p>&quot;And it is important in life that you don’t define failure as failure to achieve only one specific goal. You can show up prepared and still not cross a specific finish line. 163 men participated in the Delta Force trials, but only 12 were ultimately accepted into the program. Those 151 men were not failures – not even close. They just had to accept that this Delta Force finish line wasn’t one they were going to cross and instead start progressing towards the next.&quot;')
