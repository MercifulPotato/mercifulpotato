Redhat employs so many more low level engineers they can generally get you a z stream patch or something to fix a legitimate bug. Canonical is an exceptional marketing company, but I&#x27;ve found their engineering to be lacking when it comes to enterprise. As someone who&#x27;s worked as a linux monkey for companies who pay Canonical for support and for companies who pay Redhat for support, I&#x27;ve always found the Redhat support to actually solve the root cause. When we filed what we thought were legitimate bugs with Canonical, the common response was just to &quot;upgrade to the latest version of Ubuntu&quot;. When we asked them to confirm that doing so actually fixed our problems we just got crickets.')
