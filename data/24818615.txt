You can calculate the total amount of work represented by any blockchain which provides an independent measure of trust.  Total proof of work can be calculated with just a copy of the blockchain data without trusting the software client.  Nothing like that exists with proof-of-stake.<p>If the assumption is that downloaded binaries must be trusted, one could simply use a key embedded inside that binary to verify the identity of a centralized database.  No need for proof-of-stake.')
