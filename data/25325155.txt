They did before, after this fire I found the cutesy animated videos they published explaining how you should shelter in place because fire is unlikely to spread in a highrise.<p>It seems like bullshit to me.  At the first hint of fire in a building, I&#x27;ll be flying down the nearest staircase that doesn&#x27;t have smoke coming out of it.   I&#x27;d not sit around in a burning building waiting to see if the fire gets worse, only to find out I no longer have any options for escape.')
