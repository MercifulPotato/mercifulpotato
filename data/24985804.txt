Prior to COVID-19, the banks I talked to really didn&#x27;t like the risk profile of fibre builds.  Real estate was the be all and end all.  Want an interest only million dollar commercial real estate loan?  Sure!  Broadband infrastructure?  Nope, that&#x27;s too risky.  As a small provider, you need to get to somewhere north of 500 customers just to break even, and then you need your next $5-10 million to keep building.  Governments think that point in time funding programs are the solution, but they&#x27;re not.  Small communities need access to long term amortization of construction costs, similar to other government programs for large infrastructure projects that are available to municipalities.  It&#x27;s a real challenge to get anywhere in underserved communities.')
