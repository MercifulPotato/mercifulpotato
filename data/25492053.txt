I think the modern sense of the term &quot;middle class&quot; is a purely modern invention.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, the historical &quot;middle class&quot; was never conceived of as being in the &quot;middle&quot; economically. They were the middle class because they were rich like aristocrats, without being nobly born like aristocrats. That put them in the middle of no scales of status; rather, they pegged the high end of economic status, and the low end of blueblood status. They couldn&#x27;t be treated as well as noblemen, because (1) they weren&#x27;t noblemen, and (2) everybody hated them. But they couldn&#x27;t be treated as poorly as peasants, because they were too rich.<p>I don&#x27;t see what we gain by applying this term to the majority of the United States today; the concepts just don&#x27;t match up.')
