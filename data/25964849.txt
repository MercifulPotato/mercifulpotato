Any decent CS program should teach them.<p>&gt; I had a FAANG interview question applying statistics to a unbounded input. It took me a while to understand what the question was really asking, followed by some shock because it was something I&#x27;d never even imagined before (since I haven&#x27;t needed to do much statistics in my line of work) and I didn&#x27;t have the faintest idea where to start. With some hand-holding I figured out some basics, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that interview was part of the reason that &quot;the hire signal was not strong enough&quot;.<p>Yeah, if you are asking something weird (as an interviewer) you should be expected to explain it.<p>It sounds to me you had the right approach (figuring out what the problem is and getting help from the interviewer). Ultimately, it&#x27;s completely possible you simply stumbled upon a bad interviewer who assumed his specialty question was well known.')
