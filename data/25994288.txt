My company existed to &quot;generate money <i>from</i> investors&quot;, for myself.<p>It&#x27;s also, obviously, fraud.  You can make it less obvious by actually spending the money on a scheme that looks busy and looks like it has potential to generate returns.  If I <i>realistically believe</i> that it has the potential to generate the returns I&#x27;m promising the investors, then I&#x27;m doing the usual thing of trying to generate money <i>for</i> investors.  If I&#x27;m selling $2 bills for $1, I&#x27;ll get a lot of customers and build a big business but all the actual value flowing into the system is the cash from the investors and I don&#x27;t have any real prospect of turning that around.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell the difference between those.')
