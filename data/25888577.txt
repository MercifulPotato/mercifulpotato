I believe that the US&#x27;s productive capacity is very high, and have a huge slack (due to heavy mechanisation and automation). If demand grows, production can keep up - and thus, no inflation.<p>Countries that import most of their supply (like in venezuela) cannot have slack in their production, and thus you see high inflation in times of high demand and low supply.')
