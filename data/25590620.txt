The line has a fixed throughput, and if it stops, it&#x27;s hard to catch up. It&#x27;s a stupendously expensive thing, staffed with a similarly-expensive complement of workers.<p>Rework in the yard, on the other hand, is &quot;soft&quot;, it can can be parallelized across as many workers as you can deploy, and they&#x27;re usually contractors so you only bring them in when you need them.<p>So if cars can be finished enough to roll &#x27;em through end-of-line and then into yard hold, that&#x27;s what you do. Clean it up as soon as possible of course, but whatever you do, don&#x27;t stop the line.')
