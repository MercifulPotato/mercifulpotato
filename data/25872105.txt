Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611327281, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870433, text='&gt; Where the politics turns into a fight between &quot;use government to achieve public policy goals&quot; versus &quot;destroy government, except for the police and security forces&quot;, the &quot;destroy government&quot; faction get to make the actual governance worse and have forfeited any ability to make useful or constructive criticism.<p>You&#x27;ve got the causation backwards. The &quot;destroy government&quot; folks came into existence because governance was poor. Don&#x27;t forget that in the 60 years between 1932 and 1994, Democrats controlled the House for all but 4 years, and the Senate for all but 10. Every now and then a Republican would get elected President to pump the brakes a bit, but Congress makes the laws, and since Democrats controlled that even wildly popular Presidents like Reagan couldn&#x27;t meaningfully roll back any of the FDR or Great Society era programs.<p>There&#x27;s not a single American city that has public services as well-run as even a second tier German city. These are one-party places like in California or New York, where Democrats control both houses of the state legislature, and the executive, and the municipal government. Here in Maryland, Democrats have controlled the state legislature continuously <i>for a century</i>. Since 1969, we&#x27;ve had just two moderate Republican governors (who got elected to pump the breaks a bit on otherwise unbroken Democratic control). Around the country, people are streaming out of New York, California, and Illinois, to places like Virginia, Georgia, Arizona, and Texas where the government doesn&#x27;t try to do much but at least the taxes and property prices are low. (The #1 reason Virginia turned Democrat is migration into what used to be a well-run Republican state. Georgia and Arizona flipped for the same reason, and the same is happening to Texas.)')
