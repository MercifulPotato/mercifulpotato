Item(by='IMTDb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608231379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25458362, text='&gt;The regulation explicitly forbids annoying banners<p>You have to love how the regulator did not even try to define what they mean by &quot;annoying&quot;. Thus making the whole law completely useless.<p>In my book, any single pixel of my limited screen real estate that gets dedicated to this useless regulation is annoying. If the EU wants to enforce this, they need to provide a way for me to basically say &quot;Yes, I agree with all tracking cookies for all sites forever&quot;, and never see a banner again.')
