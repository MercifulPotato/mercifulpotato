Games built on top of frameworks like Unity, Unreal Engine and the like get platform support basically &quot;for free&quot; as long as the framework in question supports the target platform.<p>Any in-house developed engine might either depend on 3rd party support (e.g. libraries like SFML[1]) or need to be recompiled for the new platform. Depending on architectural differences, optimisation and asset loading (in case endianness[2] differs) needs to be altered accordingly.<p>The main reason for a decision to cancel a release would be time and effort vs expected sales. The Mac market will be fragmented into Intel and Apple Silicon from now on and every &quot;Mac version&quot; would really be two separate ports (complete with separate QA and optimisation).<p>An independent studio might just not have the resources and experience to tackle this and a port that doesn&#x27;t sell can effectively be worse than not releasing on a platform.<p>edit:\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfml-dev.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfml-dev.org</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Endianness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Endianness</a>')
