Item(by='xxpor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603385432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858098, text='&gt;Look at the 3rd and 4th amendments. They are rooted in privacy.<p>Eh, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a reasonable take. They&#x27;re much more rooted in property rights. I guess you could argue they&#x27;re just restatements of each other. Privacy applies to your person, while property rights apply to your stuff.<p>But notice the 3rd amendment specifically says &quot;owner&quot;, not resident or something similar. For example, if a apartment building owner wanted to allow a soldier to live in your apartment, you couldn&#x27;t stop them. Obviously any sane lease wouldn&#x27;t allow that but my point is you couldn&#x27;t make a constitutional argument against the government saying it&#x27;s a violation of your rights.<p>Also, SCOTUS didn&#x27;t extend the 4th amendment to imply privacy until 1967. Before then it only applied to property. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Katz_v._United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Katz_v._United_States</a>')
