Google, Apple, FB, Twitter, etc are not in the business of supporting outlier extremism in our society. Claiming censorship because they don&#x27;t want to platform that stuff is ridiculous.<p>Imagine a Jewish-owned store being forced to sell nazi paraphernalia because not selling it is censorship. The users of parler or gab are just mad these huge companies are taking a stand. Engaging with their tantrum only gives them a platform, even if it&#x27;s just a small personal one, and is clearly bad. Do we argue with crazies on the street yelling &quot;The end is nigh!&quot; every day? No.')
