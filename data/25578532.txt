The effective reproduction number won&#x27;t be less than one anytime in the near future.<p>The important point is that in January 2020 the percentage of the general public who were contagious was very low. Still, 350,000 people died this year. In January of 2021, the contagious percentage will be much higher. That more people will die in the following year is simple arithmetic.')
