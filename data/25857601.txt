But I assume you mean &#x2F;r&#x2F;bodyweightfitness? I am also a big fan, but I moved on from it and do my own programming based on reading Overcoming Gravity (2ed) - fantastic book if you want to get into the nitty gritty on body-weight programming.<p>&#x2F;r&#x2F;bodyweightfitness have just started rolling out a new series of plans to replace the RR. So if you haven&#x27;t popped by in a while it&#x27;s worth a look.<p>The one thing that always bugged me about the RR was the videos were just a random mismatch and some weren&#x27;t even the bodyweight variant - they just told you to ignore the barbell or whatever. It&#x27;s a bit of work to film and edit but there are a finite number of exercises in the RR so I always felt it made sense to make a consistent set for people to reference.<p>That is one thing I really like about this website - the demonstrations are clear and consistent with what is being described. .')
