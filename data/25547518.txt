Since there were no options for a managed Concourse in 2018, we migrated to Circle, one of the Changelog sponsors at the time.<p>Concourse worked well for us, we didn&#x27;t have any issues that were being enough to remember. You may be interested in this screenshot that captured the changelog.com pipeline from 2017: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipeline.gerhard.io&#x2F;images&#x2F;small-oss.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipeline.gerhard.io&#x2F;images&#x2F;small-oss.png</a><p>I missed the simple Concourse pipeline view at first, but CircleCI improved by leaps and bounds in 2020, and the new Circle pipeline view equivalent is even better (compared to Concourse, clicking on jobs always works): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.circleci.com&#x2F;pipelines&#x2F;github&#x2F;thechangelog&#x2F;changelog.com&#x2F;251&#x2F;workflows&#x2F;5836f363-060a-4bc5-8b9a-29988e59f0ad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.circleci.com&#x2F;pipelines&#x2F;github&#x2F;thechangelog&#x2F;chang...</a><p>The Circle feature which I didn&#x27;t expect to like as much as I do today, is the dashboard view (list of all pipeline&#x2F;workflow runs). This is something that Concourse is still missing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.circleci.com&#x2F;pipelines&#x2F;github&#x2F;thechangelog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.circleci.com&#x2F;pipelines&#x2F;github&#x2F;thechangelog</a><p>My favourite Circle 2020 feature is the Insights: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.circleci.com&#x2F;insights&#x2F;github&#x2F;thechangelog&#x2F;changelog.com&#x2F;workflows&#x2F;build&#x2F;overview" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.circleci.com&#x2F;insights&#x2F;github&#x2F;thechangelog&#x2F;change...</a>. Yup, we were one of the first ones to ask for it in 2019.<p>In 2021, I expect us to spend one migration credit on GitHub Actions, as a Circle replacement. Argo comes as a second close, but that requires an innovation credit which is more precious to us. Because we are already using GitHub Actions for some automation, it would make sense to consolidate, and also leverage the GitHub Container Registry, as a migration from Docker Hub.
