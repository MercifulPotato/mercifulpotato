However, I don&#x27;t understand how this would work at Amazon&#x27;s scaleâ€”for some packages you simply cannot update all the consumers at once and also as the vendor of an API, it&#x27;s not my job to update the consumers. So I need to be able to have multiple versions of my interface resident at the same time. Brazil solves this problem with version sets.<p>How is it solved in these vaunted monorepos at Facebook and Google? If there are N core libraries that each have two versions of their APIs, it it possible for consumers to each pick and chose which APIs to use, or it enforced that libraries just have one version that is &quot;live&quot; at any time?')
