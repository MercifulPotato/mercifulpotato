Highly unlikely (1 in 1e9) that snakes just found a new way to slither when scientist setup that experiment. The article acknowledges that it is hard to observe snakes in the wild. They have most likely been slithering this way for a long long time. Scientist captured snakes slithering in a way they have never seen before.<p>Measurement (and lack thereof) is the biggest source of errors. Medicine and medical studies is rife with mis-measurement e.g. associational studies. The Boeing 737-Max disaster was because of mis-measurement from a sensor. I could go on and on about this.')
