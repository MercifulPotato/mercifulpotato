Mental illness seems more plausible to me, even if part of the mental illness is making the person racist. It&#x27;s an illogical thing to do that takes a lot of effort.<p>A racist behaving rationally might just put the news clips together and or add commentary and sensational titles. They might put their clips on popular movies or new trailers so more people would watch. They might make shorter clips in the middle of the trailer, because, as is, putting the news clips at the start means anyone looking for the trailer will just bounce on seeing something else.<p>Surely there is a history of racism and obviously there is a racial element to this, as I identified in my previous comment, but the bizarre and irrational nature of it makes me think it&#x27;s either automated fraud or mental illness. Also, I don&#x27;t understand the relationship between this and framing black people for crimes, as far as I could tell the video clips are real clips from the news about black people committing crimes.')
