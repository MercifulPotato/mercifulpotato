Then a reasonable option is to get time off. For each hour you lost on sleep, perhaps that day you stop working earlier 2 hours. This need not be discussed, you can simply tell your manager.<p>Otherwise, a little extra involvement might be necessary. Ask your manager&#x27;s private phone number. When there&#x27;s a problem, share your problem with him. In the middle of the night. They may get some new insights in the difficulties.')
