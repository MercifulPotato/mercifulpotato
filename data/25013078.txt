It&#x27;s more expensive, but if you only print once in a blue moon it&#x27;s cheaper and less hassle than an inkjet (which will be all dried out or the cartridge will be empty from running the nozzle cleaning cycle every few days) when you need it that second time.<p>Laser printers can sit idle much longer but they&#x27;re bulky and sometimes energy hogs.')
