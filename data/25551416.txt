Now that you have simplified the problem you are more likely to get hold of it and solve it.<p>This happens all the time - when I am solving a technical&#x2F;logical problem, sometimes I feel like my wife thinks I am just staring blankly at the screen day-dreaming. So I get insecure and start to explain to her how hard the problem is, but because she&#x27;s a physician I have to translate it into common language first, and 99% of the time I say &quot;never mind, got it&quot; before I have a chance to really bore her.<p>Come to think of it, this may be how therapy works. You are forced to take all the &quot;mess&quot; that&#x27;s in your head and narrate it to someone else, in the process getting much simpler perspective on it.<p>Writing is the same way for me. For example, all the ideas in this post were in my head in some amorphous way, but now that I wrote them out they became neat little analogies I can use in the future.')
