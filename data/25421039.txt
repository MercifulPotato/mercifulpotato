Different ARM chips aren&#x27;t &quot;somewhat compatible&quot; anymore than Intel&#x2F;AMD x86 chips. It&#x27;s a standard instruction set. And even if we&#x27;d get different instruction sets, we have much better toolchains&#x2F;compilers to work with multiple architectures now than we did in &quot;the home computing landscape of the 80s &#x2F; early 90s&quot; (GCC and LLVM aren&#x27;t really comparable to Sinclair Basic).<p>The M1 has been out for a month and we already have hundreds&#x2F;thousands of natively compiled binariesâ€”and Windows and Linux are up and running.<p>Choice is not a problem and competition is good.')
