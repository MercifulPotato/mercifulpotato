It&#x27;s considered that they are qualified to be entrusted with a lot of responsibility, so they are also inherently more trustworthy. This sounds reasonable especially given how many incidents are witnessed with no hard evidence - like jay walking, littering, disturbing public peace, etc. and probably also a lot of more serious offenses. You could be caught trying to steal a car in a dark street and all that stands between you and freedom is the police officer&#x27;s word.<p>In this day and age with the possibility of just using body cams to cover this it should no longer matter. But the real qualm I have with this logic is that it&#x27;s never turned on its head: if a trusted officer of the law breaks that trust they should be punished <i>far</i> more harshly. This almost never happens.')
