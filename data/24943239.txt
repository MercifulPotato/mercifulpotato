If the party you are attacking denies the validity you have a few real bits of data you can point to and use to call the other party a liar.  If the party you are attacking tries to explain the nuance that there is some true and some false data in there then you use that against them to try to claim it is all true or that they are admitting that your specific bits of disinformation are true, by the time people hear the full statement it is already too late.<p>Seriously, it has been over four years since Clinton and the Podesta emails.  How can anyone still be this naive?')
