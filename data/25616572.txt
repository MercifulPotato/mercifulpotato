What distribution? What&#x27;s &quot;their display driver&quot;? Nouveau, the open-source Nvidia one, is pretty bad, and everyone uses the proprietary Nvidia driver (this may be hard to come by on some distros, like Debian, but don&#x27;t use those; use Ubuntu or Manjaro). The AMD open-source one is great and everyone on AMD GPUs uses that. I&#x27;ve been running triple monitor, diagonally-aligned 1080p&#x2F;1440p configurations for years on several distros and DEs with both Nvidia and AMD drivers.')
