Zomato&#x27;s rep offered to give us a 5 star rating if we gave him free takeaway food, or a 3 star rating otherwise, during the initial listing. We obviously gave him the free food, but I thought I would be a wise-ass and decided to record him. Posted it online, but turns out, Zomato&#x27;s doing that with every restaurant, so it didn&#x27;t become much news at the end of the day.')
