California needs to have massive controlled burns before the wet season every year, especially in non-drought years, to prevent this kind of uncontained fire from ever happening again.  Will some of these towns burn to the ground from &quot;controlled&quot; burns getting out of control? Yes.  But the alternative is that they simply burn some other time down the road when less can be done to stop it.<p>The simplest way to get people to take wildfire management more seriously is to raise their insurance premiums unless they mitigate the risk. I see tons of homes across the west in the exact same situation as the homes that are burning in CA,OR,WA right now. No one takes it seriously until the fire is bearing down on your town. At that point, it&#x27;s far too late.')
