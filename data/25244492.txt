However I&#x27;d like people taking responsibility for what they said. I don&#x27;t see anyone admitting &quot;Yes, I was wrong but I did my best to approximate the truth&quot;. I don&#x27;t see anyone explaining what exactly they were wrong about and how their thinking has changed few months later; what they would have said in hindsight. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d expect from true authorities but it never happens.')
