The parameters you can tweak in X11 didn’t let me change the fundamental curve, and to me where so much worse than Apple’s it rendered the system frustrating to use. I don’t know if wayland suffers from the same issue or not, but certainly googling around the many places were people similarly complained weren’t answered by a magic Wayland config. Does anyone know if it’s possible to get an Apple-like mouse curve in Linux?')
