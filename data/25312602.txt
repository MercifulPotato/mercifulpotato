Item(by='pm90', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607153323, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310620, text='&gt; The fundamental problem with taxation is that governments are even worse than individual billionaires like Jeff Bezos at choosing what to do with large amounts of money.<p>Citation needed. When Governments had lots of revenue, they assist the population with public services, which tend to benefit the lowest stratum of society the most. But the cumulative effect is to raise the quality of life of society as a whole. There is little evidence that billionaires have that kind of effect on society as a whole (outside of a few notable exceptions like Gates).<p>Having a billionaire class that has so much resources that they can influence public policy and Government... is an even worse outcome, and could be considered the only reason to dismantle this class. The Government is elected by the people (in a democracy) and having mini-kings is absolutely detrimental to the health of our democracy.')
