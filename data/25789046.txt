No. Any &#x27;best of&#x27; list is at most a bit of fun when taken with a pinch of salt, however the method obtained.<p>The boast or claim to be &quot;The Greatest Books of All Time&quot; lacks honesty or displays vast ignorance. The lists from which this list is compiled are intrinsically linked. This makes the title invalid, but, importantly my point, is that it <i>does not make the resulting list invalid</i>. Just please call the list what it is, a fun experiment.')
