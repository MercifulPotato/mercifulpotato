Also just because the code isn&#x27;t released doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s secure that same bad actor can theoretically hack the same code out of the writing company to start with.<p>It&#x27;s a debate we&#x27;ve had with secure messengers the benefit of having that many eyes on a piece of software outweighs the minor risk of a secret zero day.')
