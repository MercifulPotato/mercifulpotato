Users collaborate in near real-time on notebooks, schedule long-running notebooks, and we automatically detect user&#x27;s models and then save them so they don&#x27;t have to. They can then deploy them in one click. However, MLflow has trouble with models requiring high-dimensional inputs, which is most non toy models I&#x27;ve seen.<p>The usual &quot;solution&quot; is to write custom wrapping code for this because it only supports 2D DataFrames, which is unacceptable for us because that would mean users would have to do it, so we&#x27;ll take care of this too.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3570" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3570</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>')
