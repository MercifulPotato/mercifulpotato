Then charge them for whichever is the larger portion of a drive and provide the space and IOPS that they are then paying for.<p>This way, if you need 10MB but also 25,000 IOPS, then you&#x27;ll pay for ~10% of a drive. You&#x27;ll get your minimum required 25,000 IOPS....and also 200GB or whatever share of the drive is required to get you those IOPS.<p>At the end of the day, I&#x27;m not entirely sure it matters whether the cloud provider breaks it out like this as long as it at least has a little gray UI element under the specified storage space slider that reads out the IOPS to you.<p>It would be exactly the same as the current situation where customers do this manually. So probably not particularly necessary - why make customers fill in additional fields they might not need to?<p>I do think cloud providers should make it clear during requisition and read back how many IOPS you&#x27;re getting, just for clarity.<p>It does seem like having temporarily high quotas and then throttling back seems to break developer experience. Good deeds and punishment - but in this case there&#x27;s a solid underlying reason why it has detrimental effects.')
