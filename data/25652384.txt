And the buyer of the bonds gets a discount.<p>As for why anyone would buy such bonds:\nThe system is considered very stable (no US sub-prime mess) so if you have a lot of money, do not want to take risks (stocks and forex) and your bank charges you negative interest, it might make sense.<p>As for the house prices. Yes they are going up. But you still have to pay back the money in 20 years. Or remortgage, but then it might not be at 0%.<p>Another thing to consider is that property taxes are based on a public valuation that have some correlation with what you would be paying for a house (valuations is big mess now, but it will probably be fixed in less than 20 years).')
