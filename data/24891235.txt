The theft is incredible. In the bay area and particularly SF this is not one or two candy bars a week theft.<p>In SF, if you stop a shoplifter and they are hurt, if they are in a protected class etc, it&#x27;s game over for you as an employee and possibly the store. Even if you stop someone, even if police come and arrest, DA is never going to prosecute. If they do prosecute, its a misdemeanor. It&#x27;s pretty wild the first time you see it.<p>The clerks know who is coming in to steal. The stats above are from 2016. 2020 is worse, and much &#x2F; most of the property crime goes unreported. If walgreens reported every shoplifting incident the numbers would be nuts.')
