It&#x27;s possible to get pretty much anywhere in a reasonable amount of time, even late at night, with just a quick bus ride or two. I won&#x27;t say MUNI is perfect but it&#x27;s doing a lot of things right. Anyone who thinks BART is synonymous with SF&#x27;s inner city transportation is really not making their way around the city by transit.')
