Item(by='dash2', descendants=None, kids=[25407124], score=None, time=1607863987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405980, text='Sure, but one available choice is &quot;don&#x27;t use x&quot;. The point is that he says it&#x27;s obscene, but he acts like he prefers it to not having it.<p>One worry about the rising tide of anti-Facebook etc. sentiment is that it is driven by (a) a small number of vocal people who (b) say that x is horrible, but don&#x27;t act like it. (I don&#x27;t say whether this worry is always, or even mostly, correct. Just that it is worth considering.) The result can be problematic.<p>For example, like millions of people in the EU, before I use any new website, I now have to click &quot;OK&quot; on a GDPR button. I consider myself as caring about my privacy. But my behaviour tells me that I just click &quot;OK&quot; without even reading what they have to say. Obviously, my privacy is less important to me than the 10 seconds or 1 minute that it would take to read their policy and opt out from anything I dislike.<p>You can respond that this is a &quot;dark pattern&quot;, and I agree. You could also say it would be better for me to be able to set my privacy once - say, via browser settings - and I indeed try to do that, having used various Firefox settings and plugins to manage my cookies. Nevertheless, the fact is that, as my behaviour reveals, I would rather get on with my life, than waste 10 minutes a day clicking on privacy policies. Given that, of course, I would also rather not be presented with the &quot;GDPR OK button&quot; at all. It&#x27;s a fleabite of annoyance that I deal with many, many times, and every time I mutter to myself &quot;screw the EU and screw the GDPR&quot;. I suspect I am not alone.<p>I also suspect I will be downvoted for this, by just the noble idealists about whom I am grumbling. Sigh.')
