They have a Facebook group, and a number of other interactive options (like a Slack workspace).<p>In that case, we also have the “luxury” of the system not being used (or useful) for making money. It’s a totally free system, customized to a fairly narrow demographic.<p>I feel that it’s important to do a good job, and maintain the highest possible quality; regardless of whether or not anyone uses my stuff (I am my own best customer. Most of my projects are dependencies for other projects I have written).<p>In that vein, I don’t see that making it difficult to report bugs is such a good idea.<p>If I am not interested in fixing a certain issue (like if it’s a bug that I don’t think affects my own projects, and would destabilize the system, if I tried to address it), then I’m more than capable of politely and respectfully saying no.')
