So although most are theoretically capable of charging many different cars at their voltage requirements, not all are, and that&#x27;s a base requirement. In order to even charge the different Tesla models and their differing packs, the chargers are capable of varying voltage and current. So they are designed to be variable, but depending on how it&#x27;s designed, most likely the vehicle needs to communicate the voltage and current charging requirements for it&#x27;s state of charge.<p>Secondly, Tesla&#x27;s chargers have unique connectors and unique communication with the vehicles. Not to mention, the architecture is designed in a way that no payment, identification, etc. happens at the supercharger. You just plug it in and everything else is handled on your vehicle touch screen and Tesla web account. So really, unless Tesla decided to license the tech and allow other vehicle brands to id and communicate with their chargers, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible to charge at a supercharger.')
