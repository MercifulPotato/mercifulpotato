Security-wise Signal would be better... but:<p>Signal experience isn&#x27;t that good. Alien from the platform they run on. For example, no system recommendations to send this person a message or share something with them through signal.. Telegram is more a platform native and integrated into the system.<p>Also there is the issue of messages arriving late (not minutes but hours late, sometimes days late)')
