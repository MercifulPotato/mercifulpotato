When no one was knocking on their door wanting to talk to them.  When they were saddled with thousands in student loan debt maybe.  Or maybe they were never any of these things.<p>The normal person is starved for opportunities to advance, to be recognized, to try out new things.   The average Joe doesn&#x27;t get a lot of things to say &quot;no&quot; to. The average person doesn&#x27;t have a life mission of what to do with their vast wealth and time remaining on Earth, like a Warren Buffett does.  Sure, feel absolutely free to say no to fixing GM cars because your passion is Aston Martins, or how about not waiting tables today because you really want to be a cook?  Or, for that matter, saying that you don&#x27;t want this group of Jira tickets on infrastructure because you really want to do UI?  Hm?<p>For many (maybe most) people, life is a combination of random walks that you say &quot;yes&quot; to many of the paths you come across, and hope that it leads you somewhere good.  Having choices is a luxury. Don&#x27;t forget that.<p>I will say that yes, you should have perspective and opinion about what you want to do, and not want to do in life, and what paths you want to go down.  And you should work every day to build up the ability to have choices.  But most people operate within far more constraints than these celebrities and don&#x27;t have such luxury to be passing up new opportunities.<p>This is like lottery winners telling people how to succeed in life.  Fun, but dangerous for the average listener.  You go and try being as obnoxious and choosing to focus as Steve Jobs, and please report back...')
