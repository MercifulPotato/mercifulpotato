Maintainers can produce quality packages that don&#x27;t vary unintentionally between target systems with less effort to produce. Package consumers can rely on having the same quality packages on varying systems. I use Ubuntu Server mostly because its packages are highly consumed. If I could get the same packaging on a different system I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about arbitrary variations not related to the distro but different just because it&#x27;s produced through a separate workflow.')
