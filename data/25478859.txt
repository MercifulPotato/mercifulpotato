Including specifics on <i>what</i> medical staff within a hospital system would get it? Like not just &quot;health care staff&quot; or &quot;first responders&quot; (everyone in the Stanford Medicine system is that already right, this is about who within that group gets it).<p>Please back that up by showing me such clear guidelines from a few states. It should be easy to find this, if indeed most states have done this, presumably in a very transparent way for something so important and contentious, right?<p>I don&#x27;t believe most states have.<p>(It doesn&#x27;t make it easier that the federal government told states how much they&#x27;d get them REDUCED it, and in general is only committing to telling states how much they&#x27;ll get a week in advance).')
