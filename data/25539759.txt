The people that I referred to as &quot;naysayers&quot; were right. I was wasting my time learning about fundamentals and stuff aka reinventing the wheel to understand why something works.<p>Hmmm... I need to reflect on my old perceptions and views now and error correct or rather &quot;bugfix&quot; my brain.<p>Thank you too! :)<p>Edit: to clarify what my goal was in all this:\nBasically, if you understand or rather know something deeply you have &quot;power&quot; (as knowledge will give you power). But again this way of thinking seems to be deeply flawed and employers don&#x27;t appreciate it apparently.')
