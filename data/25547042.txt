Forget studying the same crap for 15-20 years of our lives to have a damn calculator to solve basic adding and subtracting that&#x27;s done on a cash register in our daily lives. How many of you solve out of this world equations in your daily life? 95% of the world doesn&#x27;t. We all use basic add and subtract. Hardly anyone knows how to start a fire, or kill game to survive. If the internet goes out and you can&#x27;t check that daily habit of yours, your life is turned upside down. Its a waste to study all these years to find out you don&#x27;t need to figure out a right side of triangle to drop a tree. If you can count to 10 on your fingers, what&#x27;s the point of an in depth educational system.')
