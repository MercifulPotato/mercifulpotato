As we all know Twitter, Facebook, Google&#x2F;YouTube have been summoned to the senate many times to testify over privacy and such issues.  I am quite sure they are working hard to ensure the future administration is a bit more lenient.<p>We should be more worried over the thousands of other vocal conservatives and constitutionalists who have been deleted in the past 48 hours.  This is silencing freedom of political choice.<p>EDIT: Downvotes shows that cancel culture is alive and well.')
