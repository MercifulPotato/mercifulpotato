I’ve seen it in their IT systems, their design teams are either on crack or got outsourced to 4 year olds and their product&#x2F;sales gurus are a mix of bean counters incapable of producing an original idea and a bunch of lifers running on nepotism.<p>Can confirm. BMW used to be quite innovative, at least on the scale of German automakers, with their connect services. We have a fairly well equipped and fairly new BMW which includes those services. Not only can they get quite expensive (especially their incredibly pretentious concierge service), but their smartphone integration is awful at least (CarPlay is a subscription). The only connected drive services that could be remotely useful are so bad, they&#x27;re basically unusable.<p>&gt; It’s starting to happen and will get even worse, BMW will have a tough decade at least.<p>The only innovation BMW was able to come up with in the last few years is increasing the size of the front grill. I am not sure if BMW is incompetent, ignorant, uncreative or if they&#x27;re just a<i></i>holes (looking at managements behavior during the pandemic, that&#x27;s certainly the case).<p>I doubt that BMW will be able to maintain its independence as a car manufacturer in the long run, unless there are some dramatic changes in line. My guess is that they&#x27;ll be acquired by some other car manufacturer, maybe Daimler (although they face similar challenges), but more likely some huge Chinese company.')
