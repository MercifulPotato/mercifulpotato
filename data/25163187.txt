The author&#x27;s point is the exact opposite: while Ubisoft developers are ok with burning churches (which magically restore themselves), they do not show any of the other Viking raiding acts that have more broad implications. The author&#x27;s problem is with the erasure of the actual viking culture, like slavery, and also with the (possibly unintentional) misogynistic views that the game portrays about weak, effeminate men, etc.')
