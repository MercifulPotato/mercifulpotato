No fundamental assumptions have been broken. Odds are overwhelming that everything will once again happen as it has thousands of times before.<p>A very risky play from a hedge fund has resulted in people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing convincing more people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing that there is a clear ally (other retail investors who are getting back at The Man) and a clear enemy (evil hedge funds that have robbed the American people), and that what they&#x27;re doing is some sort of justice and not just an extreme market correction. They&#x27;ve attached emotions to these trades, and when the time inevitably comes that they have to become The Man to stand with The Man against The Man, a very small percentage will realize what needs to be done to trade another day, while the rest are going to learn how little say they actually had in this incident. WSB (or at least what it was before this) has had a lot of laughs at the expense of the latter group -- &quot;it literally can&#x27;t go tits up!&quot; is trotted out whenever somebody finds out that they&#x27;re not in control.<p>Active retail investment requires a fatalistic view of the market.
