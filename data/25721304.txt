It is a simple and useful skill. They probably were not as good as modern people, but the evidence is reading was not as uncommon as we think.<p>Christans have always had the idea of sexual privacy, something they inherited from the Jews. We have plenty of writing from early Christians that make it clear that they objected to how open the Romans were.<p>The Victorians might have invented the idea that sex is sinful, but no religion surrives long if there are no children, so I&#x27;m not sure how common that belief was. (The shakers of course did have that belief and did well for a few years. I&#x27;m not aware of other groups with such beliefs, though I&#x27;d be surprised if they were alone)')
