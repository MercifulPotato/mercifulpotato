It was simple to setup and send&#x2F;recv was very useful for making backups of the data on a separate machine on the network. I now have been using btrfs as I switched to OpenSuse and frankly it also just works and its been easier to setup as I didn&#x27;t need to do module installs etc. However I&#x27;ve had to switch to rsync for my backups but that wasn&#x27;t hard. The other good thing I&#x27;ve used is the fact I can grow the raid and can rebalance the disks this isn&#x27;t possible on ZFS.')
