It&#x27;s hard to imagine a stronger attempt at walking them in than they received. They got very special treatment from friends with connections.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337011619268882432" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337011619268882432</a>')
