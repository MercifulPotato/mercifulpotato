Yes, Fedora is fast moving and it is what Red Hat uses as the base for major releases, but we&#x27;re more than &quot;Redhat-unstable&quot; in so many ways.<p>CentOS Stream will be the upstream for RHEL minor branch development. This is actually a huge thing that I think people are missing: previously, once branched from Fedora, RHEL development did not happen in the public eye. With Stream, it will. This is huge and awesome good news. However, that development will still be entirely Red Hat curated. This is different from Fedora, where we make community decisions with Red Hat&#x27;s engineering input as a stakeholder but not the decider. (See for example btrfs as the default filesystem.)')
