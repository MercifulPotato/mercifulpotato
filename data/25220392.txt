First, precedent is strongly against the players here. Player stats have never been licensed to my knowledge. It&#x27;s not clear if this is for lack of trying, or if the market for that data used to be superfans, and it was too small to matter.<p>That said, in any argument I tend to side with the underdog. I think it would be great if Athletic voluntarily shared some of their revenue with players! It would be a good move for them, because it would take wind out of the sails of the counter-parties, and it wouldn&#x27;t acknowledge the players right to their data, except tacitly.')
