France built France built over 50 reactors in about 15 years, so obviously a rapid buildup could be done if that ends up being the best option, but that is worthy of its own discussion.<p>My point was that there are advocates who only talk about the cost of nuclear power compared to say the low cost of solar electricity from solar cells in Arizona at noon.  If we are going to only rely on wind&#x2F;solar there are a lot of unknowns about how long term grid storage could work or the costs  of over building of wind&#x2F;solar that might have to be done, etc etc.  Yea that all might just work out, but if it doesn&#x27;t is it better to suffer an existential threat from climate change or use nuclear power?  If people are opposed to nuclear power no matter the consequences, then they should just say that.<p>I think Bill Gates has the right approach here - he is investing in grid storage technologies AND investing in advanced nuclear plant designs.')
