B)Has great quantitative explanatory power.<p>&gt; Watson and Crick were not math savants. They did not have natural gifts.<p>You have a very quaint and naive view of biology. Since  the work of Maynard-Smith at the very least, has rigorous  mathematics taken an important role in biology.  Population genetics,neuroscience, systems biology, biochemistry among others are underpinned by lots of math. People working deciphering all the signaling pathways in the cell are working with what is effectively a complicated,messy but fascinating discretely-encoding program.')
