I often dig through Goodreads to find books or authors I can&#x27;t remember the names of -- and Goodreads isn&#x27;t great for that.<p>Open Library actually provides the missing piece.  The fact that they offer bulk downloads also makes it easier to be a good internet citizen and not send tons of API traffic their way.<p>Looks like I&#x27;ll have to set up a monthly donation.
