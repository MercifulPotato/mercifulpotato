Many police in America are scum, a state of affairs perpetuated by a profound lack of accountability to the public. They can break down the wrong door in the night, murder the innocent occupants, and face no meaningful penalties (let alone meaningful <i>criminal</i> penalties) despite obvious negligence leading up to and during the incident. Given that, one can see how the wrong kind of people (assuming the job is what we naively assume it&#x27;s supposed to be about) are often drawn to police jobs.<p>edit: This is a strongly worded comment. I believe strong words are appropriate when we’re talking about atrocities like the murder of innocents under the color of law. These scum are not a “side” that deserves “equal consideration”—we have a responsibility to figure out what’s true and what isn’t to the best of our abilities, but ultimately we need to strongly condemn evil whenever and wherever it manifests, and the breed of authoritarian cruelty practiced by many American police definitely qualifies.<p>Also note that I have intentionally not said <i>all</i> police are scum, because that’s obviously not true.')
