At the same time, at the end of the graduate school many people loose their passion for science. I would recommend these people to learn how to write code and move to industry. The demand for programmers is pretty high.<p>P.S. I got PhD in theoretical Physics at UC Davis, but moved to Bay Area for a Machine Learning job.<p>I love Physics, and can get back to it after retirement, but right now now I am paid well, and  more flexible. I like that I can choose company and geography. Postdocs and faculty members do not have this luxury.')
