Item(by='avian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609150511, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557469, text='&gt; only works on near constant noise of airplanes and other near constant sources of noise.<p>That is simply not true - at least in my experience with an old model of Sony headphones. It&#x27;s possible that prediction plays some role, but I bought mine with specific purpose of silencing neighbor&#x27;s kids.<p>They work really well with this kind of sporadic, random noise and the difference between turning on active cancellation and just passive attenuation due to ear muffs is very noticeable. I&#x27;m talking about low-frequency noises that are mostly transmitted through the vibrations in the walls and floors - feet hitting the floor while running, ball bouncing of the walls and so on.')
