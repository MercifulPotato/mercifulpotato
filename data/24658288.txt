I can&#x27;t say that I have experienced caste in same light as the article - in many jobs and across many hiring decisions it was never about caste but rather sometimes about language, geography and compatibility. It&#x27;s also a matter of preferences as far as marriage goes - Brahmins for e.g. marrying within is not so much of a given today and whatever percentage of it is still happening is more about familiarity and preferences for culture and language than it is because of the belief that Brahmins are superior caste. They no longer are advantaged either.\nBrahmins really are the new Dalits in India - nowhere to be seen in any power positions, have no affirmative action&#x2F;reservations for college education or jobs, hold no lucrative jobs and thus if not already disadvantaged then certainly on the way to be so.<p>I say that as someone who grew up in a Brahmin family - my dad was discriminated against in his business ample times to cause him to give up early. Both me and my brother had to be academically score perfect grades without fail in order to get into an Engineering college when most disadvantaged cast folks got in for a lot less. The rob Peter to pay Paul thing hasn&#x27;t quite done any net good for society except maybe in times of explosive growth&#x2F;expansion which is to say not too often.')
