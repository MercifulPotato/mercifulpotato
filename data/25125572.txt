I recall that parts of it were already integrated into Firefox, but could someone state what percentage of the Firefox engine is based out of Servo and what the roadmap is for bringing Servo to a stage where it could almost replace Gecko? Does this new home for Servo (and detachment from Mozilla) still mean that Firefox would continue to aim to use it?<p>Tangentially, what’s the headless browser space with Firefox at the core looking like? When would it be able to provide something like Electron (possibly without being such a RAM hungry piece of software)?')
