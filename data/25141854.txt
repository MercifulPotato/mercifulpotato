I started with Firebase, thought it was super cool, then moved to GCP, which was super inflexible (and super shit support). So I decided to try Azure, since we used that at a previous startup, but it was too complicated to even get started. So I decided to give Jeff my money (or rather avail of his free tier), and started using AWS. While it&#x27;s super complicated to use compared to Firebase, it was relatively easy to learn from scratch due to huge amount of support online and what they have on offer. But what honestly stumped me was the HUUUUUUUGE amount of services they have, and the pricing on that. DynamoDB was half the price of Cloud Firestore, the free tier on most services was half that of GCP, and the offerings were insane. Need to host a website? Cloud Front. Launch an app? Lightsail. Satellite connection? Covered. Streaming Data? Kinesis. Queried Database? Elasticsearch. And that&#x27;s just scratching the surface, I know.<p>Honestly, in a few years, I think we&#x27;ll see Google forced to exit this space, Azure and AWS competing on price for big name corporate contracts, while others such as Digital Ocean being crumpled, simply because the AWS offering is so vast and widely supported online. And AWS&#x27; lock-in is pretty damn good.<p>The only solution to break out of such a duopoly would be for tech oriented companies to stop being lazy and start building out their own cloud infra.')
