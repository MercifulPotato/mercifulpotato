Like for example.<p>&gt; <i>The DRA created a five-year &quot;look-back period.&quot; That means that any transfers without fair market value (gifts of any kind) made by the Medicaid applicant during the preceding five years are penalizable.</i>\n<i>The penalty is determined by dividing the average monthly cost of nursing home care in the area or State into the amount of assets gifted. Therefore, if a person gifted $60,000 and the average monthly cost of a nursing home was $6,000, one would divide $6000 into $60,000 and come up with 10. 10 represents the number of months the applicant would not be eligible for medicaid.</i><p>Maybe it&#x27;s me as Italian that am a simpleton, but for me that&#x27;s a cost.<p>If someone parents here get treated in a hospital, they are treated freely.<p>If after 4 years they want to gift their children with a few thousand euros to pay, for example, for their marriage, they don&#x27;t have to worry about it.<p>Worrying has a cost.<p>The incentive of the Medicaid system is to lie about the real entity of the assets one possess.')
