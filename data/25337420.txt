Why not? If anything, they seem like the ultimate in toffery. They just sit there and sneer at others and then rely upon their imagined cleverness to exert dominance. They may not have a huge country estate, but they can sneer and belittle with the best of them.<p>And really do you think that being non-English is a get-out-of-jail-free card here? Are you saying that the Irish aren&#x27;t British? Are you saying that having divorced parents gives you free rein to pretend you&#x27;re not a toff? Are you saying that women can&#x27;t be uppercrust or toffesses?<p>You have such a racist, sexist view and you seem blind to the snide, sneering dominance exerted by contests like this.')
