They &#x27;gamed&#x27; the exchange rate into their advantage.<p>&gt; This behaviour is interesting because it shows that Kelly has a sense of the future and delays gratification. She has realised that a big piece of paper gets the same reward as a small piece and so delivers only small pieces to keep the extra food coming.')
