Case studies and legal stuff.<p>Imagine some day I decide to expose something. What steps should I take? How should I proceed? What&#x27;s the calculus for deciding? I imagine it&#x27;d resemble spy craft.<p>Also, I&#x27;d like some philanthropic group to become a resource for whistleblowers. Pretty much like outreach programs for victims of domestic violence. Anonymous, no strings, coaching. Plus a mountain of cash for legal stuff. I imagine your case worker would help you assess the merits of your case. They&#x27;d plug in some numbers and predict the enormity of the undying hell you&#x27;re about to unleash.<p>I looked a bit after the Sibel Edwards event. The whistleblower NGOs I found seemed little more than a support group with other survivors.<p>I keep thinking of that group of lawyers that&#x27;s made huge money suing pharmaceutical (or maybe it was pharmacists) under the whistleblower statutes. Surely more such groups could pop up, each with their own expertise.')
