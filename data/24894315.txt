These machines are usually tucked behind someone&#x27;s router, and it is hard to tell every router owner to forward the ssh port. When I install a reverse proxy, the machines can proactively tunnel right into a beacon machine whenever they are online and I can ssh into them from the beacon machine directly. I usually set up frpc as a service on the remote machine. It is also possible to use autossh with a monitoring port for this, but I noticed that frpc can bypass firewall restrictions much easier. This scheme also lets me use tools like Cockpit to view the health and status of my remotes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fatedier&#x2F;frp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fatedier&#x2F;frp</a>')
