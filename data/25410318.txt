As in:<p>Encryption: Yes.<p>Multi-factor authentication: Yes.<p>Do they care if the MFA is simply the user pecking at buttons like a bird trained with seeds: No.<p>There is a <i>real problem</i> with Azure AD MFA. Unlike the consumer MFA, it shows you exactly zero information about the source of the information. None. You get a choice of &quot;approve&quot; or &quot;do not approve&quot;. You don&#x27;t get any input information for making this decision.<p>Hacking this is trivial. If you know someone&#x27;s password, you just have to occasionally try logging in. <i>Eventually</i> the user will accidentally click approve even though they didn&#x27;t trigger the authentication.<p>You&#x27;d assume that nobody would ever fall for something like this, because <i>surely</i> nobody would be so stupid as to approve an MFA prompt they didn&#x27;t trigger.<p>Meanwhile, my Microsoft Authenticator app triggers randomly about 5-10 times per day because every single MS app insists on &quot;reauthenticating&quot; me every 24 hours. So I&#x27;ll be sitting at my desk and my phone will pop it up randomly. I&#x27;ll look up, and sure enough, Teams wants me to re-MFA for some stupid reason.<p>I&#x27;m paranoid enough that I&#x27;ll always reject these MFA prompts and then start the login cycle manually, but most people would just peck the button like a trained bird.<p>Similarly, I&#x27;ve run scripts before that needed 6 MFA prompts to complete (don&#x27;t ask). I ran the script once and it asked 7 times... uh-oh. Is this an Azure bug, or a hacker from China? <i>How could I possibly know?!</i> The information is not provided to me!<p>This is Microsoft&#x27;s fault, 110%, and I dare anyone here to argue otherwise.<p>So instead of reaching for the downvote button, make your case on how &quot;yes, yes, yes, yes&quot; is not a security disaster below in the comments please.')
