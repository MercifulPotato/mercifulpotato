Item(by='wesammikhail', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606754580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253183, text='&gt; Think about all those people who always worked more than everybody else and sacrificed everything just to fail.<p>&gt; But always remember, romanticizing hard work only does good for society but very rarely for the individual.<p>If you dont think hard work does good for the individual, then you are not only mistaken but most likely trying to justify your laziness more than anything else. And if you think the input size of your labor has to be proportional to the output size of success&#x2F;failure, then youÂ´ve completely misunderstood the relationship between labor and success.<p>Hard work on its own is <i></i>insufficient<i></i> to success - there are many other factors required (timing, capital, support&#x2F;network, etc.) - yet it is <i></i>required<i></i> for success because having all the other factors come together without hard work to bind them leads to abject failure most often. And sure, you can talk about the few exceptions to the rule that got lucky, we can all envy those. But unless you are one those people who got lucky, <i></i>you have no better strategy available to you if you want to succeed<i></i>.<p>Besides, hard work has an insane amount of benefits to it even if failure is the outcome. You learn new things all the time, you connect with people that may become your greatest supporters in the future, you grow as a person and most importantly when you look in the mirror you come to respect yourself because you choose to bear a burden that few are willing to. Most people dont take risks, most people dont work hard, and most people would rather smoke weed and chill on a couch rather than work on something that will enrich their lives be it financially or otherwise. <i></i>Hard work is the only reliable strategy available for the average person<i></i> to become a better version of themselves and with that create a better future for themselves AND society.<p>So no, hard work does not &quot;rarely&quot; do good for the individual. It most often does good for the individual. The probelm with your statement is that you are equating &quot;good&quot; with &quot;success&quot; (mostly financial) and those two things are very very different from each other.')
