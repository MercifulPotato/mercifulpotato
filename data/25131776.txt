But we still burn it for fuel. And iron is far more abundant.<p>Also, I&#x27;m no chemist but I imagine it&#x27;s a lot easier to strip an oxygen atom or two off of an iron oxide molecule than to string together a bunch of water and atmospheric CO2 molecules into a complex hydrocarbon. So we can convert the combustion byproducts back into fuel much more easily with iron.')
