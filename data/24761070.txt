It&#x27;s my course, in case that wasn&#x27;t clear. Should have probably stated as much, but hopefully it&#x27;s still what you&#x27;re looking for. The free courses (the two linked above) are more than enough to get people started on KiCad and the other course resources are only if people want to keep following along.<p>ESP32 is QUITE beefy, actually (and power hungry). But the STM32MP series is nice too, that&#x27;s a newer offering. I think it comes down to how you&#x27;d prefer to develop code, especially at the beginning. If you&#x27;re looking for an Arduino type solution, you will find a ton of resources for the ESP32. As for RAM, I interviewed a guy on my podcast (Mike Fikes) who actually put Clojure Script on an ESP32...so it can handle some pretty high level stuff! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contextualelectronics.com&#x2F;cep005-clojure-script-on-hardware-with-mike-fikes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contextualelectronics.com&#x2F;cep005-clojure-script-on-h...</a><p>One thing I always encourage is that people follow the best examples and kits and tutorials they can on the internet. There are LOTS of things that can go wrong, and premature optimization for a production level component can lead to a lot of frustration and diving down the wrong rabbit holes. Best to follow good examples and make mistakes later (ie. I don&#x27;t know how many examples of STM32WP projects there are on the internet yet)')
