At one point my brain interpreted the shifting red taillights in front of me as a game of Tetris.  That&#x27;s when I knew it was too dangerous to continue so I pulled over (rest stop was close by) and took a 15 minute nap.  I found that powernaps like this are really effective at energizing me past browning out and letting me finish the drive safely.<p>Measures like opening windows in the middle of winter, playing loud music, pinching, etc. stop working eventually and a nap really is the only way out.')
