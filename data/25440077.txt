Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608104779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439701, text='&gt; I think the lack of progress is due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how democracy functions and drives progress.<p>I assume you mean <i>people&#x27;s perception of</i> the lack of progress.  Actual physical progress is independent of the public&#x27;s perception of it, I would think.<p>&gt; Meaningful progress is only made when persuasion occurs.<p>Makes sense.  I pay fairly close attention to the variety and nature of political persuasion, and I find it rather....<i>interesting</i>.  I think a fair argument can be made that it is often exerted in directions that seem inconsistent with the general well being of the population.<p>&gt; The biggest trick ever played on the public is telling them they are disenfranchised and that the system is rigged.<p>I agree that that is &quot;a&quot; trick, but I don&#x27;t agree that it is the biggest one, by a long shot.  Actually, I think there&#x27;s more than a little evidence that suggests there&#x27;s a fair amount of truth to it.<p>&gt; If people spent 5% of the time and effort they spent lamenting corruption or political advertising on persuasion, change would advance at a rapid pace.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine how this could be true.  Who would be the parties being persuaded in this scenario, and how would that exert influence on the amount of change?<p>And then looking at it from another perspective: compare the change in well being of the average person in China versus the USA over the last 10 to 20 years - does the above explain the entirety of the differential?  Or, might there be some other variables in play here?')
