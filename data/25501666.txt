A quick google shows that 7% of Tesla&#x27;s 2019 revenue was selling credits.  While sure, that&#x27;s of the same order as the profit, you can&#x27;t make an argument that &quot;all&quot; of the profit was credits for basic fungibility reasons.  &quot;All&quot; of the profit could be any 7% chunk of revenue.<p>And 7% is like half a year of profits growth in this cases for a company that is still growing rapidly and finding efficiencies.<p>It&#x27;s spin, again.  And I genuinely don&#x27;t understand why so much of it continues to be deployed against this company when it keeps proving it wrong.')
