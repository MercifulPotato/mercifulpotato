Soft, they get scratched easily (most of them at least, I know a few types that are scratch-resistant), they show wear and tear in a much more unpleasant way than metal, glass or wood.</i><p>Most of the visible metal bits in any consumer electronic will be aluminum, which is notoriously soft (softer than gold) and scratches easily. Likewise, most any product made of wood (moving beyond electronics now) will be made of a wood that&#x27;s soft enough to scratch easily. I&#x27;m not convinced that scratch-resistance is the metric for instinctively classifying the cheapness of a material.')
