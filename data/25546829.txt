They said that the flight was delayed (5-6h) due to &#x27;unforeseen circumstances&#x27;. When I reached out to them for the â‚¬200 they claimed that they will not, as it is was not their fault and for security reasons they cannot disclose to me the &#x27;why&#x27;.<p>I got a very close friend working for Wizz. He told me that this is the boilerplate BS email they send to all such requests, to scare them off. Reading it one may thing &quot;oh there may have been a terror-related thing, better not bother the CIA-FBI-NSA-PoPo-MI5-MI6-MI99... and that I should reach out to the responsible regulator and I&#x27;d get my money back. Which I did. I included the BS email. I assume the regulator didn&#x27;t buy the BS email from Wizz and I got paid. 3 months later, but Wizz lying bastards didn&#x27;t get away with it.')
