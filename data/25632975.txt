Where is all the nuance? Reality can&#x27;t be reduced to a simple &quot;X is bad&quot; narrative.<p>This narrative overshadows the actual issues, and thus produces nonsense. Note that nearly nobody talks about the ACTUAL financial issue, which is that Ant&#x27;s way of dealing with money is very dangerous and has the potential to cause a financial crisis.<p>Yes I know the regulator&#x27;s timing is suspicious. But to completely ignore the actual issue, or to casually brush it away as an illegitimate distraction, and instead to focus 100% on just the &#x27;CCP bad&#x27; narrative, is just sensationalism, stereotyping and oversimplification.')
