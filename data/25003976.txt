Another use for having multiple Debian subsystems (what Bedrock calls &quot;strata&quot;) is to serve as a low risk alternative to an in-place dist-upgrade: If anything doesn&#x27;t work as desired in the new Debian release, just keep using the previous one until you get it working; once everything&#x27;s migrated over, you&#x27;ve effectively dist-upgraded and can (if you wish) remove the old stratum.<p>I&#x27;m Bedrock&#x27;s founder and lead developer.  If you have any questions about it I&#x27;m happy to answer them.')
