Item(by='pavlov', descendants=None, kids=[25369011], score=None, time=1607567571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368577, text='<i>&gt; &quot;per your profile, you work at Facebook (which I assume making well over $250k a year) and yet your pushing for a socialist agenda?&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m originally from Finland. Now that I&#x27;ve been living in America for a while, I can compare both.<p>The modest success I&#x27;ve had in life is largely thanks to Finland&#x27;s safety net and accessible opportunities. I received free college education in a specialist field (film post-production).<p>When I started a little software startup in said field, the Finnish government gave me small grants and loans to help me along. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about healthcare during those &quot;ramen profitable&quot; years. The company wasn&#x27;t a big success by any measure, but it helped me build a network.<p>Thanks to so-called socialism, I didn&#x27;t have student debt and didn&#x27;t need rich relatives to go into business on my own. But that&#x27;s not a story that fits the American idea of entrepreneurship, I guess.<p>Although my current job at $BIGTECH pays well, the expenses are also calibrated very differently. Preschool for my kid costs close to $3k&#x2F;month, which is more than 10x what anyone pays in Finland. The quality of the education is similar. I plan to move back to Finland when the kids are a bit older. It&#x27;s just a more stable place to raise a family.')
