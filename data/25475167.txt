On the other hand trying to tax money out of poor people is rather pointless, strategically speaking. Or desperate. People with no money can&#x27;t effectively support a modern industrial state - we need industrialists, high-paid labour and craftspeople.<p>So from that perspective it isn&#x27;t at all clear to me why the government needs to treat some citizens differently than others. The approach advocated in this article makes sense. As long as everyone gets an opportunity, the situation is fair.')
