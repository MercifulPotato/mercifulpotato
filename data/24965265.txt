When I first read it I felt for the first time I understood how the game is scored. These two quotes stand out and are what matter:<p>&gt; Persuadable voters trust the parties on different issues. And there’s a pretty basic pattern — both here and in other countries — in which voters view center-left parties as empathetic. Center-left parties care about the environment, lowering poverty, improving race relations. And then, you know, center-right parties are seen as more “serious,” or more like the stern dad figure or something. They do better on getting the economy going or lowering unemployment or taxes or crime or immigration.<p>&gt;  So I think Democrats need to talk about the issues they are with us on, and try really hard not to talk about the issues where we disagree. Which, in practice, means not talking about immigration.<p>That&#x27;s the game for both sides: Talk about issues non-partisan voters trust and&#x2F;or agree with your side on, and avoid the opposite.<p>Simple in theory. Impossibly hard in practice.')
