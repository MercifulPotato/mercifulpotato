Item(by='nytgop77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609108528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554263, text='Your summary is totally right. But first part of the comment feels too one-sided (pro-saas). So couple of balancing thoughts for each point.<p>(1). Tractor analogy seems too extreme - it&#x27;s about skiping automation in farming. But if one skips saas, one still automates in house (the amplifier is the automation).\nAlso, frequently &quot;saas&quot; feels less like &quot;tech&quot; and more like &quot;outsourcing&quot;.<p>(2) Total cost of ownership applies to saas as well. Lawyer&#x27;s time for contract. Developer\\architect time to figure out documentation, so company would know what configuration to ask for. \nCommunication being external also costs time.<p>(3) Solutions for data ownership exist, but it&#x27;s one additional thing to worry about.')
