Like the bricklayer, or plumber you don&#x27;t want &quot;creative&quot; so much as reproducible quality which comes from experience. So in that regard craftsman is partially right too. Traditional factory work OTOH had painters, machinist, welders, etc. All of which were highly skilled labor, but their jobs like a blacksmith making nails or plumber brazing pipe frequently were just repetitive application of that skill. One might even say that these painting reproduction shops are in this camp as well despite being &quot;art&quot;.<p>So its the same with software, yes you have a framework, but the act of building out forms using that framework to CRUD up some data somewhere is frequently quite repetitive despite differing colors and button placement.')
