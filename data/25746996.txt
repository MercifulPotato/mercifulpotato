This comes from both the left and right with numerous benign&#x2F;extreme examples.<p>Meanwhile the same people supporting social media bans will scream about how traditional news (murdoch as a private example) promote speech that they don&#x27;t like. Those people will also complain about the speech not allowed&#x2F;censored from traditional news platforms.<p>So which is it? Are we talking about the rights of private companies? or are we genuinely talking about free speech? How can you have it one way for social media and another way for traditional news?<p>I don&#x27;t think social media or traditional news monopolies should be dictating the voices we hear.')
