He did not follow prior disclosure guidelines that you&#x27;d expect in a penetration testing scenario.<p>In all honesty, disclosing these loopholes would&#x27;ve been unfruitful. Unless exploited, lawmakers would not have put much effort into closing these loopholes, and many would&#x27;ve been very likely to take advantage of them themselves. And big complex entities like the EU would be very slow to fix anything anyway, and it is likely that any fix would&#x27;ve left other openings to exploit.<p>From an engineering perspective, a system like the finance and tax legislation of the EU and it&#x27;s member states is a massive, monolithic, legacy fraught and overhead encumbered system where the engineers of it cannot foresee exploits in their system, have no tools to test the system before launch, and are often incentivised to deliberately leave openings to be exploited.')
