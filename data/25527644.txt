An app is not the best way to learn piano. Piano is not just about pressing keys. Does the app correct your position (important if you don&#x27;t want to get fatigue and cramps), your volume, fingerings, etc? Does it tell you how to practice the parts where you&#x27;re struggling?<p>&gt; connect it to an el cheapo midi keyboard<p>Please don&#x27;t do that. I mean, if you just want to give it a try to piano and not spend anything, yeah, go ahead, but a small keyboard with non-weighted keys will limit you a lot, even early on. The sound is terrible, you won&#x27;t be able to control the volume properly, and getting a better technique to play better and faster will be far more difficult. Not to mention that at some point you will try to use the extra keys and if they&#x27;re are not there you can&#x27;t do anything. If you want to seriously take up piano, just buy a decent keyboard at the start, you&#x27;ll end up needing it anyways.<p>Edit: Don&#x27;t get me wrong, anything that gets more people into playing music is good. But I think it&#x27;s also good if people know the advantages and limitations of the method they use to learn, and are able to choose the method that fits their expectations. If you just want to poke your nose into piano playing maybe an app is enough for you, but there are no shortcuts and no magic method.')
