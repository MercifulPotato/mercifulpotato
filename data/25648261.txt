I could be wrong but I think that would be a mistake. I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of printers and I&#x27;ve never met one that felt like they needed innovation. Printing is an industry that begrudgingly accepts innovation when it&#x27;s forced upon them.<p>On the consumer end of things, I suspect you&#x27;ll struggle to get people to pay much for the use of the software itself. Many people might simply take inspiration from your work, then do it themselves if they&#x27;re going to print it themselves anyway. But they would likely pay a premium for on-demand printing.<p>All that being said, I could be projecting. The aspect of this product that I would personally pay for is the ability to have my custom designed notebook printed and shipped to me. That&#x27;s very valuable to me as a notebook lover. If I print it myself, the quality will suck. If I design it myself, it&#x27;ll suck.<p>But if I can use your app to drag and drop beautifully-designed components and then have it magically appear at my door? Take my money, please.<p>That&#x27;s my 2 cents, anyway. Good luck! I hope you find wild success with this no matter what direction you take, because the idea is that good IMHO.')
