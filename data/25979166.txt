I use it in an Equalizer APO filter chain on my gaming machine along with an EQ and compressor which are fed from a dynamic mic.  I consistently get comments about the quality of my mic setup in-game and on Discord.<p>The best part is that it has almost no impact on voice quality, unlike Krisp and some other options I have tried.  Singing into the filter chain even sounds good, with the exception of when my 5 year old daughter joins in.  rnnnoise seems to think that her voice is noise and tries to intermittently filter it out, which causes a volume warble while we sing together.  To be fair, 99.9% of the time her voice should definitely be considered noise I want filtered out.  ;)')
