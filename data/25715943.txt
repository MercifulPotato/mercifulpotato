I think that is highly dependent on housing costs and how early you retire.  If you have kids who are not in college (and live where college is not free) and have not paid off your house, 1MM in retirement is a woefully small amount of money (I think?). At 5% withdrawal (risky), you are living on 50K a year, 30K post-tax.  That&#x27;s not even going to cover your mortgage in many cases, much less other living costs.')
