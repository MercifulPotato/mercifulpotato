Item(by='zo1', descendants=None, kids=[24903476], score=None, time=1603715561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891654, text='The methods have changed, the motivation and net result is the same: opinion and thought control.<p>Tech has made it impersonal, clinical, obfuscated, random and ubiquitous. There is no need to &quot;send people to gulags&quot; or torture them in order to suppress their ability to sow dissent amongst their peers. That is the sole purpose, even if it&#x27;s algorithmic and emergent without a central &quot;dictator&quot; controlling what can or can&#x27;t be said. Essentially only approved opinions and movements are allowed to gather steam, no different to the movement of dissent and mistrust of the government that had to be stemmed previously using gulags.<p>So yes, you are 100% right it&#x27;s not the same and we are not being sent to re-education camps. But that doesn&#x27;t mean certain individuals are not being persecuted through &quot;random&quot; algorithms that target and marginalize them. As another poster here mentioned, censorship does not need to be absolute for it to have an effect. You also mentioned network effects earlier: I would urge you to consider what &quot;network effects&quot; are occurring due to mild and moderate censorship that is not absolute.')
