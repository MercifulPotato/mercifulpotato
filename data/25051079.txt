Item(by='prohobo', descendants=None, kids=[25051200], score=None, time=1605038670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25050159, text='This tacit acceptance of a &quot;newsfeed flooded with false&#x2F;defamatory information&quot; when it happens to support one obvious partisan side is, frankly, something embarrassing to have to see.<p>I have no interest in defending the Trump administration except to point out that what you are supporting is, in fact, a hypocrisy. I can think of four examples which I <i>know</i> are hypocrisies that make it through the supposed &quot;fake news&quot; filter.<p>1) Russiagate, an unsubstantiated hoax promoted in the media for 3 years leading to countless defamatory attacks on Trump, and millions of dollars spent on investigations.<p>2) Cambridge Analytica, a tactic used by Obama&#x27;s campaign which was praised in 2011 as being a new progressive way to reach voters, and then miraculously became an act of corruption when Trump did the same thing in 2016.<p>3) &quot;Mostly peaceful protests&quot;, an ongoing gross misrepresentation of what normal people would call riots.<p>4) &quot;Trump supporters are racist white men&quot;, an ongoing smear of the Trump administration and emotional abuse towards the Trump base (or anyone who doesn&#x27;t buy into the narrative), which has been proven absolutely false by the latest election.<p>So which is it? You do or you don&#x27;t want a newsfeed flooded with false&#x2F;defamatory information? Just allow the stuff you don&#x27;t personally see as false&#x2F;defamatory?<p>This is an extremely dangerous problem, and people need to start waking up to it instead of thinking they got it all figured out, as if Alex Jones yelling at frogs is the reason everything is falling apart.<p>The fragmentation of reality which we&#x27;re seeing (Trumpers, leftists, QAnon, flat earth, 5G, etc.) will NOT be solved by slowing down how fast people can &quot;like&quot; something. The entire internet is broken, and the social media platforms need massive rewiring. We need to properly research the ways the current platforms poison discourse, and find remedies that work to dissolve fragmentation and help people communicate better.<p>Currently, things are rapidly spinning out of control, and the social media platforms have decided to opt for totalitarianism. As they ban and hamstring everyone who doesn&#x27;t buy in, good or bad, those people will find each other on the decentralized internet. This is creating a powder-keg for narrative chaos and conflict.')
