It appears when new money is deposited on exchanges and OTC desks. It&#x27;s simply a database for USD deposits. Some exchanges use MySQL to track their deposits. Tether allows transfering deposits between exchanges, in contrary to MySQL-dollars. There&#x27;s way more MySQL-dollars being &quot;printed&quot; than Tethers. People pay attention to Tether because it&#x27;s a transparent system.<p>If Tether is not fully backed, it&#x27;s a problem for those who own Tether. Tether is not a problem to Bitcoin.')
