It&#x27;s interesting that so many US citizens of African descent expect to go back to &quot;The Old Country,&quot; and &quot;just fit in.&quot; Lot like the Italians and Irish.<p>As far as Africans go, there&#x27;s not a whole ton of difference between white Americans and black Americans. I think that, like in Europe, there&#x27;s entrepreneurs, setting up &quot;Return to Your Roots&quot; tours for diasporans.<p>Europe probably has more experience with Africans than the US. When I have met black folk in Europe, they have frequently been first- or second-generation Africans, as opposed to the US, where most black folks I know come from families that have lived here for many generations. I think the UK has a similar culture.<p>I lived in Uganda, when Idi Amin threw out all the Ugandans of Indian descent. These were true Ugandans, who had lived there for generations. It was devastating; both to the people that were thrown out, and the nation, itself. The infrastructure of the nation collapsed, almost overnight.<p>It&#x27;s pretty much impossible to &quot;un-mix&quot; a mixed society. That&#x27;s not for want of trying, though. History is full of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; boneyards. It never seems to end well, but we seem to be a bit thick, in learning the lesson.')
