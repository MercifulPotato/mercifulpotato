Item(by='biscotti', descendants=None, kids=[25022193], score=None, time=1604798142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015967, text='&quot;Racist&quot; mentioned in this thread dozens of times along with fascists all the usual derogatory buzzwords. Communist and woke both worryingly have less mentions considering the context. Bolshevism suprisingly has got no mentions considering what the YCombinator Alumni Michael Simon tweeted and the platform he set up.<p>Anywho, I digress. I believe those in here to be intelligent and educated so I would ask you to take your partisan hats off for a minute if you&#x27;re honest and consider when AZ goes Trump this is the time for you to start freaking out.<p>The mainstream media has been extremely irresponsible and the forthcoming riots when this is overturned are going to lay squarely on their feet. I would also ask those of you who have a conscience to be less irresponsible than journalists over these coming weeks until December in an attempt to reduce said damage.<p>I say this because if you think Biden is going to be your president you haven&#x27;t been watching carefully enough.<p>Also dang if you will please change the title. Biden hasn&#x27;t won anything yet - as you know the media doesn&#x27;t declare winners esp not given their woeful conduct and bogus calls (AZ), states have to certify before a winner is declared. Also please ask PG to be more responsible with his tweets if he will listen. This will reflect badly on all involved.<p>Thankyou.<p>Edited to add: I don&#x27;t see Next Page at the bottom of the pages in this story, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s bugged...')
