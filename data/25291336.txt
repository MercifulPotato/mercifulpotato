I had issues with a contractor who couldn&#x27;t figure it out and it partially lead to us abandoning that version of the project ( on v3 now, had to change direction though).<p>Unreal is significantly harder than Unity, unless you stick to blueprints. Unreal&#x27;s  C++ is a harder language than Unity&#x27;s C#.<p>Plus I find Unity&#x27;s community to be much more newbie friendly. Unreal tends to heavily tilt towards massive projects. Unity treats mobile as a first class citizen and it&#x27;s very easy to get started.<p>Then again, I&#x27;ve been using Unity since 2012 roughly, had I started with Unreal I might have a different opinion.')
