Much of the public swore off checking and savings accounts, never mind owning stocks.<p>It seems like the big money is changing its clothes to pose as children in order to get priority on the life boats (&quot;Women and children first!&quot;).<p>The social circle of firms closely connected to this ruin of Robinhood and which had been short GME are the speculators. Short for longer than intraday == speculative. Short as a market maker for an hour or two is good for efficient clearing.<p>It&#x27;s on the guys with the big money to gather their fortitude and ride this out in the most-trust-inducing ways they can. I think the big money is naive if they think it could be otherwise.<p>One more thing, I am reminded that a lot of the time, a retail investor will buy something, a weak stock, and ride it down to zero out of misguided optimism. Conducting margin calls on zero notice is going to be toxic to such people and I don&#x27;t think the finance world really wants that money to leave the market for good.')
