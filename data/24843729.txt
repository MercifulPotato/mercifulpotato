They did this because they are incompetent and were in the pocket of the CCP.<p>If you want to fault this guy for something it&#x27;s trusting the data out of China at all and even considering it appropriate to do analysis with those numbers.<p>Again, 170k estimated vs 220k actual deaths is not a huge difference when dealing with a highly multiplicative event like a pandemic.')
