At a minimum I would think they would pretty equal as far risk and ease if you&#x27;re rebuilding.<p>My workloads are mostly containerized at this point so the host OS is pretty insignificant overall.  Perhaps you&#x27;re in the same boat, although I&#x27;d still think it&#x27;s at worst equal, at best easier to stick with RHEL flavored.')
