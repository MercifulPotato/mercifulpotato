I would recommend sticking with it through at least the beginning of the second season, which is mainly about longshoremen and unions, before passing judgment.<p>I usually recommend people make it through season 2 before deciding they&#x27;re in it for the long haul (bearing in mind that 2 seasons is already quite a haul, especially for such a dense show). It&#x27;s my experience that people get turned off by the jump from the expected gangsters-and-cops to the more &quot;boring&quot; Longshore men storyline (though like many, I appreciated season 2 a lot more in retrospect).')
