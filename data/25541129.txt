Item(by='zw123456', descendants=None, kids=[25541338], score=None, time=1608953172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25540563, text='I agree, the heist angle was something that came to my mind, it would work if they somehow knew that the blast would take out the generator back up and if they knew that that C.O. only had one entrance facility or some vulnerability like that, which would mean some inside knowledge. Often C.O.&#x27;s have dual entrance vaults which it would make sense for bank alarms to be redundant, but if they got the generator or something. They went out of their way to try not to hurt anyone which seems more like maybe an Oceans 11 type heist. I guess if come Monday morning a bunch of banks have been hit we will know, but I would think that the cops are standing guard at all he banks right now.  Highly unlikely but who knows.')
