He is the only motherfucker on Earth who has continued to accumulate billions of dollars while pretending he is giving it all away. He could have done so much more but decided not to because he’s a selfish jerk. The fact that people on his payroll did a great deal of good work does not make Bill Gates a good person. Bill Gates is and always was and likely always will be a terrible person. I suppose it is refreshing that he has some conscience and isn’t an outright monster in every facet of his life.<p>While it’s true that Bill Gates’s philanthropic efforts have salvaged his moral reputation, it is not true that he deserves it. A culture that didn’t worship billionaires would scorn him for the criminal and gluttonous dirtbag that he his. Anyone with his amount of wealth can’t pretend to be generous.')
