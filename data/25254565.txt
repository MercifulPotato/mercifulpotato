They reflect on the different facets of the experience they’re going through. They have self awareness, and cultural awareness. They’re in a hard spot and have some desire to change- and while they beat themselves up a little bit about it they also understand that this self-judgement may not be healthy either!<p>To the author, please keep it up. You remind me a little of me at 25 yet much more articulate and aware. Keep asking the questions, keep paying attention to your feelings, keep on trudging the path. And therapy could really help! Good luck.')
