You have room&#x2F;game being created on the fly and it is destroyed an hour later. There are many of these rooms and they are distributed over multiple machines. You can&#x27;t really use rabbitMQ here, it&#x27;s not performant enough.<p>And even if you did, you would pretty much reimplement what Akka Cluster does for you: instance synchronization, different strategies for handling split brain scenarios, dead letter handling, direct message forwarding, persistence (if needed) and so on')
