We&#x27;re pushing very hard for a culture which embraces the limitations of the protocol. Anyone who even thinks about extensions has the fury of the mailing list wrought upon them as soon as they propose them.<p>And Gemini is so simple that it&#x27;s difficult to monetize. There&#x27;s not much corporate incentive here. I think that corporations will continue to use the web, because the web was basically hand-designed for corporate needs - even going so far as to do so at the expense of the users.<p>&gt;You can make a Gemini client in two weeks?<p>Two <i>afternoons</i>. And a stated goal of the specification is not to add substantial changes.<p>We can decentralize the internet <i>and</i> serve Gemini over our new, decentralized space. We can work on more than just one of THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMSâ„¢ at a time, you know.')
