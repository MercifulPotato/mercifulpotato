I would likely boycott the company. I don&#x27;t think there would be a legal issue, though.<p>I always hate this part of these comment threads; there is always a lot of conflation between legal and moral responsibilities.... I hate that people who think this sort of censorship is ok (and I am actually one of them) try to argue from a legal standpoint.... I am pretty sure almost everyone agrees that Wordpress isn&#x27;t breaking the law here, so why argue that point?<p>As for the moral argument, I don&#x27;t think I am being hypocritical to say it is morally ok to censor some things but not others. Not everything is the same.<p>In fact, I think even the most die hard free speech absolutists are ok with anti-fraud laws. No one is arguing that is ok to host a typo-squatting website pretending I am amazon and harvest login credentials. No one would say we can&#x27;t take down that site because of free speech.<p>So, what we are really arguing about is degree; how fraudulent does something have to be in order for it to be ok to censor?<p>Personally, I think the decision should be made on a combination of the certainty that the content is false, along with the harm the content can cause. Fake amazon site is clearly false and clearly harmful; automatic censoring.<p>Flat earth society? Clearly false, but depending on what the site is advocating, it might be mostly harmless.<p>Part of the harm determination is also going to be based on evidence; how many people have we seen be tricked by the false information?<p>Basically, I don&#x27;t think this is one of those issues that you can have a clear rule for, which is probably why programmers have such a hard time with the concept and default to saying we shouldn&#x27;t even try.')
