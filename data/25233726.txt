We&#x27;ll be releasing what you described soon - the  reason it isn&#x27;t fully released yet is that you still need some kind of conference call link, and having two links gets a bit awkward for viewers. We&#x27;re also working on a way to record video with synchronized slide advancement for an asynchronous  &quot;meeting&quot; with the same intended effect. Let me know if you want to chat or check it out.')
