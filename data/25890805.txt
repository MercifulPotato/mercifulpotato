Every time I visit a new area or country, I&#x27;m immediately unpleasantly surprised by the taste of the water, but within a few days I forget that there ever was a difference and wouldn&#x27;t even notice what was different if I tried to be conscious of it. I always see people traveling to another country complain that the &quot;water doesn&#x27;t taste good&quot; there, implying that it is of lower quality or unsafe, and it usually just makes me chuckle because people traveling in the opposite direction will say the same thing.<p>Of course, this article is about water that is potentially hazardous which is a real problem.')
