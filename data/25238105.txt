Same day shipping has very limited availability here in Germany with a fairly limited inventory, most items are next day shipping. I ordered a product at 3AM with a huge text claiming &quot;same day delivery when ordering within the next 5h&quot;. The order arrived at 8PM the next day, which was relatively annoying considering the same day arrival heavily influenced my purchasing decision.')
