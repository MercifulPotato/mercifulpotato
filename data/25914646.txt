Ada, despite being in the older age for computer languages was specifically designed with embedded programming and safety features in mind and does this quite good.<p>It also supports OOP if you want that sort of thing and more crucially has pretty good concurrency support build into the language while still being reasonably safe. With SPARK&#x2F;Ada you even get a language variant that can be formally proven. To name some more modern use cases.')
