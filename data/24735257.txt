Item(by='neltnerb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602284223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24730348, text='Yes, this is very close to my area of expertise, my previous job title was director of chemical process development but I&#x27;ve got my degrees in materials science and physics so I think I mostly understand what they&#x27;re doing in a broad sense if not the details at small scale. But yes, a 5% energy efficiency gain would be an enormous deal for some chemicals like ammonia. A 1% efficiency gain there is last I checked 2 power plants per year that could be taken offline in response to the lost demand.<p>But for most chemicals the energy efficiency is important while material efficiency is more important. Usually there are tradeoffs. For instance I have made a chemical to 99.8% purity without a ton of purification. If it were to 99% then I&#x27;d have to spend a lot more energy to reach 99.8% purity (which happened to be required to be useful as a product). But the process to reach 99% is simpler and uses less energy than the process to reach 99.8%. So really it&#x27;s just an optimization problem where you definitely cannot assume that improving the yield or efficiency of one part of the system will result in an <i>overall</i> efficiency improvement unless you model it all.<p>The problem is that it is premature to talk about energy efficiency in any remotely meaningful way here because the &quot;big box&quot; you need to draw around your system is vastly bigger when you&#x27;re talking about a complicated plant doing by my count at least a dozen (including heating, cooling, separations, etc) processes simultaneously.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that their idea wouldn&#x27;t work in that context, I am simply saying that at TRL 2-3, if this were me doing the work, we would have noted the amine issue and deferred it until a later TRL level because it&#x27;s theoretically a non-core technology to remove it. It doesn&#x27;t tell you much about your throughput of your membrane or what salt gradients it works with or how to power it -- that&#x27;s what I would expect them to be focusing on.<p>Removing the amine would be like TRL 3-4 maybe, if they&#x27;re on the ball, but they have to attack the problems most likely to result in failure first. Amine contamination is way lower on a priority list than, say, the membrane rupturing every seventeen days. That&#x27;s literally just more where I would guess they are at development-wise, regardless of whatever claims they make.<p>I just cannot trust claims made at that TRL level, at best they&#x27;re extremely optimistic guesses extrapolated from a 1L benchtop apparatus they are trying to model a whole plant using data from. It&#x27;s a good thing to do. It won&#x27;t give a correct answer, but it will give you an idea of what&#x27;s important at least.')
