This ends up requiring you to pin to a specific nightly build date. And then the ecosystem that might also be relying on night starts to shift, and all the sudden you don’t have a stable build anymore.<p>I never experience that on stable, and it’s been my primary reason for not recommending Rocket for so long, even though that it’s an excellent library in all other regards. (I believe it’s working with stable in the master branch at this point, and just waiting on a release of 0.5).')
