I was absolutely blown away at how much I loved this book.  I sat down to read it and ending up losing 4 hours to it!<p>The book inspired me to build a little course on Awk to (hopefully) share the love: \n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FreedomBen&#x2F;awk-hack-the-planet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FreedomBen&#x2F;awk-hack-the-planet</a>.<p>I gave that course as a talk at Linux Fest Northwest in 2019 and then again in 2020 due to popularity.  When Covid hit I recorded videos and put them on Youtube.  There are links in the Github page above if you want to watch them.<p>I wasn&#x27;t intending to self plug, but I guess it does feel relevant :-)')
