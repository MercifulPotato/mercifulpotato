Or if CT is SF, where is the corresponding Oakland?<p>I live in NYC, and my view of CT is that its modern identity is dominated by being a suburb to NYC, with a handful of big and old businesses in the big cities to keep domestic economy afloat.<p>The places in my mind that don&#x27;t fit this model are all east of New Haven, at which point CT starts to be &quot;Coastal New England&quot;, a region that, excepting Boston, continues up to Bar Harbor, ME.<p>But my view is obviously biased by my limited experience, I&#x27;m curious to hear more of your perspective.')
