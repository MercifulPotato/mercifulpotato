Should have been done a long tome ago for both FAT32 &amp; NTFS as well as all other file systems which are intended for widespread use.<p>It&#x27;s just not something where you want to have a moving target, it basicaly needs to stay the same forever once it gets into widespread use.<p>Important data is too important for any less than truly standard file sysstems.')
