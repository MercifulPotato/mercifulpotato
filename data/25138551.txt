It was packed with ideas which were just coming into focus in my own mind after 10 years in the industry, but I didn&#x27;t have names for them or have them systematized.  It&#x27;s a terrific feeling reading a well-written book like that and going &#x27;Yes! Yes! Yes!&#x27;.<p>(Since then, as with many things in our industry, it seems  the book has been turned into a buzzword consulting&#x2F;training money grab.  Sigh.)')
