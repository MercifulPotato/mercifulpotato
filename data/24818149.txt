Because all the video&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen indicate politicians of a certain political persuasion (and their family members) doing the utmost to avoid wearing masks in situations that they should have known better.<p>&gt;Until when? The shutdowns were supposed to be about making sure that hospitals have time to prepare, research has time to be done, society has time to adapt. This has already taken place.<p>Stop building this up into a strawman. Nobody is arguing that lockdowns should last forever.<p>&gt; Should a layman be expected to know what a common sense response is for a pandemic? If such knowledge were that ubiquitous, we wouldn&#x27;t be seeing these kinds of issues, so calling it &quot;common sense&quot; serves only to insult people who don&#x27;t agree with you here.<p>Is wearing a mask so that your drops of saliva and nasal discharge doesn&#x27;t reach and infect others that hard to understand?<p>&gt; Except the virus was thought to be much more deadly at first, and the efficacy of cotton masks has been and is still a controversial subject.<p>It isn&#x27;t controversial at the very least, see my post above. It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to see how a barrier that slows or blocks droplets in and out of your orifices can help to prevent the spread of respiratory disease.<p>&gt; If you truly believe it is &quot;common sense&quot; to do things differently, you might be inclined to think there&#x27;s some kind of conspiracy going on.<p>Nice of you to bring up &quot;conspiracy&quot;. And here I am thinking that it was incompetence and politicisation all along.. silly me.')
