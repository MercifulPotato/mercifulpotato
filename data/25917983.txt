Do what Google never will - put users&#x27; privacy front and center.<p>On a sidenote, I might now re-enable cache that I kept disabled (well - cleared on exit) because of supercookies. I don&#x27;t care that much if a single page tracks me, but I _really_ don&#x27;t want Google to track me across sites. If Firefox protected me against that.. they would have one very grateful user. :)<p>EDIT: this also highlights why Google is so invested in Chrome - they can make sure that privacy doesn&#x27;t interfere with their money-making machine. They really are brilliant. Brilliantly evil.')
