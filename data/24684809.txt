Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[24684901], score=None, time=1601876076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24684478, text='Brexit.<p>It&#x27;s not just an amicable separation of bureaucracies.<p>If you&#x27;re in the UK (as I am), the kinds of headlines coming up regularly make it really clear the UK government is trying to not be part of Europe in all sorts of bizarre ways.<p>For example the most recent big deal was the UK has formally decided to break international law by reneging on the UK-EU withdrawal treaty it signed up to less than a year ago.<p>That&#x27;s a very unusual thing for the UK to do, and it has people up in arms because it means the UK will now not be taken as seriously when it makes future international commitments (including trade deals), and when it is finger-pointing to other nation-states breaking their international commitments in future.<p>It&#x27;s keener than ever to trash human rights and civil rights enshrined into EU law and show that it wants to take them away from people in the UK, which is a curious turnaround because at one time the UK was a leading champion, drafting the legislation and putting them into place.<p>It is all very tribal and symbolic, and doesn&#x27;t appear to be rooted in any kind of advantages for the UK or people and businesses within the UK.  Costs to businesses are going up (new tariffs on import and export).  Trade deals are defaulting to worse terms (there&#x27;s no good trade deal with the EU).  Cooperation on major scientific projects is breaking down.  Financial institutions are starting to move headquarters out of London.  UK citizens living abroad are losing rights (a UK passport is much less useful than it used to be), and the cost of travel for UK citzens is going up (need more visas, need to pay for medical treatment, can&#x27;t retire in the EU any more, if you already did you may have to move back and be poor).<p>What it does appear to be rooted in is the UK Brexit leaders being able to see &quot;we did it, as you can see we are visibly not part of Europe any more&quot;.')
