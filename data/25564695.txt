I have a NAS for photos and media, plus a big USB HDD for ZFS snapshots of my machines - but all of this is homelab tinkering, not an actual backup strategy.<p>I realized in the last year or so that the only digital media I have which I would be genuinely sad to lose were wedding photos - so I saved those to 3 different cloud providers, made a Blu-ray copy, and a copy on the NAS. If I lose all of that in some tragedy, chances are I&#x27;ve got bigger things to worry about.')
