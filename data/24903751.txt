Why wasn&#x27;t the &quot;losers and suckers&quot; story likewise blocked until it was verified?<p>Both stories had no external verification upon publication. One was blocked immediately. The other never was.<p>&gt; <i>The &quot;losers and suckers&quot; story was independently verified by NYT, WaPo, and AP.</i><p>One can&#x27;t &quot;independently&quot; verify a story based purely on anonymous sources. Can you link these alleged verifications?<p>&gt; <i>But the NYPost has not been verified by anyone, nor they did seek verification, nor did they even ask Biden for comment, because they know the story is bullshit.</i><p>Not true. The NYP story cited sources, and these sources have seen been verified, for example by the NYT:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;hunter-biden-laptop.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;hunter-biden-...</a><p>Your comment that they never asked Biden to comment is likewise untrue. This would be plainly ridiculous: all we&#x27;d need to know if a story is true is to see if they asked for a comment from the subject. In fact, plenty of untrue stories ask for these comments. Why wouldn&#x27;t they?  Do they want to make it obvious they are false?')
