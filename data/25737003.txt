As a PC player, I had no issues playing on a 3 year-old machine, it&#x27;s about as buggy as the average huge RPG game (like Divinity OS, Skyrim, etc.).  Then every week or two you get a patch.<p>Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 did better PR by releasing an early release version first, so the impatient can jump on it.<p>My personal feeling is there is so much effort put into this game, it&#x27;s sad to see it spun as a dismal failure by a greedy entity.  It must be demoralizing for the devs and artists and other staff members that worked on it.')
