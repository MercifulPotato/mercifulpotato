Reducing it to some &quot;selfish need&quot; is a cynical generalization. Denying pets will not improve the lives of these creatures, it will close their niche and pave the way for the extinction of their species. After millennia of living with them, that would be the ultimate betrayal of our most loyal friends and allies. We can already see that with horses: they are no longer useful and their numbers are dropping fast.')
