On the other hand, using synthesizers and messing with patches usually leads to things I wouldn’t have always imagined in my head.<p>I’ve never asked anyone about any of this before, so I never realized others might not experience the same things. Sometimes I wish I could switch subjective experience for a day with another person to get real perspective.')
