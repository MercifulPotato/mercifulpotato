Even if outlook, thunderbird maybe supports it, goodluck getting all the mobile versions to support it too.<p>The clients used to view emails suffer from the same problem with browsers so are subject to all the HTML&#x2F;JS&#x2F;CSS privacy attacks.<p>I wish all companies would move to something centralized solution where communication is guaranteed to only come from those within the same service. This way Sharon from HR won&#x27;t open every link, download every crypto&#x2F;ransomeware.<p>Maybe my IT could also save 150k a year by not having to send me phishing &#x27;training&#x27; emails and instead deal with some decent forms of signature checking. Heck billions of dollars a year are wasted because of phishing, spam, crypto attacks because of email.<p>From my perspective, email is a shitty legacy tech from 1990s that should be moved to a modern solution that enables E2E encryption or signature checks at a minimum.')
