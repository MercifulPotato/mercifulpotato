There are plenty of indicators that a review might be a bot.<p>That would be wrong but believable. I read some of the reviews, they did look very similar in ways beyond describing the same problems.<p>But I&#x27;m good with assuming malice, it seems like every company that takes action right now is unlikely to be doing it coincidentally. Maybe Google is doing it because of money somehow, hopefully it&#x27;s an actual mistake that they&#x27;ll fix. I suspect the former.')
