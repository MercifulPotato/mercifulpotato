I use int64_t and expect compilation to fail if stdint.h doesn&#x27;t define it. It would be a problem, but much less of a problem than using intWhatever_t, having compilation work, but having no idea what the bounds were.<p>intmax_t doesn&#x27;t define an upper limit either, as TFA explains, because you don&#x27;t know at runtime what the limit really is.')
