I think calling them “industrial grade” is pushing it when they’re rarely used as the first line of defense against code that is expected to be actively hostile.<p>actually firecracker is not a sandbox. it&#x27;s basically qemu&#x2F;libvirt and a minimal implementation of devices. it&#x27;s qemu-kvm with a http interface and way less devices.<p>the reason why they rewritten qemu-kvm is because qemu-kvm contains a lot of code that is not needed and is way more bug prone. and also loading a kernel is way faster in firecracker since they optimized the kernel loading code.')
