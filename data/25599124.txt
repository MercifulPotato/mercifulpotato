The main outcome is that it’s now going to be much more of a pain in the arse to perform lots of basic functions that we took for granted.<p>There is now a bunch more red tape involved involved in buying or selling goods or services to other European counties. It’s harder and more expensive to move for work or education, both to and from the UK. The UK now has a customs border inside it’s own territory (which is fairly mad in itself).
