I&#x27;d also point out that members of &quot;polite society&quot; may ostracize you for many reasons, including perceived sexual deviancy, punk rock music, dancing, any degree of alcohol or drug use, communist leanings, anarchist leanings, and more. We just have to trust that liberal culture will hold people morally accountable for the people they ostracize, and that those who are impacted have the means to migrate to more accepting towns.<p>Continuing our analogy, I hope that we use our power to ostracize &quot;netizens&quot; very sparingly. And I do mean our power, not that of the tech giants, who merely do what they believe will be best for their image as decided by us. I also hope that there continues to be a competitive landscape of online countries, each more liberal or authoritarian in its own unique ways, from where differing individuals and organizations can connect with the world.')
