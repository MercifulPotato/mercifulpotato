I had a rather long exchange with someone on here a few weeks ago about the difference between &quot;theft&quot; and &quot;robbery&quot;.<p>In this case though, the meaning is kinda academic. If you don&#x27;t get a job or an apartment because of unfair bias, would it make you feel better that it was due to negative stereotypes about your nationality or sex, rather than negative stereotypes about people with your skin color? They&#x27;re all equally unfair and the outcome is equally negative for you.<p>Bigotry based on any immutable characteristic is equally bad. Ok someone used the wrong label for the specific <i>type</i> of bigotry, so what? Especially in this case, we don&#x27;t have a good word for bias based on nationality or national origin (&quot;xenophobia&quot;? but what if they&#x27;re a dual-citizen or citizen of your country? &quot;ethnophobia&quot;? you get my point) We know what they meant, so move on and talk about the bigotry instead of the dictionary. That&#x27;s why saying &quot;X isn&#x27;t a race, so it&#x27;s not &#x27;racism&#x27;&quot; is pointless in this context.')
