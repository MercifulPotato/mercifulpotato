My hypothesis, and perhaps this is a relatively sad commentary in the US, is that the level of inequality in major US cities is off the charts: for many people <i>eating</i> at a nice restaurant in a major city, food, even eating out, is a tiny portion of their overall budget, so adding 5% is really nothing, but people <i>working</i> in restaurants are really struggling to get by (and diners know it), so the increased tip rate is basically a consequence of trying to make unaffordable large cities bearable for workers.')
