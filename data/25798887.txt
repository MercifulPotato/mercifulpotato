If the patent is very clever and something that people are unlikely to discover themselves then it makes sense to exist and be enforceable.<p>Not really, not if the holder isn&#x27;t actively exploiting it.  The whole point of patents is to encourage expensive innovation so you don&#x27;t come up with something and then have it stolen after doing the hard work.<p>But if you did the hard word and aren&#x27;t exploiting it, then it shouldn&#x27;t be withheld from society.  Let someone else exploit it.<p>If you did the research but can&#x27;t mass market it, then you should be forced to sell the patent, so that society can benefit from your invention.<p>At the end of the day, the patent system is supposed to benefit <i>society</i>, not the inventor.')
