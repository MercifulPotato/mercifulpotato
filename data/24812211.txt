He doesn&#x27;t fault the other side for activism, but for actively pursuing a philosophy he disagrees with, living constitutionalism.<p>It all depends on exactly what you&#x27;re applying &quot;activism&quot; and &quot;restraint&quot; to. Barnett would argue for restraint in reading Section 230 as creating more authority than its text supports, but activism in applying such restraint.')
