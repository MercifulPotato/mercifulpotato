Lets say I have 200 dollars of illegal money.  How much value does that actually have?  I would say 0 because it is illegal.  Now lets say I buy a widget that is worth 100 dollars for 200 dollars.  Then I sell it for 100 dollars.  I now have converted 200 dollars of worthless illegal money into 100 dollars of legal money.<p>This happens all of the time for EBT and food stamps.  Buy a case of pepsi for 30 dollars and sell it back for 15 (sometimes to the same seller).  30 electronic dollars that can only be spent on a limited set of goods is converted to 15 dollars cash that can be spent on anything.<p>My point is that the definition of &quot;value&quot; may actually align.  It&#x27;s ok if they new owner sells at a monetary loss because they are still making a gain.')
