And there was a good reason for that. But it has produced side-effects. Nationalism is a big no-no today.<p>So people don’t feel like they belong to a group. There are just, many groups living next to each other, London is a symbol of that but Paris is well in line, and all of France is made of groups who live next to each other, and don’t like each other.<p>Military service was praised by the elderly as instigating a sense of belonging and cohesion (among all the evil it also did on the weaker half of the population, I’m not having rosy glasses here).<p>So, basically, it has been more than 70 years that your idea of a nation going bowling together is a big no-no, and we work hard on mixing people, which... let’s say it doesn’t work yet, to be nice... I mean we all have a daughter who’s been raped by the « other » group so I don’t personally think it will work, but if it will, you’ll have to invent something that solders our co-country with us.<p>Of course bowling together is a good idea, but it works with small groups, and we’ve killed the glue that holds larger societies together (for good reasons at the base).<p>Also, my best friend and I cut ties after we’ve seen each other’s life choices is about exploiting the other, so I have at least one counter-example that going bowling together doesn’t tie people closer, when one is causing harm to the other with his life choices.<p>My opinions is, we do need less ideology, because we’ve reached peak brainwashing in 2020, and social networks need to accompany research and science and discovery of stats formulated in an digestible manner, instead of hammering onto people that one’s opinion is right and the others are evil.')
