That action will be remembered in your browser&#x27;s local storage. So when you need to use your amazon password again, it will automatically advance and generate the correct password.<p>But if you come from a different browser, you&#x27;ll need to click &#x27;generate different codes&#x27; again to advance to the correct password.<p>For services where the password frequently changes, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a very practical way to use this. At least not across several different browsers.')
