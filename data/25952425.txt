I use Vivaldi at home (on a 9-year-old desktop), and Firefox at work, and the only things that come to mind are tab opening&#x2F;closing could be better, and some very CSS-heavy animations such as the NYT&#x27;s map of coronavirus&#x27;s spread from Wuhan are much better on Gecko than Blink.  But day to day, I have no complaints about performance from either.<p>Then again, I also use uBlock Origin... perhaps Vivaldi is slow without it.  I&#x27;ll also admit that theoretically I&#x27;d expect Vivaldi&#x27;s UI to be slower due to being based on web technologies instead of native, but I can&#x27;t say I can perceive a difference except in edge cases.')
