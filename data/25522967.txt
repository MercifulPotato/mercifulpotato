It works based on so-called contexts; a process in a context cannot see processes in other contexts (at all), with the exception of context 0 which is the &quot;root context&quot;, or if you disable PID isolation. VServer was a competing implementation to what evolved into LXC, as such it implemented similar concepts, such as PID namespacing, pretty early, using own code. It&#x27;s just the looks though. VS used a single global namespace, but individual guest contexts could not &quot;see&quot; PIDs outside of their context.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ols&#x2F;2007&#x2F;ols2007v2-pages-151-160.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ols&#x2F;2007&#x2F;ols2007v2-pages-151-160....</a>')
