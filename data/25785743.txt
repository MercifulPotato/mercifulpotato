I built:<p>An electric go-kart for the kids.<p>A lithium battery for my car.<p>A full custom electric skateboard. Custom deck, hand made lithium battery pack, custom motor mount, and more.<p>A portable and high power lithium battery. That powers a water heater I made from parts from a Keurig machine. Basically its a cup-at-time portable electric water heater I use when camping with the family. Goes from off to a cup of hot water in less than 2 minutes, only heats water you will use.  I could have used an inverter and a Keurig machine directly but that wouldn&#x27;t be fun.')
