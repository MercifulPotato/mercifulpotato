Doctor can keep records under a unique ID which patient is given at the start of sessions and the patient presents it at each session to validate the relationship. In the event of a breach, even when all data is exposed, without tracking the unique ID back to a person (which would be difficult or impossible) the harm is little.. \n(Imagine reading a story of a person but you don&#x27;t know who that person is..)<p>You might say that there would be other person names and places in mentioned in the records and from that network and timeline you may be able to deduce the identity.. but these PII can in turn be depersonalised. And also this is not scalable for widespread damage.<p>It just need a bit of thinking when designing a system. Frankly any org that ask for PII and doesn&#x27;t have a well thought out way to store them should be heavily penalised.<p>That&#x27;s what the law should do standardised methods of storing sensitive data.')
