We can’t just file this under “it happens at all large companies” and call it a day. Large companies like Apple should be held to a higher standard.<p>With the rise of evaluating company stocks based on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) shareholders should start demanding that companies publish anonymized statistics on number of HR cases reported and how they were handled. Workplace abuse can happen everywhere but larger companies like Apple need to double-down and start showing that they are handling it.<p>This _might_ sound utopian. But shareholder value is about the only thing companies like Apple care about.<p>Apple held a modicum of respect in my book for stepping up to protect privacy. Reading a piece like this tears that away. I’m reminded that Apple is yet another gigantic tech company. The ends doesn’t justify the means. Great products doesn’t justify abuse.')
