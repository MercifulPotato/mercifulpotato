( While still providing x86 services to those who needs it )<p>Google and Microsoft are already gearing up their own ARM offering. Partly confirmed by Marvell&#x27;s exit of ARM Server.<p>&gt;The problem is single core Arm performance outside of Apple chips isn’t there.<p>Cloud computing charges per vCPU. On all current x86 instances, that is one hyper-thread. On AWS Graviton, vCPU = Actual CPU Core. There are plenty of workloads, and large customers like Twitter and Pinterest has tested and shown AWS Graviton 2 vCPU perform better than x86. All while being 30% cheaper. At the end of the day, it is workload &#x2F; dollars that matters on Cloud computing. And right now in lots of applications Graviton 2 are winning, and in some cases by large margin.<p>If AWS sell 50% of their services with ARM in 5 years time, that is 25% of Cloud Business Alone. Since it offer a huge competitive advantage Google and Microsoft has no other choice but to join the race. And then there will be enough of a market force for Qualcomm, or may be Marvell to Fab a commodity ARM Server part for the rest of the market.<p>Which is why I was extremely worried about Intel. The lucrative Server market is basically gone. ( And I haven&#x27;t factored in AMD yet ) 5 years in Tech hardware is basically 1-2 cycles. And there is nothing on Intel&#x27;s roadmap that shown they have the chance to compete apart from marketing and sales tactics. Which still goes a long way if I have to be honest, but not sustainable in long term. It is more of a delaying tactics. Along with a CEO that despite trying very hard, had no experience in market and product business. Luckily that is about to change.<p>Evaluating ARM switch takes time, Software preparation takes time, and more importantly, getting wafer from TSMC takes time as demand from all market are exceeding expectations. But all of them are already in motion, and if these are the kind of response you get from Graviton 2, imagine Graviton 3.')
