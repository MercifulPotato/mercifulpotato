I enjoy having a national identity (language, ethnicity, food, architecture, history, etc). It gives me a sense of place and I view my country as basically my extended family (it&#x27;s a small northern European country). If you have peoples from all over the world moving to my country then that sense of brotherhood breaks down. Sorry, but tribalism is real and it&#x27;s natural. Maybe that&#x27;s why places like the US that have all sorts of peoples trying to live together is much less cohesive than my country.')
