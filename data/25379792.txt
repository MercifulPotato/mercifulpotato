GDPR and the cookie law rarely get applied in real life (and when they do the punishment is laughable). The only real solution is a technical one - a browser that respects your privacy.<p>The only way that I think a law could assist with this would be if the governments would force all websites of legal businesses to work without javascript as well as via tor, but even then it will go unenforced.<p>That being said, I do not think that fingerprinting is an exploit as browsers come build-in with technologies that are meant for fingerprinting (see the ping attribute for example).')
