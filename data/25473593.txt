No living people have ever died as a result of taking some particular obviously unsafe shortcut, so they can rationalise it as OK, even though intellectually they know it&#x27;s a very bad idea. Each time this unsafe shortcut kills somebody, <i>all the living people</i> still have no experience of dying from that shortcut because the one person who experienced the other outcome is now dead.<p>Close calls can help a little bit, gradually, but the effect is slow and unevenly distributed.<p>&gt; it would have a greater tendency to burn itself out.<p>One reason I particularly point at elimination strategy (beyond the, in my opinion obviously related fact that it worked) is that zero cases has a <i>categorically</i> different impact than merely low numbers of cases that result from hoping a lower R-number will cause it to &quot;burn itself out&quot;. You get to zero only one case at a time, tracking and tracing everything, getting right into the details, whereas these vague statistical approaches do not do that.<p>Lots of countries or regions have tried to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; but that&#x27;s not actually a way out, it&#x27;s just to buy time. Now, in this case if you bought enough time (maybe 18-24 months) you get a vaccine. But not all diseases are like that, and we could not be confident this was one.<p>Getting to zero is instead a (painful) permanent fix that allows you to really open up (within the country or region at zero). New Zealand&#x27;s international tourist economy got a kick in the head, but its people are alive, much of everyday life is already how a lot of us in the North are hoping 2021 will be - its message this summer is &quot;Make summer unstoppable&quot; with small adjustments like wearing a mask on the plane, or tracking where you visited with QR code scanners - but otherwise a pretty normal vacation season, concerts, sports events and so on.')
