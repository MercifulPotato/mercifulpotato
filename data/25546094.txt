Apple got up on stage and said, &quot;three years from now, we won&#x27;t be selling Intel-based laptops. If you don&#x27;t get on the train, you&#x27;ll be left behind.&quot; Microsoft won&#x27;t do that. Without that commitment, why should a software firm port its applications to ARM? Every software firm should be thinking, &quot;if we don&#x27;t do any work, Windows on ARM will be miserable and never get traction.&quot; Likewise, any chip maker is going to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to invest in ARM laptop&#x2F;desktop chips until it&#x27;s clear that ARM is going to be a major part of the Windows ecosystem.&quot; Finally customers are going to think, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to buy an ARM laptop until it&#x27;s clear that Microsoft, the chipmakers, and software firms are all behind this.&quot; No one is willing to commit to the future because that future won&#x27;t exist unless they all move in unison.<p>Honestly how hard is it to port software to ARM?<p>Electron apps just work, .NET just works and Java does too. So does every language that isn&#x27;t C&#x2F;C++. And even on the C&#x2F;C++ side, unless you are doing some funky things I doubt it&#x27;s more effort than adding a release configuration that targets ARM in the build pipeline.')
