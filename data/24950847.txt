As soon as you add too many dependencies to rust with lots of macros, compile times tend to increase a lot for rust projects because it creates a fat binary, whereas it works fine for a mountain of dependencies in Scala for me.<p>On the other hand if you just need compiler errors, cargo check runs almost instantly for incremental checks.')
