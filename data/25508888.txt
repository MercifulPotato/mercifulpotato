Instead of a long diatribe more or less saying the same thing, I think that article sums up 99% of it.<p>Generally speaking: I just don&#x27;t have the energy for the amounts of bullshit that comes with being in this career anymore. No job is immune from bullshit, this much is true--but I kind of hate this cop out because it strips agency from people in minimizing the amount of bullshit they are subjected to on a daily basis.<p>For me, that means to hell with this career. I very much want to do something different, so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25251029" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25251029</a><p>Good luck on whatever voyage and path you end up taking, I genuinely hope you find a spot of zen for you and yours.<p>EDIT: BY THE WAY--I will probably never stop coding, as there are always opportunities to be efficient in bookkeeping and do some low level automation (in fact I do this already). I&#x27;ve also got a home lab running a few local services and I enjoy tinkering. I&#x27;m just not at all interested in writing and maintaining feature&#x2F;production code for another SaaS platform or &quot;tech company&quot;. Not at all. Never again. The idea of even interviewing for one of these jobs has the heart rate ticking up and the jaw to clinch up.')
