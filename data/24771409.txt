The phrase originally comes from a mistranslation of the Latin petitio principii which itself was a mistranslation of the original Greek which approximately meant &quot;assuming the conclusion.&quot; The original mistranslation is unfortunate because, at least to me, the more recent meaning of basically another way of saying &quot;raises the question&quot; actually makes a lot more sense.')
