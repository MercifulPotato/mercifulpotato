If he says nothing - apparently he condones it. If he says something condemning it, they pretend it&#x27;s not genuine, ignore it and look at the other vague terms he uses as if they&#x27;re dog-whistles condoning it. This tells me they&#x27;ve pre-decided their stance on him and will push that no matter what he says or does. You can&#x27;t argue or reason with insanity.<p>What makes it worse is there are a lot of very smart, articulate and well-meaning people that are coming to the defense of such an incoherent point of view. They <i>will</i> verbally and with &quot;facts&quot; stomp down on anything but the most perfect of criticisms, essentially making criticism of any left-wing action next to impossible.')
