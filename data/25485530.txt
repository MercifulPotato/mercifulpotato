Say a rook moving from a1 to a3 while an opponent’s knight moves from or into a2?<p>Also, if you are going to write down moves, you can allow the players to move all of their pieces, too, like in Diplomacy.<p>A queen could capture a pawn next to the king, and a bishop could simultaneously move to prevent the king from capturing the queen, for example. A countermove could be to move a pawn between that bishop and that queen, and to have the king capture the queen.<p>⇒  I guess this multi-move variant would get highly complicated very soon. It might be better to follow diplomacy here and replace <i>“If two moving pieces end up on the same square, both are eliminated”</i> by “...same square, neither moves”<i>, or maybe add </i>“x supports y moving to square S”*?')
