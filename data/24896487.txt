Through with something like ipfs emulating network delays on access could work, but would be <i>VERY</i> hard to get right and make immune to statistical timing analysis.<p>It&#x27;s also one of the view ways how to get some (imperfect) degree of censorship resistance without running in direct conflict with laws to e.g. hinder access the child pornography. Note that this is just imperfect protection working for countries which do not officially have censorship in their law and have no effectivish national firewall. I.e. it wouldn&#x27;t work for China, it also wouldn&#x27;t work if the political situation in some western countries get worse. But it does work for &quot;non-official&quot; censorship enacted based on not-so-legal pressure and harassment.  Or corperate censorship enacted by companies supposedly on their own will.')
