Microsoft being as big as they are really pushes other similar-sized companies like Google.<p>We&#x27;ve seen Facebook follow suit to shift their workforce in a similar manner. It makes you wonder when we&#x27;ll hear something similar from Google, Apple, and even a reverse course for Netflix. If they don&#x27;t, then recruiting might suffer as a candidate would likely pick the more WFH-flexible company.')
