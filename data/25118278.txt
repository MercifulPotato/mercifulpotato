In reality I expect you could get the cost to be much less (I mean, even S3 standard is closer to 2 cents than the 3 cents I quoted) with on-premises storage. You also wouldn&#x27;t need every minute of every video instantly available like you would get with S3 standard, further reducing costs.<p>I had a hard time finding the bandwidth costs, but since you&#x27;ve done the math already, I&#x27;d like to hear what you came up with.')
