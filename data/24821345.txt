A tax lcould also morally legalize the behaviour (moral is important in antitrust behaviour look at the claws&#x2F;lobby of tobacco firms).<p>On the contrary, it is a fine by a government subjected by a court of law. Every government has to start this lawsuit themselves though. It takes a lot of effort, time, money. On top of the fine, action as a result of being found guilty can be demanded as well (see history of US phone companies).')
