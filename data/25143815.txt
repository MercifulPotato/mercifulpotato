Free from the eyes of children who may be doing pandemic schooling from home? And indemnified against criminal liability for opening up certain troubling related content by an authoritative, audit ready, third party recorded video feed?<p>There are just legal requirements around certain types of porn for example. Or videos of illegal activities up to and sometimes even including murder.<p>Law enforcement authorities only tolerate a certain number of mistakes in this regard. With certain content, they may not tolerate any mistakes. I&#x27;m not saying FB is right. In fact, FB probably didn&#x27;t even make the decision. They outsource. What I am saying is that FB, with the content they want their contractors to moderate, are putting those third parties in highly precarious legal positions. I don&#x27;t blame those companies for acting to protect themselves if FB is not willing to take on all legal responsibility for things that may go wrong.')
