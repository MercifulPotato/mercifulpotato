Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24948670], score=None, time=1604107918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940077, text='&gt; Thereâ€™s no way or even motivation to describe those board specific miscellanies in such way that Linux Kernel drivers can dynamically consume and adapt to, or <i>decide</i> how to behave.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like an intractable problem to standardize and document this sort of thing. Once you know that pin 45 is connected to a model ABC123 backlight controller, you know to communicate with it on pin 45 using the ABC123 backlight controller driver. If the same pin is used for multiple outputs, no problem, standardize the method for switching between outputs and describe which pins are switched to which devices using which control pins in a machine-readable table.<p>Apparently they haven&#x27;t done this, so how do we get them to start?')
