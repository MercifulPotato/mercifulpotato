Item(by='existencebox', descendants=None, kids=[25610530], score=None, time=1609562406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25610343, text='I realize this is unsolicited, so I will feel no insult if you don&#x27;t desire to respond, you&#x27;ve just got me very interested from a &quot;management case study&quot; perspective; so at the risk of a very naive question:<p>Do you have a good understanding re: what your folks are unhappy _about_?  Like very specifically, do they feel overworked? Is there reliably political drama in the office? Is it a pay issue?  I mention these not to suggest but give examples of how bluntly I mean.  Problem here, is that it may be hard for you, given the power dynamic, to get that answer, but as an engineer, I can say it was always _pretty well known_ to the boots on the ground what was making the team unhappy. (and what was fascinating, and why I make this comment, is that it always seemed to run into a real bottleneck percolating up into management)<p>If you&#x27;ve already gone down this route, then again, ignore me entirely, but if you&#x27;ve not, or if you doubt the veracity of the message you got, I wonder if you can get a &quot;spy in the ranks.&quot;  I don&#x27;t mean  this in a negative way, but an engineer who for whatever reason (Naivete? self-sacrifice? I use these somewhat snide terms largely because I&#x27;m somewhat tongue-in-cheek referring to my past self) is willing to go against otherwise better judgement and be truly open with management about the situation (in that sometimes, management _may_ be the problem, and no one wants to fall on that sword), and who has enough trust with their peers to understand what&#x27;s going down with them as well.<p>This can be hard to find, and isn&#x27;t always present; but to summarize this ramble:<p>I would emphasize attacking the root of the problem in a very personal fashion, but that to do so requires having (or building) some conduit of trust and rapport; and I wonder if you&#x27;ve run into roadblocks trying to apply this.')
