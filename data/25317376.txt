You `.clone()` everywhere, and it&#x27;s still going to fly fast.<p>Some benefits:<p>* static typing niceness: language server, typo catching, some types preventing human error here and there etc.\n* expressing some ideas in a much more robust way\n* best in class tooling like package manager, rustdoc \n* hitting some unexpected not strictly data-analysis requirement is never a blocker\n* you can reuse your code, compile to WASM and embed in a page\n* performance of auxiliary code is never an issue\n* unlike Python, you can send it to another person and expect it to work just like it did for you\n* if it turns out that the &quot;one-off&quot; has to become more complex and serious, you don&#x27;t have to throw away everything and start rewriting it &quot;in more serious way&quot;')
