Curious what version you were using. There have been some notable internal changes to the engine over the years.<p>The 1.0 release was a complete rewrite of the previous codebase, and included a very aggressive optimization inspired by inferno.js (called node recycling) that turned out to cause issues in some edge cases and didn&#x27;t materialize significant enough performance benefits given the added internal complexity.
