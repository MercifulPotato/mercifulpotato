Few reasons:\n1. &quot;A very large portion&quot; - no, there are some motivated by different regulatory treatment for different transactions, but it&#x27;s not &quot;a very large portion.&quot; There&#x27;s also nothing wrong with the regulatory-motivated trades generally done by banks. It&#x27;s not the same as what this guy did which is clearly immoral&#x2F;wrong - he was not doing something in an optimal way to reduce tax burden. He was doing things that caused governments to literally pay out new money - negative tax payments - possibly under fraudulent pretenses. As an analogy for what is appropriate - if you open a Corp in the US but decide to open an S Corp rather than a  C Corp for better tax treatment - is that a reg loophole? No you&#x27;re following the law to get better tax treatment. \n2. Wide bid-offer isn&#x27;t a rip off. Markets are generally competitive, corp clients can easily ask 3-4 banks for a price for the same product. What confuses novices is that in financial markets its typically easy to see the &quot;mid&quot; in addition to a bid-offer and then feel bad about profits. Would you feel equally guilty if you went to the store and saw the &quot;mid&quot; on a $1000 iPhone is $500 - and the bid&#x2F;offer is 50%? Before you say &quot;it&#x27;s different!&quot; - consider the complexity involved in arranging a profitable bank that has a competent sales team, trading desk, operations, compliance, capital, legal, etc. etc. - and also does profitable transactions. It&#x27;s a moat - hard to replicate - and that&#x27;s what leads to profits.')
