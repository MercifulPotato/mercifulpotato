Remember that your competitors are using their money to kill you short term throughout the whole time. Of course they refused to invest, they didn&#x27;t have the money to invest with and the risk was too high to any individual retailer.<p>edit: Also, e-commerce was only 16% of retail sales pre-covid. And that took 30 years to achieve. So traditional retailers saw it more of a long term problem than something to worry about right now.')
