If you use too much power you get high temperatures and have to clock down to avoid overheating.<p>The core designs for desktops and laptops are basically the same. The desktops use more power because it allows them to hold higher clock speeds -- the base clock of the 4800U (8C, 10W) is 1.8GHz, the base clock of the 3945WX (12C, 280W) is 4.0GHz.<p>This is also why desktops and laptops have about the same single thread performance. Running a single core at full speed is within the laptop power budget.')
