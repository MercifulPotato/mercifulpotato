Which is the whole point - the original statement was you can&#x27;t have freedom of speech with &quot;buts&quot;.  We already have &quot;buts&quot;, and most people would agree we have freedom of speech.<p>A functioning society can&#x27;t have the unbridled &quot;freedom of speech&quot; op is insinuating we should have.  You aren&#x27;t free to lie in a court of law, that&#x27;s infringing on your freedom of speech.  You can&#x27;t falsely accuse someone of a crime - also an infringement on freedom of speech.  Add countless other exceptions to the rule.  And all of that is ignoring the fact that &quot;freedom of speech&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean: other people are forced to listen to you or repeat what you said.')
