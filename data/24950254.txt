They are designed for plants but they work pretty well for humans too. You get a lot more power per dollar than the human ones which are usually at the bottom end of the required light output. If you pair it with a smart home relay (or microcontroller with relay module if you are so inclined) you can have it turn on automatically with your alarm.<p>I use a 100W 16x16 LED array grow lamp and if you&#x27;re within 3ft it feels like a sunny day.<p>I also recommend if you think you might have DSPD that you get bloodwork for cortisol and prolactin. Some people who don&#x27;t have the mutation still have the symptoms because their cortisol is permanently elevated (chronic stress) and only falls when they are exhausted. Both can be treated with a light box and relaxing activities in low light in the evening but if you have elevated cortisol you may also need to consider additional treatment option for chronic stress. It&#x27;s also possible to have both because constantly being on a different sleep schedule to the rest of the world can cause chronic stress.')
