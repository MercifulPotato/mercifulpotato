He streams on Twitch and puts up some ridiculous Donkey Kong scores even if they aren&#x27;t close to the current world record. He is still pretty popular in some circles. His restaurant isn&#x27;t too far from my house and he makes regular appearances there so I assume he lives around here too. Cost of living isn&#x27;t too high. He&#x27;s probably doing alright.')
