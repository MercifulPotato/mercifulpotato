Search is super-ambitious and a new index getting traction could be game changing for lots of people. It appears that Mojeek is indexing translated documents, which is exciting for unlocking knowledge, but really leads to a bizarre initial user experience. If indexing translations is what is going on, this is kind of exciting... but will be challenging to deliver better user experiences than single language indexes.<p>Stemming (grouping similar terms like &quot;mortgage&quot; and &quot;home loan&quot;) seems bizarre. I did a search for my last name, and it came back with mostly results where the name was using the German spelling, which made the results mostly worthless. (the difference is the German spelling ends in &quot;l&quot;, the French version ends in &quot;le&quot; and the English spelling ends in &quot;el&quot;). So, the resulting search results were mostly useless.<p>Hope to see more of Mojeek!')
