They do the warehouse to store, but that is a lot of local roads so the logistics of getting drivers to&#x2F;from the truck on highway access is harder than just keeping a driver in the truck.<p>The big truck companies are interested in this. They mostly highway travel so a team of trucker drivers in each city isn&#x27;t as logistically difficult. Plus they can promise their drivers home each night instead of twice a month.')
