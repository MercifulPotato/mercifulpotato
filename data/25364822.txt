For a simple example of freedom being taken away without state involvement: a person who (illegally) locks up another person is absolutely taking away another person&#x27;s freedom.<p>This idea that only freedom from the state counts is very pernicious, and it&#x27;s at the root of the inordinate power corporations have in today&#x27;s world.<p>Freedom is the ability to do what you want. Any conditions that don&#x27;t let you do what you want are restraints on your freedom, even if they are being enforced by a private company.')
