If you removed the disk from the drive before walking to a new screen, it would grind the empty drive for a while, but eventually it would just use the old screen layout for the new screen but still &quot;think&quot; you were in the new tile.<p>So lets say you had 3 screens 1-2-3 and &#x27;2&#x27; has an obstacle but &#x27;1&#x27; does not.  You could:<p>1) walk to the right hand edge of screen 1<p>2) remove the floppy<p>3) cross to screen 2 - this would appear to reset you to the left side of screen 1<p>4) put the floppy back in<p>5) walk to right side of the &quot;fake&quot; screen 1 and cross to the next screen again<p>6) presto - you&#x27;re now on screen 3!  Obstacle avoided!<p>And you could repeat step (3) multiple times to teleport across an arbitrary # of screens.<p>8 y.o. me was super proud to figure that out :)')
