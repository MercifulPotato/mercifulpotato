What instrument would you consider then not to be dull? You cannot compare a piano to e.g. a violin or a guitar. It&#x27;s a completely different concept; you can e.g. play (theoretically) chords with ten or more (when you press two keys with one finger) simultaneous notes; and you can control the timbre and loudness by how fast you press the keys; it&#x27;s like a percussion instrument with 88 parts.')
