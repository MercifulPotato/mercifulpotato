What scares me about a mask is that it could do more harm than good: if it&#x27;s made with non-safe materials I am breathing through it for hours on end, bad things might happen.<p>I&#x27;d like to order from Ali Express but have no way of judging safety or knowing if the certifications are enforced. With a reseller I hope that they are.<p>Do you have any tips on judging if a mask is going to be safe?')
