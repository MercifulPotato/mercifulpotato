Now apple.paypal.secure.wendys.scamsite.info&#x2F;payus&#x2F;wwwcitibank just shows scamsite.info. This is a good thing! And doubly because URL paths and fragments have been made largely irrelevant to end users as app routes.<p>If you&#x27;re going to rant about the death of the URL you should complain to HN as well that only shows the domain next to posts.')
