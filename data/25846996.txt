(Ford: 382, Carter: 534 , Regan: 393, Clinton: 396, Bush: 189, Obama: 212)<p>Obama ensured that there was a process set up that filtered the pardon requests, so that no hint of political- or personal-favors could intrude, no possible quid-pro-quo, etc.<p>Yes, Clinton&#x27;s pardoning of his brother-in-law was pretty bad. Trump&#x27;s pardoning of his entire slate of co-conspirators and personal associates looks worse, to me personally.')
