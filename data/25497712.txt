The bottle didn&#x27;t leap into dad&#x27;s hand by itself. I feel bad for your family, and this happened to a few folks in mine as well, but Facebook doesn&#x27;t jump into your family&#x27;s brains all by itself. Users are actively installing, using it, and poisoning themselves. I think Facebook is a net negative, and should be regulated like any other harmful addictive product. But, the blame for its affects must be shared with its users.')
