Yes, they&#x27;re about $5 in Australia, and I&#x27;ve even gotten them for free on occasion when I was unemployed.<p>Some quick stats about the medication from wikipedia [0] - The medication was generally available in the UK 1969 (1982 for USA), and in 2017 was the tenth most prescribed medication in the USA.<p>When I saw news popping up over the last year or so about how exciting it was for a generic inhaler to be approved and available I was surprised and appalled by the whole ordeal, to be honest. It&#x27;s an essential medicine. Generics have been available for ages here.<p>How on earth can companies and the government be allowed to do this to people? I mean, the literal answer is probably the oligarchy. I would have thought that people who can manage their chronic health conditions and avoid becoming disabled (or dead) would be infinitely more exploitable than those who can&#x27;t, but I guess the numbers have been crunched and that mustn&#x27;t be the case. It&#x27;s unspeakably awful.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Salbutamol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Salbutamol</a>')
