Jiro&#x27;s oldest son is expected to eventually take over Jiro&#x27;s sushi place, so as a result essentially is toiling for his father into old age. On the other hand, somewhat ironically Jiro&#x27;s younger son actually has more freedom, so he strikes out on his own pretty early and has his own very successful sushi joint.')
