Meaning if you sold 1m in products you would still be in the 15% bracket next year. You would need ~1.43m in sales to be &quot;Moved up&quot; the next year (It gets more complicated with subscription revenue already having a 30&#x2F;15 cut depending on the user&#x27;s subscription length.) It works out to this (Using 1m in sales as the cutoff to simplify the numbers):<p>Year 1:\n999k --[-15%]--&gt; 849k (This year doesn&#x27;t trip the &quot;limit&quot;<p>Year 2:\n1000k --[-15%]--&gt;850k (Limit is tripped, next year is 30%)<p>Year 3:\n999k --[-30%]--&gt;699k (Fell below the limit, next year is 15% again)<p>Basically if you are close to the limit at the end of the year, you should immediately stop all advertising&#x2F;marketing spend to ensure you don&#x27;t go over the peak :)<p>I&#x27;m not really sure why they did it this way as it really screws over people that are just at the 1m&#x2F;yr mark, vs a progressive system that would &quot;just work.&quot;')
