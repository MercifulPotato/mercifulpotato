We have to be able to black-box things in order to manage complexity and make progress quickly. For this SOLID helps but if it is applied a too fine a granularity then it can make things worse (and I think micro testing things with mocks etc can cause this)<p>&quot;There is no theoretical reason that anything\nis hard to change about software.\nIf you pick any one aspect of software\nthen you can make it easy to change,\nbut we donâ€™t know how to make everything\neasy to change. Making something\neasy to change makes the overall system\na little more complex, and making\neverything easy to change makes the entire\nsystem very complex. Complexity is\nwhat makes software hard to change.\nThat, and duplication.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;martinfowler.com&#x2F;ieeeSoftware&#x2F;whoNeedsArchitect.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;martinfowler.com&#x2F;ieeeSoftware&#x2F;whoNeedsArchitect.pdf</a>')
