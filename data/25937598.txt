I&#x27;ve had brokers force me to close short positions (esp in &#x27;08-&#x27;09) because &#x27;no shares available&#x27; which forced me to buy at the market in order to close out the position.  It had nothing to do with interest or margin.<p>(Granted, they were some pretty illiquid stocks so I suspect that the broker had managed to get into a naked short situation when they allowed the trade to execute before actually trying to go out and borrow them.  Of course, their mistake was made my problem.)')
