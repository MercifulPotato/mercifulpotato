It&#x27;s a hidden feature that&#x27;s not documented. Pretty easy to setup, but not discoverable. It&#x27;s an option that they developed but decided not to include in the final version. Here&#x27;s a tutorial: sonicbloom.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;ableton-live-insider-tips-options-txt-part-1&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;ve specifically noted above, expecting this reply: &quot;I&#x27;m aware of the Options.txt hack which is unreliable and I&#x27;m not even sure it works with the latest Live 10&quot;. It does <i></i>NOT<i></i> work properly and it&#x27;s unsupported&#x2F;unmaintained. You get misaligned circles, up to 4 per channel, instead of plugin names, because redraw logic is broken.<p>&gt; Having all instruments and plugins in a horizontally-oriented trough allows quick drag-and-drop rearrangement.<p>That&#x27;s true in most DAWs. E.g. in Logic, you just drag plugins around, either in the channel strip which would be always open for a given channel, but ALSO in the mixer view. Try dragging plugins across channels in Live and see how that goes for you.<p>&gt; It allows you to reach the knobs on their native instruments and plugins without the need to open&#x2F;close plugin windows firs<p>Same in Bitwig. In Logic, you can&#x27;t but instead you can e.g. see all (native) EQ curves for all channels simultaneously in the mixer view and access it without having to select the track first.<p>&gt; MIDI mapping becomes much quicker and intuitive when you can simply toggle the MIDI&#x2F;Keyboard mapping overlay for a given plugin.<p>Same in Bitwig. In Logic it&#x27;s a few clicks instead of one but the idea is the same.<p>&gt; Being able to nest plugins within them like macros and then quickly hide or reveal a dozen plugins within a single rack is great for declutterring an otherwise busy interface.<p>True. But that comes at a price of those chains and effects being even LESS discoverable when it comes to mixing. Since now a particular plugin may be buried deep two layers down in a rack of racks.')
