A 5 point harness is best.  A car seat converts two or three point harness to a 5 point.  Which is great, because those soft little bodies need as many touch points as is possible to spread the load of force.  We know for a fact that the 5 point harness is the best, that is why race car drivers use 5 point harnesses instead of lap belts.<p>The three point harness is a good compromise between the uselessness of a lap belt and the incovinience of a 5 point harness. But its certainly not as good as a 5. Point harness.')
