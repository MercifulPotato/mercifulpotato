The guy is a stock promoter through and through. It&#x27;s really sad to see people fall into this guys trap.<p>He has an incredibly story (coming from nothing) but lets look at his career:<p>He &quot;leaves&quot; (aka fired) Facebook for being a D*ck head. Nobody is willing to work with him because he is rude and a jerk. His direct reports would cry regularly. Steven Levy talked about this in his book on Facebook.<p>He starts a VC fund. The fund has no &quot;major&quot; wins. For a guy writing checks in 2011 he didn&#x27;t get any of the big wins. The VC fund literally &quot;burns down&quot; as Axios put it because he divorced his wife and was chasing a girl in Italy rather than being in the office.<p>Now he SPACs worthless companies selling them off to retail traders who think he is Warren Buffett. He is a salesman. The guy is on CNBC every other day.<p>I get the &quot;holding truth to power&quot; narrative is attractive  but Chamath is not our saviour. I would argue he is just as bad as any other hedge fund manager. Taking advantage of retail investors.<p>Chamath talking about protecting the little guy is like Steve Cohen talking about respecting securities laws.')
