Item(by='KAMSPioneer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610149824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25692127, text='Sorry, I&#x27;m probably explaining myself poorly. I much prefer chat systems with PFS because it mitigates the blast radius of a key leak, I get that. What I&#x27;m saying is, <i>if</i> you store a message history that contains the plaintext that Mallory wants, and it&#x27;s stored in the same way the identity key is, PFS doesn&#x27;t get you much.<p>The attacker who has all your ciphertexts needs the decryption key to get the plaintext (which she wants). Now, with a PFS scheme the key gets deleted as soon as I receive and decrypt the message, so the attacker is out of luck, basically (even if she gets my long-term key). However, PFS only moves the target to my plaintext message database...which is stored the same way my key is (as I understand it). So really, unless I purge my message history with some regularity (I do), then the stakes are the same -- don&#x27;t let the attacker get access to the device.<p>But most people prefer to have all their chat history available and searchable, at which point individual decryption keys don&#x27;t matter and therefore PFS doesn&#x27;t, in my opinion, help much.')
