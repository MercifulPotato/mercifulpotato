Nokia owns (IP-sense) many parts of the ecosystem - but not all of them (not to mention third-party components like the Java interpreter found on some S60 and above devices). They tried to release it in 2009 to attract some interest - but the iPhone and Windows Mobile (Android were very niche at the time) were better to say the least and withdraw the offer before the year ends (at the time Nokia tries to enter the netbook business). Worse of it, some parts are owned by Ericsson, Sony, probably NTT and a lot of others that I forgot. Oh, and I am not sure and this might be wrong but I heard rumours that some of the Symbian IP might be under the care of UK Crown (due to insolvent Psion). If it were true, this kills any chance of releasing the code.')
