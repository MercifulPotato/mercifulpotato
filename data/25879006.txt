Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611369240, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25875958, text='If the alternative to a x% chance of upselling someoone to a yearly subscription is &quot;read one article and maybe never come back to their site&quot; then the price that the vendor will want to charge for that article is x% of that yearly subscription.  You mention 1&#x2F;2 a cent in multiple comments, but that&#x27;s not a realistic expectation - if the paywalled sites would offer a per-article payment, they would definitely want to charge much more than that for that single article, closer to a dollar or so. They don&#x27;t offer per-article pricing because the currently paywalled sites can earn more otherwise - the micropayment challenges aren&#x27;t relevant, they will not sell their goods so cheaply (as it would devalue and &#x27;cannibalize&#x27; their main revenue) even if there was a zero-fee micropayment mechanism.<p>Half a cent per article is a plausible target for all the weak&#x2F;cheap sources who can&#x27;t possibly afford to put up a paywall right now because nobody would pay. It&#x27;s not going to be used by the currently paywalled sites, their business model relies on getting a not-micro amount from each customer.')
