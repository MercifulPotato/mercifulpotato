Eg, as paying someone to demonstrate a deep understanding of a topic and articulate the uncertainties. That is different from traditional research because they aren&#x27;t being asked to do anything exactly new. But in practice that is what I think the better researchers actually do.<p>Maybe there is a clue in the name &quot;re-search&quot;. Epistemologically I don&#x27;t think it is possible to set out to discover something that isn&#x27;t already known to exist, so the justification for paying people would best be for evidence that they were searching rather than if they find something.')
