Moving to extended point is impractical for a great many reasons.  Transfer function form IIRs put high demands on FP dynamic range that other forms do not.  This has real world parallels too, since the most basic way to realize an analog filter is with the transfer function method.  I don’t know of anyone who makes a 2 F capacitor with tolerances that are within 2 pF.')
