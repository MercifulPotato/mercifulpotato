Why try to squash the former into the latter when you could just use the former directly?<p>I&#x27;m just struggling to see your point here. You&#x27;re saying it demonstrates a lack of effort in learning best practices whilst also saying that it&#x27;s a lack of understanding of how to use OO. If it&#x27;s a multi paradim language and you ignore FP approaches that are fully supported in favour of OO patterns (to deal with the same thing!) I&#x27;m not quite sure that&#x27;s a lack of effort learning best practices. It&#x27;s more &quot;I have an OO hammer, I&#x27;ll hammer away with that&quot;')
