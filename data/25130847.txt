It’s impossible for solar to provide 100% of the power used in a day because the sun doesn’t shine for 24 hours. It also doesn’t reduce the amount provided by baseline power sources because they can’t scale down quickly (they take days to start up and slow down) so they ended up generating a wild excess of energy those days. The amount of power generated != power used and if there’s no one to use it then it goes unused. On top of that, that first link was great and showed just how much solar fluctuates week over week and day over day making it hard to predict.<p>Renewables are fantastic, don’t get me wrong, and I’m a huge proponent of them. Problem is they’re just one piece of the bigger picture and making wildly infeasible claims like 100% renewable energy just makes it that much harder to implement a reasonable and highly effective strategy that relies on growing renewables while maintaining a robust grid that can provide power cheaply. Southern Australia is one of the most expensive power markets in the world so it’s not really a good example and the world shouldn’t be following their model.')
