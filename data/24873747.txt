Given all the past (and even current!) cases of censorship and book burning, shouldn&#x27;t we strive to never allow that ever again and to protects books for future generations ?<p>Finally we have a way to preserve books in perfect form forever digitally yet people somehow try to shackle this new technology with paper book technology limitations. The same limitations that coat us so much ideas, knowledge and stories as books would burn, rot or turn to dust.<p>Frankly any form of technology trying to prevent digital book distribution and archiving really is a digital equivalent of the inquisition book burning (or helping make that happen again).')
