There are so many UGFs (underground facilities) on the JIPTL  (Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List) and we don&#x27;t have anywhere near enough ordnance of the right types staged to hit them all before Seoul is a smoking crater. I&#x27;ve participated in 5 or 6 of the big Korean Theater exercises[1][2], working at a Corps-level HQ. The entire country is a reinforced underground fortress. Remember how we shelled Iwo Jima for several days and still barely scratched the defences on Mt Suribachi? NK is like that, but worse. They&#x27;ve had 60 years to dig in, and instead of a small island a few miles wide, the fortress is the size of Indiana.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Key_Resolve" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Key_Resolve</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ulchi-Freedom_Guardian" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ulchi-Freedom_Guardian</a>')
