All these temporal and dynamic resolution techniques are here to stay as they -improve- the look of games no matter the HW.<p>What do I mean? Obviously dynamic resolution and temporal reprojection are worse than say, a fixed 8k rendering at 240hz! Yes, true! But, that&#x27;s not the correct math.<p>The more correct math would be, on a given hardware, say a 3080, would you rather spend the power to render each single pixel exactly, or would you rather &quot;skip&quot; some pixels and have smart ways to recover them for a fraction of the price, almost equal to the real deal, so now you have extra power to spend somewhere else?<p>Of course if you just do less work with DLSS or similar technologies, you&#x27;re losing something, it&#x27;s bad. But that&#x27;s never the equation. The real equation is that no matter how powerful the HW, the HW is a fixed resource. So if you spend power to do X, you cannot do Y, and you have to chose whether or not X is more valuable than Y.<p>Makes sense?<p>Now, all that said, it&#x27;s also true that sometimes you max out everything in a game, you cannot have more of anything because that&#x27;s literally all the game has to render, and at that point sure, it&#x27;s reasonable to spend power even in things that are not that great bang-for-the-buck because literally you cannot do anything else anyways! So for the very top PC HW, you end up doing silly things, like rendering in native 4k because you cannot use that power in any other way.<p>But that&#x27;s in a way &quot;bad&quot;, it&#x27;s a silly thing that we have to do as there is no other option! If we had the option though, it would be much better even on a 3080 to render say a 2k or 1080p upscaled to 4k via DLSS, and use the remaining power to say, have 2&#x2F;3 times the detail in textures or geometry or number or shadow-casting lights etc etc...')
