But when they are the subjects of similar things, then they don&#x27;t like and want to have this power for them.<p>There is a very good and ironic example of that in France:<p>The former president Nicolas Sarkozy created and pushed a lot of nefarious &#x27;security&#x27; laws when he was president. For example, the possibility for police to monitor phone calls without a warrant and things like that.<p>To critics, he was replying that the state is &#x27;trustful&#x27; and that only bad people could fear for their privacy.<p>Back now, a few years later, police wiretapped a phone line that he opened under a fake name to secretly discuss about another police investigation that is currently targeting him and he allegedly used this line to abuse of authority and try to get insider knowledge from law officials in exchange for a special position.<p>At his trial and in medias, he cried everywhere that it is unfair and abused that his phone lines could have been wiretapped like that to provide evidences against him. Like if he is a victim and not the person that pushed these bad security laws against the population despite a lot of critics of people concerned by freedom and privacy topics.')
