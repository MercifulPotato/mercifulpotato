(pretty much unavoidable in chrome). If you have a google account then they know your phone number is verified and getting a phone number usually requires government mandated identification.<p>Otherwise they use fingerprinting to identify you and correlate it with activity on google, youtube, google ads, etc.<p>If those two things fail then Google will give you an endless stream of captchas even if you answer all of them correctly. I often had to complete 20 captchas only for it to tell me &quot;sorry&quot;. There was maybe a 1&#x2F;3 chance that completing all 20 captchas let me through.<p>Meanwhile on a different browser where I&#x27;m logged into google I get through on first attempt. Google captchas are just a data mining operation. They have nothing to do with proving whether you are human. After all, if they have enough data about you they often give you the option to skip the captcha altogether. The captcha is a psychological attack on you to convince you to give Google more data.')
