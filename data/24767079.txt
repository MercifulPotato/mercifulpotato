They are the party of &#x27;free speech,&#x27; God, guns and eliminating abortions. The rest is ancillary to their voters. When you cast your opponents as God-hating, Christmas-fighting, Gun-stealing, baby-killing potheads, people don&#x27;t really care about your economic policies, they&#x27;re just voting to stop the anti-Christ.<p>The Democratic tent on the other hand is stretched about as broad as it possibly can be, and they don&#x27;t really commit to anything. If they cast themselves as too progressive they risk alienating their right flank and the &#x27;centrist undecideds&#x27; (I mean my <i>lord</i> who can&#x27;t make up their mind about this). If they cast themselves as too conservative, they risk alienating the Bernie bros (who IMO swung the election for Trump last time).<p>So, they stand as a big blob. They espouse a kind of wink-wink-nudge-nudge progressivism: no clear support socialized medicine, a refusal to answer questions about court packing, and immigration doesn&#x27;t even come up. Maybe more DACA? Where we just throw the problem under a rug again, instead of actually addressing it.<p>I personally wish the Democrats were half as progressive as Republicans are trying to make them out to be, but they&#x27;re not. Not even close. Half of what the Republicans accuse them of I&#x27;m like damn, that&#x27;s solid center to center-left policy, I wish the Dems were on board with that!')
