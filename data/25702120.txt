Someone was like &quot;but what about the ACLU???&quot;<p>Fun fact: The Nazis never ended up marching in Skokie, despite the court case. Their goal wasn&#x27;t to make their views known (their views were known). Their goal was to harass small municipalities with significant Jewish populations, and the ACLU said, &quot;Sure, we&#x27;ll help.&quot;<p>I still don&#x27;t think the ACLU is a fascist organization, to be clear, but on the free speech front they&#x27;ve done way more advocacy for fascism (which will crush free speech if permitted to take power) than literally anything else.<p>But in this case - where it&#x27;s about a private company, so there isn&#x27;t even a legal right, and when there&#x27;s a serious proposal on the table to <i>harm</i> free speech by gutting Section 230 to preserve people&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; to force a private entity, whether Twitter or a tiny phpBB, to carry their speech - I&#x27;m starting to worry.')
