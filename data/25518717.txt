The AI did a better job of figuring out what I like (138 and uplifting trance) than Spotify does (EDM). I blame it in Armin van Buuren: he is an <i>extremely</i> popular EDM DJ and he plays a very wide variety of EDM. If you listen to EDM chances are he has at least a few dozen sets you&#x27;d enjoy. That&#x27;s the problem: he&#x27;s prolific and he connects every genre of EDM to every other genre of EDM. He&#x27;s a &quot;super-connector&quot; and I could easily see how this wrecks recommendation algorithms, all roads lead to Armin.<p>Basically: recommending music is not the same as recommending goods, and I think the same approach is being used.')
