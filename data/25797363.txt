Elitism in retrospect is one thing, but trying to bring it forward or explicitly advancing it seems like it would result poorly. By what criteria would an Albert Einstein, the patent clerk, ever have been selected? Your best bet at an Einstein is to let everyone in and see who discovers relativity.<p>It seems to me that the only way to enrich the elite is to empower the masses, so to speak. In any case, I think it&#x27;s more important to focus on what circumstances allow a person&#x27;s potential to emerge. Potential is a highly available resource.<p>Like the author note, the problem isn&#x27;t that most will fail. It&#x27;s that most will never try, tenure or no. The free mindedness required to even attempt greatness is often frivolous. Frivolousness is more of an egalitarian than an elitist hallmark.<p>*Note: I&#x27;m not referring to politics or economics in any way. Just playing along with the language of the article.')
