(He may be a smart footballer, or even a smart person. But even those are sometime  wrong).<p>Lacking emotional skills is, when profound, a disease called Autism. Which makes a lot of things really hard. I don&#x27;t believe there to be anything comparable for lacking quantitative skills while being of normal intelligence otherwise.<p>There&#x27;s a thing called dyscalculia, I believe. Have you ever heard of it? Have you heard of dyslexia? Is the latter one more widespread, or is it more profound? The answer doesn&#x27;t actually matter for the conclusion not to worry too much about the phenomenon.<p>The best advice is to be excellent at what you&#x27;re good at, while trying to foster high regard for other disciplines, an to find people and involve them where appropriate, and to try to track how useful their advice is and, if it is, to seriously consider it.<p>Incidentally, all those are emotional skills and, in my experience, lawyers are far better at respecting statistics or math than STEM graduates are at not sneering at any intellectual endeavour that doesn&#x27;t glorify Richard Feynman.<p>(who, by the way, was the rare exemption. And not only because it would have been awkward for him to sneer at any discipline that doesn&#x27;t glorify him)')
