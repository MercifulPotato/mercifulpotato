We can argue about it but basically can quantify what is or isn’t a valid scientific experiment.<p>The demarcation problem is essentially scientists disagreeing that we can sharply divide science from non-science.<p>The replication crisis is evidence that not all &quot;science&quot; is actually science.<p>&gt; If one side argues in bad faith, they can just keep making shit up or doing things to undermine the discourse itself, like talk over someone else or bully them.<p>Silencing one side of a debate is also undermining the discourse.<p>&gt; What we are seeing now is a shifting both of cultural norms and the infrastructure of our media environment which means that “free speech” no longer has some of the constraints and restrictions which enabled it to perform the truth-seeking function we desire it to.<p>Actually what we are seeing now is the democratization of free speech so that an oligarchic elite is no longer the only group who is able to make their voice heard. In this light it is unsurprising that the oligarchic elite wants restrictions on speech.')
