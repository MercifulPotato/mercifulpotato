In the past, you could get tenure at community or regional colleges just by teaching. If you were interested you might from time to time publish an article in the institution&#x27;s journal or maybe even in a real journal - as a botanist or astronomer you can do citizen science without much equipment. That&#x27;s how it ought to be.<p>But nowadays, administration has taken over, and everyone gets to fulfill the publication metric, or there won&#x27;t be tenure.  So you have predatory journals (I prefer the term &quot;journal of convenience&quot;) that fulfill a genuine need. The only one who is worse off is the taxpayer or tuition-paying student because they get to pay the page charges. That is a problem, but everyone reacts to incentives.<p>There are certain parallels to zero-tolerance policies at schools - in the past the popular kids got off lightly, consequentely because of real or perceived corruption the popular kids now get away with no punishment at all while everyone else has a 5-ton weight dropped on them, all in the name of fairness.')
