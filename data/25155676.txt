But very cool tech.<p>I&#x27;ve used SQL&#x2F;MED in Postgres, FDW, linked servers in SQL Server, database links in Oracle, and more advanced virtualization&#x2F;federation engines also.<p>If you haven&#x27;t been exposed to this area before, highly recommended as another tool to know about for the toolkit.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SQL&#x2F;MED" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SQL&#x2F;MED</a>')
