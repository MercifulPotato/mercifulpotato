Most big Canadian companies trade in Toronto and New York, so I can buy in Toronto in CAD$ and sell in New York for US$ because some HFTs are keeping them exactly in sync. All I pay is two trading commissions and a 1-2cents &#x2F; $100share in spread. So converting $30k would cost me $20 in commissions and ~$12 in spread, so about 0.1% in cost and that goes down for as much as I&#x27;m comfortable in doing per trade.<p>I probably lose a bit more in whatever distortion I&#x27;ve created, but $30k doesn&#x27;t account for much in their hundreds of millions of $ in daily volume.')
