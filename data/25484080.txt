So before you delve into that process, take a step back and think carefully what you want out of it.<p>I like long walks accompanied by music (ambient music). Walking can be a deeply meditative experience, just pick terrain that won&#x27;t give you trouble (no high traffic streets, no steep hills etc) and just go. Walk until your body starts doing it mechanically, and don&#x27;t focus on the destination nor in search of stimuli.\nMaybe because walking exerts energy, it can be more effective than just sitting or laying down - when you are really energetic and not tired. Maybe because the scenery changes and it acts as a context switch to our minds.<p>It has been both effective as a form of emotion regulation, coming up with novel solutions, and just feeling more in sync with myself.')
