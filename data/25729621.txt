This is similar to companies that choose their initial technology with scalability in mind before they&#x27;re even remotely close to needing to scale.  I&#x27;ve actually done this only to discover that scalability has a very definite cost and when you&#x27;re small it has an outsized impact on your burn rate.  If you have success, you&#x27;re going to figure out a way to make the changes you need.  Case in point: Facebook.  They successfully grew a PHP codebase into one of the most popular apps in the world.  It definitely cost a lot more money for them to make PHP work, but when they got to that point they were a lot less cost-sensitive.<p>Planning for that far down the road is the least of your worries.  And any plans you make along those lines are not likely to be very accurate anyway.  You&#x27;re much better off optimizing for the near to mid term.  Based on the hosting costs described by the OP they are already reaping a tangible value here.')
