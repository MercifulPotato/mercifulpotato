Regardless of platform, mobile apps <i>feel</i> the same - they both have navbars, tab bars, lists and table views, etc. Even if I could use an iOS navbar on web, it would look so out of place it&#x27;s not worth considering.<p>Okay, so you can&#x27;t reuse UI components, surely you can reuse the Dart code that makes up the guts of the webapp? And, sure, you could, but why would you when you can spend maybe 10 minutes to translate it to native JS (the two languages are practically identical) and ship it without the Flutter Web dependency?<p>I actually feel like it&#x27;d be easier for me to convert some of my Flutter components into React ones, than to try and learn Flutter Web and set up its whole toolchain. I think it&#x27;s a cool idea, but it&#x27;s not meant for widespread use (speculation): it&#x27;s meant specifically for Google&#x27;s Fuchsia, where they are probably planning on shipping Web applications pretending to be native desktop apps along with the full Chrome experience much like they did for Chromebook.')
