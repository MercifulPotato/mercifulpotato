That runs at lower current (thus watts) than computers and so we had to run new electrical and AC into the server room to use it for IT equipment.<p>Cars are trying to switch to 48V because 40-50V is a range where touching a live wire gets your attention but won&#x27;t do too much permanent damage (eg kill you).  Or if you went with 20v you might be able to reuse equipment designed for USB power supplies.')
