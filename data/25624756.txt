I remember reading about how for broad brand advertising they used to segment by city. Half the cities got an ad for Coca Cola and half didn&#x27;t. Then you compare sales of Coca Cola. No one will publicly publish numbers because it&#x27;s a mix of sensitive sales data and competitive advantage (ie: otherwise your competitors don&#x27;t have to burn money running their own tests). Also, smaller shops turn their online advertising campaigns on and off all the time to test impact.')
