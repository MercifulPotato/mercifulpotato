Modern ICBM designs have multiple independently targetable warheads. There are also submarines with nuclear missiles. You can also launch decoys (eg: aluminium foil or flares).<p>And uh. Recently, I was reading a book called Skunk Works. The author explains that, basically, the US was able to keep the existence of stealth fighters a secret from the public (and Russia) for years and years. He also mentions the idea of a stealth ICBM multiple times in the book (which was published in 1995). That&#x27;s when it hit me. That technology already exists. Russia and the US probably have an arsenal of stealth ICBMs. They&#x27;re just not publicly boasting about it, but if you think about it, there&#x27;s no reason that technology wouldn&#x27;t exist, particularly since military contractors were already thinking about it over 25 years ago.')
