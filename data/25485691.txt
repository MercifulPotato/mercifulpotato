And what are they getting in return for their time and labor?<p>&gt; When we hire people, we make sure they are better prepared than our market competition. We provide them with a desk, computers, printers, access to food and beverage, access to tuition related to the job they will be making, and many stuff the employee doesn&#x27;t have to pay for. How and why could we think society-wide should be different? Governments should start thinking of their citizens as employees.<p>Access to those things are provided <i>conditionally</i> upon their satisfactory performance. What conditions are you proposing that governments require to be met?')
