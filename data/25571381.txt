Same as LinkAce, it has custom text, tags, full-text search and thus can work as your own micro-blogging&#x2F;blogging&#x2F;pastebin tool.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a solution in this space and I feel like none are really there although I could probably make it work:<p>- I want input to be absurdly simple. The standard bookmarks are perfect, as is a simple bookmarklet but I want the same ease of use from my mobile<p>- I want the content to be easily cacheable on my mobile so I can read it later while offline, if possible in a more readable rendering<p>- I want the content of the link to be archived in a reliable way; Archive.org is a good way because there&#x27;s a chance that the link is public anyway so it is of potential value to everyone<p>- I want to have some liberty around the link, like the possibility of adding text with a little formatting and the possibility to have no link, just text, to act like its own article. Full-text search on everything is also important<p>I think 2) is the most contraining requirement because it requires more mobile-specific development (probably an app), the rest can be worked around with many solutions already.')
