Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=[25405007], score=None, time=1607844605, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404813, text='I actually used to live near there and have driven down that road numerous times.<p>* @7pm in the morning in the winter the whole area can be fogged up and it was dark. I&#x27;ve driven down and cycled down there when it wouldn&#x27;t have been safe doing 15mph.<p>* Animals can be hard to see, even in good conditions. Especially the donkeys, they are grey, on a black road and the sky is normally grey in England. Many of the animals there have high-vis collars to make them more visible at night.<p>* It depends what section of the road. In one section of that road the visibility is excellent (when there isn&#x27;t fog). In another stretch even in the summer,\nthe visibility is weird due to much of the road being in partial shade due to the trees.<p>* Drivers go much faster than the 40mph limit in that area almost all the time, especially on the high visibility parts. It doesn&#x27;t help that if you come off the M25&#x2F;A31 you would have been going about 70mph and so doing 40mph makes it feels so slow that you can step out of the car.<p>* The three A-roads near are either blocked due to heavy traffic especially in the summer (infrastructure in general is a joke in Hampshire and Dorset) or they don&#x27;t go where you want.')
