The article sadly seems like it was taken down and I&#x27;ve never seen it replicated.<p>Basically all the White Bikes ended up in the canals, and the theory is simply, 1% of the population is &#x27;bad&#x27; all the time and good people are &#x27;bad&#x27; 1% of the time (for instance drunk), and you should design for this.<p>Even if your society is near perfect you still have to engineer around that 1% catastrophic failure. Bikes will be thrown in canals, and that woman possibly is a good person in a 1% bad spot or an outsider who is &#x27;bad&#x27; for the group.')
