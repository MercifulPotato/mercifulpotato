Once in a while I slept 7 hours, that was the maximum I could and I felt really great about it. Then I accidentally started intermittent fasting about 6 months back to see if helps with lowering cholesterol. But surprisingly I started sleeping more. Now, I eat my meals between 6am and 1pm. After that I fast. I sleep well and I can feel my body producing enough melatonin. For some reason, melatonin supplements never helped me when I tried before. My urge to drink alcohol has also lowered since even though I am an occasional drinker and I sleep for at least 8 hours a day. I can feel my body healing from at least 10 years of insomnia.')
