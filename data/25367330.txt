Under California law, though, you do have the right to request deletion of your personal information if you are a California resident: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;</a>.<p>2) Legal responsibility aside, if you email hn@ycombinator.com with your request they are likely to help you do whatever you would like.  I think you are better off phrasing it as a polite request, though, rather than a veiled legal threat.')
