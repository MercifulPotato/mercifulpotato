The round steering wheel looks good and works nicely. This doesn&#x27;t look good and I imagine it&#x27;s going to perform as badly as any of the other F1-style steering wheels do in real life.<p>And why get rid of the stalks? BMW had those annoying turn signal stalks that would always be in the neutral position even if you had the turn signal on. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone liked them. I know at least a couple of BMW owners who didn&#x27;t know how you were supposed to cancel the signal without being explicitly told about it by someone. I think BMW already returned to more sensible turn signal stalks now. I can&#x27;t fathom at all why you would trade the steering wheel stalk for two buttons on the steering wheel.')
