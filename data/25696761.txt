To reiterate, however, tolerant societies should not and cannot tolerate intolerance.<p>People promoting the “election fraud” lie, or supporting the insurrection&#x2F;coup attempt are undermining democracy and are borderline seditious. It’s not okay to spread that lie, and if not ban, HN should at least officially condemn those false and odious beliefs.<p>Right now I believe it’s our civic duty to make clear that those beliefs are unacceptable and anti-democratic and will not be tolerated.<p>I don’t know if you really understand that an armed mob attempted to take hostage members of Congress in order to stop the certification of the new, legitimately elected President.<p>What do you believe? If supporting that isn’t the line that someone should be condemned for crossing, and shunned, then what is?<p>HN - your silence is complicity. How do you think people of color feel reading HN comments where folks argue how racism isn’t really a thing or was “solved” in the 60s? Do they feel like people are being kind according to the guidelines?<p>What does it say about you if you ban me for what I said, but keep the racists and folks who wouldn’t mind seeing Trump get three or four or five more terms, because I’m honest about my beliefs but they hide behind junior-high level verbal wordplay?')
