Educational handicaps on multiple generations of students?<p>My point is that it&#x27;s cheap to wear a mask and socially distance yourself while otherwise carrying on with life. It&#x27;s extremely expensive on society to force everyone to stay home as much as possible and avoid certain businesses. It&#x27;s expensive because it pushes the country more rapidly into debt, it pushes millions into poverty, it drives up suicide rates, and dozens more second and third order effects we won&#x27;t find out about until the coming years.')
