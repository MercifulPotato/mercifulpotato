Wow! I&#x27;m never going back. Everything about it made me really happy, from the smooth install (Debian often has issues with serial console installs), to being able to boot ZFS, to the sheer simplicity of configuring the OS.<p>One stark example of how clean the FreeBSD install is: there are something like 9 or 10 processes running after boot for a fresh FreeBSD install, compared to dozens for a fresh Debian or Ubuntu install.<p>Using jails is also a lot more pleasant than using docker.')
