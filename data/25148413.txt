At some point it feels like you’re doing archaeology more than research. I have to specify the time range I want to search in more and more these days.<p>Sure, the information may not have changed, but I do not trust things that haven’t been updated in that long. Especially anything tech related. Imagine it’s the year 2050, you do a search for how to do some mundane thing in React, and you’re finding articles that were written <i>today</i>. Maybe some future person is even reading through this comment right now.')
