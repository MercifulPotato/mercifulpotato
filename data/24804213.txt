Utilities are essential services AND have monopoly power. Facebook and Twitter are neither essential services nor do they have monopoly power (there are a billion other websites you can post on, and the barrier to entry to creating your own website is close to zero).<p>Being big is not the same as being a monopoly. McDonald&#x27;s is big, but they are not a monopoly because they have a lot of competitors. Regulating Facebook or Twitter as utilities would be as dumb as regulating Mcdonald&#x27;s as if it were a utility.')
