Heck, there is a reason that knights hunted the things to prove how good they were.  When you have to put a piece of metal on the spear to keep the thing from coming up the spear and killing you too, it marks a tough animal.<p>If I remember right, part of the problem is that they are not great eating.  Although, a animal overrunning Texas boggles my mind.')
