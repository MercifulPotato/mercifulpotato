That purchase included related patents. The expectation is that they will move to integrate their own modems into their SOC in the next couple of years. That will help increase the efficiency of their chips.<p>It may also make it feasible to include 5G in laptops. Currently Apple licenses Qualcomm modems. Qualcomm charges a fee that is proportional to the full retail price of the device. That would be significant for a laptop. If Apple can use their own modems and get around that licensing cost, it makes a laptop with a cellular connection more likely.')
