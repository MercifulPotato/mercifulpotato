It used to generate 5-10X what it does now before the days of mobile apps. Back then it was a very meaningful addition to my grad student salary. I had 250K MAU at one point, many of which seemed to be coming from middle and high schools in lower income places that had common computers but presumably not graphing calculators for every student.<p>It&#x27;s <i>SORELY</i> out of date with current web tech. Problem is it&#x27;s not generating enough ad revenue for me to want to go and rewrite it (over working on all my other side projects), and it&#x27;s not generating little enough for me to want to shut it down -- it&#x27;s still profitable even if it&#x27;s just a little.')
