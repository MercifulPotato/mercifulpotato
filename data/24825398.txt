Industry leaders have the revenue to pay hefty stable salaries while those funded through public support don&#x27;t have enough incentive--positions are unstable and tethered to short projects and budgets for those projects are non-starters. As such, most talented scientists, researchers, and developers don&#x27;t bother supporting public research and just join industry.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to build out lovely infrastructure but then you still need people to use it and innovate on it. The current models rely on student labor (undergrad, graduates, and post docs) to pickup the tabs with low compensation relative to skill and passionate researchers to pick up the rest in unpaid or underpaid time from faculty supported positions. This model isn&#x27;t sustainable where a BS can start people out in the $70-100k range while research will struggle to maintain half of that and often want a post doc for that rate.')
