Most code editors have a regex search and replace figuring out the regex requires too much regex expertise. I can&#x27;t think of a good example off the top of my head but for example, being able to search for things that match multiple rules. It would be much easier for many users to be able to say &quot;starts with x&quot;, &quot;ends with y&quot;, &quot;has abc in the middle&quot; as 3 separate statements than to have to derive the regex that does it.<p>Similarly being able to search easily for balanced parens, brackets, quotes. And being able to search programming language aware as in &quot;only in strings&quot;, &quot;only in comments&quot;, etc...<p>All of those seem like they&#x27;d be useful features but I know of no editor that do any more than just a single regex with no context')
