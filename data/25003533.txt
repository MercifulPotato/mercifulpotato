Not all of them, but definitely more than half. They could have been take-home if(f) the professors trusted students not to use the internet during an exam.<p>In the math and computing classes, professors structured the questions in layers that tested different concepts. You could always have a double-sided &quot;cheat sheet&quot;, and some professors let students bring in the whole textbook for time-constrained exams. It took far too long to &quot;brute-force&quot; more than one or two questions.<p>In the liberal arts classes, you were tested more on critical thinking and contextual questions. You needed to understand concepts at more than a surface level to make compelling arguments about how they related to each other, and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to develop that understanding for many topics over the course of an hour, even if you have the primary material in front of you.<p>We weren&#x27;t allowed to bring anything with a radio, but forcing students to take exams in complete isolation always felt odd to me. It&#x27;s pretty rare to need to do actual work in a &quot;clean-room&quot; environment.')
