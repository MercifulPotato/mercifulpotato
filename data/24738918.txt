I logged into reddit in the default mode for the first time in (years?) and holy cow what a disaster.  Herky jerky async widgets assembling themselves, huge images and videos and animated crap I don&#x27;t want to see, maybe 2 posts visible altogether on the front page (without scrolling), vast amounts of wasted whitespace, and &quot;Sign in to Reddit with Google.&quot;  Uh, no.  Ha ha, thanks for the option.<p>Still better than mobile, freezing up the device to inquire if I want to use the app.  (&quot;No...I also don&#x27;t want to use the NSA&#x27;s app, but thanks.&quot;)<p>How does anyone use that site?')
