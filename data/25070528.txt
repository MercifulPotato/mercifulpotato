Item(by='llimos', descendants=None, kids=[25071540, 25071042], score=None, time=1605193093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069467, text='@mgechev Thank you, I appreciate you replying to someone who&#x27;s clearly not the biggest fan :)<p>My main point isn&#x27;t so much the individual difficulties like debugging, yes you can build something on top to fix it. It&#x27;s that these are symptoms of not respecting the idioms of the language the framework is built in. This leads to everything working fine if you do it exactly by the book, but when you start deviating slightly from the standard Angular way of doing things, the cracks start to appear.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t happen if it was written to work <i>with</i> the language rather than against it. There&#x27;s no good reason why me setting my own setTimeout() without going through Angular&#x27;s should break things, but it does (and Angular reports my app as &#x27;unstable&#x27;). If I have a getter method on my component that gets called thousands of times a second by Angular to see if something changed, it&#x27;s another symptom that the framework wasn&#x27;t written to fit neatly together with the language.<p>The fact that you can add yet more code and tooling to handle these issues as they come up does not alter the fundamental problem.<p>I&#x27;m really interested to know how many JS or DOM builtins Angular modifies, wraps, edits the prototype, or replaces in order to work. I know it modifies Promise, I think setTimeout too, and probably also DOMElement. @mgechev, would you have that information?')
