It’s not hard to track which signups came from ad clicks versus organic traffic. The problem is that most companies start out focused on their apps and simply assume advertising is a totally independent function that happens elsewhere in the company. Invest some time into including advertising as part of your signup process and it’s really not that difficult to track LTV of customers who signed up via ads.<p>In fact, that’s how Uber confirmed this fraud.
