But I do not believe that a production deployment of keycloak with HA, backups, customization, integrations, upgrades etc. is easy at all. It takes time and planning to get it right. Depending on the constraints, it isn&#x27;t obvious to me why it would win by default over SaaS alternatives, or simpler on-premises alternatives like OP&#x27;s.')
