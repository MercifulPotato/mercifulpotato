Linux, today, is already a performant, secure kernel with an incredibly stable userspace-facing ABI.<p>For packages, the problem isn&#x27;t so much being able to install old and new packages (although that&#x27;s certainly useful); the problem is maintaining a stable version while still fixing bugs and security issues. It&#x27;s no good just having a packaging system that lets me run a 5-year-old glibc with a fresh-from-git application server if that ancient glibc has multiple known exploits in it. The work in an LTS system is carefully backporting fixes to your chosen old version while holding its ABI stable.')
