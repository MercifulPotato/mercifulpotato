Item(by='gamegoblin', descendants=None, kids=[25567331], score=None, time=1609222910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25567216, text='To re-iterate my original statement:<p>&quot;Is it not the case that we could work 15 hours per week and maintain the lifestyle that was prevalent during Keynes&#x27; day?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m explicitly talking about living as if it were the 1930s. No internet. No cable. No air conditioning. No eating at restaurants multiple times per week. Small house. No college. Maybe no car.<p>So you say I am equating the cheapest houses today with the median back then, which is <i>absolutely correct</i>. That is exactly what I am trying to say. You can live a median 1930s lifestyle for dirt cheap today.<p>That house was built in 1948 and is basically the same as most other middle class houses built in that time period.<p>In 1930, fewer than 1% of people graduated from college. So if you want to live a median 1930s lifestyle, you probably don&#x27;t have to worry about sending your kids to college. You don&#x27;t need college to command the $13&#x2F;hr wage that is necessary to live this lifestyle anyway.<p>Only 48% of households owned a car in 1930, so if you want a median 1930s lifestyle, that may involve not owning a car. And if you do own a car, a used car from 2005 can be had for $1000 and trounces any middle class 1930s car from that era in every metric.')
