If you&#x27;re a youtuber shooting an interview with a single camera and no crew, you want it to keep recording and you can edit it down later. Action cameras will keep recording no matter how long your ski run is. Someone recording a sports match or school play or band concert or lecture will want continuous recording. Drone videographers don&#x27;t want to worry that if they&#x27;re delayed taking off, the recording will end mid-flight.<p>Of course, how many people really <i>need</i> or will <i>watch</i> a full length video of little bobby&#x27;s soccer match? Or need a DSLR to video it rather than a cell phone? Those are different questions...')
