Contrary evidence is cleaved from the story if it doesn&#x27;t fit the agenda.<p>It is hypocritical when the authors paint themselves as concerned with the plight of an identity category, but downplay negative outcomes when it contradicts their agenda. From my perspective this shows how little these supposedly compassionate voices actually care. They&#x27;re simply exploiting the situation to score political points.<p>This isn&#x27;t unique to Asian-American identity politics. If you look you can find it across the entire spectrum of identity politics. The obvious solution in my view is to concern ourselves with the plight of individuals as individuals, not members of a specific tribe. Treating individuals equally was at the core of liberalism, but today it has been overtaken by philosophies that put membership in an identity category before the individual. The outcome is predictably divisive and toxic.')
