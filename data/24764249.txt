Yes it does require expertise to recover from a cockup, but you will never gain the expertise if you treat it as impossible.<p>Note that you don’t have to avoid getting in a mess: it’s normal, when you are trying to do something unusual or advanced (or impossible in other version control systems) to make a mistake and accidentally blow your foot off, but git gives you the tools to glue your foot back on good as new.')
