And they were living in much worse conditions of course.<p>Farming (especially without modern technology) is very cyclical, most of the time you have too much labour and too little land&#x2F;food. Then for a few months you have too few people to do everything that needs to be done.<p>And there was no easy way for vast majority of people to store surplus for more than a few years. And there was a real possibility of starvation if a few factors independent of you happen at the same time.<p>So the whole society and economy was structured around these constraints - that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t follow our intuitions. It made no sense to increase gains by 10% if you had to increase risk by 1% to do that. It made no sense to work harder if you have enough and it&#x27;s gonna spoil anyway. You&#x27;re just risking injury to throw it all away later.<p>There was a great series of articles about it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;24&#x2F;collections-bread-how-did-they...</a>')
