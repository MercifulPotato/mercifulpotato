Anymore than e.g. saying red hair used to be a sign of weakness, outdated views have no bearing on this discussion. Just because outdated views once existed and that normal behavior is now normal does not mean that we shouldn&#x27;t label impairments as such in order to try and understand and help those affected by them.<p>Edit: very interested in feedback on why this either rubbed some people the wrong way or was perceived as a negative contribution to the discussion')
