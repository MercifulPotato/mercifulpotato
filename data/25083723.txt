Sometimes it moves the window to the left half. Other times it moves to the right half. And some other times it does nothing until I press win+right first. Overall I think itâ€™s a terrible window management system. Sure MacOS has nothing built in but it takes about 5-10 mins to install and configure a much better system.')
