A president has the necessary means for an official communications channel, I can&#x27;t quite figure out why he chose Twitter, a service provided by a private company and not the government, instead.<p>At the same time I must say, I personally don&#x27;t use this type of social media anyway because I think there is a conflict of interest. I use Mastodon, Pixelfed, Pleroma, etc. No company gets to regulate my social activity on these.<p>I don&#x27;t think that this is censorship though, as it is not the government deplatforming these people and groups. It was clear from the start that private companies could do that and that it is well within their rights, the problem is that we rely on private companies for social media when we really don&#x27;t have to.')
