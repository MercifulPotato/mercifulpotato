Imagine after 2016, youtube decided to ban everyone accusing Trump of cheating. Do you think that would make the democrats &quot;see the light&quot;? Or do you think it would galvanize the democrats?<p>This election is ultimately going to be decided in the supreme court. Not on youtube. Youtube should have just kept out of this issue.<p>Trump is celebrating this right now because not only does it rile up his base, it makes independents and even some democrats take notice and sympathize with Trump.<p>Even if youtube had good intentions ( and I&#x27;m not sold on that ), they ultimately are damaging the country. But I guess that&#x27;s why they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.')
