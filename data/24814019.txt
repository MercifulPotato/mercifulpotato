A few centuries ago, effectively 100% of the population was religious and such beliefs were anathema.  Should society have suppressed the spread and adoption of that &quot;bad idea&quot; and remained religion-bound instead of becoming secular?<p>To endorse suppression of &quot;bad ideas&quot; is conservatism in a nutshell: The ideas we have today are surely right; anything that differs from them is dangerous and needs to be suppressed.')
