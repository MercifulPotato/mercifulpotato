Not really sure, but I guess the wave function and measuring devices? It does require something that corresponds to measurements and the evolution of that classical world is distinct and separate.<p>The wave function and any of its behaviors are not considered Real in CI, quite the opposite. CI posits that the wave function &#x2F; schrodinger equation is just a mathematical tool that can be used to model the behavior of quantum phenomena - it is merely a tool that we can use, together with the Born rule, to predict the outcome of measurements. The measurements are the only things that are real. That&#x27;s why CI is also sometimes summarized as &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; :).')
