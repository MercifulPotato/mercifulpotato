Separated bike paths, bike storage, showers at offices&#x2F;work, etc would all make it much more likely for someone to decide to bike.<p>We could tell people: Decide to bike and save money. Decide to bike and save health. Decide to bike and save the environment.<p>We can tell people those reasons now but there is still a huge hurdle, and it has nothing to do with the bikes or technology. What if all bike companies (and component manufacturers like Shimano) spent all their R&amp;D budgets on education and lobbying instead of better technology? That might work. Is any one company big enough to make a difference if it went at it alone? Probably not.<p>I don’t look forward to environmental catastrophe but I do think it could help move cycling into more of a mainstream solution. Then perhaps we could have the will to tackle some of the infrastructure and norm issues that keep cycling a hobby at best.')
