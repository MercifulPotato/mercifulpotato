The reason I found Caliphate interesting was not the details of Chaudhry&#x27;s story, which I experienced as were portrayed as dubious and in need of verification throughout; I certainly finished the podcast feeling uncertain whether Chaudhry had actually done any of the things he claimed.<p>Instead, the reason I&#x27;ve recommended this podcast to friends is that it spends most of its time on a fascinating exploration of the journalistic process.  How does reporter verify claims made by people about events in a war zone?  The people you interview have a reason to lie to you, sneaking across borders doesn&#x27;t generate passport stamps, and reliable records are hard to come by.<p>This latest news feels like an interesting addendum to all that; I&#x27;d have expected any other podcast publisher to do an additional episode or two covering the new evidence and grappling with what that changes about the conclusions one can draw (certainly Serial has done a number of updates on new evidence about its past stories).<p>That said, my sense is that the NYT is taking this extreme action in part because they in retrospect are unhappy with the fact-checking process for the podcast, and I could see that sort of concern motivating this type of retraction&#x2F;disowning despite all the uncertainty the podcast itself presented.')
