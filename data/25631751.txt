At $FewCosAgo, I inherited a codebase which used passwordless login via SMS. SMS has a ton of intrinsic security flaws because of SS7 so there are obviously risks with this method. But with that said, it worked very well for the exact same reasons email doesn&#x27;t here: SMS delivers nearly synchronously, and it was rare to end up in a situation where the login text didn&#x27;t send to a user. After going through the flow a couple of times myself, I was shocked at how much more I felt inclined to test my own software just because logging in was so much lower friction.<p>Regrettably, the issues with passwordless email&#x2F;SMS login mean that for now, if there&#x27;s no OAuth provider you can&#x2F;want to use, the ol&#x27; password is probably still the best way to go.')
