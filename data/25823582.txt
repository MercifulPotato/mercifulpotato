Excessive pay for doctors is definitely part of the problem here. People don&#x27;t like to hear it and don&#x27;t like to admit it because the work they do is so important and because there are other, bigger costs, and I get that. But difficult situations have difficult answers, and doctor pay is huge in the US in a way it isn&#x27;t in every other country and doctors themselves know this. It may not fix the problem overnight, but regular people would see instant savings if we fixed this issue.')
