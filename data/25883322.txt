One of the questions they asked is where do you see Java in 25 years?  At that point in time, with a six month release cycle, the answer was Java 64. :)<p>I got on the Java roller coaster in the Java 1.1 days... so some 23 years since I wrote my first Applet that tied to the mainframe via RMI&#x2F;CORBA. Java has really evolved.  Seems there is a wide range of Java developers - those fluent with streams, lambdas and other features introduced in Java 8 - and those who don&#x27;t even seem to know what Java 7 try with resources are.  I suspect C++ and other languages that have been around for multiple decades see the same thing.  Not sure if it is the starting education or just dated material.')
