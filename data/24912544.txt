A coding challenge that I took the full hour on and bombed out of college was now done in twenty. I just picked up the problem solving intuition by writing a ton of code.<p>Were you perchance interviewing others while at FAANG or doing anything related to interviewing (speaking with coworkers about it, etc.)? I&#x27;ve seen plenty of people come out of FAANG worse at interviewing than they went in.<p>The problems I&#x27;ve heard most of my peers solve at FAANG are not really that relevant to interviewing. At least, none of them are like, &quot;Yeah, man, totally kick ass at leetcode now that I&#x27;ve been at Facebook for a year!&quot;')
