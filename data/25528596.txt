Some time later I registered the account and started visiting the site daily. Over the years I have to admit that it was a great source of information but it also took a lot of time to invest in reading the articles.<p>In this period and for some time I have been visiting the site twice a day. In the morning and in the evening.\nEach time I go from page 1 to page 4 (and read more deeply 5 or 6 published &quot;articles&quot;). I open ALL THE LINKS. So I open 120 links in the morning and fast scan all of these.\nIn the evening I open only new links (I think on average about 30 links).<p>HN level of reading depth: 4 pages\nLink opening (morning + evening): 120 + 30<p>I&#x27;m curious about your behavior.')
