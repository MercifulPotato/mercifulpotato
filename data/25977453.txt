Also, it&#x27;s summer down there, with heat waves, etc. All of this diminishes virus&#x27; ability to spread. It&#x27;s very situational. Australia is not doing anything more special than other countries. You gotta look into the meaning of these numbers and just the value.<p>Lockdowns do work, technically speaking, but not in the long-run. Virus doesn&#x27;t care and will operate as usual, albeit at slower rate. Persistent things those viruses are.<p>Lockdowns make sense only at the beginning of a pandemic and their only sane purpose is to give the health care segment to prepare itself for the hit. Beyond that it&#x27;s a lost cause. You&#x27;re not saving thousands of lives, you&#x27;re just extending the inevitable further down in the future, while your economy is sinking, which will create even more problems down the road.<p>So even if you stay inside the cave forever, the bear will still come.')
