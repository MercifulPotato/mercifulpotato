Much easier to have the Apple devices backing up to iCloud.<p>I did look at their Plus&#x2F;Professional&#x2F;Team offerings <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;plans" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;plans</a> and they do look useful for a lot of business cases.<p>By the way, they cut the number of devices that could access an account from unlimited to 3 on the free account.  Fair enough but I was somebody who earned extra gigabytes in 250MB chunks for every person I referred to them.')
