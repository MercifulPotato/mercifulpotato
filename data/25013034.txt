It emphasizes explicit control flow, preferring code duplication that is easy to read, over minimizing duplication by creating complex abstractions or implicit runtime behavior.<p>There are a lot of cases where these tradeoffs suck and add a bunch of unnecessary friction.  And there are many cases where it boosts overall productivity significantly.')
