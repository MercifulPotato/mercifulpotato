I care about that a lot more than Georgie. Discounting me as &quot;these people&quot; is distinctly how we get to corruption.<p>&quot;These people&quot; also couldn&#x27;t allege fraud in Georgia if we had fraud-proof systems. It&#x27;s not rocket science. I wish we could point them to proof. We can&#x27;t. We can point &quot;these people&quot; to pretty good evidence, but we wouldn&#x27;t have this particular problem if we could point to hard proof.<p>We&#x27;d probably have a different problem, but it is what it is.')
