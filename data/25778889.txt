Therefore it is false to say they do not. Please don&#x27;t spread &quot;known false&quot; information. Pretty simple. What follows my caveat is supported by evidence and testimony. If the testimony was false, then my intel may not be reliable. I don&#x27;t believe that to be true but I&#x27;m not infallible. What follows my intel is my opinion. My opinion is based on more than what happened to Parler. I&#x27;m sure I could have made that clearer. Maybe I should have put line breaks in to help people who have trouble parsing arguments in prose.')
