Like &quot;come on, come on!&quot; - that kind of gesture.<p>I have to stress though that I agree with &quot;danaris&quot; one level up from from this comment - it seems perfectly believable that individual police sympathised and aided these people. However it&#x27;s not &quot;The Police&quot; as an entity as some others are suggesting, that&#x27;s venturing into Q territory and is a bit Conspiracy Theory for me.')
