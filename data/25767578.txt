Hundreds of thousands died.<p>So you say every time there is a revolt and one government is replaced with another it means a fundamentally different way of governing people, different political system?<p>The reality is that nothing really changed and China and, again, I will invoke &quot;On Origins of Political Order&quot; because it is very well explained there.<p>Just because a monarchy has been replaced with Mao (de facto monarch) and then with single party doesn&#x27;t mean people gained any rights.<p>While people in western world were slowly getting more rights (shifting from a absolute monarch to rule of law to concept of human rights) nothing of that sort happened in China.<p>Think of communist party as a collection of princes that band together to govern a huge mass of people but not for the good of the people, but rather for the good of the party (collection of princes).<p>Where those goals coincide this results in goals for the good of the people but where they do not, this will result in killings, mass incarcerations, etc.')
