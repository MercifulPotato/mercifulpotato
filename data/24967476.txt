This did cut the price down dramatically. I would not recommend it for super critical apps (except if you have your own state of the art data center, but I am not speaking about that), but having 5-10 servers in a secure cabinet will give you infinite flexibility for little cost. We pay around 5000$&#x2F;y to keep running about 50k$ worth of hardware. It&#x27;s 10-20 times less that what we would pay on AWS. Of course this approach has limits, but it can work in some scenarios and should not be &quot;de facto&quot; dismissed.')
