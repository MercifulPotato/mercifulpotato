If not, make sure they don&#x27;t try to. If yes, MobX is accomplishing that in the most efficient way possible so you may need to rethink your UI.<p>&gt; I moved the code that looks at that state up the tree and then pass it down to solve<p>This doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me as a fix, and to be honest I suspect it&#x27;s merely covering up the problem in a roundabout way.')
