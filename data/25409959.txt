The dollar is really quite different than gold or silver.<p>This is because even after the &quot;american empire&quot; falls, there would still absolutely be people with the ability to replicate dollars very easily, and who would also be willing to do so.<p>That entity would be whoever owns those US dollar printing presses that are printing the dollars right now.<p>If the US is in a state of collapse, but people are apparently still accepting US dollars in payment, then there would be a strong incentive for who ever controls those already existing printing presses, to produce more green pieces of paper, and exchange them for goods and services.<p>The same is not true for good and silver.')
