Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[24965969], score=None, time=1604306446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965479, text='&gt; What you wrote about the virtues of newtype was explained quite well in the post itself<p>The post implied that the newtype-based approach was somehow &quot;not type safety&quot; and offered significantly less safety in practice than the constructive model approach. The first of those is definitely false, and based on my own experiences I don&#x27;t believe the second.<p>&gt; Further, it&#x27;s important to understand what the critical additional steps are in such approaches to achieving that safety and avoid cargo-culting &quot;newtypes make things type-safe&quot;, and to understand the ways this safety can be violated.<p>Naively it sounds like that would be important, but I&#x27;m not convinced it actually is in practice. My experience is that even a cargo-culty use of newtypes delivers most (maybe even all) of the defect rate benefit, and that these vigorous warnings about newtypes are more likely to reduce real-world safety (because people faced with cases that they can&#x27;t produce a constructive model for will be encouraged to use an alias, or no type at all, rather than a newtype) than improve it.')
