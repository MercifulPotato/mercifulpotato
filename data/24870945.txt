Without having any idea where it is I can still find it even faster than that.<p>Start Button &gt; &quot;bluetooth&quot; &gt; Enter<p>And with search autocomplete I only needed to get as far as &quot;bl&quot; before it suggests the right thing. And my desktop doesn&#x27;t have wifi, but I only need to get as far as typing &quot;wi&quot; for the start menu to suggest the wireless settings anyway. The Control Panel always sucked, and the settings menu sucks on iOS or Android too. Typing in the start menu to search has been around since roughly Vista.<p>And their apps aren&#x27;t great, but I haven&#x27;t experienced anything like the problems you describe. They&#x27;re barebones but fine.')
