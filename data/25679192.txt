Still great for light tasks and actually not too bad for heavier ones. It has very few moving&#x2F;active parts - just a CPU fan and battery - so it doesn&#x27;t require that much maintenance to keep chugging. Problem is, my official macOS security updates end end of next year. 10 years of support is alright I guess, but what do I do, throw it out and add it to the ewaste pile? I think not. I can give it a second life as a desktop or server (great idle power consumption) with Linux or any of the BSDs.<p>If I buy a 2022 Macbook Air, I&#x27;d like to repeat this process for it in 2032. Moore&#x27;s law is dead, treasure your hardware.')
