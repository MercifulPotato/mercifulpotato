Immigration _per se_ isn&#x27;t bad. I say so as an immigrant myself. Trump is <i>married</i> to an immigrant. But unrestricted low-skill illegal migration in tens of millions is most definitely bad, and it leads to modern day slavery, while at the same time depressing the wages of the working poor and making them dependent on welfare. That&#x27;s why Kochs want it so much. So bad, in fact, that Barack Obama deported a lot more illegal migrants than Trump ever did. So long standing that Bill Clinton highlighted the issue in his 1995 State of the Union: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1IrDrBs13oA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1IrDrBs13oA</a>. So severe that Hillary Clinton voted for a border wall: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2018&#x2F;jun&#x2F;27&#x2F;cal-thomas&#x2F;did-hillary-clinton-support-border-wall-mexico&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2018&#x2F;jun&#x2F;27&#x2F;cal-thomas...</a>. Immigration from countries where one can&#x27;t even meaningfully do a background check is also bad. Skilled immigration program abused to get H1B wage slaves to the detriment of US grads who are drowning in debt is very bad indeed.<p>&gt; disputing and attempting to overturn democracy<p>Nobody is &quot;attempting to overturn democracy&quot;. There are hundreds of sworn affidavits and abundant video evidence of election irregularities. This needs to be followed up on, for the same reason why Nancy Pelosi was calling for the same in 2017: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SpeakerPelosi&#x2F;status&#x2F;864522009048494080" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SpeakerPelosi&#x2F;status&#x2F;864522009048494080</a>. She spent _4 years_ undermining the choice of the American people, and by extension &quot;democracy&quot;. Presenting evidence in the court of law <i>is</i> democracy. If evidence is shit (as it was in Pelosi&#x27;s case), the court will throw it out. If it&#x27;s not <i>you</i> should be just as interested in hearing about it, because such things tend to backfire, just like Harry Reid&#x27;s filibuster fiasco did.<p>Here&#x27;s an explanation of what happened to you that will alleviate your cognitive dissonance somewhat: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;astateofEmily&#x2F;status&#x2F;1327079491760361472" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;astateofEmily&#x2F;status&#x2F;1327079491760361472</a>')
