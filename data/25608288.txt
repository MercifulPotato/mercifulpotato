Has anyone tried to write a 7.5 KB living thing or DNA-based tool from scratch?  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily even need to reproduce to be revolutionary, tiny genetically engineered transistors or structural fibers or chemical reactors might all be super useful and have super simple DNA programs that only have a few dozen lines of code.  What makes this so hard?')
