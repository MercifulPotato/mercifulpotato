Tether.<p>The point of Tether initially is regulatory arbitrage for Tether based exchanges.  It gives them a fiat substitute without having regulatory baggage that trading in actual money would require.<p>Tether then turned into a lifeline for a Bitfinex bailout and now acts as a (almost assuredly illicit) liquidity provider to Tether based markets.<p>The only reason Tether is worth a dollar at this point is because the Tether denominated Exchanges say it is worth a dollar.  They are really what backstop Tether now and are fully complicit.')
