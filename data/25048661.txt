Not important, just that a vegan or vegetarian is simply someone who did a cost-benefit analysis where, to them, the costs of meat (environmental degradation, massive suffering, personal guilt, my-god-said-so, whatever) outweigh the benefits (taste, convenience, social acceptably). That&#x27;s merely it!<p>It&#x27;s not cognitive dissonance to want to enjoy some of the benefits of something without some of the costs - that&#x27;s what vegan &quot;meat&quot; (at least attempts) to do.')
