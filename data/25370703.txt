They are restricting one form of outdoor activity while allowing others. There is one group (restaurants) that is inordinately harmed by this restriction.<p>For instance, I walked by the Presidio parade grounds in SF this past Sunday. Plenty of people were picnicking on the grass there. They were eating and drinking without masks while social distancing. It’s basically a restaurant level risk without the restaurant.<p>That activity is allowed but outdoor dining isn’t.<p>Another example. I went to downtown Burlingame the week before to get my phone fixed. There was a lot of outdoor dining but more interestingly there were many people walking or standing around with masks down while sipping drinks. Those sidewalks don’t permit 6 ft social distancing.<p>That is still not restricted but outdoor dining a few feet away would be.<p>These restrictions don’t make much sense. The problem is that the behavior that is causing most of the spread is something that they cannot effectively ban without massive policing.')
