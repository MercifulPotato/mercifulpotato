I&#x27;m not advocating you do this but I think my background made me tough. So I haven&#x27;t been afraid to confront the geek bullies down through the years. They tend not to have the strength of character to handle a direct confrontation i.e. a verbal challenge with silent pauses and direct eye contact. They will give you some verbal but they will probably back off. A more difficult situation is when your boss tells you to fuck off. I&#x27;ve been there. That one you suck up and quietly make your exit strategy.<p>Push back a bit with your colleague. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they are on medication or dealing with their own demons.<p>Try not to cry. I have seen it in the workplace and it tends not to play out well for the person who cries.<p>Finally, life is generally not either or...push back and look for a new job...see where it takes you.<p>(just to reiterate, I don&#x27;t condone violence. My Irish upbringing was my brother getting beat up, I beat up who beat him up and my Dad waiting in the background in his vest if it escalated...my Dad was ahead of his day, pre Bruce Willis :-) I think however we have gotten so politically correct these days a lot of nonsense goes unchecked...a fight always starts with a face off, we probably still need that bit)')
