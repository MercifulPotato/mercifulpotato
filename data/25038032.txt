Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=[25040050, 25040957], score=None, time=1604947152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037289, text='&gt; Many people have an aversion to something if it&#x27;s called plant, healthy or natural.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is the issue.<p>Nobody would eat something called &quot;McMeat&quot;, it begs the question &quot;What kind of meat?&quot; and usually the assumption is the worst. When I hear &quot;McPlant&quot;, what comes up in my head is eating a tree or grass. If you leave it to people&#x27;s imagination, often what comes to mind is the worst not the best.<p>This is the genius of &quot;Impossible Burger&quot;. They manage to suggest it&#x27;s great and sidestep the inevitable question of what is in it. They are literally suggesting the opposite, that they found the holy grail of food, great tasting and healthy.<p>Though I have the same feelings when I read &quot;McRib&quot; as well and it&#x27;s making another comeback so maybe I&#x27;m off base here.')
