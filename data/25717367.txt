The left wing kooks are not in charge. They are fringes. They speak loudly, in part because the media loves the argument, but their goals don&#x27;t become platform and their leaders don&#x27;t hold high level office. Bernie Sanders lost twice, and both times supporters loudly shouted that the centrist candidate chosen instead was no different from the far right opponent.<p>That does not condone any of the kookiness, but the difference is too stark to draw the simplistic comparison. The right wing kooks put one of their own in the very highest office, and he enjoyed vast support until it literally turned violent. Even now it&#x27;s not clear to me that the support has wavered, but is merely temporarily embarrassed.<p>To solve QAnon in your party you need to stop encouraging them. They are not an untidy extreme who happened to have had a big day. They are part and parcel of the party at every level. They have become tired of getting only dog whistles, and are now saying the quiet parts out loud. But they&#x27;ve been saying the quiet parts for decades and I don&#x27;t believe you when you pretend that you didn&#x27;t hear it. You were told many times, but you won&#x27;t hear it from me because you&#x27;ve been telling them for many years that I am a liar and a traitor. Ceasing to do that is the first step, and you won&#x27;t fix anything else until then.')
