Now I take a more modern medication and it works wonders.<p>I don&#x27;t have ADHD, but I&#x27;m curious what the modern one is.<p>Back in middle school, around 2001, I did a report on ADD and ADHD, and 3 of the medications that existed for it: Ritalin, Cylert, and I&#x27;m not certain of the third but from the other comments Adderall sounds like it could be it (though I think it started with a &quot;D&quot;, is there one that does?).  The only thing I remember from it is the conclusion that if I got diagnosed and needed medication, I&#x27;d refuse Ritalin, and that Cylert seemed like the best of the three.')
