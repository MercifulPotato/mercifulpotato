It seems they want to phase out all non Metal APIs.<p>(Which is to say, I bet the return of eGPUs on mac will only happen if apple releases a discrete Metal-based GPU)<p>It makes sense, so far as it means they can further integrate hardware solutions they make themselves and not deal with a higher level driver interfaces. Otherwise they&#x27;ll be limited to incorporating features present in all supported vendors.')
