Come on, man.<p>&gt; It’s a bit worrying that total lies about a conspiracy between Dominion and (very much dead) Hugo Chavez to rig an election for Joe Biden is what gets classified as “dissent” these days.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you can really even call this a &quot;classification.&quot;  It&#x27;s more of a false equivalency, either made in bad faith or through some sloppy bit of emotional reasoning.<p>I&#x27;m seeing <i>a lot</i> of this kind of thing now (another similar example is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25898393" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25898393</a>).
