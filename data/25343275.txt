Discussing technical feats of the Great Pyramid of Giza, and speculates about hidden knowledge encoded in the dimensions &#x2F; location of these structures. Goes even further suggesting it is a warning of recurrent catastrophe. But biggest impression made on me info ( around 1hour:15minutes mark) that plenty of the important ancient structures around the globe are located on circle roughly 100KM wide and Equator length and different geometrical relations between these points.')
