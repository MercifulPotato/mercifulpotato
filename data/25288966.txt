Every feature has a cost: to complexity (CTLs are notoriously ‘weird’ on Windows, for example), to security (LDAP is a terrible protocol due to BER), or simply in the maintenance costs that prevent security improvements. Software engineering is about weighing those trade-offs: do you implement the feature that 10-100 users use, or do you spend time improving things for the other billion users? There are limits to what can be supported, and limits to what is even good to support in the first place, and while such pragmatism may seem like arrogance, the reality is less malicious: it just isn’t good software.<p>In any event, making sure usage statistics are enabled, and bugs are filed when actually, is a good way to help prioritize.')
