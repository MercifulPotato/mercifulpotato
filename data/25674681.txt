It&#x27;s up to you collectively to decide if it is BS or not, too heavy, too light, etc.   I&#x27;m not suggesting everyone has the influence to change process much at the place they work, but they idea that there is a single &quot;thing&quot; called process and some places have it and some don&#x27;t is just dangerously misleading.<p>It is true that process tends to naturally scale with org size and longevity because communication becomes more complicated with this scaling - but that only gives you a bit of a lower bound (i.e. if you go below this, you start shooting yourselves in the feet)')
