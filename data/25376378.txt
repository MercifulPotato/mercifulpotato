If 10x the engineers gives you 10% more revenue then that&#x27;s worth it economically if the pie is large enough. 10% of 4 billion a year can pay for a lot of engineers. Once you&#x27;re no longer growing then you need to focus on efficiency as more engineers rarely translates to more total revenue in that case.')
