There are too many problems w&#x2F;Google HW.<p>The supply chain sucks if something breaks (which happens much more often than my iDevices).  My pixel 1 mic stopped working, and it was impossible to find parts to fix it (including for 3rd part repair stores).<p>My wife&#x27;s Pixel 3 won&#x27;t reliably charge wirelessly.  You have to reboot the phone 1x per week inorder to get wireless charging to work.  So you put it down... And wake up to a dead phone.<p>My pixel 4 had a terrible Chrome problem until very recently.  Chrome would basically lock up the system.  The gesture navigation also kind os sucks.<p>Also, the pixel 4 glass really sucks.  I had scratches all over it with the first month... Vs my Moto G7 which has none.<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on the new Android TV chrome cast or the 2 WearOS watches or my chromebox that can&#x27;t have more than 2 BT devices connected (or it stops working).')
