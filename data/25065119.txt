In Texas I pay spot rate updating every 5 minutes. There is a 3c&#x2F;kwh fee regardless of price. Most of the time it&#x27;s 2-3c&#x2F;kwh however it occasionally goes to $1-9&#x2F;kwh.  At night it&#x27;s usually .01c to sometimes well into the negatives where I get paid to use electricity. As you can imagine I charge my electric car at night and in average it only costs me about $2-3 per 1000 miles of range.')
