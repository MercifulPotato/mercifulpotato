Item(by='petejohnson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611365248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865455, text='&gt; Elastic built a popular product off the work of countless open source contributors. That&#x27;s how they became a market leader in this product space.<p>That&#x27;s simply not true. Elasticsearch and Kibana are primarily built by developers on the Elastic payroll.\nYou can verify this by looking at the &quot;Contributors&quot; tab on Github for both projects. I honestly couldn&#x27;t find a single person there who wasn&#x27;t employed by Elastic at the time of their contributions.<p>&gt; The people who contributed to the product did so with no expectation of reward except that their efforts would remain open source<p>Again, did you do a survey of any of these people? Seeing they are Elastic employees I guess they asked for more than just OSS glory... Probably lunch and and a pay check.<p>&gt;  But yanking the Apache license out and moving to a more-restrictive license is not the right solution, and is not what everyone who contributed to building the product signed up for.<p>What would you suggest, at this point in time, that Elastic did instead? \nThey released the projects as OSS 10 years ago - there&#x27;s no changing that. Now they need to stop Amazon or they might not survive as a company. \nI&#x27;m honestly interested to hear your suggestion.')
