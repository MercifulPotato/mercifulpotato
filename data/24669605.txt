Do those necessarily put food on the table? No, but many people happily write, perform, paint, etc. knowing that it won&#x27;t pay the bills. The idea that everyone is in it for the money is a blanket statement that I&#x27;m not sure is even true for most creatives.<p>You can make a separate claim about whether artists <i>should</i> be able to financially support so that they can make art full time, but that&#x27;s quite a different claim.')
