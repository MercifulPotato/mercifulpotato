In theory tickets are non-transferable, but it is not enforced at all. A passenger train carries more than 500 people and if someone gets caught they just bribe out of the problem. Since the ground level problems are hard to solve, a solution at the top gave IRCTC some power to control and lower the available black market tickets. When the problem with identity and transferable tickets is solved then I think technical problems will be resolved.<p>Keep in mind Identity is hard to check and for rural passengers. There were very few such documents before AADHAAR etc.')
