Redis is a bit younger but my understanding has not changed for users drastically. Postgres has more features but the day to day is pretty similar.<p>I don&#x27;t feel the same so true for JavaScript. Node was brand new, package management was brand new, ES6 wasn&#x27;t even published yet, never mind usable. For the browser&#x2F;DOM you likely used jquery because you couldn&#x27;t use it directly, APIs like querySelector weren&#x27;t available in a time when Chrome was less popular than IE6. You probably wrote &quot;var that = this&quot; a lot as most people didn&#x27;t understand bind&#x2F;apply. Modules were done by using a global object and sticking functions on that.<p>So I don&#x27;t think JavaScript has yet earned being called boring on the same level as the others, even if the &quot;days since last framework&quot; days are over with React the winner and Vue&#x2F;Angular the other survivors.')
