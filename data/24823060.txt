Could you clarify?<p>Do you mean to say that collaborative document editing is perceived to be more efficient but that it is in fact not more efficient?<p>Assuming that is what you meant, that may be true, but for me when working on a document with others there is more to it aside from saving time on writing together. Specifically, being able to see the document as a whole means that I can write sections of text that are more coherent with the rest of the document, and also that I can suggest changes in other people’s sections while we are working on it.<p>Collaborative editing is also useful when discussing a document on teleconferencing or when we are in the same room. For example if we are talking about a budget and we all have the Google sheet open I can point to a cell or group of cells, say something about it and make a change immediately in accordance with what we conclude, and they can make concurrent edits elsewhere in the sheet for other parts of the sheet that are affected by our discussion.')
