Today, Bob&#x27;s Discount Furniture has opened stores up and down the Eastern seaboard and even on the west coast, He&#x27;s retired from starring as himself in his own commercials, being replaced with a puppet likeness and becoming a sort of founder-turned-mascot like Col. Sanders. But the chain&#x27;s enormous success wouldn&#x27;t have happened without those initial, cheaply made, cheesy ads.')
