Minor run ins with the police, car accidents, making shady deals or getting into debt to random lowlifes she just met. I always used to say that I wished she would just stay in her room and sit on the bed. Save both of us so much trouble!<p>This was in the days before social media, otherwise I&#x27;m sure she would have done plenty of damage from her room.')
