I have enough experience with business needs to know that the purity&#x2F;safety&#x2F;whatever other benefits of haskell just aren&#x27;t worth the lack of ecosystem, difficulty in finding developers, and hit to developer speed. Haskell is too far on the spectrum (on various axes) to be the right choice most of the time, and not enough companies have shared how they&#x27;ve outperformed with it to even start the conversation. Haskell is like the mercedes of programming languages -- airbags show up there first, but regular cars get them eventually.')
