No coding, psueudo-code, nothing.<p>Usually, it turns out they have been really doing light IT work for years - using reporting tools, maintaining little scripts, even just some Excel jockeying.  But they still think of themselves as software engineers.<p>My gut feeling is that lots of these candidates <i>could</i> learn (relearn?) to code, but have spent years not coding.<p>I don&#x27;t have the numbers in front of me, but I would guess that the majority of these types of candidates (10-20 years of experience) that apply to our roles can&#x27;t code in an interview situation and haven&#x27;t been programming recently.<p>It is definitely not all of the experienced candidates who fit that profile.  The few very experienced candidates we get who can code are often excellent but are looking for salaries well beyond our range.')
