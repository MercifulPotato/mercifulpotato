It&#x27;s highly contagious and getting worse with new variants.\n2) Given this, we have a choice: get the antibodies the easy way (take the vaccine), or get the antibodies the hard way (catch the virus).<p>For some people, the virus is no big deal. For me, it meant suffering for 2 weeks, and to others it is way worse, getting sent to the hospital, and some (a tiny percentage) not surviving it at all.<p>Given the risk of a new vaccine vs the risk of getting COVID and suffering, I would take the new vaccine 100 out of 100 times. I tell people that had I known how bad catching the virus was, I would have taken BOTH vaccines at the same time to avoid having to go through that. (Also, I&#x27;m under 40 and very healthy&#x2F;athletic.)<p>I&#x27;m also highly averse to &quot;optional vaccines&quot; in the first place, and only give my children the absolute required vaccines to keep society and themselves safe.<p>Just my perspective on this, but I come across so many people who do not see things the same. In the end, a lot of people are going to suffer with the virus due to applying their fears to the wrong thing.')
