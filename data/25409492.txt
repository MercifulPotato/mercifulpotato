True, Mach is architecturally different from the BSD kernel but user space started out as NetBSD and its still fundamentally a POSIX system.<p>I never worked for either company but have worked with NeXT and Apple engineering teams on projects and wouldnâ€™t say that I was working with people who took a non-Unix orientation, especially when compared, say, to Windows.<p>Would you not have considered AIX Unix?  Or Unicos?  People considered that Unix but it was more alien than the macos due to then constraints of the hardware.')
