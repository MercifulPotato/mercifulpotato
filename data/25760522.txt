I&#x27;ve seen it go wrong hundreds of times and has been subject to a bunch of different workarounds (e.g. pipx).<p>Debian should probably ship a separate global python environment for Debian packages that depend on python where it is managing the environment - one with a different name (e.g. debpy), a different folder and, preferably, without pip even being available so that it&#x27;s unlikely people will accidentally mess with it.<p>This could have isolated the python 2 mess they had for years also, de coupling the upgrade of the &quot;python&quot; package from the upgrade of all the various Debian things that depended on python 2.<p>really, it&#x27;s easier to make &quot;apt install python&quot; be the way to install python &quot;on the side&quot;.')
