Let that sear in your mind&quot;<p>You might have good arguments for your white-hot searing hatred of this company, but I will confess, it makes your position look much worse when you represent it with hotly charged emotional statements instead of reasoning.<p>For example: I find it trivial to understand why someone would call a Facebook service &quot;Critical Infrastructure&quot;, thinking about how we don&#x27;t control how families and communities choose to meet up.<p>Your childs little league sport uses facebook, your aunt and uncles have organized the family into a whatsapp channel, your President incites riots on Twitter... we don&#x27;t get to choose which networks are the critical ones, and sometimes, we make the binary choice of &quot;Be apart of society&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;.<p>Just my 2c, it doesn&#x27;t seem that hard to understand why he would call these things critical, when you actually take a few moments to think it through honestly.')
