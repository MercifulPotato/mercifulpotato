Item(by='morganvachon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611665056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25911267, text='&gt; <i>My parents had corrective eye surgery in the last decade (corrected their myopia), and they claim the eye surgery damaged their &quot;reading vision.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m -7.00 &#x2F; -7.25 and this happens to me if I wear contacts instead of glasses. With glasses I can comfortably read a book or screen from about 10 inches away and beyond. With contacts I have to hold it at arms&#x27; length before I can make out small text. This is one of the many reasons I&#x27;ve stuck with glasses over the years. Another advantage of glasses is that I can take them off and have a natural and detailed &quot;magnifying&quot; effect. This comes in handy when soldering small components (wearing non-correcting safety glasses) or examining a circuit board for tiny defects like cold solder joints or broken components.')
