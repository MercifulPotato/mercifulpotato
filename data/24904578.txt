Item(by='smcameron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603774504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24898694, text='I used to run a &quot;recreational computer programming&quot; meetup once a month, (back when I lived in a large city with a nice hackerspace attended by people who weren&#x27;t laser-focused on some sort of &quot;startup mania&quot;) which was quite rewarding.  I tried to steer away from the sort of &quot;computer science&quot; aspects and more towards the &quot;art project&quot; aspects, as this suited my own interests more, and I think the audience as well (a more computer-science-centric approach was tried before with poorer results, ymmv).  Once this COVID nightmare is past, or managed, I may try to start something like this again, for now, it seems impossible, or at best pointless, as the best part of it was meeting with people.')
