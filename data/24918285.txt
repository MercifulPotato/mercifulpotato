Not an insurmountable one and nobody prohibits you from running private stops or garages.\nYou can even negotiate the use of bus lanes or tram lines.<p>The other barrier is much higher capital investment. Both bus drivers, busses and stops are not cheap, while the margin on a ticket is thin. (Compared to taxi fleet.) But it can be done even encouraging competition - see South Korea for an example of where it worked.')
