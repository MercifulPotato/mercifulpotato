Covid is mostly lethal among older population. Those people take a lot of various drugs. And it looks like that particular population was avoided during trials. Various allergies are also widespread these days. If the vaccine is only for very healthy 30 years old who typically does not have any covid symptoms then what&#x27;s the point?<p>Another thing is lack of information how vaccine affects fertility. Probably it does not, but not testing it causes the spread of craziest conspiracy theories.<p>One more problem was really small trial group. It sounds like it was huge - 140K in case of Pfizer vaccine - however only less than 200 people were diagnosed covid, 95% of them were in placebo group, which proves that vaccine works, the question is how strong this proof is.')
