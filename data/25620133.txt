Startups generally don&#x27;t have the resources to do things properly. They don&#x27;t have the people, the cash, or the time. So they trade on their future value: get cash from investors on the promise of future returns. Pay below-market salaries but promise quick promotions and options packages. Take on tech debt to get to market now, and hope to pay it off later. And, when it works, this is a great strategy. Tech debt is good if you&#x27;re a startup. But only if you survive it.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve never seen a startup that was actually killed by tech debt, although it does sometimes cause good employees to quit, and of course it causes product delays. It&#x27;s like any form of debt: a dangerous but oftentimes necessary tool.')
