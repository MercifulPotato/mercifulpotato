There are regularly reports of people doing nothing but driving up and down a nice street downtown. Flooring it from red light to red light, dropping the clutch on every gear change. All. Day.<p>The completely unrelated question <i>I</i> would like to ask is &quot;Why is it allowed to show your middle finger to random people on the street, but as soon as they&#x27;re in a car, it&#x27;s a crime?&quot;')
