So don&#x27;t let it. :) I spent a lot of time finding my domain and eventually found one that makes people chuckle when they read it, it&#x27;s lightly funny and innocuous. I work in the tech industry, many (many) people have their own domains - it&#x27;s not as uncommon as you&#x27;d think depending on which circles of friends. It&#x27;s very common to see a domain based on their last (family) name and several family members share it, I see that a lot and have seen it for 2 decades.')
