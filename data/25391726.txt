It isn&#x27;t the tractor a large-scale wheat or corn farmer is going to use to work the fields. Those tractors generate hundreds of horsepower and cost $250k.<p>But there is plenty of market for a small utility tractor, and the people using those aren&#x27;t all hobby farmers. You don&#x27;t use your massive 500 hp John Deere 9630 to stack hay bales or cultivate your row crops or power your auger or post driver.<p>Even if you have a 500 hp monster you&#x27;ll still want a utility tractor. Right tool for the right job.')
