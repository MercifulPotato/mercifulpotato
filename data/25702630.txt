In practice performance is more complicated and mmap is this weird corner-case over engineered inconsistent optimization thing that often wastes or even &quot;leaks&quot; memory which can be used for actually important for performance caches, it&#x27;s also awful at error handling and so on. I had to literally patch LevelDB to disable mmap on amd64 once, which eliminated OOMs on those servers, allowed me  to run way more LevelDB instances and overall improved performance so significantly, that I had to write this comment.')
