Like many established industries, being a car mechanic doesn&#x27;t have too many ways up from there- you can get all the certs you want, but you&#x27;ll never be management- and compensation increases are based more on tenure than anything else.  If you can teach yourself and then get into a performance garage or something like that, go for it!  You&#x27;ll likely wind up better off buying a project car to learn on or going to a technical school in off time than going full-tilt into mechanicary- and you&#x27;ll have a chance to see if it&#x27;s right for you before you switch.  Also, if you like that stuff, and want to create things, consider mechanical engineering of some flavor.')
