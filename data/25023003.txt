This isn&#x27;t about voting or getting employees votes for the democrat party.  H-1B cannot vote for the left but that is better to party hardliners than someone who votes right and hires right wing.  This is 100% about making sure executives of tech companies remain leftists and members of the leftist pro-socialist party.  H-1B is only one way they work to achieve this.  Since 2015 they have created chief people&#x2F;diversity officer roles which are nothing more than party officials who are given power to filter hires based on perceived party loyalty but in the name of combating &quot;racism&quot; which is pretty much envelops all leftist reasoning these days.  They are hardcore leftists and trade blacklists between companies.<p>In the corporate world it is imperative to leftist managers and boards that they maintain political control of tech companies like google, twitter, amazon that both track every move and word of the populace as well as filter the content that people are allowed to see.')
