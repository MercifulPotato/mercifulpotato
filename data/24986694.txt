Item(by='throwaway34241', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604469649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979160, text='I liked the the idea of taxing profits via taxing revenue (with a VAT) and deducting domestic expenses that was proposed a while back.  I think it was called a border adjustment tax, and the idea was that the incidence of the tax was on the profits and it was apparently trade neutral because the currency values would adjust (which would cancel out foreign expenses being non-deductible).<p>It seemed like such a simple solution to the often complained about problem of multinationals shifting profits to tax havens, since itâ€™s much easier to determine where revenue is from, but I almost never see it discussed when corporate taxes come up.  I wonder if it will ever go anywhere.')
