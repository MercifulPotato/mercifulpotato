This is the site where I first learned about Bitcoin in 2011. At the time it was treated enthusiastically. People would &quot;Show HN&quot; projects they made that used BTC, people were intellectually curious about it. Then somewhere around 2014 it turned negative. I&#x27;m not sure what drove this change. IS it that engineers liked experimenting with it, and when those experiments didn&#x27;t bear fruit they moved on? Is it that the engineers were replaced with marketers and financial analysts in the cryptocurrency community?')
