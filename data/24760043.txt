Over a million people are in nursing homes, and more than another million work in them.<p>I am not sure why you think it&#x27;s more realistic to lock down three million people totally than have most people take moderate precautions. Remember, this is in a proposed scenario in which the average grocery shopper will have a high likelihood of being infected, without masks or any social distancing measures being taken.<p>The White House tried the &quot;frequent rapid testing&quot; strategy, and that didn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job of protecting the staff there. Again, this was in the current situation in which we have a relatively low prevalence of contagion, with social distancing measures and masks in the outside environment.')
