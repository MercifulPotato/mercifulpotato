This project is an attempt to make it better and easier to use.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to advertise competing frameworks. But Angular can learn from other frameworks, which do some things better... mainly the routing. It was important to me to illustrate what Angular does badly, as to show the need for this project.<p>What exactly are the false claims?? I said Angular is commonly joked about, which there&#x27;s plenty of evidence for; Youtube videos, twitter, stack overflow surveys.<p>This is an Angular ecosystem contribution and I hope some people find it useful.')
