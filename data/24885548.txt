I didn&#x27;t even need a calculator for most of my maths degree, never mind a programming language.<p>Learning and exploring maths will involve theorems, deriving stuff, solving textbook problems, that kind of thing. Not much of this will involve actual numbers or explicitly calculating anything. In any case, the calculation is very often the &quot;easy&quot; bit, without much to be gained knowledge-wise unless you know <i>why</i> you&#x27;re doing what you&#x27;re doing.<p>And then Julia is probably your best bet. I&#x27;ll also recommend R, just because nobody else has. It&#x27;s got all the advantages of Julia with the added benefits of being a much slower and quirkier language. It does do a good job of getting out of the way when you just want to do explore some math concept though.')
