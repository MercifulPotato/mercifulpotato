I live in the US, which has a fairly high rate of motor vehicle crashes. My view is that our streets are hardly safe enough for cars, and if a car can crash into a car, then it can crash into a bike. In addition to a higher rate of crashes, our cars are bigger, meaning that they can do more damage.<p>Long before we started adding bike lanes in my locale, cyclists and motorists tended to choose different routes through town. Motorists chose the main streets, which have higher speed limits but also more congestion. Cyclists usually preferred threading our way along residential streets and isolated bike paths. Bike lanes in areas where there are no ways to avoid the high traffic streets seems to simply accommodate how most cyclists prefer to ride anyway.<p>In practical terms, avoiding cars means that cars are not part of the safety equation. It&#x27;s also more pleasant. I&#x27;m an experienced urban cyclist, yet I still prefer riding in the absence of cars.<p>Drivers have always been taught to share the road with cyclists, and there are always a few who don&#x27;t believe it. I don&#x27;t think construction of bike lanes changes this very much. I have noticed that during the 20 years I&#x27;ve lived in this town, cycling has gotten more popular, there are more bike lanes, but also, drivers have become more aware and friendly towards cyclists on the regular roads.<p>There are cyclists on both sides of the debate about bike lanes. And surely, if roads can be designed badly, bike lanes can be too. I&#x27;ve seen pictures of some pretty ridiculous examples.')
