They would not invest in appropriate processes&#x2F;tools to run an agile development shop, but wanted to brag to investors and clients about all the usual buzzwords. Engineers spent forever shelling through machines to find logs in staging, production APM was half-implemented. Everything was a poorly-implemented open source project  with no contributions upstream. The teams other than my greenfield team were mostly self-taught, previous college interns.<p>I say all of that to say this. Allow your engineers to save you money. The bean-counters frequently in finance&#x2F;accounting working the balance sheet donâ€™t know the first thing about saving money where it actually matters. Everything that company did was mired in technical debt and took easily 3x the time it should have taken with proper tools, processes, and staffing. It frequently cost them productivity towards reasonable deadlines all the time.')
