I have lived in a dozen countries since, and every time I stream Jeopardy from wherever, mind latches to the comfort of a sparse apartment, shared with 2 other roommates, all equally enthused by figuring out what this large, lovely country was all about, through the questions from the show.<p>I, after a couple of attempts ended up being &quot;screened&quot; for the the show, and failed - Baseball and Civil War were the topics.  I still do bad in these topics.  Still much to learn, but thanks to Mr.Trebek, America offers a fleeting familiarity.<p>If anyone wants to witness the two sides of American popular culture, spend an hour between 7-8pm on ABC - For the first half you will see Jeopardy, and then a cheerful but vapid (by design) Wheel of Fortune.<p>I was telling my wife, two days ago, that CNN political host John King will be a good stand-in for Mr.Trebek and today I heard this news.<p>I will miss Mr.Trebek in a way that will last my lifetime.')
