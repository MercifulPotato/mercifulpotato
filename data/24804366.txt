I just don&#x27;t know if it makes sense to expect tech companies operate with any values besides making money. That&#x27;s why I say &quot;don&#x27;t ask or beg them to be courteous, <i>force</i> them to either be courteous or &#x27;<i>don&#x27;t use my code</i>&#x27;, which a license can do.&quot;<p>Frog &amp; scorpion don&#x27;cha know.<p>The other thing that annoys is the fact that the permissiveness of the license is precisely why AWS used it, probably part of why it&#x27;s popular, why he can tweet about it &amp; build his brand etc. The author has and continues to benefit from the permissiveness of the license. To enjoy the upside of permissive but complain that the downside isn&#x27;t fair comes off as a bit self-serving.')
