Even if WebKit was just Apple&#x27;s name for their internal fork of KHTML, I don&#x27;t see any reason they&#x27;d retire it.<p>Blink was originally spun-out of WebKit too.  Similarly, Google controls Blink, and the two have diverged significantly in the intervening years.  I suspect patches for any of them won&#x27;t apply cleanly to the other two.<p>Regardless of their origins; KHTML, WebKit, and Blink are now independent pieces of software.<p>It&#x27;s still unclear to me why anyone should expect Apple to retire WebKit for iOS.')
