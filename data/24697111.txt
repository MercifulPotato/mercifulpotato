Maybe more depending on their prompt size. So unless they have an enterprise deal with OpenAI, this service will end being very costly. Might be cheaper to have a human agent.<p>That said, it&#x27;s still early stage, the bot itself has a lot of kinks as mentioned in the comments. Hopefully things will settle down soon.')
