I think there&#x27;s also some kind of discoverability issue with org-mode features: I don&#x27;t really know which features should I look into to improve my setup further and have something really nice instead of a glorified markdown.<p>One day I&#x27;ll just read the manual from start to finish and try to start properly from there, one day.')
