Or at least any experiments that previously have demonstrated such biases have had biases them self. I at least wasn’t ready to accept a theory of outgroup prejudges being ”natural” without resounding evidence from good experiments.<p>A Marxist might argue that given the previously mentioned conditions (in particular worker alienation) would create an alienated “outgroup” which others (including the working classes) would learn to despise. However this is hardly something that some might call <i>a natural</i> condition. And marxism is far from being an accepted theory of human behavior.')
