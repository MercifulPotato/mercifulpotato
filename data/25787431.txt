What about the SSPL is considered discriminating against a field of endeavor?<p>The AGPL is OSI-approved, and as I understand it also has a requirement &quot;that if you provide the product as a service to others, you must also publicly release any modifications&quot;. (Possibly not &quot;as well as the source code of your management layers&quot;, but that addition doesn&#x27;t seem to post any additional problems related to &quot;restrictions of fields of endeavor&quot;, I could see a future AGPL adding it, it seems somewhat the spirit of the AGPL).<p>What are the parts of SSPL that differ from AGPL in a way that OSI woudln&#x27;t aprpove?<p>(The requirement about &#x27;fields of endeavor&#x27; can be debated and is one of the currently more debated ones in OSI, but i my memory it goes way back in time to the early days of open source, I think you can probably find Stallman arguing for it before OSI even existed, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s there for some kind of nefarious reasons inserted by OSI sponsors. But certainly one can disagree with it.)<p>(Here&#x27;s Stallman against fields of endeavor restrictions from 2013, definitely not pre-dating OSI, but I think this does go way back, and I don&#x27;t think anyone thinks Stallman&#x27;s opinions are bought by corporate sponsors, and Stallman is obviously quite influential in ideas about what open source is. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20130509151342&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;programs-must-not-limit-freedom-to-run.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20130509151342&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.o...</a>)')
