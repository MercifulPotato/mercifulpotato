There&#x27;s no fundamental right to have people trade with you.<p>It&#x27;s would of course be a different story if the broker&#x27;s unwillingness came from their participation in a price manipulation scheme. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really plausible here, although I suppose I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out given the crazy dumb things Robinhood has done in the past.')
