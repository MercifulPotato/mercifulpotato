Item(by='pmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606188999, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194858, text='One of the reasons that so many people are ok with javascript is that they&#x27;re ignorant of the risks they&#x27;re exposing themselves to by using it.<p>This includes even places like HN, where I&#x27;ve had people claim that JS was completely secure and refused to believe there were any JS vulnerabilities until they were shown proof.<p>So, yeah, my option is to stay silent and conform, and let everyone have a pleasant time at their steak dinner without mentioning that I&#x27;m vegetarian for ethical reasons and either eating their steak or going hungry.<p>Incidentally, both vegetarianism and environmentalism have become much more popular over the last few decades, while they used to be very fringe positions, far out of the mainstream.  They didn&#x27;t become popular by people staying silent about them.<p>You might say there&#x27;s a time and a place for everything, and the reveal of artwork that&#x27;s powered by a javascript website is not that time or place, but I say what better time or place is there?<p>This is the best opportunity for awareness to be raised.<p>That said, I didn&#x27;t intend to derail this thread in to an anti-javascript screed, but if people are going to start calling me entitled simply for asking for a direct link to a video so I don&#x27;t have to run their javascript, then I&#x27;m not just going to swallow their insults.  I&#x27;m going to respond.')
