While MS hasn&#x27;t always done a great job on all of the OS functionality surrounding the kernel (though it&#x27;s quite good now), the internals of the NT kernel are and always have always been excellent, and IMO, are considerably superior to Linux&#x27; kernel internals.<p>One reason for this, interestingly, is that NT had less of a past to deal with - it was a clean-sheet design by one of the most experienced OS kernel designers on the planet (David Cutler, from DEC) - Linux was still trying to be &quot;Unix-like&quot; and maintain (more or less) POSIX compatibility (though to be fair, POSIX didn&#x27;t show up until about the time Linux grew out of its hobbyist toy phase...)')
