I haven&#x27;t done the math (I&#x27;m probably not capable of actually doing the math) but my bet is that it is not possible to set up a tunneling barrier that does not also effect the spin component of the wave function.  My further bet is that it will turn out that the uncertainty introduced into the spin component by the tunneling barrier is just enough to produce a no-communications theorem for tunneling just as there is one for entanglement.  I&#x27;ll even place a third bet that there&#x27;s  a Ph.D. thesis (if not a Nobel prize) at the bottom of that rabbit hole.')
