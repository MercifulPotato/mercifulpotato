There are only 5 traders (Alice, Bob, Chuck, Dave, Eli) and 100 shares that are all owned by Alice.\nBob borrows all 100 shares from Alice and sells them to Chuck.\nDave borrows the 100 shares from Chuck and sells them to Eli.\nThus, Alice and Chuck are each owed 100 shares, Bob and Dave are in debt for 100 shares, and Eli owns the 100 shares.<p>Thus, Bob and Dave must now compete for the 100 shares owned by Eli, which then drives up the price.<p>I don&#x27;t know how the synthetic long shares mentioned fit into this.')
