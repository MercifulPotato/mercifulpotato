(HN is much more legible.)<p>The header image is unnecessarily huge.<p>There&#x27;s a login box, but you won&#x27;t spot it unless you&#x27;re paying attention. Why would you want to log in anyway?<p>Overall, the design looks knocked-together in a hurry with no real understanding of either good layout or UX.<p>The app itself has poor layout spacing and - ironically - the colour choices and combinations are unusual and not what you would expect from an experienced UI designer.<p>To be clear, this isn&#x27;t being picky for the sake of it. I would honestly be surprised if a majority of experienced UI professionals were enthusiastic about the current design of either the site or the app.')
