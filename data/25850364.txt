It&#x27;s seriously that good. But for the other aspects: mid-range, treble, detail, separation, sound-stage they are comparable to a $200 headphone e.g. from AKG. Something like a Hifiman Sundara or Sennheiser HD650S which you can pick up for 1&#x2F;2 the price are easily 2x as good.<p>So if you like fun, bass-heavy tracks you will love APM. Otherwise probably not so much.<p>But you don&#x27;t buy APM for sound quality alone it&#x27;s the convenience, integration, spatial audio etc.')
