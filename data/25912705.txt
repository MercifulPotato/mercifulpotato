For example, can they prove that some part of the source code did indeed come from that Venezuelan company? If so, what does this mean? Can discovery prove connections between current or former officers and the Venezuelan company? What does that mean? How much of their claims do they need to prove to show that the statements have some basis in fact?<p>Turns out one of the heads of Dominion was affiliated with Antifa (whatever that means, I don&#x27;t know.) Could they find that he accessed systems during the night of the election outside of his duties? I dunno.<p>I think it also turns out that a former Dominion officer went to work for Soros after the election. What does that mean? I dunno.<p>So I personally think there is a lot more interesting things to be found on the Dominion side.<p>If there was anything shady going on, they would have to be fucking morons to run it through the company. So chances are, they probably won&#x27;t find anything.')
