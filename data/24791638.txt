Such as, if a potential employee got a single very bad recommendation from one past employer, or one negative past online experience or reputation hit?<p>I don&#x27;t know, you may well be, but I suspect most companies are not.<p>Most reasonable people will take the size of a company into consideration when looking at reviews on GlassDoor (at least in the last, looks like it&#x27;s no longer worth looking at now). So a single bad review for a small company would not be a deal breaker for me. It&#x27;s the patterns I look for.<p>Hopefully, you&#x27;re doing the same when hiring.')
