His method, he explains, has been to “cheerfully commit the academic fallacy” of eliding Dostoevsky’s “autobiographical fiction with his fantastical life.”<p>Although I have not read Christofi&#x27;s book, I am willing to admit that this could be a potentially fruitful method of interpreting the writer and his work. But for those interested in authentic history, I would recommend Joseph Frank&#x27;s magnificent study &quot;Dostoevsky: A Writer in His Time&quot; (2010), a fascinating yet critical biography that examines Dostoevsky&#x27;s life, letters and philosophy.')
