Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607896434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405594, text='&gt; A lot of people always complain about how hard it is to figure out what Urbit is, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the obfuscation is part of the plan....<p>&gt; But as others have pointed out (including the author of the post), the idea is deeply terrible, and implements a sort of feudal network with kings, lords and peasants (galaxies, stars, planets), because Yarvin is a neo-reactionary who believes life was better when we had monarchies in charge of everything.<p>&gt; All of this speaks to a desire for things to be simple. Simple politics, simple computers.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s exactly true. If he really had a desire for things to be simple, then why the obfuscation?  IIRC, his writing about his ideas is also highly obfuscated: extremely verbose and prone to unnecessary redefinition.  The talk of simplification may be just a lure to hook some followers.<p>It all feels more like an attempt to bluff his way into some kind of elite status.  There&#x27;s at least two ways to be seen as brilliant: actually be brilliant or say impenetrable nonsense and hope people <i>assume</i> you&#x27;re brilliant (because sometimes brilliance is impenetrable to the layman).  I&#x27;m also sure some <i>actual</i> elites are tickled by the idea of feudalism and are willing to patronize him.')
