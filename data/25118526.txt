I am no expert, but my understanding is that when test subjects were given the vaccine, and then later &#x27;challenged&#x27; by the SARS virus, they developed a pathological response. In other words, taking the vaccine had a potential to make their response to SARS and potentially other coronaviruses worse.<p>The study I linked therefore recommended caution in giving the vaccine to humans.<p>Obviously this is something that vaccine researchers are aware of (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-020-00789-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41564-020-00789-5</a>), but I think it&#x27;s something that is perfectly rational to be concerned about given the time and money pressures available with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.')
