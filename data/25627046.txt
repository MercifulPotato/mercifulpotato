A $1k grant is great but to me it doesn’t seem like that would be the barrier to getting an idea going.  Maybe I’m speaking from a place of privilege and not considering other knock-on effects though so I’d love to know of any other successful examples of small grants like these.<p>In the meantime I’m going to think of some $1k sized ideas to see if I can come up with anything worth submitting!')
