It&#x27;s not like the Montreal Protocol that outlined the global effort to fix the ozone layer (which was crazy effective and it&#x27;s on track to heal up fully in the 2060s). It&#x27;s a giant load of blue hat bureaucratic round about bullshit ever written.<p>It&#x27;s a general &quot;you should stop beating your wife&quot; declaration. Everyone must sign this document agrees they should stop hitting their wives. You will sign it and then we are going to get around to telling you how to stop beating your wife at a later date. By the way, by signing this you automatically agree to whatever our future committee will determine, which will be formed by an ad hoc committee that we need a committee to help develop. You can&#x27;t argue with what that committee says, and yes it will be non-market solutions that you have to pay up for. Oh, and theres a 100 billion dollar fund that you are all going to contribute to. Yea, that&#x27;s the floor, it&#x27;ll probably be more than that. To solve the wife beating problem, we are going to fly women around to showcase them being beaten (metaphor for the constant fucking conferences that have all these twats burn more and more jet fuel to wag their finger at the public).<p>Co2 emissions is a huge problem. It&#x27;s terrible for both the environment and people&#x27;s health in general. There is zero escaping that fact. But signing a blank cheque agreement that hands your agency of action into someone else&#x27;s hands... I mean seriously, we complain about companies and governments doing the same thing to consumers. We is the UN given a pass? They&#x27;re no where near as effective as anyone imagines. Yes, better than nothing given the war numbers of pre-league of nations compared to post. There is still a ton of improvement that&#x27;s needed. Their laughable bureaucratic system would make a wonderful dark comedy multi-season show. Add to that, the US pays a huge chunk of their payroll, which that 100b fund will be a huge burden on us because &quot;of course the US is responsible for paying for most of it&quot;. Fuck off. At this point I want my tax money going into my community instead of heading out to pay for some elitist plane trip to have a TED talk somewhere to explain to me how I&#x27;m a bad person.')
