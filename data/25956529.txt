Either the mechanics are boring (a reskin of classics like Parcheesi or Uno) or it&#x27;s a jumble of stuff cribbed from other games with no cohesion (&quot;look here&#x27;s the deckbuilding part, and over here is worker placement, and look an area control mechanic on a modular board, yay!&quot;).<p>And there&#x27;s the whole business of how much of a luck factor you want, how much rubber banding there is to keep it competitive, how much your strategy has to adapt in response to what others are doing, etc etc. These are things that pro designers carefully iterate on in the context of hundreds of test plays, often with a community of other designers who are equipped with the necessary experience and context to think deeply about how a game works and will work across multiple playthroughs.')
