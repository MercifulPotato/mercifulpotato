Item(by='40four', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610392744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25702715, text='I think you&#x27;re right, both things are certainly true.<p>I might have gotten a little lost in my angry rant, but what I&#x27;m trying to say is many of these articles are not presenting the subject in a fair manner.<p>If the pesticides harm the beekeepers bees, they are certainly hurting wild bees too. Collateral damage from farms is real, but the percentage of wild honey bees that come in contact with these farms has to be a small percentage. The fact that these farms destroyed the bee&#x27;s (and every other animal&#x27;s) natural habitat in the first place is never mentioned. It&#x27;s as if they want these farms to continue to operate, but without any chemicals, which in reality is impossible.<p>It would be best if we got all our food from small, diverse, organic farms but that&#x27;s unfortunately not the system we have. I wish it was.<p>Also, not once ever have I seen the history of honey bees explained. Everyone wants to cry over the &#x27;wild&#x27; honey bees dying, meanwhile nobody mentions that they are not native to America. They were brought over by European settlers. So any &#x27;wild&#x27; populations we have in America were artificially introduced, but they want everyone to think that it&#x27;s natural and they have always been here. And they want you to think that all farms, no matter the size or type rely on &#x27;wild&#x27; honey bees to pollinate their fields.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate, but it&#x27;s just not how out system works in the United States. So I&#x27;m trying to say I&#x27;m frustrated explaining this over and over to people that have been mislead by certain groups who only care about pushing their own agenda. If we want have a real conversation about bees, then you can&#x27;t leave out the history of how they came here, and you can&#x27;t leave out the large role commercial beekeepers play in our agricultural system.')
