He constructed a stage persona in exactly the way you ascribe to Johnson; the only difference is that you personally decline to accept Johnson&#x27;s. Setting aside the question of whether people should have the right to choose how others refer to them in a professional vs a private context, there&#x27;s already a very simple, common, and well-known way to refuse to call him &quot;Boris&quot;, and it&#x27;s one which already carries the same connotations.<p>As a matter of simple courtesy, don&#x27;t force people to ask you what you mean (which is what you do when you refer to him as &quot;Alex&quot;, exactly as you would if you referred to Houdini as &quot;Erik&quot;); presumably you find it as infuriating as everyone else when people deliberately speak in such a way as to force you to ask them to clarify. It&#x27;s bad manners just as using needlessly pretentious and obscure vocabulary is.')
