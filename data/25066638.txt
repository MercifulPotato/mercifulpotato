Another idea I&#x27;ve been thinking about is to capture the phase by splitting ACF into multiple complementary parts at the spectral density step, i.e. when we draw the spectrogram, we use |r exp(i phi)|^2 of the FFT output and that |...|^2 drops the phi. However, we could split this |...|^2 into a sum of a few terms that would add up to the same spectral density, but would separately capture the phase. In the simplest case, |x + iy|^2 = x^2 + y^2, can be interpreted as two half-spectrograms: one for x^2 and another for y^2. If colored the same, we&#x27;d get the original spectrogram, but if colored differently, we&#x27;d know values of x^2 and y^2 and that&#x27;s enough to know the phase up to a quadrant.')
