Forgive me for being ignorant.<p>* Do packages need to be &#x27;ported&#x27; to Nix or its build &#x2F; install system? If so, how much effort will it take and on what factors the effort required to port may vary substantially? (eg: Programming Language).<p>* How is disk space usage? Is there any kind of deduplication?<p>* How are security updates to shared libraries handled?<p>* Transactional upgrades look great. But how is the user experience around Transactional upgrades of running GUI applications?<p>* Other performance characteristics - bandwidth (delta upgrades possible?), startup time (I hope this will be good)..')
