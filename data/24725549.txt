It would be &#x27;fun&#x27; to be able to type so fast that the computer would end up buffering the letters..words...sentences and I could watch what I had typed scroll out to the terminal.  This was the single biggest motivator in learning how to touch-type.<p>I do know that sometimes the connection was just so poor that it wasn&#x27;t because I was awesome, it was just a shitty connection.  But I never let that truth get in the way of my ego.  =)')
