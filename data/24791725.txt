Item(by='fsflyer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602785400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24788991, text='I also have 15C from my early University days and my 28S from graduate work, both still working.  I got the 15C used from a junior EEE student that was quitting the program.  I think it&#x27;s on the 3rd set of batteries in 35 years.  It got used several hours a day for the first three years.<p>The 28S burns through three N batteries every two years, even when it doesn&#x27;t get used much.  That may have contributed to the battery doors wearing out on the 28S.  Mine is still in great shape however, as spent most of it&#x27;s life on a desk rather than thrown in a backpack with heavy books that the 15C endured with aplomb in it&#x27;s case.<p>The 28S was at work and the 15C at home.  Now that I&#x27;m working from home and they both are on the same desk, I find I pull out the 15C unless it&#x27;s complex enough that I want the four line display on the 28S.  And if it&#x27;s slightly more complex than that, a spreadsheet is probably the better tool.')
