R can&#x27;t really handle large datasets and simply runs out of memory if you load everything. You get around this by splitting your data into a bunch of RData files but there&#x27;s quite a bit of overhead maintaining those, recreating them when you need more variables, etc.<p>With DuckDB you can just load it once into the database then use dplyr&#x2F;dbplyr to transparently access data with the queries pushing down to the DB afaik. And it runs anywhere and doesn&#x27;t need local admin (like most database servers).<p>(SQLLite can&#x27;t handle many columns without a custom build)')
