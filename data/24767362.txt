That&#x27;s my understanding of the many-worlds theory.</i><p>This is a case of a simple theory that indeed models the mystery well. However, it seems &quot;wasteful&quot; in that it would branch into gazillion trees of reality. In Occam&#x27;s Razor, does &quot;simplicity&quot; include quantity of &quot;stuff&quot; needed? Because sometimes the brute force algorithm&#x2F;model is the &quot;simplest&quot; if we ignore quantity of stuff and time, such as bubble-sort. Bubble-sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms known, but is inefficient from a time and resource standpoint.<p>If there are &quot;free&quot; dimensions to spare out there, then the &quot;wasteful&quot; multi-verse model may not really be wasteful. We humans are used to thinking in terms of economic trade-offs, and a model that uses up large quantities of space&#x2F;time rubs our instincts wrong.<p>If true, the theory means that in some universe somewhere I&#x27;m a billionaire who married a supermodel.')
