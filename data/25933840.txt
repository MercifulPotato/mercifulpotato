This story didn&#x27;t end yesterday, it&#x27;s entirely possible that the Tesla shorts were &quot;just premature&quot; the same way that the people who started shorting the housing market in 2005 were premature (and took a beating during those years).<p>And the praise for &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets seems a bit excessive considering that by his own admission, he only just learned about them a couple of days ago. I don&#x27;t know how much time he&#x27;s spent there but I&#x27;m not sure that his read on the place is especially accurate.')
