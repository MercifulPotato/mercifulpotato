The ‘distance from unbiased’ for each coin is 0.25. We double that for each coin to get 0.5, then we multiply them together to get 0.125. Finally, we add 0.5 to get 62.5%. The full equation would be (0.5 + (2x0.25)x(2x0.25)) = 62.5%.<p>I think the answer here would be 75%, no? 0.5 x 0.5 = .25 not .125, or am I missing something? Maybe the example was supposed to have 3 coins -- then the math would work.<p>Does that result somehow make sense in that each coin is halfway to being completely biased?<p>The strange thing in that formula is seen with 2 80% biased coins. You end up with a total bias of 86%. Which goes counter to the idea that mixing biased coins is always an improvement.')
