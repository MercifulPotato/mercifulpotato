The iPhone was always meant to be able to install and run native apps, just because that&#x27;s how all computers and phones worked back then. The concept of a web app was still pretty far away (Flash was the closest comparison). Even on day one most of the heavy lifting on iPhone was done by apps rather than the browser - email, messaging, music, YouTube, Maps etc.<p>The novel part was restricting the distribution of apps through their own store. If that hasn&#x27;t happened, the alternative would be people simply downloading and running iPhone apps from all over the internet, as is standard on most other platforms including macOS.')
