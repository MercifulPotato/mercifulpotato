Chinese is logographic. You can&#x27;t simultaneously claim that different dialects are seperate languages and also claim that they were secretly writing phonetically all this time. They wouldn&#x27;t be mutually intelligible even in writing. Hand-waiving away a logographic system as a &quot;syllabry with redundancy&quot; is exactly the type of dumb semantic game I would expect from HackerNews. I guess you think a car is just a bicycle with more wheels and an engine too.')
