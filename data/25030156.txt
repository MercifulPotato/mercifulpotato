If “finite” is low and delays between them short, scammers will make the effort to go through all warnings.<p>If delays between warnings are long, the scammer will wait until one is shown and then sell the fake, and the buyer will only be warned when it’s too late.<p>If it’s high, the difference with “forever” is small, and you’ll still be annoyed.<p>Having a separate screen that shows the warning on demand or showing the warning only after a new sim is inserted might be the best option, but I fear too few customers would know about it.')
