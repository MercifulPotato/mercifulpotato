Not only do the artists get an order of magnitude more revenue, sellers can offer merchandise and physical media (vinyl, CD, cassette) too.  These often include a digital copy.<p>Due to the closer connection between artists and fans I&#x27;ve received many signed&#x2F;personalised records for the collection over the years.  Artists can also gauge demand for future releases almost like crowdfunding.<p>To me Bandcamp has been the saviour of music in the streaming age.')
