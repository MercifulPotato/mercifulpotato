Item(by='RestlessMind', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611698571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913654, text='&gt; Because there are very few software&#x2F;IT companies in Canada (or Europe or almost anywhere else except China) with revenues like US software&#x2F;IT giants.<p>I replied elsewhere in the thread but this is simply not true based on what I have seen first hand at companies like Google. They have a presence in Canada &#x2F; UK, but pay at a much lower rate than SV for the same job&#x2F;level&#x2F;performance. So profitability or a lack of revenue seems just an excuse.')
