Then when they do I add them to a list and then unfollow them. Ideally that means my main feed is empty.<p>The problem with this approach is that a lot of smart people are political right now. I&#x27;m political and so I appreciate this and know where they are coming from. But it does make it hard to have a single-purpose reading experience. For example, my feed of basketball twitter accounts is great when there is a game on, but it actually not all that different from my list of political&#x2F;news accounts the rest of the time.<p>But overall, I think this is the approach to take.')
