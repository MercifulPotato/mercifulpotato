Item(by='quesera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603295545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848626, text='&quot;mm&quot; is a perversion of &quot;MM&quot;, which is derived from Roman numerals (M is 1000, and MM is M*M). This notation has a long history of use in business and accounting.<p>For consistency, the author&#x27;s use of &quot;bln&quot; should be &quot;BB&quot;, or at least &quot;B&quot;. These have no Roman antecedents, but they are common in accounting.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen &quot;MMM&quot; for billion. Missed opportunity! I&#x27;ll have to suggest that to our CFO for our next filing.')
