Even if you&#x27;re the sole maintainer of a critical project and you imagine the world wants your head, the world has to wait sometimes.<p>However, users may abandon projects where support tickets go untended, maybe even writing a post about it in the process[1], so try to respond when you can, unless you&#x27;ve abandoned the project.<p>As a representative for a FOSS project or even a bystander commenting on a PR, respond professionally and succinctly.<p>If you shouldn&#x27;t accept a PR, don&#x27;t.<p>If it&#x27;s a request that seems hostile to the project, and you have time, either leave it for a little while to cool off, try to serve it with professionalism without getting off-topic, or at worst close it.<p>If needed, add a &quot;code of conduct&quot;[2] so that you can &quot;encourage a pleasant and productive environment by responding to disruptive behavior in a fast, fair way&quot;[3]. Note that instituting one before it&#x27;s needed, while seeming proactive, may put off some users.<p>If you screw-up, apologize briefly, then fix it or move on.<p>[1]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;free-code-camp&#x2F;why-im-not-using-your-github-repository-2dff6c7ac7cf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;free-code-camp&#x2F;why-im-not-using-your-gith...</a><p>[2]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;building-a-strong-community&#x2F;adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;build...</a><p>[3]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;building-a-strong-community&#x2F;about-community-management-and-moderation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;build...</a>')
