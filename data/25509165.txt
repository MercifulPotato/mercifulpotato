But thinking about working day and night for the dreams of others, dedicating the vast majority of your time and energy to a faceless corporation who can dump you like a bored boyfriend, or doing menial, pedestrian jobs that pay little to nothing and would be unbearable for even the most flat-lined brained person living today, well, it gives a different vibe, doesn&#x27;t it?')
