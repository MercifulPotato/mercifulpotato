Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25830600], score=None, time=1611036162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829524, text='This is a legitimately good description of an <i>arguably plausible</i> (but still plausible!) scenario. But I must note that democracy is not <i>lost</i> in this scenario...unless you&#x27;d like to explain:<p>&gt; At this point in time there is no longer a democracy in the US.<p>If we were to attach a debugger and step through the code, what state (variables and their values) would represent a valid scenario of democracy <i>no longer existing</i> in the United States?  Or I suppose we could just look at the implementation of IsDemocracy(), assuming the designer of this shitty simulation is reasonably organized.<p>&gt; The only thing that saved us from this was Trump&#x27;s cowardice.<p>Well, that and other things that you haven&#x27;t considered.<p>I don&#x27;t say these things because I think these morons are righteous, or Trump is a good president, or because I think this event is insignificant, but the opposite: I think this scenario is extremely significant - so significant that I suggest we discuss it with the same rigorous precision that is usually reserved only for discussing topics like computer programming.  I think a decent argument could be made that the welfare of the country <i>inside of which we write computer code</i> should command at least as much respect during conversations (even if begrudged) as we enthusiastically heap upon coding arguments.<p>But of course, this is just my opinion.  And to be fair, if shit really does ever hit the fan, most everyone in this forum is well off enough to get the hell out of dodge to some other country that hasn&#x27;t gone down the drain, where we can start the process all over again.')
