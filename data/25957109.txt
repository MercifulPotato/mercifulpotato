If you&#x27;re going to put quotes on something like that, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to ask for a reference.<p>I&#x27;m just wondering, can you give examples of the research papers for these PhDs or degrees where you evaluated them and found them insufficiently rigorous. It sounds like this has happened a lot, so are there any resources on this I can read?<p>Hancock&#x27;s pop sci summary of other people&#x27;s work you linked to is entertaining, but are we really surprised that geologists 100 years ago had a limited understanding of the history of the earth? That controversy was 40 years before we even came up with plate tectonics. It&#x27;s hardly cutting edge stuff.')
