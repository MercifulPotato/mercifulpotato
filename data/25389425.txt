This is a flaw in capitalism that creates duopolies and hurts consumers. \nWe then get companies that are too big to fail, can afford creative accounting and plethora of other not so nice things, like lobbying government to change legislation in favour of them. \nWe also need a rule that once company goes over a certain threshold it should be split.\nI don&#x27;t think we have ever experienced something like this before that&#x27;s why there is no regulation and we can see from our experience that companies do not behave nice, so we need a law that forces them to behave.')
