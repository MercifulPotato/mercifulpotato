I&#x27;ve not been on there for years] you don&#x27;t have to write a reason for an up- or downvote. You just select from a series of icons representing; &quot;insightful&quot;, &quot;funny&quot;... etc.<p>A system like that wouldn&#x27;t add much overhead to voting on a submission, but would give an indication as to why the voting had gone that way.')
