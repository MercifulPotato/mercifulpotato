Most systems have the pipes installed in concrete (yes, there is lightweight concrete for floors with wood joists; I&#x27;ve considered it) so unless you are deliberately stupid you aren&#x27;t going to puncture the piping.  Water in the system also counts towards the systems overall thermal mass to, helping keep the heat consistent.<p>Since few people seem to experience radiant heat it&#x27;s pretty hard to state just how different it is and feels.  It&#x27;s amazingly comfortable.')
