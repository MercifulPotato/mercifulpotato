The problem we haven&#x27;t solved as a society is what do we do with all these smart people? They need money so they go get a high paying job in finance or tech or consulting and then all that scientific training was kind of left aside right? So what was the point of the PhD?<p>A job with meaning is hard to find, maybe we should encourage and support all these smart people to start a business&#x2F;research venture?
