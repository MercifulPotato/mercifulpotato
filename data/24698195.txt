Because if it correlated to something (so that we could verify that relationship), it&#x27;s no longer random.  Like if I made a random number generator, and it only ever outputs the number 4, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to validate whether the RNG is broken or if this is just the exceptionally unlikely chance that the number 4 is chosen repeatedly.')
