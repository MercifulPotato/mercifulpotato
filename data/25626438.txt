I get some good stuff there and here, and find fun stuff too. But I do notice booting up one or the other reflexively. That&#x27;s the part I don&#x27;t like. If I&#x27;m being intentional about it, it&#x27;s okay, but on autopilot I feel guilt.<p>What really did it for me was blocking them on coldturkey for a day. I&#x27;d very much recommend trying out blocking whatever your habit sites are for a day. It&#x27;s eye opening. I found myself doing &quot;cmd+t news&quot; or &quot;cmd+t redd&quot; idly simply out of habit. Likewise when I deleted the reddit app on my phone. When it&#x27;s not coming from the executive function part of my brain, or even worse, when it&#x27;s counter to my executive function decisions, it&#x27;s not productive.<p>Basically, if it&#x27;s a decision I look back on fondly, that&#x27;s the criteria for okay. Some of the time on these aggregators meets that criteria, but not enough of it :\\')
