Congratulations!<p>CIDER and Projectile are my daily drivers. I&#x27;ve been sponsoring Bozhidar on GitHub Sponsors for a few months now, and couldn&#x27;t have been happier about the bang for buck I&#x27;m getting. If you&#x27;re benefitting from these packages, or other ones by Bozhidar, please do the same!<p>In general, if you have some other free&#x2F;open-source packages that you rely on in your work, I urge you to contribute financially to their development. Software needs manpower to thrive, and manpower needs financial support to be sustainable.<p>(Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not affiliated with CIDER in any way, other than being a happy user.)')
