What are &quot;those empty Walgreens shelves&quot;, not having been there I don&#x27;t know what you mean. Further, SF was not unique in experiencing that. I experienced it in North Carolina and Utah. What do you mean &quot;squalor that is not that real?&quot;, what is the &quot;context from mid-atlantic cities&quot; and how is that relevant or informative to SF in particular? What is obvious when you leave? Where did you go and what did you experience?')
