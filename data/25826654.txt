Item(by='carbonguy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611004161, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823609, text='&gt; It&#x27;s a cliche but if we spent 10% of of what we spend on Nukes or drug enforcement on this it would be a game changer.<p>&gt; &gt; I think people that say things like this overestimate how much we spend on things like this and underestimate social spending.<p>These caught my attention because they both made claims for which the quantitative basis can somewhat easily be established, partly because the parent was making a relatively specific claim as these things go.<p>Here&#x27;s what I was able to find with ~20min of searching for federal spending in these three categories:<p>Foster care: $22 billion (2017) [1]<p>Drug control: $25 billion (2015) [2]<p>Nuclear arms: $35 billion (2019) [3]<p>I was surprised that these three areas received roughly equivalent amounts of money - support for your statement that people tend to underestimate social spending.<p>As to the parent comment: while it does seem likely that taking 10% of the budget from nuclear arms or drug enforcement would indeed make a qualitative difference to foster service provision, my hunch is that the 10-20% increase that implies wouldn&#x27;t be a &quot;game changer&quot; as the parent asserted even if the claims in [1] that the program needs to be entirely reconfigured are warranted.<p>EDIT: The parent comment also asserts that a better-funded foster care system would be &quot;cheaper than prison&quot; - another question which could probably be answered with some quantitative basis.  Anyone else want to take a shot at it?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Primetime&#x2F;FosterCare&#x2F;story?id=2017991&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Primetime&#x2F;FosterCare&#x2F;story?id=2017991...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drugpolicy.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;DPA_Fact_sheet_Drug_War_Budget_Feb2015.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drugpolicy.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;DPA_Fact_sheet_Dr...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;14&#x2F;us&#x2F;nuclear-weapons-spending-trnd&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;14&#x2F;us&#x2F;nuclear-weapons-spending-t...</a>')
