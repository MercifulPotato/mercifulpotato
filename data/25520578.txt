It&#x27;s also a skillset that is increasingly valuable if you want a promotion.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how so many of the responses here assume that the skills people should keep sharp are narrow technical skills. I&#x27;d expect a developer to keep their technical skills sharp as part of their day to day job. That&#x27;s not the most important reason to practice interviewing; the most important reason is to know how to sell those skills.<p>I know lots of techies dislike having to know to sell themselves, but the reality is that hiring managers can&#x27;t read minds, so selling your skillset is part of the job, but one you don&#x27;t use very often in many jobs.')
