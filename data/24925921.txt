I&#x27;m also a runner and listen to 15-20 hours of podcasts a week.<p>When I&#x27;m in &quot;the zone&quot; of a run and a podcast comes on that particularly resonates with me, I tear up (maybe 3-4 times in my 6+ years of running). I think that&#x27;s due to a combination of the power of the podcast episode and my heightened emotional state when I&#x27;m on a long run.<p>This Artifact had that effect on me while I was sitting on my couch.
