Item(by='jinmingjian', descendants=None, kids=[25058209], score=None, time=1605062864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25049253, text='There is already a general purpose working-in-progress OLAP project written in Rust.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tensorbase.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tensorbase.io&#x2F;</a><p>1. TensorBase is highly hackable. If you know the Rust and C, then you can control all of the world. This is obvious not for Apache Arrow and DataFusion (on the top of Arrow).<p>2. TensorBase uses the whole-stage JIT optimization which is (in complex cases possibly hugely) faster than that done in Gandiva. Expression based computing kernel is far from provoding the top performance for OLAP like bigdata system.<p>3. TensorBase keeps some kinds of OLTP in mind (although in the early stage its still in OLAP). There is no truely OLTP or OLAP viewpoints in users. Users just want all their queries being fastest.<p>4. TensorBase is now APL v2 based. Enjoy to hack it yourself!<p>ps: One recent writting about TensorBase (and those compared with some query engine and project in Rust works included) could be seen in this presentation:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tensorbase.io&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;rustfest2020.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tensorbase.io&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;rustfest2020.html</a><p>Disclaimer: I am the author of TensorBase.')
