Here&#x27;s the full sentence:<p>&gt; To be Roman, and citizenry became quite broadly spread, during those few centuries, was to be free and safe.<p>It&#x27;s pretty plain here that the parent is arguing that <i>Romans</i>, not their slaves, were free and safe. Anyway, the idea that Rome is worse than its contemporaries because of slavery or some other failure to adhere to 20th (or 21st) century mores is silly (though fashionable) without making a case that said contemporaries performed better by those same standards.')
