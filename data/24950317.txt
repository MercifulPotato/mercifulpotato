A huge part of his appeal is general stances against corruption. Also, though Bernie is more anti-capitalist than most Democrats, he is also very squishy on issues of racism and misogyny. There are a lot of voters out there who support left-wing economics and right-wing social policy, and Bernie has appeal for a lot of them. There’s a large contingent on the left who are anti-“identity politics.”<p>My dad is center-right, despises Republicans, and likes Bernie (votes for him in both primaries) but thinks Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib are too radical. In terms of economic policy this makes little sense, but that’s not what’s going on here.')
