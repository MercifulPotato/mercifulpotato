Utilitarianism is a term for a feature of a &quot;bedrock moral philosophy&quot; (that it&#x27;s rules involve maximizing some function of outcomes), distinguishing moral systems with that feature from ones which view right&#x2F;wrong as inherent features of <i>acts</i> (or, more rarely, of other things, like individual actors) independent of outcomes.')
