We can also take alcohol (in whatever amount) into the equation. I know, its called &quot;alcohol and drugs&quot;, but alcohol is simply a [regulated] drug. It doesn&#x27;t fit the narrative of &#x27;drugs are bad, mkay&#x27; though, but I believe that narrative is even on mainstream on the way out.<p>&gt; How did Lou Reed or Kurt Cobainâ€™s harder drug use affect their music?<p>As a kid I read the book &quot;Come As You Are&quot; about Kurt Cobain (who was kind of a music idol to me, long before I could understand English well enough to understand the texts). He had severe back troubles, supposedly stemming from his choice of going left-handed guitar player. He was both left and right-handed, supposedly (elsewhere, from what I understood, people who are both are actually left-handed but partly adapted to right-handed world).<p>As with Philip K. Dick, I can totally imagine a writer on amphetamines. I&#x27;m a former Ritalin (Methylphenidate) user (legal with subscription). Whenever that worked, I could finally focus. Uppers help you focus for a while.')
