The NVMe heats up on its own. There are a bunch of reviews going into that topic, because it just matters for high end NVMe drives. See for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerbase.de&#x2F;2020-09&#x2F;samsung-980-pro-ssd-test&#x2F;2&#x2F;#abschnitt_temperaturverlauf_und_drosselung" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerbase.de&#x2F;2020-09&#x2F;samsung-980-pro-ssd-test...</a> - though the 980 Evo did well without an additional cooler, and here it&#x27;s indeed depending on the airflow.<p>You seem to assume it&#x27;s the case that heats up to 80C or more, that&#x27;s not true and also not necessary for NVMe SSDs to go over their limit. Your CPU&#x2F;GPU has fans moving the heat away, that&#x27;s a better position to be in...')
