Item(by='megameter', descendants=None, kids=[24876182], score=None, time=1603501763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869421, text='I subscribe to the ideas of permeable and fractal boundaries. The former is one I attribute to Heather Marsh&#x27;s writing - the idea of being able to move across a boundary fluidly and express different selves at different times and places. The latter is an original variant, using a fractal as the specific metaphor of self, and where you define your boundary is always &quot;true until you look at the details&quot; - then you find the exceptions, and exceptions to those exceptions.<p>In this light, societal boundaries like public&#x2F;private tend to act as hard cuts to the fractal of self, pruning it into a perhaps  uncomfortable shape.<p>In both mine and Marsh&#x27;s framing, power structures represent a human  health issue in that they channel the self into an element of the system, depriving it of a natural development pattern.<p>But even so, this model allows a criticism of fringe conspiracy groups in that they represent an inflammatory response: an &quot;anti&quot; to the body politic. In this they differ from epistemic study groups, because the study goes nowhere, employing all the facts towards question-begging conclusions. Their collision with the &quot;mainstream&quot; acts to throw both into greater doubt. You want some of this inflammation, but as with inflammation in the human body, not continuously or at high levels.<p>All of that said, I do believe that on the whole, power structures are loosening these days, because the angles of attack on them are so varied, like a horde of descending insects. Control exercised in one place causes inflammation in another. The &quot;social media meltdown&quot; - the typical result of an actor who has lost their place in the power structure - has grown so common as to be unremarkable. Meanwhile, people who work in between the boundaries, finding those cracks through which they can slip, seem to thrive.')
