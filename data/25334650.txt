They went to Santa Cruz, Seattle, Denver, DC, and Austin. It&#x27;s a shame. The ones that stayed either are very rich where a $5M house is not an issue, or they still live with three roommates and rent without kids.<p>Just wait until they look for interesting jobs and get 100 linked in messages from CA and like 1 or 2 from DC. (note: I live in VA just outside DC, speaking from experience.)')
