There’s a reason drunk driving is illegal: you’re a danger to <i>others</i> on the road. Hence why being a drunk passenger is fine; you’re not a danger to the other drivers on the road.<p>So, <i>should</i> Apple be restricting what the user can do with their device? Depends on who you ask. But when it comes to distracted driving, it’s pretty well agreed that it’s wrong.<p>----<p>Now, if you <i>still</i> want to watch YouTube while driving, you actually <i>can</i>. Just load up the YouTube app on your phone and hit play. They don’t stop you. Apple just won’t let you put it on your <i>car’s</i> screen.')
