I&#x27;d rather talk to you about future of programming than this junk, but OK.<p>You&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s what the courts are saying.  I don&#x27;t think most people are buying that, though.  There&#x27;s too much video evidence and testimony to dismiss every motion.  Georgia, for example, is a mess.  To say that it&#x27;s fine is taking the result you want and working backwards. (Again, I&#x27;m a Bernie Sanders guy.  I don&#x27;t like either of them! :-)<p>It&#x27;s like a clean room.  You can&#x27;t have video of people walking in with their outside clothes, without going through the processes and then say, &quot;You have to prove that it contaminated the room.&quot;  You don&#x27;t; it&#x27;s enough to show the process was tainted.  There&#x27;s enough evidence to show that with the existing video and hundreds of witnesses.<p>The clip I linked to shows that our electoral systems are a train wreck in many states, especially when compared to other countries.  (Go watch it.)  Now we&#x27;re screwed.  Tens of millions of Americans feel (pretty validly) cheated out of their vote and it has created a no-win situation.<p>I hate this topic.  What are you working on? Any new insights?  :-)')
