Also, HF tends to be really noisy and low bandwidth, not sure it&#x27;d be very pleasant for music.<p>Edit: And another problem that&#x27;s probably even more important for this use case, most common ham radio equipment is simplex (only one person can transmit at a time). In the VHF&#x2F;UHF range you might be able to engineer a high bandwidth duplex (or TDM) system, but then your range would be limited to a few miles.')
