Tech companies want you to believe it&#x27;s an Internet apocalypse, but realistically, it means when someone sues a tech company, they are going to have to defend themselves on the merits of the case instead of using a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card. Facebook, Google, and Twitter will need slightly more lawyers, and the rest of the Internet will get along just fine with &quot;doing the best we can&quot;.<p>Pornhub will survive 2020. And it&#x27;s an example of what removing Section 230 protection can do, absolutely, since SESTA&#x2F;FOSTA exempted child sexual exploitation from 230 protection. Pornhub now only accepting verified uploads from professional studios and performers will not end porn. And in fact, without the ability for anonymous uploaders to post pirated premium porn, adult performers are going to make more money than they ever have before. Piracy has been hurting pornography just as much as it&#x27;s hurt every other type of content, perhaps even moreso.<p>Yeah, the wild west of the Internet is over. Governments know how it works and how it can impact them. Businesses have massive influence over how it operates and evolves. And the Internet isn&#x27;t just &quot;out in space&quot;, it exists as real equipment in real sovereign countries, and that will continue to apply more to how the Internet works over time.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s bad for the Internet. With regulation comes protection for people who might be otherwise harmed by others online. And it highlights the need to continue to push for global individual freedom: As we push towards open communication and human rights, the Internet as a whole will reflect that.')
