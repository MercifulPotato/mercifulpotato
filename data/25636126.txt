Some of the most informative, useful comments I&#x27;ve seen on Hacker News have taken the form of wild tangents.<p>I do see where you&#x27;re going, though, that if &quot;I agree&quot; is sufficient cause for an upvote, then it&#x27;s only reasonable that a vote in the opposite direction should be allowed to carry the opposite semantics.<p>It&#x27;s just that, from a purely social standpoint, that&#x27;s not actually how human beings typically think, feel, and react. Perhaps it could be that simple on the Vulcan version of Hacker News.')
