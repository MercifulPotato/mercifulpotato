The tricks lawyers, accountants, and estate planners can do run circles around tax authorities. They can’t close the loopholes as fast as new tricks are created.<p>The “if we only just seized money from the rich to solve all our problems” theorists are wrong on  two major counts. First they expect to be able to seize the money, which as I described above is very unlikely. The second is that once they seize it once, they will be unable to seize it again as the wealthy don’t have any more assets or wise up.<p>The proper way out of the fiscal mess is to reform government and, if needed, increase taxes broadly and sustainably. I am not a Bernie Sanders supporter but he was the only one who straight-up said he would raise taxes on everyone, unlike every other candidate that was promising utopia by taking the money from billionaires. But everyone wants easy answers nowadays, no one wants to sacrifice, if it’s not something for nothing immediately then it’s a non-starter.')
