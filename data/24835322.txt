Maybe for end users (who will get their web page in 485 ms instead of 500ms), but for developers it is not.<p>I was expecting HTTP 3.0 to get us huge benefits, but the numbers that were posted few days ago in hacker news are so underwhelming that I just don&#x27;t care for it at all.<p>And cost of development is high.')
