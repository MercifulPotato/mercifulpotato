The PS2 was awesome and the backwards compatibility to PS1 games got me hooked. However, I have no desire to buy 3 new consoles every 6-7 years that don&#x27;t support my previous collection of old games. If the PS5 had backwards compatibility all the way to the PS1, I&#x27;d buy it in a heartbeat, but since it doesn&#x27;t, I won&#x27;t buy it.')
