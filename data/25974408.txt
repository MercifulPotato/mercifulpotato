I have one 4K main display at 200% scaling, and an old 19&quot; off-screen I use for IRC and music playback at 100% scale. Every time I wake my machine, the windows from the off-screen are shuffled around to the main screen, and windows on the main screen are resized and moved around. It absolutely drives me up the wall, and it&#x27;s clear that this configuration has never been tested by anyone at Microsoft.')
