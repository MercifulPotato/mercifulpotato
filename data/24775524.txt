I know my view is idiosyncratic, but I view making money like a biological process. Most things have to do it if they want to survive, but it doesn&#x27;t deserve to be <i>the</i> thing that matters. The Silicon Valley focus on explosive growth, as opposed to healthy and reasonable long-term growth, is bad for the world.<p><i>I wonder if they are adequately assessing the risk of this decision model. People get deeply emotionally attached to media, and it&#x27;s a strong negative when a series you love is cancelled, so this could negatively affect their brand over time. And that&#x27;s not something which is so easy to design KPI&#x27;s around as new subscriber numbers.</i><p>Right. This is especially true of series with defined story arcs. A sitcom can be ended at any time, but if <i>Breaking Bad</i> had ended at Season 4, it would have pissed off everyone.')
