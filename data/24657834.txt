How many people who got a cold or flu have cardiac abnormalities when you do a cardiac MRI? Covid is undoubtedly more fatal than the flu, but in some demographics, like the young, it is less fatal.<p>The first cited study of athletes does not provide any context. The other cited study (Puntmann et al) did attempt to have a control group of people who did not contract Covid but had similar risk factors as the people who did contract Covid. If you look at this control group, a ton of people have cardiac abnormalities (in Table 1, as many as 26% of the non-Covid group could have the criteria for myocarditis that the study states).')
