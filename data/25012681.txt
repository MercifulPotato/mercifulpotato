Your boss might be micromanaging, but not with the boss hat, but a senior engineer hat, or an architect or product owner hat. I have considered introducing a convention where people declare what hat they are wearing first!<p>Also if the manager is also the expert in the technical area this can have the same effect. This often happens in small companies where the managers have been there about 10 years and wrote all the early systems. They take the role of manager, mentor, architect and code reviewer.<p>The solution which takes time is to start delegating out a stream of that work to a individual contributor who becomes the expert. This is a win for everyone. Less bottleneck for the team, less micromanaging, new ideas can flow in, and members build up skill and experience. New eyes on code, if they are good eyes can also lead to tech debt being paid off.')
