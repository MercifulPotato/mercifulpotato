Which is a main reason why pkgconf-based dependency resolution works much better with other build systems. If you compile package abc on, say, Ubuntu, and it needs package xyz you do not need to bother about how it is found. You just install xyz.<p>What I want to say, CMake makes things way more complex and solves problems which exist only on Windows. Otherwise, it does not add much, and is a burden. Why should developers on Linux carry that burden?')
