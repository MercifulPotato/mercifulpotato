Periscope bans nudity, so there is a non-zero human cost to moderate this. And with declining numbers in general, the amount of moderation needed goes up relative to the overall userbase.<p>I&#x27;m also convinced that there is a Periscope &quot;underground&quot; where people anonymously share and promote truly illegal content via private streams (where the only &quot;private&quot; aspect is the URL). In the past, Periscope may have been able to turn a blind eye because it&#x27;s not visible through the app, but with increased scrutiny on illegal content, the easiest and cheapest way to deal with it is to shutter the service.')
