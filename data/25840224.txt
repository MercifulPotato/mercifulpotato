Or even code that is encoded into x86 assembly, will be under American jurisdiction. And we know that all code written in China, uses the C programming language, as they have never developed their own technology stack.<p>In order to avoid this fate, then China must rip out everything from their country that has American technology, and develop their own technology stack, down to the ISA (Instruction Set Architecture). They cannot even use ARM or RISC-V, they must develop their own ISA, and call it CNA-1.<p>Then, they would have to develop their own programming language on top of this. Then their own operating system, and application software, to replace all American technology.')
