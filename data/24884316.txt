That will usually mean something like Github like site hosted in Russia, China or some other bloc where DMCA does not apply.<p>Right now, lots of users in the US scientific community use Scihub or how millions of US students use libgen, millions of users of open source software will have to get used to a non US controlled domain to get access to their software. Also development of these software will be done in the shadows so as to avoid the reach of the DMCA.')
