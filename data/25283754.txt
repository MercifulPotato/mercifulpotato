I was very into music in the 90s&#x2F;00s and bought nearly every CD I wanted and I ripped them into mp3s years ago.  I may just budget a $100 or so to buy mp3s I don&#x27;t have that I still want to listen to, and cancel YT music.<p>I don&#x27;t often buy ebooks since I love physical paper, but when I do I try to buy DRM free or use Calibre&#x2F;Apprentice Alf to strip the DRM and convert to epub.<p>Movies are a real challenge though.  Plenty of older stuff I have on DVD and it&#x27;s easy to rip, but it does take an enormous amount of effort to rip blu-ray.  I may try to do an OTA antenna hooked into Plex for most of TV, but will probably keep CBS all access and a couple others for movies&#x2F;shows&#x2F;etc.  So I&#x27;ll self host most things :-D')
