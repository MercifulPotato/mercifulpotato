A database sometimes uses the file API when actually wants to access the disk in a lower-level fashion, for which APIs are fragmented, non stable, non portable. So it&#x27;s not a fault of the abstraction, but the fact that a different low-level abstraction to access the storage in a way databases need to do is missing from POSIX.')
