You don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to take on higher risk for a higher return. It&#x27;s usually better to leverage risk-adjusted returns rather than chase high total returns with commensurate risk.<p>You <i>can</i> take on more risk that if you have the appetite, but if that&#x27;s the case you could also just use levered beta (e.g. 3x levered S&amp;P 500). This would significantly improve your portfolio while still being fundamentally much easier to understand than a novel asset.<p>If your portfolio has a decent risk adjusted return and very low volatility and beta exposure, it&#x27;s safer to just leverage it up to the same risk as the S&amp;P 500. This reduces the chance of you blowing up your capital in the long run.<p>I would argue there are very few investment goals for which extreme risk is sound (especially if it&#x27;s unhedged!).')
