I scrape a little data here and there, and a reliable proof of work system costing ~20s on a commodity core would make some of my personal projects cost tens of thousands of dollars monthly. Maybe that&#x27;s worth it to someone (e.g. if they have an army of hacked machines without anything better to do), but I think it&#x27;d keep a lot of the riffraff out.')
