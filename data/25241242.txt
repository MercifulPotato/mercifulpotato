I have a Ghost commuter bike with belt drive (came with Continental, but it broke and couldn&#x27;t be replaced, so it was swapped to gates). Not only is a it a huge pain in the ass to carry two identical heavy wrenches in case you have to remove the wheel+belt in the field, and tension is hard to get right even at home, but of course the cable is extremely hard to remove the first handful of times (and which gear you have to be in changes from hub to hub), ... but my Ghost had a disc brake caliper located such that the caliper had to <i>be removed</i> in order to remove the rear wheel (the disc cannot just side out of the caliper, it hits the caliper body itself). Ugh.')
