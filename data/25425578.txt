Do you want junior high school kids, handling contaminated biowaste, where the probability or risk of infection is very high.<p>And this was at the very beginning, when the science behind this virus and disease was not fully known.<p>It’s safer to throw the samples into a fire furnace, than to risk transporting it or storing it, where its leakage could further infect more people.')
