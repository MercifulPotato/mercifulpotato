Rich people with celebrity status never suffer the negative effects of those systems.  In fact, it actually benefits them because the system knows they’re rich and actively favours them because they’re considered more valuable than the rest of us.<p>Of course he doesn’t get worked up because if his assistant calls for support on anything they get routed to the VIP support system and a team of people spring into action to solve the problem for him.<p>People like Carmack don’t have to use the shitty systems they’re building, so they don’t care.
