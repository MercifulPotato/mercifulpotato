You&#x27;d like to believe that people believe everything they read on Facebook, while the truth is people don&#x27;t care.<p>I don&#x27;t have Facebook. I discussed things with my mother and sister personally. Our relationship is closer than just online crap. We actually talk together on a regular basis.<p>&gt; Obama being Muslim or not has no effect on her life<p>This belief of my mother has an effect on our political discussion. In particular, she doesn&#x27;t want to vote for a Muslim. It sets the stage for the rest of the discussion to come.<p>Where do I start? Do I start with Muslims aren&#x27;t bad people? Do I attempt to prove Obama is a Christian? Etc. etc. These facts and beliefs lay the groundwork to the very discussion. And I have to take it seriously if I so wish to have an intelligent discussion with my family.<p>&gt; Just stop. The sad thing is you as a human will not recognize in yourself how much your &quot;knowledge&quot; is faulty as well.<p>I know that Obama is a Christian, and that Breonna Taylor was innocent. I don&#x27;t expect to know the truth to everything, but I&#x27;ll start with the facts I know about and work my way up.<p>-----------<p>I don&#x27;t believe myself to be the &quot;defender of truth&quot; or whatever. I can point out to my mom and my sister that I disagree with their &quot;alternative facts&quot;, but I&#x27;m not so arrogant to believe that I can change their opinion on just discussion alone.<p>But when I see such obvious untruths seep into their talking points, it does make me weep inside on behalf of the truth.')
