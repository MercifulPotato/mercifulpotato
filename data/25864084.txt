That includes both Premium and Music subscribers, but given the pricing structure it is hard to imagine who would pay for just Music. In terms of all users, 1.5 years ago they said 2B monthly active users.<p>On one hand, that sounds miserable. Only 1% of the users are paying! On the other hand, a Premium subscriber is an order of magnitude more profitable. The ads run rate seems to be about $20B&#x2F;year, and subscriptions behind at just a factor of 5 at about $4B&#x2F;year.<p>(The $20B is a hard number from the Q3 earnings, $4B is  back of the envelope. It&#x27;s hard to say just how e.g. regional pricing if affecting it, or how the family plans are counted.)')
