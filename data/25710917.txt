Both are 25-30% better than h264. See Netflix&#x27;s benchmarks. We&#x27;re talking 4gb vs 6gb<p>A 1gb movie will always look like crap, even with an even better codec like AV1. Pause the movie during an action sequence or explosion and it&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;re watching the video on YouTube with all the compression artifacts that entails.')
