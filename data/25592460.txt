It&#x27;s the glue of civilization. There are MANY things that are legal that we can do, but we will not, as we will feel ashamed of it.<p>It seems to me that about half of the general population is constrained by the &quot;sanctions&quot; of shame exclusively, but given the green light by a high profile example of, oh say, the President, will gladly act like horrible human beings, which is their original nature. Not only will they not feel shame, they may even be <i>proud</i> of being horrible.<p>If anything, the last four years have taught me a lot about humanity, and how fragile our contract with society is.')
