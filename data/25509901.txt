When I founded a startup we discussed how an exit would happen (for either party) and documented it.<p>That&#x27;s the controlling factor here, and of course HN has no insight into those docs. Depending on what legal jurisdiction you are in, you might have some other rights&#x2F;obligations.<p>Either way, please consult a lawyer who has helped clients through this kind of situation before. Preferably a local one.<p>After doing so, you may want to reach out to the investor and make sure that your co-founder isn&#x27;t controlling the narrative with them. Again, the lawyer probably has some advice on this approach.')
