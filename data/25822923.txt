The &quot;mother and baby&quot; homes. The amount of abuse involved was horrific and the country is still untangling and confronting it decades later.<p>Be wary of changing a system where the abuse is borne silently because there is no way out for one that makes it visible and thinking that is worse because just now you can see it.<p>Divorce rates are on their way down in the West. The transition period is definitely rough, but eventually the cultural norms adapt.<p>I would be interested to see if you canvas the views of Bangladeshi women on the comparative systems.')
