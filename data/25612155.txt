I understand info from Nubes has special value, so I&#x27;ll be as explicit as I can.<p>I must be slow, being an old fart...

(Why did it trip me up? Because on my  screen in non-dark mode, { and [ look identical due to my eyesight, and I assumed I was looking at [ because the text said that&#x27;s what it was... as you get older, you&#x27;ll understand)<p>I don&#x27;t understand why \n  b=a;\n  c=a;  &lt;-- doesn&#x27;t work because a is &quot;used up&quot;???<p>I&#x27;ll get a Rust compiler and start again.<p>I&#x27;m allergic to &quot;macros&quot; as they have had a special place in hell because of their misuse in C... I hope Rust is more sane.')
