Because otherwise when the headlights are on (which is required in many places on motorcycles at all times) you will not at all be able to see these.<p>Edit: to be clear Iâ€™m talking about the large projector units below the LED driving lights. Most motorcycles come from the factory without the ability to turn those main headlights off and many states mandate them. On my FZ1 the main headlights are some of the brightest and most powerful I have ever seen from the factory on any vehicle including cars, by putting the LED in the same housing you are putting this LED strip just three inches from an incredibly bright light source. The factory turn signals (that the Author removed) are normally located at least a foot from the mains, the new models put them on the rear view mirrors way out to the side.')
