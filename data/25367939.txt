You donate some assets to a DAF instead of directly to a nonprofit, so you can decide later how to actually give it away. As long as that&#x27;s a one-way path and they can&#x27;t withdraw it later, I don&#x27;t see the big issue.<p>Now the money might be given to nonprofits that aren&#x27;t charitable or are &quot;bad&quot; in some way, but that&#x27;s possible normally. Seems like DAFs just create another hop?')
