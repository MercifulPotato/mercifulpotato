You’re fixating on a number that doesn’t inform you.<p>Whatever their level 5 means, it excludes at least 90% of the people who <i>wrote</i> large technical and impenetrable documents just to graduate from school, not including all the practicing lawyers, doctors, engineers, scientists, and writers in the country.<p>There’s a disconnect between using the 2% number to represent any kind of literacy threshold, and reality. It may have measured something, but this “2%” does <i>not</i> represent a limit on number of people who have the capability to read Prezi’s terms of service.<p>&gt; I stand by my belief that this terms of service is sufficiently complex that even fewer [than 2%] can understand it.<p>That’s unfortunate, I’ve failed to make a convincing argument. I was hoping to help you see more clearly that’s not what your data actually says, and is also contradicted by other data as well. The data isn’t wrong, but your interpretation is.')
