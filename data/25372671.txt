Until there&#x27;s too much wealth disparity, and Peter is willing to pay more than Paul has in total for desert-grown almonds. Either Paul steals the water or he dies, and thieves aren&#x27;t popular.<p>Eh, unlikely.  Peter will just get his almonds from the cheapest supplier, who is unlikely to be growing in a desert.<p>There&#x27;s nothing special about water in the scenario you are describing.  Plenty of other commodities are traded on markets, and more developed markets have meant better and more secure supply for everyone, especially poor people.<p>&gt; Of course there&#x27;s another form of currency - votes. I can&#x27;t really say they&#x27;re universally distributed, because FPTP screws up the purchasing power of a vote. But I&#x27;d give good odds on a very strong correlation between a functioning democracy and cheap water.<p>Only some countries use FPTP.  In any case, there&#x27;s a strong correlation between any attributes generally seen as desirable.  Figuring out causation is harder.<p>Btw, you know what poor people lack even more than money: influence and connections.  I wouldn&#x27;t look to politics to improving their lot.')
