Item(by='dmix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603741234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899931, text='&gt; Most of the corporate media are (sometimes ludicrously) optimistic, the other polarity. I read both.<p>Unfortunately being wrong on the internet is now becoming long-term grounds to be censored.<p>Its quite sad really and I don&#x27;t know what the solution is.<p>One thing that I DO know is that the solution isn&#x27;t coming from the government. They are terrible at things. Their job should largely be relegated to protecting freedoms and security.<p>This 230 stuff is mostly probably going to backfire and create a less free internet. We don&#x27;t need more lawyers and more government intervention to internet communication.<p>I do know we have many thousands of people working on solutions to things like Reddit (and Cloudflares) hyper-sensitive long-ago-crosed-the-line censorship, even if censorship is probably a poor world for it given the historical baggage.<p>Although this is the internet and even sights like T_D were almost entirely replaced on a site without Reddit&#x27;s regulation and controls (a far worse situation in many&#x27;s eyes) welll before it was banned on Reddit. It&#x27;s thriving on a domain name I won&#x27;t mention here.<p>Same with infowars and 8chan, they both quickly found new homes on new places.<p>But there censoring on any major platform and being related to fringe online communities being fringe DDOS protection services and aononimizers (who yes do still get heavily advertised and recruited on Reddit and redirected to these new unmoderated sites, so their censorship policies were always destined to fail).<p>I&#x27;m more concern about operating in the real world (VISA&#x2F;Mastercard, Patreon, acess to advertising monopoly networks like adwords&#x2F;adsense, etc), less so the online communities where discourse it happening. Reddit&#x27;s censorship problem will eventually be solved on a wider&#x2F;easier scale once the engineering work has been put into it.<p>It&#x27;s probably one of the biggest problem of our current era for those of us who understand the importance of &quot;outlaw thinking&quot;, free expression, and those who know the history of  how these tools of control are almost always abused and riddled with false positives. The history of those who went against the grain (even if that grain is terribly wrong, wrong things have plenty of other ways to kill off than censorship).')
