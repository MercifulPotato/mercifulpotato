According to Wikipedia, 0.04% vaccinations resulted in paralysis in the Cutter Incident, compared to 0.1-0.5% of wild type polio. So the vaccine was 2-10x safer than wild polio. Without vaccinations, virtually all children were infected with polio virus early in life [1], so being administered the defective vaccine was still a lot better than taking a chance with the real disease.<p>Of course, you are correct regarding the 1976 flu outbreak. If you administer something to a large segment of the healthy population, even a small risk of side-effects will add upp to a large number of cases. If the disease itself turns out to be very rare, as was the case with the flu outbreak, the vaccine itself could cause more damage than the disease even if the disease is much worse.<p>However, this is clearly not applicable Covid-19, which we already know is spreading very fast and will need to infect a large number of the population before herd immunity is achieved. The situations are simply not comparable at all – even the vaccine from the 1976 flu outbreak would be less risky than the odds of being infected with a serious case of Covid 19 (of which the long term effects are also unknown, to be clear).<p>&gt; But whenever I mention that immunizations have risks, I’m treated like a heretic.<p>Mainstream media, healthcare professionals and social media are all worried about the risks of a rushed vaccine. I literally see articles and hear conversations about this several times a month. Nobody is denying that large scale vaccinations have risks.<p>I&#x27;m not criticizing you because I&#x27;m against being cautious of vaccination risks. The criticism is that you are spreading false facts and misleading analysis that grossly mischaracterise what the risks of vaccinations really are, both presently and historically.<p>&quot;Some vaccines can have rare but serious side effects&quot; is a perfectly alright statement. But &quot;Historically, two cases of rushed vaccines (cutter polio and Gullah barre) were worse than the disease - and these were for diseases worse than covid&quot; is just not. Some of it is false and the comparison to Covid19 is misleading.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecdc.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;poliomyelitis&#x2F;facts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecdc.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;poliomyelitis&#x2F;facts</a>')
