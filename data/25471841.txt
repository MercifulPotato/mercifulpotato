But it quite clear that Apple are never going to sell it standalone. It also seems extremely unlikely that Apple are going to get back into the server game again.<p>Apple sell high markup, low volume (relatively) products. Data centre severs are the opposite, and Apple have stated quite explicitly they’re not interested in building anything that isn’t a high margin, luxury, product.<p>In the consumer space, I can see Apple taking more market share. But again, the vast majority of PC are either business machines, or low margin consumer machines. Both markets that Apple doesn’t seem to be that interested in diving into (their enterprise support is crap, and see above regarding low margin goods for the consumer market).<p>In all I must disagree with this statement<p>&gt; So it seems to me that Apple is perfectly aligned to take a large part of the market<p>Not because Apple doesn’t have the technical chops to do it. But because they just aren’t interested in that market.<p>As such I think AMD, and other ARM manufacturers have everything to play for, and no need to worry about Apple.')
