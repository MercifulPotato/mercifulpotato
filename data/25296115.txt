When your personal emails go to your friend&#x27;s spam folder regardless of how conformant and well behaved your mail server is and they think its your fault for not using gmail, that&#x27;s a problem.<p>I&#x27;ve had google lock me out of my account due to their bad password reset heuristic (which is a social scaling problem due to the above) which means I&#x27;ll completely lose my address in a year (currently forwarded to my own domain.)<p>There are similar social network effects with eg. Facebook, iMessage etc. although the abuses and problems are slightly different.')
