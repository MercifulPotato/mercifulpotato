He&#x27;d completely drunk the Kool Aid but ended his experience at the company facing more than a year of abuse from a new manager and senior engineer. Very similar to this long post about Apple, unfortunately.  He and a couple of other people on his team tried to move to different teams, but despite a long history of excellent work, everyone was treated by the rest of the company like they were toxic waste.<p>Nobody thinks that their company is like this until they&#x27;re on the other side of it.  In my friend&#x27;s case, it was only in retrospect that he saw patterns of toxic behavior from management.')
