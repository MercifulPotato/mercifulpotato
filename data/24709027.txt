Other car companies? Revenue? I ask because when there are so many emotional investors in a stock like Tesla, I&#x27;ve found it hard to rationalize the price. For that reason, I&#x27;m nervous about going short or long for any length of time. That said, I&#x27;ve had a lot of success day trading the price action.')
