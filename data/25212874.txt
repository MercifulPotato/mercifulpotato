HN is about the only one I can stomach, barely. I appreciate having a source of brief distractions, and toxicity is exactly counter to the point. Even as it is I need to keep myself out of some areas. (Holy cow does discussion of dating bring out the sense of entitlement and misogyny.)<p>I don&#x27;t really want to depend on an AI to screen things, and if nothing else, it&#x27;s a good reminder that I really should limit the amount of time I spend in the kind of vapid extemporanea that social sites bring. But I don&#x27;t want to reduce it to zero, so I&#x27;d probably use a tool that made the vapid extemporanea less unpleasant.')
