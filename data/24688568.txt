It&#x27;s basically goods stolen from people, at the moment of shutting down - they <i>should</i> be first in line. Most companies don&#x27;t shut down when they run out of their last dollar; Rather, they shut down when they have more liabilities than assets.<p>The result would be that traditional creditors will <i>demand</i> an escrow for that digital data before giving any money (or providing products before payment), to make sure that they are not bypassed -- which would be the desired result for everyone.')
