This client was doing development in another company for the last 5 or so years and approached us for further development of that product. That product was developed with no documentation and we asked time for understanding the system and picking up the small user stories along the way. He was nice till starting the project. We are barely into the 3rd month of development and now he is abusing our employees in languages that could not be posted in any platform. These abuses are for the errors already existing in that platform and we are not responsible ; that we can prove anywhere. How can we deal with this situation. Our company is very new and just completed 1 year now. We are in no way dependent on this client for our survival and what will be the best way to escape from such a mess?')
