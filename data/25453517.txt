I have been listening to audiobooks since 2010.... hardly spent 5-20 days since when I didnt have an audiobook playing while going to sleep.<p>I spend a year finishing wallander series. Then another year for Lee child, then another or John grisham.\nOther than those, read almost 40-80 books yearly. *wink 2x playback.<p>I have to say, books are now a part of my personality. There are times when I dig up a copy of any wallander series or Lee child because I want to hear dick hill.\nSame for narrators like orlagh cassidy, Steve barthurst, Simon vance, and hundreds of others.<p>My most recent love has been Louise penny series. I thoroughly enjoyed that series.<p>Not to start with either department Q or Lars Kepler. Those two were brutal and enjoyed the rawness of it.')
