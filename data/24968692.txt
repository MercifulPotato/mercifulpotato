You are talking about the latter, but that is irrelevant if you have the former.<p>There is no &quot;latest&quot; version of a project in the decentralized model. As soon as there is one &quot;latest&quot; version that rules them all, you have centralized an aspect of the project and that immediately becomes a target for organizations like the RIAA. IPFS does not help here. Because in the end, someone must have the exclusive right to release a new &quot;latest&quot; version. This release mechanism becomes a single point of failure.<p>Sure, you can use use IPFS to create multiple copies of that new version to avoid having them taken down. But you also could just do `git clone` on a new server, as so many already have done. Creating copies and putting them up for download is not the problem.<p>If git is used in a true decentralized way, everybody has their own version of the project. No two have to be alike. Do you want to use youtube-dl to download porn, get the version with the right extension. Do you have moral objections to porn, get the version without them. Exactly like there is no &quot;one&quot; Linux, each distro has its own version, with the patches they think are important. This way, the RIAA could even release their own version of the tool. One that can download from Youtube, but not video&#x27;s that are subject to the copyright they want to uplhold.<p>Users would not have download the tool directly from that one developer&#x2F;team, they could download it from whoever they trust to have their best interests at heart. That is what decentralization means.')
