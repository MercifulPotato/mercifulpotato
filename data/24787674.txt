But it feels weird to say it.<p>The English expressions I do wish people would get right are &quot;moorish&quot; meaning spicy (after the Moors), not &quot;I want more of this&quot;, and &quot;enormity&quot; meaning horrible, not huge. But English is always changing, and using these phrases in their correct meaning now confuses people.')
