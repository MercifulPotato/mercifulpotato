As long as it has people loyal to the company owners, it could create its own rules and fend off any nation that tries to take jurisdiction. This would be similar to a feudal lord enforcing his own rules with a small army of private retainers. Realistically though, this would only happen on an independent base on Mars or the Moon, or a fully self-sufficient space station. Otherwise, Earth-dependence would allow nations to influence space operations and push their jurisdiction into outer-space, similar to European colonial endeavors. Maybe the solution is to create a new, separate state that has jurisdiction and military control over the entirety of outer space not tied to any particular nation?')
