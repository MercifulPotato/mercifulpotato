Start small, make the same thing twice: one for learning, another with the lessons for the first.<p>I will not claim to be a good woodworker, I recently made <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.redd.it&#x2F;oyg8onja3ll51.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=767f2a1c0376188ca9b6270b4113fe0007166964" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;preview.redd.it&#x2F;oyg8onja3ll51.jpg?width=4608&amp;format=...</a> which I&#x27;m quite happy with. Some rough edges.<p>I do not consider myself particularly handy, but just get started. And watch a bunch YouTube videos for tips.<p>Tools used: cordless drill, saw, tape measure, 90 deg angle thingy, some clamps, 45deg angle cutting template block. I had the wood panels sawed at the DIY store, so no need for a table saw.<p>I think all the tools used can be had for a few hundred euros.<p>EDIT: I think the hardest part of this is imagining how to put everything together, do the accurate measurements or design things in a way that you can tolerate less accuracy.<p>I learned a ton making this, would do it differently next time, but both had fun doing it and now have a nice pillow box. People tell me &quot;I didn&#x27;t know you were so handy&quot;. Well, me neither.')
