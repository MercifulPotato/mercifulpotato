Item(by='shirakawasuna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610248723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25708146, text='Another view is about what services on the internet should be considered a commons, particularly as more interaction shifts to online rather than in-person spaces. Physical commons are regulated through local action and laws with some basis in democratic action. Online commons are generally near-absolute dictatorships run by a for-profit company where the only restrictions are minor government regulations that would make them liable for users&#x27; actions under certain circumstances. Otherwise, any commons can purge users for essentially any reason with no input from those using the commons.<p>I won&#x27;t suggest solutions to this at the moment other than to say there are more options that providing democratic power over existing private commons. There could be public online commons that are guaranteed to meet certain standards, for example, and for private spaces to not compete and subsume them. Though this is speaking vaguely - there are many potential discussions to have about what a public digital commons could look like.')
