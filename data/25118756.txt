Item(by='GekkePrutser', descendants=None, kids=[25118925], score=None, time=1605571406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117509, text='The source of all the supposedly funny videos some of my &#x27;friends&#x27; just love to share...<p>Though to be fair, TikTok seems to be the only one stamping shared videos with its logo, which is why I hate them in particular. I suppose most of the stupid videos I get without logo come from other sources which I would hate just as much if I knew what they were :P Here in the Netherlands there was a similar thing called &quot;Dumpert&quot; actually which I also hate (but people usually link to it instead of reposting videos so it&#x27;s easier to avoid)<p>God, I must have had 20 people sending me one with those coffin dancers involved in some shape or form.. Really don&#x27;t get why people think that&#x27;s funny. And no, I&#x27;m not all grumpy :) Some videos people share to me I <i>do</i> like but they really never come from TikTok. The app seems to always generate the same kind of slapstick humor. Someone having an accident and then the coffin dancers.. Hahah fun lol.. Or whatever.<p>If they&#x27;d just remove the feature to share videos to other platforms I&#x27;d like TikTok a lot more.')
