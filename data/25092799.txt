You can argue these massive companies have a right to ban whoever they want on their own platforms, for whatever reason they want. But they shouldn&#x27;t have a right to ban people on other platforms.<p>Even if a ban&#x2F;suspension is made in error and can be reversed, that could still cause someone a lot of harm, or be used as a political weapon. That&#x27;s legitimately scary.')
