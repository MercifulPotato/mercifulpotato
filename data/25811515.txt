But the other way to think of it and the way that it ends up being explained is that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like the the instruction set of an abstract machine that&#x27;s designed such that you can translate that abstract machine to a physical machine. And the reason that that&#x27;s important. So if you win back to the early 90s when we were talking to all of these these companies doing consumer electronics.<p>To have some fun I asked my coworker who is a lot smarter than me what that means which led to a fun 30 minute tangent.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.happyscribe.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;lex-fridman-podcast-artificial-intelligence-ai&#x2F;126-james-gosling-java-jvm-emacs-and-the-early-days-of-computing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.happyscribe.com&#x2F;public&#x2F;lex-fridman-podcast-artif...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lexfridman.com&#x2F;james-gosling&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lexfridman.com&#x2F;james-gosling&#x2F;</a>')
