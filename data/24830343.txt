This accomplishes the same goal without alienating or putting up barriers for people (especially people of color) whose native dialect of English is not Standard English.<p>I think we can all get behind this. The idea is that if you speak Indian English and refer to the contents of a written program as “codes” rather than “code”, that is completely fine, since it is clear and easily understandable by other English speakers. Strunk &amp; White is kind of a trainwreck of a style manual anyway (the linked article articulates many of my complaints, but I have others). Maybe its popularity was deserved in earlier decades, I don’t know, I’m not a historian.')
