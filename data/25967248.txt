Grammar of graphics approach is optimized for understanding data sets.<p>For strengths of plotnine, ggplot, and Altair over Gnuplot (or matplotlib), see section 3.3 of the article, particularly the example<p>ggplot(data=mpg) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=&quot;displ&quot;, y=&quot;hwy&quot;, color=&quot;class&quot;))<p>You can easily replace &#x27;color&#x27; with &#x27;shape&#x27;, or even faceting (getting a separate plot for each class).<p>I do not know Gnuplot very well -- what&#x27;s the easiest Guplot way to do this? [1] I do know that when I was looking at data sets, switching from plain matplotlib (where you&#x27;d have to plot in a loop over each class) to the grammar of graphics style was a breath of fresh air for me.<p>Separately, and less interestingly, if you are already using Python or Jupyter, Gnuplot isn&#x27;t as smoothly integrated into that ecosystem.<p>[1]: The first thing I found on the website is <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gnuplot.sourceforge.net&#x2F;demo_5.4&#x2F;varcolor.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gnuplot.sourceforge.net&#x2F;demo_5.4&#x2F;varcolor.html</a>, but perhaps there&#x27;s a better or more minimal example?')
