But after 1 month with each I found unreal to be easier.<p>A major problem with both is that the learning communities are terrible, because they&#x27;re filled with wannabes who, while well intentioned, have no idea what they&#x27;re doing. Question and Answer forums are plagued with dumb questions that aggressively try to assert that they need to know X when actually the problem begins at A, B, C. Youtube tutorials are filled with hilariously bad narrators who spend an hour trying to demo a basic concept and then for unfathomable reasons, do not show the final result before ending the video.<p>Find a single good set of tutorials to go through the process of making something (anything!) and an active place where competent people discuss things. Googling, unlike most coding problems, is not your friend if you want to find best practice stuff.<p>For Unreal, I thought this guy was decent: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DywBqQtTHMo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DywBqQtTHMo</a><p>I only did the first fifteen or so before I decided to start figuring stuff out on my own.
