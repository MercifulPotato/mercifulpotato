For instance the claim that the Apple chip has &quot;nothing of the sort&quot; compared to the SIMD on the Intel chip, making it &quot;far inferior [in some respects]&quot;.<p>It seems dubious that someone cognizant of the 128-bit NEON instructions would say such a thing.<p>The follow-up post then defensively used pejorative language to describe those people, such as that they were &quot;rubbed the wrong way&quot;, among other dismissive lines, pointing to some prior entry to prove that surely he isn&#x27;t unaware of such a thing, then going into the demonstration with the intention of proving his original point.<p>That&#x27;s...not useful. He made an enormous error because he was certain that his original wrong claims must be true. I&#x27;m not surprised that he recanted given that it was a pretty embarrassing, egregious error seen by thousands.')
