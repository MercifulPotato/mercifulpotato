Just by taking this material made out of carbon atoms you can get superconducting states, correlated insulating states, ferromagnetism, and some others. By using field-effect-transistor-style device geometries, you can tune between these states by changing a voltage on a gate. This is a big deal, because it&#x27;s much easier to change a gate voltage than it is to grow an entirely new material with a different doping level, which is usually what you need to do with other systems. The paper that this article is about is a nice measurement of the topological nature of the moire bands. It&#x27;s cool stuff and could potentially be important for quantum computing, but don&#x27;t forget that these devices are still extremely difficult to make.<p>Regardless of whether graphene has left the lab and made it into consumer electronics or not, it&#x27;s still super interesting for academics.<p>Source: I work on this stuff.')
