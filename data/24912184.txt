I have a four year old whose blocking&#x2F;disfluency&#x2F;stutter is getting worse by the day. He already has virtual speech therapy sessions 2x a week.\nI&#x27;m really worried about what will become of him in the American high school system with its rampant bullying, and then about the pain and suffering the world will inflict on him. What can I do to help him overcome this?')
