You did a lot of that in the last 24 hours. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s hard to see. I don&#x27;t want to ban you, so please go back to using HN as intended so I don&#x27;t have to.<p>&gt; <i>The important thing is they now realize</i><p>If you want people to realize something, you need to explain it to them patiently and respectfully, and include a certain amount of overlap with what they already know and feel. That&#x27;s a totally different mode of communication than flaming rhetoric. People don&#x27;t learn when beaten with flaming sticks (verbally any more than physically). They just go rigid, double down, and lash back. If you actually want them to learn, that is the worst way to make it happen.<p>Flaming is something we do <i>to</i> other people, not for them. We do it for ourselves, to vent our anger and frustration (not that it really helps us either, but it at least provides a little temporary relief). That&#x27;s partly why it contributes to destroying communication and community. We want communication and community here, so please do the opposite from now on.')
