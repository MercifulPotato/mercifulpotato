I admit this came as a surprise to me.<p>I had assumed, from a combination of the title and my intuition about 2020, that desktop computing would be enjoying a resurgence.  My thinking: many of us are stuck at home and desktop computing is the premium computing experienceâ€”especially for enthusiasts, gamers, content creators, engineers, programmers, etc.  We&#x27;re no longer carrying a computer to and from an office each day, so the value of a laptop is diminished.
