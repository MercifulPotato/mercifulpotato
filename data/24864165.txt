Maybe it would be per-user or maybe it would be a sponsorship, like what Discord is doing.   Sponsor the local neighborhood group for $25&#x2F;year, your high school class forum for $100&#x2F;year (so you can show everybody &quot;you made it big&quot;).<p>The key to doing something like that is network effects, which WhatsApp had in spades.<p>Probably it&#x27;s inevitable that they would have descended into advertising and tailoring the site for advertisers instead of users.')
