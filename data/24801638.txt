Would people pay for LibreOffice over MS Office?  Would people pay for GIMP over Photoshop?  Some would, most wouldn&#x27;t.  It would kill corporate adoption of FOSS and, since most FOSS development is done by people employed by corporations, that would shrink the userbase and reduce the sustainability of FOSS.')
