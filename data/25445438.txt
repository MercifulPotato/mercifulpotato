Load pictures into Lightroom, apply NLP, save. If you have over 10k negatives you don&#x27;t have time for every picture. NLP produces acceptable (and in my view very good) results with no additional processing required.<p>Also if you have that many negatives, every step you need to take is one step too many. My frames came from the camera without any borders, so no cropping needed. Don&#x27;t put the negatives in the &quot;wrong&quot; way. Base vs. emulsion debate is just that - a debate with miniscule differences.<p>I had a foot-switch for release so that you can use both hands for the camera and focus. Then you&#x27;ll achieve ~5 minutes for a full 36 frame roll of (strips of 4-6 frames) film.')
