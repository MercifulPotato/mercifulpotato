Item(by='CamTin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605425444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098972, text='&quot;the editor becomes the ssh client itself&quot; is effectively how I use Emacs. TRAMP (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emacswiki.org&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;TrampMode" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emacswiki.org&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;TrampMode</a>) makes editing remote files pretty much as seamless as editing local ones. I even semi frequently do slightly-crazy-seeming things like open files via chains of several ssh hops and I can &quot;save&quot; them (read: marshal a complex operation involving scp, base64, and other sourcery) in exactly the same way I can save something to the home directory on my workstation. TRAMP is a default part of the Emacs distribution (and has been for over 10 years), so it doesn&#x27;t require installing extra packages or even enabling anything. It&#x27;s just on by default.<p>This capability, plus &quot;frame&quot; management commands and the various terminal modes make my use of Emacs roughly equivalent to they way I see colleagues (I&#x27;m an ops&#x2F;sysadmin type, not really a developer) using vim + tmux.')
