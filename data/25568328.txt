An extremely low risk from the vaccine, bear in mind all vaccines carry risks, or the known risks from a virus that has killed pushing two million people and itself seems to have long term health impact on many survivors. My wife is a Nurse and had the virus in April, she&#x27;s had chest infection problems ever since and is currently on long term antibiotics to try and shake it off.<p>Waiting to check for long term effects is a novel and unprecedented standard for a vaccine. Yes the testing process usually takes several years, but testing for long term effects would take much, much longer. Nobody has ever held a vaccine to that kind of standard before, so why are we suddenly panicking about it now?<p>I&#x27;m fine with people choosing not to get vaccinated, but I&#x27;m also fine with them losing their travel and some employment privileges as a result.')
