Kicad has a nice push-and-shove manual router, which Eagle didn&#x27;t, though looking back I see they added one a few years back.<p>Both placement systems just drop all your parts into a grid sorted by reference designator, Eagle doesn&#x27;t (didn&#x27;t?) have automatic placement optimization for minimizing ratsnest length, Kicad does have that, plus various plugins to lay out your board like the schematic, auto-place similar groups of components from the schematic hierarchy, etc. Both have trace length matching and can add a meander to reach a given length automatically, Kicad has a built-in impedance calculator.<p>A critical difference is that Kicad isn&#x27;t limited to 2-layers, and for small-run high-speed digital work a 4-layer board makes a lot of sense these days and significantly simplifies routing. When all your power and ground signals and decoupling caps just go to a via and then to the internal plane, there&#x27;s a lot less work to do, and a lot more space in which to do it!')
