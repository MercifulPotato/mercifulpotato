This is simply an incontrovertible fact - India, Nigeria, Congo, etc... were in similar initial conditions and fared much worse economically.<p>Compared to countries with a similar culture&#x2F;demographics: Hong Kong, Korea, Singaporem Japan and Taiwan, mainland China&#x27;s growth has been way slower.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s also set on escaping the middle income trap in 2-5 years as GDP per capita goes above 12500$, which is something that most liberal capitalist economies cannot achieve.<p>This is still only around a fourth of the GDP per capita in the other East Asian countries.')
