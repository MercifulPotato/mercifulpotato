Warehouse workers are a totally different situation. My opinion is admittedly strongly influenced by the fact that at most tech companies I&#x27;ve worked for, the conditions have been great, and any strong employee feedback and reasonable demands were usually listened to and acted up by management. The same can obviously <i>not</i> be said for warehouse workers, so unionizing would almost certainly benefit them.<p>I&#x27;ll agree that there would most likely be some gains and some losses. I&#x27;m just not personally convinced the gains will outweigh the losses for software engineers specifically.<p>I think the key difference here between warehouse workers and tech workers is that if non-union talks with management break down, most tech workers can move jobs and keep similar benefits&#x2F;comp&#x2F;location without huge effort, the same can&#x27;t be said of many warehouse workers.')
