It is enough that the software&#x2F;service is primarily about circumventing the &quot;technological measure&quot;.<p>The technological measure itself doesn&#x27;t even have to be primarily about preventing copyright infringement. It suffices that it effectively controls access to relevant works, even if it&#x27;s not its primary purpose.<p>We could even argue that YouTube&#x27;s restriction are primarily a means of getting people back to YouTube, with copyright enforcement being only a secondary concern. Sadly, this argument would be irrelevant with respect to (A) and (B).')
