Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611380572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25879842, text='Even in England, which nobody would dispute is &quot;one nation&quot; (note that I used England here, not the UK), you can travel around to various regions and find exactly the same level of regionalism as you&#x27;re describing. People from (say) Cornwall (extreme southwest) feel a distinctly different identity for themselves compared with (say) the far north east, and particularly with the southeast. We&#x27;re talking across distances of just a few hundred miles.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that this has anything inherently to do with &quot;states&quot; per se. People like to feel affiliated with a region and&#x2F;or a community that they feel they can get their hearts and minds around. In the US, for so many reasons, &quot;states&quot; tend to be the natural attractor for such feelings. But even then, as you note, the &quot;95ers&quot; versus eastern OR is still a thing.')
