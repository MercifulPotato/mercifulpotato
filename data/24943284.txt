But what I wonder is if there&#x27;s yet a Rust web framework or set of libraries that would be a good fit for the type of stateful real-time web application where Phoenix is such a good fit right now. That is, a framework based on something like the actor model, with fault tolerance and clustering, with WebSocket-based channels built atop those actors, and possibly topped off with a real-time thin-client system like Phoenix LiveView. Those things, plus a statically-typed AOT-compiled language with great runtime efficiency like Rust, would be a killer combination.')
