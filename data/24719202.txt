However, what might be more interesting is an automated subdivision of users. For example, even if HN has hundreds of thousands of users, philosophic-types would only see links and comments from other philosophic-types. Trolls would get lumped with trolls. With a significant percentage of outside-your-demographic to keep things lively as well as gather further data about what kind of community a user truly enjoys engaging with. Especially important is identifying constructive conflict â€” the type of person you enjoy disagreeing with (if not in the moment, at least afterward).<p>So basically, instead of subdividing by interesting-content-type, subdivide by healthy-community-type. This might solve the problem of when communities get too large, without creating a lifeless echo-chamber of endless up-votes.')
