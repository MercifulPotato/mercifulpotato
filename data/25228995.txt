The former is definitely true, but consider the following:<p>- &quot;Connections&quot; used a substantial amount of acted historical scenes. Creating them in such a quality (and not some sketchy animation or a re-cut of existing work) is still a challenge today. You need half-decent actors.<p>- Technical quality is secondary to content. &quot;Connections&quot; is not just a collection of interesting and well-made bits about how technology evolved, there is an entire and compelling theory behind it, which Burke tries to bring accross. Such aspirations, executed with such intellectual and inspirational confidence, need something more than just technical ability and financial resources. Just because paper and ink got much cheaper since the 16th century, we didn&#x27;t suddenly produce a Shakespeare every 2 years.<p>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any historical documentation on YouTube which even compares to the depth and width of &quot;Connections&quot;.')
