A way to be inclusive without coming off like you hate American culture. I don&#x27;t really care if &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; has just one day and &quot;Happy Hanukkah&quot; has 8. I&#x27;m fine either way. It just seems more likely to get broader acceptance if each group is allotted equal time. A compromise of sorts.')
