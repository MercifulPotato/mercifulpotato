Perhaps their user-driven moderation scheme didn’t scale.<p>I’m getting fairly tired of being impugned by generalizations; I personally didn’t join Parler to plan evil; I just didn’t want to be on a site where everyone seemed to hate me.<p>So, I am a counter-example that invalidates the wildly general claim.<p>That is all.')
