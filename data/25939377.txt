They do everything they say to pretend they&#x27;re the public square, short of saying it, but when push comes to shove, they reveal themselves as private owners with an agenda.<p>What&#x27;s doubly annoying is that governments worldwide decided to participate. When politicians&#x27; primary channel of communicating with their constituents&#x2F;subjects is through Twitter, you could morally argue that it <i>should</i> be treated as public square. That one is on the politicians though.')
