Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603641064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886779, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see any investigation of whether IQ can be altered through nurture (which I think it can)<p>IIRC, one thing that we <i>have</i> studied pretty thoroughly, is that IQ — that is, the number IQ tests spit out — goes up when people are under the effects of stimulant drugs during the test. (Even neurotypical people, whose executive functioning is just fine without such drugs.)<p>This is one major reason that IQ is considered a separate thing from the g factor.<p>Essentially, g factor is &quot;trait intelligence&quot;, while IQ is &quot;state intelligence.&quot;<p>While <i>IQ</i> might be altered by nurture&#x2F;environment&#x2F;situation, g factor cannot be, by definition. g factor is supposed to be what you get down to when you remove all the state-intelligence confounders. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a more interesting number to study.<p>-----<p>To couch IQ vs. g factor in a cute analogy: think of ability scores in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, vs. savings throws in that same game.<p>g factor is essentially your INT ability score. It&#x27;s defined at character creation, and it&#x27;s effectively static (for regular humans; the only things that alter it in the game are supernatural.)<p>But you don&#x27;t <i>use</i> your INT ability-score directly for anything in the game. Instead, you use your INT <i>modifier</i> — which has your INT ability-score as its <i>base</i> value, but then aggregates on top all other temporary or semi-permanent bonuses&#x2F;maluses from magical effects, equipment, etc.<p>If you do a number of &quot;saving throws vs. INT&quot; at a calibrated difficulty level, and average them together, what you&#x27;ll get is a measure of your character&#x27;s current INT <i>modifier</i>, not their INT <i>ability score</i>. Their IQ, not their g factor.<p>(The analogy is surprisingly even tighter than this: people who go into INT-based classes get a proficiency bonus on their INT modifier, somewhat like people who do lateral-thinking puzzles all day get a proficiency bonus on IQ tests. And there are situational modifiers to difficulty, just like there are confounders in the questions to an IQ test.)')
