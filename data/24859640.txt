I&#x27;m a pretty fit guy in my mid 30&#x27;s, so I wasn&#x27;t really happy with that number. I started working on trying to improve my breathing a bit, and after a couple months it&#x27;s now sitting around 58 or so.<p>I mostly just tried to breathe through my nose as much as possible, with a lesser focus on breathing slower. At first it was difficult because it always felt like my nose was stuffy and hard to breathe through, but there are some techniques to clear it temporarily [0]. And over time my nasal passages became clearer to where I very rarely have trouble breathing through my nose.<p>Of course I don&#x27;t know for sure if that was actually what brought my heart rate down, but the timeline fits pretty well. Plus I figure the cost and risks of just trying to improve your breathing are pretty much nil, so it&#x27;s worth a shot.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mBqGS-vEIs0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mBqGS-vEIs0</a>')
