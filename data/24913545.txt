I used to destroy one or two pans a year by turning on the wrong burner, but it&#x27;s now been about a year and a half and I haven&#x27;t screwed it up yet.<p>The knobs are labeled with a terrible little glyph meant to indicate which is which, and I&#x27;ve supplemented this with plain-english Brady labels &quot;front left&quot;, &quot;front right&quot;, etc. Now I speak the words above the knob, and point to the burner. It felt goofy at first, but now it feels normal, and like I&#x27;m tempting fate if I skip it.')
