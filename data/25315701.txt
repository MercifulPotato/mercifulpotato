At least I couldn’t find one. I’m obviously lacking in understanding the massive difficulties such a project would likely face. But it sure would be very nice to be able to replace my TVs firmware with something open source. I don’t want a dongle or extra box or extra remote. There’s a perfectly good computer in my TV. And all the Roku’s or FireTVs are rubbish and intend to invade your privacy just the same.')
