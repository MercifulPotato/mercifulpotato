Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[25002118], score=None, time=1604607110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001147, text='&gt; Presumably you wouldn&#x27;t argue that because there are zero bystander injuries or fatalities that it is actually perfectly safe (for bystanders), right?<p>of course not. let me explain my perspective in a bit more detail.<p>first of all, these people are all experienced drivers in very capable, well-maintained vehicles. they have a network of scouts to help them avoid police and traffic. even if individual drivers don&#x27;t care much about safety, there is a strong incentive to route around traffic because of how much time it costs. any sort of speed competition on public roads is inherently reckless, but I would honestly doubt if it&#x27;s much riskier per mile than my morning commute on I-95.<p>second, and if nothing else, it&#x27;s cool to see what is essentially the state of the art when it comes to evading law enforcement. it&#x27;s hard to get an honest test of this stuff without deliberately breaking the rules, and I&#x27;m glad someone is out there doing it so I can watch and learn safely from home. anyone thumbing their nose at the cops like this is going to get at least a little respect from me.<p>finally, there just aren&#x27;t that many people doing this. hard to say for sure but I&#x27;d guess the number of attempts per year is somewhere in the low to mid tens. it&#x27;s sort of like complaining about the fuel efficiency on a new bugatti. you&#x27;re not necessarily wrong, but they&#x27;re only going to make 200 of them. who cares?')
