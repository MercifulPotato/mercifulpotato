Perhaps it&#x27;s possible to configure Docker so that it is very secure, but even Google has had people break out of their containers, so these claims about container security should probably come with a disclaimer: &quot;Docker is very secure as long as you are one of the top 0.1% in the field and never mess up&quot;. VMs seem to still be the proper tool for securely isolating processes, and should perhaps be the recommendation for the other 99.9%.<p>A few comments on how insecure the typical Docker recommendations are:<p>&gt; Sandboxed - security claims about Docker have always been controversial. Simple Unix&#x2F;BSD constructs like chroot&#x2F;jails are far simpler and they are reliable<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25547629" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25547629</a><p>&gt; However, I donâ€™t agree with using it for sandboxing for security. Especially if you are giving it access to the X11 socket, as the author does in the examples. It might not be obvious, but the app will have access to all your other open windows.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25547551" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25547551</a><p>&gt; Fun fact, most docker hosts will allow access to all your files anyway! (specially true on docker for mac, which all the cool kids(tm) here are using). Even if you restrict container host-FS access to a source repo dir, mind rogue code changing your .git hook scripts in there or you might run code outside of the container when committing ;)\n&gt; Another slightly relevant fun fact, USB is a bus. That means that any device can listen in on any other device. And USB access is given by default to some X-enabled docker (--tty something), and to most virtualbox machines (including the hidden one running the fake docker linux host on docker-for-mac), and more recently Google-Chrome. ;)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25547833" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25547833</a>')
