To be &quot;uncensorable&quot;, you need to change clients to use something other than DNS to resolve names.<p>Anyway, the property you usually want to abandon for global names is &quot;human-meaningful&quot;. Just use key hashes as names. &quot;Human-meaningful&quot; strings should be reserved for local nicknames, for the simple reason that the same string will often have different meanings to different humans, for reasons predating your system and entirely outside of its control. You have no way to guarantee that what you list as &quot;Sci-Hub&quot; is actually what the user thinks she&#x27;s looking for as &quot;Sci-Hub&quot;, and you have even less certainty of that for any less famous name.')
