Software Engineer, living in Boston mostly. I have always paid for the top tier health insurance benefits in my jobs. I have to say the experience in the US is waiting long for everything regardless and the User Experience :P is terrible. I spend so much time on calls clearing up confusions like who I owe money too, who replaces some health equipment I need, and etc. Privatizing seems to make for too much economic specialization that ends up meaning no vertical integration and thus a disjoint customer experience.')
