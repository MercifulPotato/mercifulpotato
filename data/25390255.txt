It combines the challenge of supporting a huge landscape of differing hardware devices with that of supporting a huge landscape of differing network environments. There&#x27;s a near-infinite combination of corner cases that can cause problems and handling them poorly creates the impression of severe instability for the users who experience them. The nature of video conferencing&#x2F;collaboration software means if 1 user&#x27;s environment makes the experience unusable, the value for everyone who needs to collaborate with them is also seriously hampered.<p>That said, when we started dogfooding our own conferencing product it was partly because Slack consistently had issues dropping calls after 5-10m of group video. I&#x27;m kind of surprised to read such similar complaints 18 months+ on. Presumably it&#x27;s harder to solve those problems at mass market global scales, we&#x27;re pretty vertical specific.')
