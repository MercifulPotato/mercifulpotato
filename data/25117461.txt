Even if, to take it to the extreme, it kills people and they <i>knew</i> it would kill people and still sold it, they still can&#x27;t be found liable in any way.<p>Other comments are correctly pointing out some corollaries of this, such as trials proceeding very quickly and trial phases being run almost in parallel; but the root cause all of this can happen is the legal immunity for the consequences.')
