However donors do not take a holistic view of the needs of a society and are very influenced by what visible to them, their opinions &amp; prejudices, etc... For example rich people donate billions to Harvard University, which already has an endowment of over $40 billion, which benefits almost nobody. That&#x27;s arguably not a great use of charity donations where there are other more pressing needs, also in education, which would be much more efficient uses of that money.<p>The wealthy also often think that they are best placed to solve problems that they have zero experience with, based on being successful in a completely different field. Typically this leads to failure or inefficient and suboptimal results.<p>Governments are not perfect, nowhere close, but in terms of taking a holistic view of the needs of society and applying funds where needed, they are generally much better than assigning that function to a financial elite, especially if that government is a social democracy.')
