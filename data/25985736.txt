For example, if you already have a worker thread pool executing some blocking code.<p>I am guessing it will automatically look for static occurrences of park(), wait(), etc anything that goes into a blocked state and yields to the next handler on the event queue?<p>Even with the coroutine support, it doesn&#x27;t seem smart enough to make something like &quot;while (true) { ... }&quot; auto-yield to other functions or handlers on the event queue. To be fair, it&#x27;s not like javascript does this for you either.')
