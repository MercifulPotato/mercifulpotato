I have a stainless steel liquid measuring cup, originally my mom&#x27;s, from Sweden. Probably dates to the 1960s if not older. It&#x27;s graduated in ml and pints. But its pints are a few ounces larger than US pints. I wonder if it&#x27;s some other pint scale? I have always just assumed that they got the conversion factor wrong.<p>Edit: after reading your link, it appears to me that it is graduated in imperial pints, not US pints.')
