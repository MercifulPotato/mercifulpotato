Item(by='moate', descendants=None, kids=[25751377], score=None, time=1610476038, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25750996, text='1- Your first sentence implies you stopped being apathetic, which seems to run contrary to your implied point.\n2- &quot;if you don&#x27;t want to get this or spread it...&quot; that&#x27;s fine, except untrue. If joe super-spreader is running around super-spreading, he&#x27;s going to get kids. If you think kids suddenly stopped being high-spreading vectors, I don&#x27;t think you understand children. People are stuck making tough choices (especially in the US) because they have little financial support in order to make spread-minimizing decisions. Blaming anyone who gets sick on stupidity isn&#x27;t fair. A lot of people are being forced to make choices between going to a job that encourages spreading behavior or going into financial ruin.<p>That said, a vast majority of spread is due to very stupid (or just plain reckless) people making decisions for their community.')
