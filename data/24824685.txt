This is just a typical example of selection bias. Of course the old IKEA furniture that still is around is of better quality than those that aren’t. They sold cardboard furniture 30 years ago too, it’s just that most of it isn’t around anymore, and the thirty year old furniture that still is around is the pieces that are of better quality.')
