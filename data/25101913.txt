You might have to port your software to obscure platforms with bad C++ compilers where compiler bugs are not uncommon at all, so it&#x27;s better to stay clear of more advanced features. Also, you might have a legacy system which does not have modern C++ compilers, so you might have to restrict yourself to C++03. Another thing is code size, so templates should be used judiciously.')
