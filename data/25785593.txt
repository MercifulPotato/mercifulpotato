A small script is executed which results in my Alexa devices announcing that someone is at the door.<p>All the modifications &#x2F; additional hardware fit inside the existing chime housing.  It&#x27;s been quite fun learning about electronics (For example, the chime is powered by 16v AC, but the microprocessor requires 5V DC) and writing the software for it (while admittedly is very simple) was challenging as I&#x27;m not familiar with C++.')
