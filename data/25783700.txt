So a router-capable Clusterboard seems like it&#x27;d just be a matter of adding more ports (be it by using the same switch chipset and swapping SOPINEs for ports or by using a different chipset with support for more than 8 ports - assuming that the chip in question is indeed limited to 8 ports).<p>Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to find any detailed info on the Clusterboard components&#x2F;schematics on their wiki, so I don&#x27;t know what more it&#x27;d entail.')
