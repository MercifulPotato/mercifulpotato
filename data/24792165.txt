In fact we become such apt apologists that it must be painful for anyone else to read the reactions to criticism.<p>You&#x27;ve articulated well the rationalisation I always see in these threads and among my developer friends who use Apple stuff. Apple pushes out an incredibly buggy release, or pursues a horrible policy like this, the users vociferously complain, but nothing much changes, and users can&#x27;t do anything since Apple locks down the entire stack so much. You have so little control over your own devices, it&#x27;s the opposite of empowerment. But the complaining users keep buying the new stuff anyway. It&#x27;s like an abusive relationship.')
