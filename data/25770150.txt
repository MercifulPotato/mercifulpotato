There is a limit and IIRC you lose what you don&#x27;t spend. It&#x27;s good if you have predictable costs, or you&#x27;re saving to do an expensive procedure (friends have done this for lasik), etc. You pay the bill then submit a receipt to get reimbursed out of the account.<p>In the US these are now termed Flexible Spending Accounts, with subcategories of Health, Dependent Care, etc.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flexible_spending_account" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flexible_spending_account</a><p>It helps, but certainly a different attitude towards social safety nets, defense spending, etc would make a larger difference.')
