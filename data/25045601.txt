It&#x27;s somewhat wonky on Windows to begin with (we have found plenty of games where it&#x27;s broken on Windows), and then you have to factor in that X doesn&#x27;t work the same way, and there are a hundred different window managers, which all work different ways. It should be significantly improved in 5.13, and we&#x27;re still working on improvements in that area, including in upcoming 5.13 releases.')
