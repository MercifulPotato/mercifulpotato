Linux?<p>Introducing non-portable ways of doing things that were previously portable to non-Linux OSs, yes. It&#x27;s certainly a minor point since if anything some of those changes <i>increased</i> portability <i>within</i> the Linux ecosystem, but I can sorta see &quot;introducing Linuxisms in areas that previously weren&#x27;t Linux-specific&quot; (ex. `service foo start` did the same thing on RHEL and FreeBSD; `systemctl start foo` isn&#x27;t going to be a thing on any BSD).')
