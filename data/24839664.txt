Within $10&#x2F;20, of course I&#x27;ll go for the better drive. When it&#x27;s $50&#x2F;60 or more, I get the Seagate and hope I&#x27;m lucky.<p>Earlier this year I had a Seagate fail within months of purchase, putting my NAS into degraded performance mode. So I quickly ordered a replacement drive (a WD Red) and started the RMA process for the Seagate. At some point during this process I removed and reinserted the Seagate, and... its been fine since. So now I have a WD cold spare in my closet for whichever drive fails next.')
