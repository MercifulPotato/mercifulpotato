There is also Tableau and other products like it. Most of these tools have a free version, as well. They take some learning, but it is well worth it. Of course, taking that same amount of time to actually learn how Excel works is worth the time, too. I guess the issue is that Excel is just too &quot;easy&quot; to use, and hence people using it for years and years and not actually knowing how to use it.<p>I am not trying to be an elitist about this. It is just that the misuse of Excel (because people do not know how to use it) causes massive issues on a daily basis.')
