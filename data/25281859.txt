Item(by='SoSoRoCoCo', descendants=None, kids=[25285020], score=None, time=1606944377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25281769, text='&gt; found not cancerous in the vast majority of studies<p>I just spent 30 minutes googling and found the opposite, with CDC, WHO, EPA and EU all in disagreement with one another! Forbes, NYT, and several other sites indicate increases in leukemia, other new evidence, and even a $10B settlement by Bayer (Monsanto&#x27;s owner) that will keep evidence sealed.<p>IMO, this is clearly not settled.<p>So I choose to make a rational decision to NOT to spray RoundUp on my lawn, and to try, to the best of my ability, to avoid purchasing products exposed to it. Hence, I would like a warning label. But if cannot avoid it due to opaque laws, then bummer.')
