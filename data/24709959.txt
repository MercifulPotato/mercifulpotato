I love that the country where it is manufactured is listed as well.<p>One thing I have a concern about: is the country of origin related to the specific product or the company itself?\nAn example is the KitchenAid refrigerator. I think KitchenAid does make a lot of things in the US, like their mixers, but the refrigerator listed (according to other websites) is made in Mexico. This might be a little confusing as the listing makes it look like the fridge is made in the US.<p>Also the &quot;made in&quot; drop down specifically keeps the fridge in the list when set to &quot;US&quot;.')
