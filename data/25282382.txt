I haven&#x27;t touched urbit in a long time but learning the language (hoon) and trying to do something with it was a delightful experience. After learning some number of programming languages it&#x27;s hard to find something new, where you feel like you are exploring something. Most of them are just a simple mapping of concepts that you already know (yes, ultimately it&#x27;s a mapping too but it seems to have more layers).<p>I don&#x27;t know what secret of the universe do you expect to find there. If it would be highly practical technology or pareto optimal to anything else that&#x27;s popular, it wouldn&#x27;t be obscure.<p>If you did a deep dive and regret spending time, for things like these I suggest not going deep if you are not enjoying the dive. Life&#x27;s too short for things you don&#x27;t enjoy when you have your basic needs covered.<p>Also, while I enjoyed talking with Curtis I think it&#x27;s important to be able to separate great things that people create from those people themselves.
