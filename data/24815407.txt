I have an old Mac where Steam isn&#x27;t officially supported anymore, but I can still run all the games that I installed on it. The Steam client simply stopped updating and the last version that worked still works fine. Put the Steam client in offline mode and it works.<p>Or you mean Valve shutting down Steam? Then yes, it could be a problem for some games that use Steam servers for online multiplayer. But, Steam is Valve&#x27;s core business with proven track record and many loyal customers. It&#x27;s much more likely that Stadia would shut down then Steam going away.')
