Ideally, words that are more important will naturally appear more often -- a &quot;natural&quot; anki with little overhead.<p>But many things are list-like, or maybe just don&#x27;t stick in your mind via reading, or need to be memorized quickly, or are better memorized in a digital&#x2F;artificial context, or can only be memorized &quot;naturally&quot; at a high cost (just theorizing here). In this cause Anki is worth the overhead.<p>If anki were cost free (every interesting thought I heard in a podcast were automatically added to the deck), I&#x27;d use it store everything I didn&#x27;t want to forget.')
