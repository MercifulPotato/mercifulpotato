It was never slow or inefficient compared to other scripting languages, it didn&#x27;t lack functionality.<p>Over the decades the most popular complaints have been addressed as the language has matured.<p>That it&#x27;s remained in active development for 25 years with no signs of that changing in the future is one of it&#x27;s biggest selling points.<p>I don&#x27;t blame people for having issues with aspects of PHP based on their personal preferences and experiences, I get that, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a &#x27;bad&#x27; language.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with purist perspectives on what programming languages should be and how they should work. That contributes to better design.<p>But in the real world the questions are simpler: can this tool be used to develop applications quickly? Is it reasonably efficient at runtime (in this case in the context of scripting)? Can we easily find affordable developers in the future? Is there community support?<p>PHP checks the boxes that people building things want checked as well as any language and better than many. Unless I&#x27;m missing something, &#x27;bad&#x27; here is more of a philosophical stance.')
