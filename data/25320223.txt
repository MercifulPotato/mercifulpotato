I had previously deleted all messages over 500KB in size. Still several millions of messages left (all from 2014 to 2018.) Don&#x27;t even know how to count them, because Gmail counts only conversations. Maybe it can be done via IMAP or the API, but I&#x27;d expect hitting limits on the way, so I did not spend any time trying.<p>The irony is that Gmail cannot delete more than a couple of thousand messages from Trash&#x2F;The Bin in one go. It says &quot;All messages deleted&quot;, but when you refresh you see that it&#x27;s not true. You need iterations. I guess they are using something what AWS calls a lambda to empty the bin (don&#x27;t recall the Google term) and that job hits a limit.<p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t use that mailbox for anything serious at the moment. Just an experiment...')
