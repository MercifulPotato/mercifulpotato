Item(by='betwixthewires', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602570994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755345, text='&gt;Your free speech protections are only protected _from_ the _government_.<p>This is a common argument but it is simply not true. Someone cannot tape your mouth shut because they aren&#x27;t the government. The government (at least the US government) is saddled with the responsibility to protect your rights, even from other entities. I cannot search your house just because I&#x27;m not a cop. What good is a government if it only protects your rights from being infringed by itself?<p>With regard to the particular topic being discussed, that is, a private entity moderating speech on its own property, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marsh_v._Alabama" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marsh_v._Alabama</a> is very directly applicable, and more specific to the situation itself. The only sticking point to be hashed out might be &quot;terms of service&quot; which might constitute a private agreement and this precedent may not directly apply. Of course we shall see, because I&#x27;m willing to bet these cases will be brought to court within the next 5 years.')
