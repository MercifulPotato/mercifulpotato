The malicious binary was signed, you can&#x27;t do that with just FTP upload access. The code looks to be injected at build time according to this report by reversing labs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.reversinglabs.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sunburst-the-next-level-of-stealth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.reversinglabs.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;sunburst-the-next-level-...</a><p>&#x27;Signing occurred within a minute of library compilation. That leaves no time for the attackers to be able to monitor the build system, replace the binary and change the metadata to match this perfectly. The simplest way for all these timestamp artifacts to align perfectly is to have the attackersâ€™ code injected directly into the source, and then have the existing build and signing system perform the compilation and release processes as defined by the Orion software developers.&#x27;')
