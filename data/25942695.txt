Many developers breath of knowledge extends only to that they have experience with personally. Maybe they joined the project because they want to learn something which you can only do by diving in, making mistakes, and learning as you gain experience.

Once you open something up to contributors, it becomes everyone&#x27;s responsibility to learn how to work together effectively and productively and changes should be discussed and adopted based on what is best for everyone. I am certain it would be possible to establish mentorship and technical review committees that can both ensure the quality of the end product and encourage growth in the particular specialty area the project addresses.')
