Some were cracked open, or were so compromised they could be snapped apart by hand; some survived, but there were only ashes and melted metal at the bottom.  I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t hear about the successes, only the failures, but still...<p>I don&#x27;t want people to proceed with the notion that those safes are actually fire-proof.
