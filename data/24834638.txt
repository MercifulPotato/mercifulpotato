So far I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones: a good biologic (Entyvio) + partial or exclusive  enteral nutrition (EEN) got me to manageable. But I have a habit of trawling the scientific literature and eventually discovered <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gastrojournal.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0016-5085(19)39702-1&#x2F;abstract" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gastrojournal.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;S0016-5085(19)39702-1&#x2F;...</a> (Tu1716 – Highly Bioavailable Curcumin (Theracurmin®) for Crohn&#x27;s Disease: Randomized, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial). I bought the Theracurmin product on Amazon and I feel like it was a game-changer and pushed me over the edge into deep remission, altho some foods can aggravate me.<p>I was lucky in that I got sick reasonably into my career, with enough resources and lack of dependents to step back and do nothing but focus on health. I believe that was key to achieving deep remission. But that type of focus doesn&#x27;t necessarily lend itself to career success.<p>It&#x27;s cliche, but you really do need to be your own advocate. &quot;Step therapy&quot; really does mean that you get started on old, less effective drugs first unless you fight it. And particularly in IBD, EEN is rarely used or recommended in the US relative to Europe despite good evidence <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;29398336&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;29398336&#x2F;</a> and clear potential as an additive effect on anyone&#x27;s treatment.<p>PS utilized your devops tools and advice before I got Crohn&#x27;s and it was critical, thanks!')
