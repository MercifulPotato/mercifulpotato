Self-employment is also taxed aggressively.<p>A form of self-employment in Croatia allows a fixed tax payment of about 5k EUR a year with an income cap of 39k EUR per year, leaving you with 34k EUR after taxes. Similar thing in Serbia but even more money.<p>In Austria there&#x27;s nothing like that.<p>It would be nice if it was possible to assign a significant amount of life expenses to business but that also is heavily bureaucratized and regulated that even buying a 5k EUR computing machine has weird tax consequences (not immediately deductible as expense in the full amount).<p>I mean, I guess I&#x27;m just miserably following every word of law and my accountant&#x27;s advice and maybe other people just ignore a bunch of these guidelines and hope that inspection never comes.')
