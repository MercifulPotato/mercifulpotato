Though this sentiment does seem to become more rigid toward the core of the crypto community, a huge swath of other investors are playing price action. There are tons of technical traders in crypto, and they tend to care much more about MA deviations, gaps, pennants, and candlestick forms than what&#x27;s going to replace USD.<p>You can also think of it as a play by (people who don&#x27;t have as many concerns about the dollar) off the fears of (people who are afraid about the future of the dollar).<p>IMO there is a lot of room in a speculative ecosystem for non-value, non-traditional-economics, and even hugely irrational viewpoints. They can all meet with success by using their own sets of strategies.')
