Powerful GUI software for specialised tasks is often\noverloaded with buttons and toolbars everywhere because the user\nneeds to be able to click them. The terminal is the complete\nopposite, instead of clicking through menus to find the right\noption(or use a ton of keyboard shortcuts) you have to know what\nto type. But it&#x27;s also very efficient and flexible, and in\nexchange for more difficult discoverability of features it\ncircumvents menus completely.')
