The problem is, the administrators don&#x27;t know me.  I&#x27;ve got lots of preferences; they don&#x27;t know any of them.  They don&#x27;t know what kind of chocolate truffles I like, or what kind of pizza, or what kind of shoes.  They may get me food, and shoes, but my preferences are much more detailed than that.<p>The economy is something like a fractal.  We have food, clothes, shelter, and medical.  We all need that.  But in food, we have fruit, vegetables, meat, grains, and candy.  Even if they get all of that right... how are the planners supposed to know how many people want Life Savers instead of M&amp;Ms?<p>So they&#x27;re likely to choose an objective function that is not what individuals would choose for themselves.  How are they supposed to gather the data that tells them that they made too many M&amp;Ms and not enough Life Savers?  How do they collect data at that level of detail and put it into their objective function?')
