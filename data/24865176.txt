If you wanted to travel by car with a few others to visit someone in another city ... do you have to take your small electric car with luggage to the city boundary, and then switch to a different car that can go on the highway (and has a greater range)? When you arrive at the destination city, do you then again switch vehicles to another small city car? So one trip needs 3 vehicles? Would the city boundary then have to be host to a giant concentration of garages where people keep their city-car until they return? Would people own the highway-capable cars, but be obliged to store them possibly very far away from their homes? Or in this story are the highway-capable cars almost all rentals?')
