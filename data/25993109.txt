We&#x27;re also eating our competition&#x27;s lunch in streaming ads, it&#x27;s amazing. Clients hand us their video ads (and a budget) and we figure out what shows to put it on, and put it on those shows. Our tech goes into the data analytics and integrations with the rest of the industry&#x27;s tech (or lack thereof). IMO the real selling point for potential employees is the culture.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a lot of positions, but mostly front-end engineers (nodejs+react+graphql) and data scientists &#x2F; data analysts. We can also find a place for exceptional candidates.<p>If you&#x27;re one the rare non-tech folks browsing this thread, we&#x27;re also looking for more client service ppl, marketers, and media buyers (like literally buy ads on shows). Check it out!<p>Tech stack is AWS (terraform managed), react front-end, python (Flask) backend, and a Pandas &#x2F; SQL data pipeline.<p>Culturally, this is hands-down the best place I&#x27;ve ever worked. We have a weekly company-wide (~100ppl) &quot;standup&quot; that&#x27;s actually effective and something I look forward to, everyone is competent or better, and even having the firehose job (solutions engineering) there&#x27;s no stress. It&#x27;s just nice here.')
