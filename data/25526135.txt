From experience, it&#x27;s a lot easier to move on with a clean break. And it&#x27;s a lot easier to date someone who has moved on with a clean break too.<p>A good alternate question to ask is why the relationship failed. If they accept responsibility for at least some of the issues, green flag. Otherwise, you can bet they accept no responsibility in other aspects of their life.')
