Maybe it reads condescending to me because I don&#x27;t agree with it, but I believe it could have been phrased in a less adversarial way:<p>«Haskell does not scale to organizations of 100+ engineers. There is a trade-off between writing and reading code, which Haskell does not fare well in. Also, given the realities of the dev hiring market, steep learning curves would be very detrimental to the success of the company»<p>What would have been your reaction if I had replied &quot;look up the word condescension in the dictionary&quot; to you? It would lead to bad discussion, regardless of whether my point about condescension was right or not.')
