Below us my thoughts given several decades experience As founder-<p>You have a strong position here, since you built the products.  Don’t walk away.  The ultimatum is counting in you being non-confrontational and wanting to cave.<p>This cofounder has betrayed your trust at this point, so some sort of exit is needed.  Non-technical is a lot easier to hire- you can get marketing or whatever expertise he has easily.<p>He should be the one leaving. Maybe offer to buy him out at current equity value paid over 20 years at %6 interest, secured only by company stock.<p>If he forces the issue he will destroy the company in the ensuing lawsuit.  So this is a mutually assured destruction situation.<p>What is the ownership of the software? Did you retain rights to it?  If you are forced out can you recreate the company  quickly using the software you already created?<p>Get a lawyer, now. You need an advocate who is ready to play ball and who can be the “bad guy” for you.<p>Your cofounder will likely try to spin it, try to portray any resistance from you as evidence of bad faith, etc.  Don’t let him.')
