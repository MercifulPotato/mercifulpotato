It times this randomly (often inconveniently) and it isn&#x27;t really connected to what you&#x27;re doing beyond, I believe, knowing not to do it during the middle of a workout, and it&#x27;s very easy to turn off.<p>I&#x27;m going to give the OP the benefit of the doubt and assume describing that as &quot;the companies in California are even telling you when to breathe now!&quot; is facetiousness.')
