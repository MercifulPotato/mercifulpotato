I don&#x27;t really use much social media now. A few forums and stuff, hn, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking into the decentralized social networking options lately. The idea of being sble to make an account that spans multiple social media  types and interconnects to them all seems pretty awesome.<p>Being able to connect with with random people who share interests over multiple platform types, microblogging, macroblogging, facebook style stuff, even music sharing, the funkwhale article was on the front page recently.<p>My problem is, i can&#x27;t really seem to figure out how to join any communities, how to connect to any of the disparate communities i have managed to join to any wider communities or any other accounts i&#x27;ve made or how to really connect to people through it in general.<p>Reading things, it seems pretty straightforward. Pick a platform, pick either a host or host it yourself, make an account and connect with anyone across any platform that can connect to the fediverse.<p>In practice, i can&#x27;t seem to even be able to find a few people on one platform let alone all these supposedly interconnected ones.<p>How does this all work?')
