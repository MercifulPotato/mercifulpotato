Why do the rich choose to work so much? That flies in the face of all logic since they can just kick back and exploit their class, opportunity, etc. Yet they don&#x27;t because the work is fun. Counter to that, why do the poor choose to work less even if there are clear avenues of advancement? In the article you&#x27;ll find some interesting speculation.<p>We need to fix our relationship with work, especially for the sake of those currently unable to do &quot;fun&quot; jobs that pay well. I don&#x27;t think working less or a redistribution scheme via the government is an honest solution.<p>Instead, a much higher minimum wage coupled with retraining and <i>temporary</i> economic assistance that can spur a mass automation of &quot;drudgery&quot;-type jobs is a better answer. This in turn would allow society to redesign work so that it is more humane and more valuable. I also don&#x27;t buy the belief that only some are capable of creative work.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-free-time-paradox-in-america&#x2F;499826&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2016&#x2F;09&#x2F;the-fre...</a>')
