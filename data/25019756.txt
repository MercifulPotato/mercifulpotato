Whether it’s his full page add in the nytimes condemning the Central Park five. His history of evicting people of color. His continual refusal to condemn white supremacy, or “very fine people on both sides”. He’s not a full blown white supremacist, he is willing to work with people of color when it suits him. But the idea that the media is lying about his racist tendencies is a refusal of facts. Which is a core trait of Trump, to refuse facts. That he won in a “landslide” despite losing the  popular vote in 2016, he claimed today to have won the election right when it was called. Trump lies at such a high rate that you appear biased if you always correct him.')
