The first thing that came to mind when seeing the title was &quot;but circular dependencies just mean that your layers are wrong and those should all be in the same layer&quot; and funnily enough that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> what&#x27;s explained in the article!<p>What would be interesting would be to organize modules into named layers--instead of just explicit 1-by-1 module dependencies (i.e. edges). I have not seen a language do that yet.<p>Another interesting thing that I haven&#x27;t seen touched on in more mainstream languages is the idea of bidirectional interfaces. The somewhat DSL-like NesC language had this, primarily driven by the need to write device drivers that serviced interrupts (and events).')
