Express shipping (if available) on Aliexpress is often $100+ for item that cost a few dollars.<p>Also margins are getting squeezed on drop shipping. Several years ago the difference between price on Amazon and Aliexpress was very significant now it&#x27;s often negligible and I just buy on Amazon.')
