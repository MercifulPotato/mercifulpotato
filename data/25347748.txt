It&#x27;s not like video where we still have trade-offs in terms of quality due to the huge bandwidth and processing involved for very high resolutions as well as the difficulty of reproducing very high dynamic ranges and framerates.<p>None of this is relevant for audio. Despite what some audiocultists would have you believe CD quality is basically as good as it gets, you cover effectively 100% of the (normal) human hearing range, both in frequency range and dynamics. Ok, ok, technically not 100% of the dynamics, but few people care to listen to &quot;distant ventilator on a quiet night&quot; followed by &quot;Airbus A380 taking off from the point of view of the jet turbine&quot;.<p>Of course the quality of reproduction matters a lot, playing a CD through cheap $5 earphones is not going to sound great. But even there the cost of decent quality electronics keeps dropping and dropping. You can get a good quality DAC for a trivial amount of money (and stand alone DACs are still usually overpriced because they&#x27;re for the niche&#x2F;enthusiast&#x2F;pro market, everybody else uses whatever their smartphones&#x2F;laptop&#x2F;desktop has integrated).<p>Buying ultra high-end, ultra-expensive &quot;audiophile&quot; equipment these days is effectively like buying mechanical watches. It&#x27;s because you like the luxury and craftsmanship, or you&#x27;re making a fashion statement. Apple knows that, hence these AirPods. If you&#x27;re about function over form you&#x27;d sooner get a cheapo Casio quartz watch.<p>And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, it just annoys me when audiophiles try to justify their fashion statements with pseudo-science.')
