Most first-world judicial systems are predicated on the standard of evidence being &quot;reasonable&quot;. As in &quot;reasonable cause to believe&quot; or &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. We have functioned pretty well with based on &quot;reasonable&quot; and we can apply that same standard here.
