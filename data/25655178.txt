Similarly, COVID-19 was originally named SARS-Cov-2 due to it’s close relationship with SARS-CoV also known as SARS. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;types.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;types.html</a><p>Which is why the vaccine could both be developed so quickly in the first place and we can make reasonable predictions about the vaccine.  They didn’t create a successful vaccine in under a week from scratch without a lot of knowledge of closely related diseases.  It’s that same knowledge which is behind the dosing schedule, and why it was tested like that.<p>&gt; Why does the US need global herd immunity?<p>Ending the vast social and economic harm from social distancing efforts.  With local herd immunity things go back to normal even if the rest of the world is dealing with the disease.<p>PS: The demographics of the developing world even support a staggered approach.  First a focus on vaccinations for the elderly and medical workers globally then local herd immunity based on population demographics.  Local herd immunity protects those who the vaccine can’t, but evenly spreading out vaccinations to the younger population accomplishes little.')
