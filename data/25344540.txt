Item(by='croon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607432609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344359, text='&gt; Insurance is an old and established business, many learnings already exists. The industry presumably is quite good at estimating and pricing risks.<p>This discussion is going circular. The &quot;estimating and pricing risks&quot; IS the premium. Which is all anyone in this thread has been saying.<p>I agree that insurance is cheap for the piece of mind. Which is why I have all kinds of insurance. Still most people get nothing out of an insurance, and some people get more than they&#x27;ve paid.<p>I&#x27;ll try to summarize it in another way:<p>For regular insurance, what is paid in by buyers is X. And what is paid out is X - premiums (overhead, risks, estimates, etc etc etc). That is much less than 100%.<p>In the case of the shipping scenario, ~100% of what is paid in, is paid out to affected parties.<p>That seems pretty effective, albeit all participants now own the risk, but save on all other premiums.<p>If you think there&#x27;s a better way, I&#x27;m sure you can take a smaller premium than the alternatives and make a lot of money.')
