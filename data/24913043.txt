(Y&#x2F;N)&quot;<p>Cattle, people. Not pets. Just make sure you don&#x27;t hit all machines simultaneously and are rolling, instead.<p>Since the post is talking about automation anyway, assume that any machine that can go down will go down. Ensure that any such disruption will be minimal. Oops, you just killed the production database? Whatever, who cares, it has just failed over anyway (or, for a distributed one, a new node was elected, data started replicating, etc).<p>If one considers having to SSH to a machine to be an anti-pattern, it&#x27;s amazing how much crap goes away.<p>In the more generalized case, where it&#x27;s not about machines, then it makes more sense. Maybe you are running a query that&#x27;s going to perform updates across multiple clusters. It <i>still</i> should not be done by hand with direct production access - unless you are in the middle of a declared (and urgent!) incident and everything is on fire. In which case there&#x27;s a bunch of people watching over your shoulder (or more likely, screen sharing in a conference call).<p>The same job you have (hopefully) run in QA you should be able to re-target to production. Make the question just be a way to &quot;unlock&quot; your automation - for instance, by not copying credentials or environment information until the proper confirmation has been received. One should still have an escape hatch for when (not IF) things go wrong.')
