You can tweak the request to enter any other email address to discover those details about them.<p>Then there&#x27;s the social networks. They do mitigate how easy it is to bulk upload contacts and correlate email addresses (or phone numbers) to profiles, but it&#x27;s certainly not impossible- and people who are making it their business to data mine will exploit all these kinds of &#x27;opportunities&#x27;.')
