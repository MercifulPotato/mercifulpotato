This is about the First Amendment. Section 230, by allowing moderation that isn&#x27;t 100% perfect, certainly does encourage forums to be much more tolerant towards speech since only those who make the speech will be liable. But if Section 230 didn&#x27;t exist, it wouldn&#x27;t stop bans one single bit and in fact would only encourage vastly more stringent moderation and banning (assuming <i>any</i> unvetted user created content continued to be allowed at all on the general web).<p>&gt;<i>Consider this precedent :</i><p>Look, particularly with 1A SCOTUS has made many changes over the years and EXCLUSIVELY in the direction of more, not less. So if you&#x27;re going to cite very old case law you really, really need to double check to what extent it&#x27;s been superseded since. In this particular case the cite is in fact done for you, because if you&#x27;d actually read all the way to the bottom of <i>the very Wikipedia</i>[1] piece you cited you&#x27;d have noticed that it already has dealt with this:<p>&gt;<i>In </i>Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner<i>, the Supreme Court distinguished a private shopping mall from the company town in </i>Marsh v. Alabama* and held that the mall had not been sufficiently dedicated to public use for First Amendment free speech rights to apply within it.<p>&gt;<i>Recently the case has been highlighted as a potential precedent to treat online communication media like Facebook as a public space to prevent it from censoring speech. However, in </i>Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck* the Supreme Court found that private companies only count as state actors for first amendment purposes if they exercise â€œpowers traditionally exclusive to the state.&quot;*<p>SCOTUS, particularly the current one, isn&#x27;t going to eliminate the general 1A rights of organizations despite the authoritarian fever dreams of many.<p>----<p>1: Incidentally, the end of 230 would mean that Wikipedia-the-organization would be directly liable for everything users contributed which would result in <i>certain changes</i>, the exact nature of which will be left as an exercise to the reader.')
