That said, 10 minutes seems like a long time for a simple api unless you are using a lot of procedural macros or something.<p>Regarding safety, rust&#x27;s lifetime system protects you against more than just preventing the invalid memory accesses, which GC languages also do. But several classes of race conditions that are easy to introduce in almost any other multi-threaded language are impossible in rust&#x27;s type system (unless there is incorrect unsafe code). And in a web app with high levels of concurrency, that is kind of important.')
