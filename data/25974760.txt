I&#x27;m a neuroscience grad student and would like to do research on psychedelics in the future, therefore this article was an interesting read otherwise. Coincidentally I also suffer from a state of depression, and have been for years. Mostly I can do fine but some times I can&#x27;t even get out of bed until the evening, and on many nights I wasn&#x27;t convinced I&#x27;d live to see the next day.<p>The way the sentence above is presented, to me, feels like people suffer from depression just as a result of thinking &quot;wrong&quot;. I&#x27;m sure your judgement is clouded by such a serious mental condition in some ways. But in others, I like to think that I with my depressive POV might have more realistic view points on some things than an unaffected person. I would hate to not even have this one tiny little advantage from all this, and that in fact I&#x27;m not &quot;sadder but wiser&quot; [than some]. Am I wrong?')
