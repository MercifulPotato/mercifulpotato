(Which is a really fun techno-thriller novel that explores what happens when ransomeware locks up some very bad people&#x27;s computers.)<p>Cryptonomicon is a fantastic fictionalization of Alan Turing and breaking the enigma code combined with a cool story about what encryption can do in the future.<p>Snowcrash is probably his most famous and is very cyberpunk and awesome. (Not my favorite of his though.)')
