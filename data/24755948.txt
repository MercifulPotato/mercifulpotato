Free-speech is widely understood to exclude threats and harassment, but even if it were only a niche definition used by free-speech proponents the pro-cancel-culture argument would <i>still</i> be nonsense because it claims that the pro-free-speech argument is inconsistent and self-refuting <i>based on a definition of &#x27;free-speech&#x27; that includes threats and harassment</i>. Anyone who makes this argument plainly doesn&#x27;t understand the free-speech argument.')
