Then you have to use this ratings data to somehow discover how quickly to increase the difficulty of puzzles presented to the player (for example, perhaps select one with a 0.8 prob of success every time).<p>Actually, thinking about it some more, a player&#x27;s rating should increase over time as they learn, while a puzzle&#x27;s (true, latent) rating should be fixed, so you should allow for that.<p>Edit: love the game though, nice one!')
