But seem to be far less... cloudy then common law systems.<p>Most contradictions in civil law seem to either be from really old law (think, pre french revolution&#x2F;napoleonic period) or from weird edge cases which get covered by two laws which contradict themselves.<p>The first one is usually not resolved because it is just straight up ignored. There was a famous example of this a couple of years ago about a law which prohibited people from carrying swords&#x2F;knives inside city walls.')
