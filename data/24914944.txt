Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603856928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914185, text='&gt; There are already open source versions for synthesis and PnR , and while functional they are very far off the &#x27;terrible&#x27; EDA tools everyone rags on Xilinx for.<p>These &quot;tools&quot; have no target so no incentive to improve.  To use them you have to basically push their results back into a Cadence&#x2F;Synopsys&#x2F;Mentor toolchain <i>anyway</i>, so you might as well stick to the supported toolchain.<p>&gt; The reality is SystemVerilog is a huge language, and already an open standard yet no open source project supports it fully<p>Most <i>commercial</i> systems don&#x27;t support it fully.  And its not clear that SystemVerilog is that superior to VHDL.  And, for quite a while, SystemVerilog <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> open and had some fairly obnoxious patents surrounding it.  I don&#x27;t know when&#x2F;if that has changed as I have been out of semiconductors for about 20 years now.<p>Icarus Verilog has been slowly supporting features from SystemVerilog but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of manpower.<p>In general, the consolidation of the semiconductor industry and EDA has hurt open-source EDA improvements.  There&#x27;s not very much money coming from companies to fund EDA research.  EDA startups can&#x27;t really get venture funding since VC&#x27;s all want to fund the next pile of viral social trashware.  And anyone with good software skills left the semiconductor industry <i>eons</i> ago because the pay differential is ridiculous.')
