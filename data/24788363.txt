Then I realize the evolution of gaming has come a long way.&quot;<p>That may be true for you, but I&#x27;ve played through games like Quake 1, SMB3, and Super Mario Land II this year. I love retro games and enjoy them more as an adult than when I was a kid. Plenty of us play retro games legitimately and not just as a 5 minute nostalgia hit.
