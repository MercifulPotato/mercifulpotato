Beyond the work, there is no loyalty nor should there be any expectation of one from either side.<p>The company&#x27;s purpose is to make money for its stakeholders. If you are a hinderance to that purpose, then you&#x27;ll be cut. The company won&#x27;t proactively look for another position for you no matter how many years of experience you have with them or how you stuck up for them to disgruntled workers. They don&#x27;t hear or care about that. If you can&#x27;t bring them profit, then you are gone.<p>Of course, there will be individuals who stick up for you or find a position for you at the company, but that is a human being and not an abstract entity (aka the company).')
