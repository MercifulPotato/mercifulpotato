Too much of academia is built on the deep assumption that LaTeX is the only possible format that people write documents in.<p>I think one possible way out is to start a new from-scratch TeX engine that is built in such a way that a new typesetting language (or &quot;front end&quot; if you like) can be added to it. This may lead to some reasonable slow migration strategies.')
