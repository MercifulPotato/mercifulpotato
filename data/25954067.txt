Some firms continued to allow trading of GME, and a few firms including Robinhood did not.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear that Robinhood did anything illegal, but it seems clear from their lack of transparency and Enterprise BS tactics that they aren&#x27;t going to lay out a clear reason as to why they halted longs and other firms did not. Probably because it paints Robinhood in a bad light.<p>All this does is continue to expose Robinhood for what it is: A budget brokerage firm with a shitty product. Avoid if you want to maximize your profits.')
