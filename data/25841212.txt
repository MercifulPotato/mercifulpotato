(What&#x27;s further down is irrelevant for zoom meetings) But it does help. I have a set of slightly more respectable work t-shirts and a very different set of home shirts. And it does change my mind set. And it is very nice to take it off at the end of the day.<p>Also my kids whom are stuck at home at the moment recognise the difference and &quot;somewhat&quot; tries to disturb me less if I got a work shirt on.')
