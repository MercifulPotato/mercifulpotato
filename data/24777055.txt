The best ones I&#x27;ve had seemed genuine, and led in their own way. The ones that tried to act like males usually fed into the &quot;confident women are bitches&quot; stereotype because everyone could tell that they were insecure about being in charge, and tried to overcompensate by trying to emulate super aggressive alpha-male types. Males make the same mistake, but it feels like they get an opportunity to correct their behavior, whereas females don&#x27;t get another chance once they are painted as &quot;that bitch boss&quot;.')
