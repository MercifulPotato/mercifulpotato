Many years ago, I had an idea for some software, so I left my job and worked on it. (My wife was understanding and supportive.) I did not have a business idea, I had a technical idea. I worked with a &quot;business guy&quot;, who turned out to be worthless. Every time I had to leave my desk, where I was having a blast programming, my stomach knotted. I just could not stand any activity related to marketing&#x2F;selling.<p>I was finally acquhired (to use a term invented later) by a local startup that needed what I was doing, for a signing bonus, decent salary, and a big chunk of equity. (This was in the late 80s. My &quot;plan&quot;, such as it was, would not work now, because software is basically given away.)<p>I guess the lesson is this: know your limitations, and work around them. If you hate doing X, then don&#x27;t force yourself to do X, because you will suck at it compared to the many people who love doing X. And you will be miserable. Find a situation where you can do what you enjoy, and are good at, and somebody else does X.')
