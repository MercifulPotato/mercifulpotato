It went from semi-incompetent central command to completely incompetent private cronies with baked in government support in the form of contracts, outright thuggery, and geopolitical might. Sure they got cleaner pricing signals, but they lost everything that made them competitive. At this point, most of the privatized industry that remains is largely rent seeking (telecom et all), resource extraction, and the military industrial complex.<p>The argument is that what the USSR experienced is an accelerated version of what we&#x27;re seeing in the US, since it didn&#x27;t have the other social institutions to make the transition. The free market didn&#x27;t win, it just paused its ambitions to cannibalize the only competition before continuing on the same destructive path that the USSR economy speed ran in the 80s.')
