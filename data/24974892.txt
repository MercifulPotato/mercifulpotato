Which isn&#x27;t much lower than this (especially considering those offered more CPU, storage and memory than these), even still they managed to grow considerably. So they did manage to thrive on this.<p>They recently bumped the price for the basic DEV1-S up to €4,99 and I know a lot of hobbyists like myself have been cutting down on their instances because of that. For a business this difference is nothing but for a private person it adds up especially if it&#x27;s not running anything super important. Especially because we have to pay VAT. And their prices don&#x27;t include an IP which is €1 per month extra. All peanuts but for a hobbyist it adds up.<p>I think this is an attempt to rekindle themselves with the hobbyist market, and it worked, I&#x27;m really happy with this! :D Of course many hobbyists work in IT too, so it&#x27;s a smart move to get into the hearts and minds of IT pros.<p>By the way I&#x27;m very happy with Scaleway, their support is excellent and you can just ping them on Slack if you have questions. I expected they&#x27;d behave more like a &#x27;big company&#x27; as they grew bigger (like what happened to DigitalOcean which I used before), but this didn&#x27;t happen. They still have the customer-first approach of a startup, and they don&#x27;t look down on the little guy.')
