Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25892639], score=None, time=1611500461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892271, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Philanthrocapitalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Philanthrocapitalism</a><p>&gt; Philanthrocapitalism is a way of doing philanthropy, which mirrors the way that business is done in the for-profit world.<p>Bill Gates is a well known Philanthro-capitalist. He will not invest in a product for philanthropy unless it can be shown to create a profit in the target market.<p>The general idea is that the target market (no matter how poor it is), knows more about its given situation than you do. Otherwise, you start to fund disasters like Roundabout PlayPump (Child-labor issues: children are now &quot;forced to play&quot; to pump water).<p>If a locality actually thinks something is a good idea, they&#x27;ll find a way to put up the cash. At which point, you know its a good idea to reciprocate with your philanthropy.<p>------------<p>Anyway, you don&#x27;t need to necessarily agree with Philanthro-capitalism. All I&#x27;m trying to point out is that Bill Gates is consistent on this matter: he does believe strongly that free markets are the solution. Even to philanthropy.')
