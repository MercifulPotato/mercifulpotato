I just tried to install ubuntu as dual-boot on a separate SSD from windows (which I keep around for video games) and I ran into 13 bugs (I wrote them down!) within two hours - including two which caused fatal issues in the installation process itself which I had to run around eight times before it succeeded. Then it somehow permanently trashed the ability of windows to boot. After spending three hours trying to fix that I said fuck it and nuked both OSs with a fresh windows install.<p>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried installing linux in about a decade, after using a stable dual-boot setup during university. Things seem to have gotten worse. It&#x27;ll be another decade before I try again, probably. I lost two days of pay and probably years of non-grey hair dealing with this fiasco.')
