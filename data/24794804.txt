Telling someone to grab a electrified wire is violence by nearly everyone&#x27;s standard. A mafioso directing a hit man to kill is nearly everyone&#x27;s standard. The famous &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot; is mostly violence etc.<p>So you can&#x27;t say the situation is &quot;free speech or not&quot;. The situation is always where the boundary is. Of course, the question of where quickly spreading slander on the eve of an elections is on the spectrum of protected speech is a complicated question. But it&#x27;s a bit different than the question of whether a given dogma can be challenged.')
