You need a way to prevent this and that is &quot;intellectual property&quot; or &quot;IP&quot;. This is a catch all term for an exclusive license from the government to sell something you created.&quot;<p>Generally, you can&#x27;t grant an exclusive license to rights that you do not own.  The author&#x27;s definition of &quot;intellectual property&quot; would appear to have the government owning exclusive rights to sell anything eligible for intellectual property protection.<p>Sometimes, as a condition to receiving some form of financial support from the government, you might automatically assign rights to them.  Obviously not all &quot;intellectual property&quot; is created with governmental support.<p>Internet authors frequently try to explain intellectual property incorrectly, but this is one of the more intersting incorrect definitions I have seen.<p>Patents, trademarks and copyrights do not grant a license to sell anything.  They do provide rights to sue others.')
