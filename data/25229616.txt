It&#x27;s a quote which discusses people as a category in the abstract, which is to say it discusses the idea of people and their behavior. As much as I&#x27;d like to dunk on the quote like this, it <i>is</i> consistent :)<p>My interpretation of the quote has always been that discussing people means something along the lines of gossip, i.e. specific people. That being said I think there&#x27;s a clear difference between simple gossip and <i>critical</i> discussion of others, which can be very intellectually elevated.')
