It&#x27;s not cyclists blowing red lights at busy junctions, if they did that they would be killed here instantly. It&#x27;s cyclists trying to go when there isn&#x27;t any traffic going, or they&#x27;re competing with pedestrians. Yeah you get the occasional asshat, but you get them in cars too, and they&#x27;re way more dangerous there.<p>The focus needs to be on getting cars under control, period.')
