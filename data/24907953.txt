But to really understand it you will need some build up to understand linear functions.<p>Matrices are simply a way to write down linear functions, and matrix multiplication is function composition.  All of the algebraic properties of function composition are therefore true of matrices and vice versa.<p>That intuition also explains why matrices come up so often.  For example consider Calculus.  The key idea behind the differential calculus is that if y is close to y0 then f(y) is approximately f(y0) + f&#x27;(y0) (y - y0).<p>In the multivariable calculus the same thing is true.  Except that f&#x27;(y0) is a linear function.  Which means that when we write it down we have to write down a matrix.')
