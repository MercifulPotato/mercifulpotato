While it&#x27;s still better than the traditional dealership model of service, it&#x27;s nowhere close to the kind of service that a German car gets. Not to mention the fact that Tesla wants to play the Apple game and become exclusively set on retaining its exclusive OS. I can see more customer unfriendly behavior in the future.')
