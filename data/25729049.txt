You can absolutely scale this organization to 100+ engineers.  I&#x27;ve worked at a company with ~30 Haskell developers and I was involved in hiring most of them without lowering our hiring bar.  If we really needed more it would have been quite easy to lower the bar a little and increase the numbers significantly.  Here&#x27;s another example of a company that has a large Haskell team:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iohk.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;team&#x2F;#team=development" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iohk.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;team&#x2F;#team=development</a><p>Now if you needed to hire 1000 developers, then you&#x27;d have more of a problem, and perhaps Haskell wouldn&#x27;t be the right approach.  But in my experience, Haskell engineers get a multiplier effect over the average non-Haskell engineer because the code is more concise and the average engineer skill is higher.  I don&#x27;t know what the multiplier is, but it&#x27;s definitely non-zero and positive.  This not only pays the obvious direct benefits, but also reduces the communication overhead of your team and the number of managers you need to hire.')
