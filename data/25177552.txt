The details of the suit were just released a few hours ago, and for the sake of international media recognition OP selected the most prominent article with a title reflecting the current scenario.<p>I&#x27;ve been following this saga for a while, it&#x27;s all on Reddit. Here&#x27;s a summary, the guy  started off by creating a YT channel a few months back called &quot;WhitehatSr&quot; where he documented what actually happens in these classes and showed that the &#x27;teachers&#x27; literally have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about. They&#x27;re literally throwing around buzzwords whilst pressuring the child to pay for the full course to learn advanced concepts. The videos were posted to reddit, and soon the reddit accounts got taken down by the admin.(Not mods) Soon his twitters too, only his original remained, and so he began posting under his real name.<p>The guy persisted and created more Reddit accounts and continued to post till his videos got taken down on YT. I think after creating a bit of noise and being picked up by a few minor publications, the videos were reinstated, but any other person that posted videos exposing the same had their YT taken down. At  this point he was posting on LinkedIN too, and around this time he got a barrage of messages from WhiteHatJr employees, one of them claiming to file a sexual assualt case against him if he does not back down. He ignored them for a while and finally called them out, after which they did briefly stop, but soon after his LinkedIN got taken down.<p>He said in one of his posts, that a lot of editorials would reach out to him and collect information but never end up publishing, almost as if their was a driving force stopping them from it.<p>He soon began to get death threats to him and his family which were deleted within seconds, but he managed to capture evidence. They were from anon accounts but they made it pretty clear where they&#x27;re from<p>His most recent big development was screenshots from their Slack channels, which clearly showed their so called students with laurels don&#x27;t exist, and one of them even show their CEO saying something along &quot;We have to make the app on behalf of the student&quot; and one of the employees says he&#x27;ll get it it done.<p>Shortly after this, a rupees 200 million lawsuit was filed against this guy for &quot;defamation&quot;. He hasn&#x27;t decided what to do<p>I hope this gives an idea what kind of scum this 300mn USD valued &quot;edu startup&quot; is, whose primary targets are parents from middle and lower income households who can be enticed with a few programming jargon and images of Sundar Pichai. I&#x27;m sorry for the improper phrasing and structure, I tried to jot down what I could recollect.')
