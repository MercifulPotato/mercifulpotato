In the former, the rockets had a nice exhaust plume and were slow enough that if you were strafing while shooting, you got to see a nice view of a missile in flight[0]. In Q3A, the rockets were just glowing blobs with a small trail behind, rarely giving you nice visuals. I always favored railguns because of a nicer trail.<p>Serious Sam, back in those days, also had a very nice missile trail visual, and coupled with the outdoor gameplay (giving rockets many seconds of flight), I just loved kiting and unloading rockets at the coalescing piles of enemies.<p>--<p>[0] - Let&#x27;s ignore for a moment that real-life rockets would be much faster.')
