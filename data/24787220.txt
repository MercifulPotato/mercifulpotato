Part of science--science being imperfect and reliant on experimentation--is arriving at contradictory results. It is a natural part of the scientific process and is codified in the scientific method.<p>What is the lesser evil here? Are some scientist so beyond reproach that any incongruent findings are illegal? What if they&#x27;re right? What if they&#x27;re wrong but there was no intent to mislead. What if the authority that anoints untouchable scientists is compromised or otherwise acting in bad faith?<p>Nothing good is going to come from giving credence to a ridiculous notion like &quot;science denier.&quot;')
