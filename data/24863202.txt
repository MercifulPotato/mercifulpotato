Hmmm what can&#x27;t go wrong. Partial support, late support of extensions, bugs,...<p>IMHO: a very bad choice. Complicated basic and higher level elements of protocols are the death of them (remember SOAP). I follow the train of thoughts to not restrict yourself too much but if (eg) java or C++ cannot implement it easy, not a good idea.')
