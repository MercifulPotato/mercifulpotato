Both are very convenient. I’ll listen happily for 2-3 hours in the evening in comfort. I find myself having to charge the Airpods Max every other day, it seems to me like it drains very quickly even when it’s in the case. The panda switches off properly and is always ready to go, I can go a week without charging it with this usage pattern.<p>When I’ve gone to reach for the Max it’s always very low on battery or dead, even if it’s had very little usage after a charge a day or so before.<p>If it powered off properly I’d be a lot happier')
