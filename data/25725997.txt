Practically speaking, USB is defined by Intel, and it is making a visible choice to allow itself a position in the market for Thunderbolt 4 by making some USB4 features optional so they can include them in TB 4, and adding other small minimum performance guarantees and hoping that is enough to sell TB 4 chips to high-end AMD motherboard makers, which in turn makes their own CPUs (with built-in thunderbolt 4) more price competitive. It is a sound business plan, but not in the best interest of consumers.')
