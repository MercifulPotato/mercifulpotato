Especially if you use different operating systems, and want to synchronise your browser experience between them. Not having things synced has actually been a major advantage for me, as I use my phone and Mac very differently than I use my windows devices, but I can see why you wouldn’t want to run safari on Windows&#x2F;Linux.<p>Hell, these days I gotta say that I can see why you wouldn’t want to run Safari at all. It’s terrible at Disney plus, and others, and while that may be a Disney plus and others problem, that’s still technology that doesn’t work right out the box like it’s supposed to.<p>I do think the fact that the new Edge is so good is going to eat into Google’s market. Exactly because of people like you and me who aren’t going to bother unless we have to.')
