Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[24813893], score=None, time=1602972894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810569, text='&gt; Looking back at the rise of fascism and the Holocaust in her 1951 book...<p>She learned the wrong lessons from her study of the rise of fascism. The correct lesson is &#x27;if you botch the economy badly enough, voters will explore <i>every</i> option to try and get some relief&#x27;. Including voting in Nazis. The Nazis (with a parallel to Trump) are a sign of some large group feeling profound economic distress and being rather unhappy with politics as usual.<p>And there is a basic premise in the middle of that article that you quote: that the author is morally pure enough to determine what is good and bad in the marketplace of ideas. That possibility was tested extensively in the 20th century. There isn&#x27;t anyone who can do that. They tried lots of people, none of them worked out. If we create a method for anointing some truths reliable and some &#x27;twisted&#x27; then it is going to become controlled by corrupt people and then do more harm than good. Free speech is by far the most reliable way of identifying bad ideas as bad.')
