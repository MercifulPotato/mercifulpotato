One of the places I ride has a few very conspicuous dumps of obvious construction trash and it is extremely irritating. In this case, it&#x27;s a bunch of asphalt roofing... very heavy and likely expensive at the dump.<p>Its bad enough I almost think we should just eliminate all dump fees and charge everything upstream. If you charge for disposal at the time of sale, then you don&#x27;t need to charge at the time of disposal. Then you remove the incentive to dump elsewhere.')
