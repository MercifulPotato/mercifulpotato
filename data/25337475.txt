First of all I know nothing about art so that already disqualifies everything I will rant now.<p>For me artists are nothing more like the embodiment of the survivor ship bias. I can appreciate something that takes skill to create, be it a craft, a poetry, or even a photorealistic drawing. I can appreciate something that raises emotions in me (I&#x27;m aware that rasing emotions is a highly subject criteria as well). I can appreciate something that is new and unique.<p>None of these things is true for 99.9% of art, this artist included. I think these artworks are not different from atleast thousands of other graffiti doodles from other people. Somehow people start to praise this guy (seemingly random?) instead of anyone else. That&#x27;s just survivor ship bias.<p>I know people say it all the time but it&#x27;s true &quot;I could have made this&quot;. My point is that probably most of art critic&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between a random doodle of some random art student and most famous abstract art.<p>It&#x27;s also not about having an unique idea, banana on the wall is not something special, people do crazy things all the time. There are probably thousand of wanna be artists that tape things on walls and make some random things in hope of getting famous and could tell you some deep thinking why it criticises our modern society.<p>So for me art is just a random circle jerk of people telling each other that this special guy is good and the rest isn&#x27;t and if you don&#x27;t agree or see it you are just someone that has no idea about art. \nAnd my take on really high expensive art is that it&#x27;s just a form of tax evasion or similar goals.')
