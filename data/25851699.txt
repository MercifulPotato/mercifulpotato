The technology, design, content etc we know how to do but a big chunk of our work is identifying and helping people within the partner organisation who we can work with  and develop the concept of what they need.<p>For many it&#x27;s their first time building a product and so sometimes it takes a lot of time to help them understand how to deliver the bits on their side that are needed. Also to get a sense of who&#x2F;what&#x2F;why they want if they ask for stuff like new features. Inevitably that can lead to a lot of internal politics within them that we have to navigate. Also different organisations want different levels of input to a white-label, so there is a balance between that and your own roadmap. Some want a turn key solution, some will bring their own people, experiences, inputs, designers etc etc.')
