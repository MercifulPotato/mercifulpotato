But the natural beauty in Texas in my opinion doesn&#x27;t really compare to a lot of California and the Northwest.<p>But from a financial standpoint it&#x27;s great.  I have friends who make 50k a year in California and live like they&#x27;re in college where as when I made that much in Texas I felt very comfortable.  Things like buying a house in a nice walkable neighborhood 5 minutes from downtown for 200k in a major city isn&#x27;t really an option in California.')
