I never have to worry about scale, and for a single developer that&#x27;s important, as there aren&#x27;t 10 other developers to leverage when scale becomes an issue after the fact.<p>I also don&#x27;t have to pay for what I&#x27;m not using, also important for a single developer. If I had chosen a more traditional approach of using EC2 to host a server, I would be paying quite a lot more for my project to sit idle on an EC2 instance 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365 if I&#x27;m not getting enough traffic to support paying for the idle server.')
