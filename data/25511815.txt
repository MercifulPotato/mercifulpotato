Logically, even a large SPA should use less overall data than a comparable server-rendered app over time. A JS bundle is a bigger initial hit but will be cached, leaving only the data and any chunks you don&#x27;t have cached yet to come over the wire as you navigate around. A server-rendered app needs to transmit the entire HTML document on every single page load.<p>Of course, when you see things like the newer React-based reddit, which chugs on any hardware I have to throw at it, I can sort of see where people&#x27;s complaints come from.')
