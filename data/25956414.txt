It&#x27;s just speculators returning to &quot;normal&quot; in expectation of returning back to bullrun.<p>And volatility itself is understandable if the fate of BTC is either $0 or &quot;replacing all base currencies and monetary use of gold, oil and real estate&quot; which yields more than 20x higher than current price. There is no middle ground and market will be in a volatile &quot;land grab&quot; or &quot;price discovery&quot; until it flops or saturates monetary needs of everyone.')
