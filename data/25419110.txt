It also involves extended arguments over the statements that follow from these axioms even amongst philosophers who agree the axioms are true.<p>&gt;[W]hat almost invariably happens in practice is that individual philosophers act as advocates for the particular axioms that they believe actually hold.<p>I agree with this as well. My main point was about the structure of the arguments. I don&#x27;t think arguing from an axiom you hold to be true turns the argument anecdotal.')
