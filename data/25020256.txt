That 3e-Audio TPA3250 board isn&#x27;t sold anymore, so I built my own custom variant amplifier using similar parts with a TP3251:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;gPH8VZiaGRiNYWfL6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;gPH8VZiaGRiNYWfL6</a><p>It sounds MUCH better than my existing cheap vendor Fosi TPA3116 did -- the cheap vendor ones don&#x27;t use quality components, especially for the power supply, so you&#x27;re not going to see the expected performance.<p>That power supply board (diode bridge + filtering caps) was designed with a friend in KiCAD and fabricated by JLCPCB (I have a few boards leftover). The speakers are also DIY -- Hivi 3.1 with cherry wood veneer!<p>I showed article author Zorpette my work, and he gave it his blessing =)<p>EDIT: If you do try to build this, be VERY careful around the high-voltage power supply electronics.')
