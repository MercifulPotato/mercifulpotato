There is nothing inherently making it a bad idea to bundle those things in one device, but unless you want to go down the DIY rabbit hole, the AIO options are generally not great.<p>Manufacturers I think you should consider would be MikroTik, and Netgear&#x27;s business and SOHO ranges (one step up from the normal consumer stuff).<p>If you&#x27;re set on a consumer WiFi router device, Unifi is your best bet.
