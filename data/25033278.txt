They think he&#x27;s a genius, brilliant businessman, and probably don&#x27;t realize how powerful his negative language about migrants etc. really is, they just don&#x27;t understand what statesmanship actually is or how important that it is that he is a role model as well. I guess it&#x27;s one of the more obvious problems of raw populism.')
