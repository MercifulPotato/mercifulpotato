TSMC&#x27;s latest node at 5nm&#x2F;3nm was like $16B and so 10x doesn&#x27;t sound outrageous if playing catchup.<p>I do wonder how many people will be involved; it could be like ITER where everyone builds one fab that&#x27;s truly the best in the world. Or it could be that they want to spread it out amongst the existing incumbents they can find who I am sure will do nothing with it.<p>Concentrate the funding and I imagine it could do pretty well. Distribute to (more than one) commercial entity (preferably zero to retain public access) and I doubt it will go anywhere.')
