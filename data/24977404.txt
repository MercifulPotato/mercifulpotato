In such circumstances, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to assume that adding steep price gouging will produce any marginal increase in the likelihood of a producer increasing production, on top of whatever production increases are already going to happen just as a result of instantly selling out of all existing stock.<p>But all that is assuming the gouging happens at the production end of the supply chain. If the gouging is happening at the penultimate step of the supply chain and the profits mostly don&#x27;t make it back to the manufacturer, then price gouging can&#x27;t do much to incentivize higher production.')
