I&#x27;m bearish because the art to good analytics is deeply understanding the data. The SQL queries are the easy part. It&#x27;s knowing when to omit inactive states, or how accrual works in the system, or that field X was depreciated and isn&#x27;t accurate anymore.<p>These systems solve none of those underlying questions, and in fact are more likely to make it worse. Because if you won&#x27;t even bother to write SQL or look at your database, you are even less likely to make sure it&#x27;s high quality.<p>(There is maybe an exemption here for queries that you don&#x27;t really care of you get the real answer. I don&#x27;t know what those questions would be, but that would be a good usecase.)')
