It&#x27;s a small price to pay for having your system &#x27;just work&#x27; without going down the Arch Linux road and having ultra control over every component of the OS. Even Ubuntu constantly phones home to `snapcraft.io` and `canonical.com` but needs to do that to check for updates and do things like sync the clock with NTP. Do I care that Canonical now knows when my box goes online? Hardly. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for having a pretty solid OS that has good hardware compatibility and I have no issues with my printer, and it&#x27;s plug-and-play. If I need to use Windows to open a .DOCX file (for work) I use Virtualbox where I have a Windows VM to do Windows things. I don&#x27;t see the fuss really in using Linux as my daily driver. Others are so biased and fanboi-ish towards MacOS it&#x27;s disturbing to witness.')
