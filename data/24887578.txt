When that happens, we go back to our full set of simulations and run a series of regressions to see how your scenario might look if it turned up more often.&quot;<p>I interpret that as running a regression (linear?) and extrapolating it out to the tail where the conditioning is happening. This should eliminate the issue Andrew is seeing?')
