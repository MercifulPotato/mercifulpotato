I got an Intel 5K iMac in the summer and I&#x27;m still very happy with it. I need to be able to run windows and Linux in VMs so M1 isn&#x27;t for me right now. It&#x27;s no for you either.<p>Having said that, your manufacturer of your Threadripper is now on notice. Apple isn&#x27;t done with the M1, more powerful desktop chips are on their way over the next few years and there&#x27;s a very good chance they&#x27;ll do exactly what they just did to Intel and AMDs mobile chipsets to the high end stuff. Apple are coming for them, and not being impressed now isn&#x27;t going to serve them well down the line.')
