Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606569915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234805, text='I would like to mention that these articles claim &quot;renewables generate waste&quot; but they always omit that you can always improve the technology to produce less harmful waste. You can&#x27;t do that with fossil fuels.<p>For example. A common complaint is that solar panels are full of leaded solder. What the articles omit is that leaded solder has been banned for more than a decade and the panels they are complaining about are two or three decades old. The articles also generally focus on the most toxic waste even if the most commonly used solar panel types don&#x27;t contain any of that toxic waste. Thin film cadmium solar panels are &quot;toxic&quot; and everyone agrees but it&#x27;s a tiny portion of the market. Most solar panels are based on silicon wafers and with some luck you can resurface the top layer of the wafer and use it to make new solar panels. If the frame is made out of aluminum and glass you can recycle that too.')
