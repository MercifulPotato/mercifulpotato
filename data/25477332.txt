For something which is very, very rare.<p>You apparently missed the whole point of newsletters <i>automatically</i> unsubscribing users on a 5xx error from the previous discussion that the topmost comment was referring to. Not that you are to blame for missing that because it wasn&#x27;t restated here, but that&#x27;s the context of the whole discussion. In this context I also heavily disagree with your statements and agree that among other examples automatically unsubscribing to a single &quot;permanent&quot; error is a brittle system.<p>If I have sent emails successfully to a certain email address before it is not wise to assume a permanent error on a single response that the RFC specifies as permanent. Email&#x2F;SMTP is in it&#x27;s core a stateless protocol, but as a mailing list service I can keep state and provide additional context to errors that can improve my service.<p>Finally, if you read the RFC 5321 4.2.1. Reply Code Severities and Theory it specifically uses &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot; instead of &quot;MUST NOT&quot; implying that there might be valid scenarios to act differently.<p>RFC 2119:<p>&gt; SHOULD NOT   This phrase, or the phrase &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot; mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.')
