Fundamentally, if you make a platform, you can (mostly) enforce whatever policies you want about the type of speech you allow. This is why Parler is trying to chase this from an anti-trust angle, not a 1st Amendment angle.<p>If you are talking about the more general philosophical idea, keep in mind we are talking on Hacker News. Here, right now we are moderated. Much discussion on Parler which caused Apple, Google, and Amazon to hit them with the ban hammer is banned here as well. Likewise, most online forums ban talk of murder, rape, death threats, etc.<p>Parler itself has policies against this kind of content, if they didn&#x27;t, Apple at least wouldn&#x27;t have allowed them on the App Store. Parler does not enforce their own Terms of Service. If they did, we wouldn&#x27;t be here now.')
