And, once trusted, they becomem a platform, on top of which more ideas can be constructed.<p>I think the main problem is that the lies people believe today (i.e. that the election was stolen) are constructed on a <i>deep</i> foundation (which, like anything, is some part factual and some part counterfactual).<p>To refute a lie, you have to not only tear down the lie, but  the foundation on which it was constructed. And because life is complicated, sometimes we construct many verifiable truths on top of complete lies. We have to be careful deconstructing these.<p>So, to correct a superficial lie (election was stolen), you have to deconstruct the lie recursively (state electors, mail in voting, behavior of senators&#x2F;congresspeople). This is incredibly hard, because people trust the platforms on which the lie is constructed.<p>This is why we don&#x27;t bother trying to reason with the &quot;lizard conspiracy&quot; people. It&#x27;s also why PhD students can&#x27;t be bothered to explain their work to people outside their field.<p>It&#x27;s a real conundrum.')
