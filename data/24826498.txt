Go compete there if you want to take PEDs!! Of all the sports PL is the most honest in that it has that outlet at least, but it of course varies by country. The steroids taboo in some countries might discourage the creation of untested federations. That could end up having the wrong effect of encouraging athletes on the fence about punching their natty card; they might stay in the tested federation while using PEDs.')
