If you choose to believe any information as it was written, without thinking about it yourself or checking with other resources, that&#x27;s on you.<p>Personal responsibility seems to be criminally underrated, everyone would rather blame anything and anyone but themselves. That&#x27;s toxic for everyone, including yourself.<p>But this reminded me, I don&#x27;t remember the last time I solved a problem without looking for an answer online... It&#x27;s really efficient, but I&#x27;ve lost the ability to <i>quickly</i> solve something <i>by myself</i>.<p>This is why I&#x27;m afraid of all the censorship and blocking, I&#x27;d have to go back to how it was. It was slow and hard, but also fun tbh.')
