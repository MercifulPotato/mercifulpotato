I mean, currently only around 100% of one annual GDP has been printed this way. And this money is still debt - it eats into wealth and incomes of the future retirees i.e. those same people who are now going unemployed - they are borrowing from themselves by getting those benefits - because a larger debt now means higher interest payments later (and these of course go to the rich, included but not limited, rich Chinese, but mainly rich Americans), and limiting what the government can pay to the same people in form of say, social security payments when they get old. This money still doesn&#x27;t come from nowhere.<p>Or, it increases risk of default when everyone&#x27;s savings will be wiped out - except most of the money the rich have are again, in stocks so these won&#x27;t be impacted nearly as much...<p>Whatever way it goes, these are not free money. Call me a conservative but stuff just doesn&#x27;t come for free.<p>I wonder why is this difficult to grasp - i mean OK, the virtual capital (e.g. startup valuations, or even stock market values) MAY come from nowhere, because they can just equally return to nowhere - these can be pumped to infinity. But we are speaking of consumption money for people living hand to mouth - whatever dollar is given to them, goes to very material consumption. Where this extra stuff will come from, if people don&#x27;t work more for them to be created? It just doesn&#x27;t appear out of nowhere if Fed prints some bucks.')
