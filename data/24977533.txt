I routinely program a CPU which has no FPU, so any arithmetic will have to be done in fixed point.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to get work done with fixed point arith, it just requires a bit more thinking through so you don&#x27;t run out of bits. Usually, I write unit tests where I compile my code for host architecture and compare the fixed point result to host&#x27;s floating point. Then I can set a precise error margin for my XP approximation.')
