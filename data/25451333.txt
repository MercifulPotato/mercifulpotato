A lot of users, a few rich stewards with vested interests, and no real democracy.<p>If I, a random user, come up with a really great standard that solves a bunch of real problems that users have, it has no chance of being accepted unless it solves the problems of the few rich stewards.<p>So, today, The Web(TM) and its Internets(TM), which now pretty much defines our global economy, is currently being developed by advertising and consumer product companies, and a handful of companies who profit off of the standards that they make. Our future rests not a little in their hands.<p>Feels kinda like watching a big capitalist train moving towards global society in really slow motion.')
