Item(by='twic', descendants=None, kids=[24686771], score=None, time=1601898253, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686623, text='&gt; it&#x27;s difficult to conclude that children are the &quot;key&quot; to superspreading<p>Not only does the study not show that, the press release doesn&#x27;t even claim that - it contains two separate claims, that superspreading is important, and that children are involved in spread. It&#x27;s only the use of a comma in the headline that - through incompetence or dishonesty - suggests that!<p>Mods, could we have the title changed, please?<p>EDIT: Mods changed the title already, thanks mods!')
