Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610462822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25744910, text='&gt; Take the bottom 50% (or whatever) in generation A. Count what percentage of their children end up in the top 30% (or whatever). Thats&#x27; mobility. And it&#x27;s highest in Northern Europe, by any reasonable standard.<p>Except that this isn&#x27;t true.  You are basing this assertion on mobility indexes which account for more than this raw mobility.  It&#x27;s the reverse.  By raw mobility, the US does outperform Europe.  But, importantly, and accounted for by the indexes are referenced in the follow-up comment to your other respondent, people in Europe do not backslide between generations the way they do in the US.  Europe has higher economic stability, but lower mobility, due to broader social support systems and much more heavily progressive taxation.<p>Any study that goes back before WW2 shows a different story in the US, and that&#x27;s partly because post-WW2 was a major economic shift between the US and Europe, and also because the US has to account for its (relatively short) history of discrimination affecting economic mobility, especially in the South.<p>A more honest take is that economic mobility is different in both places based on various demographic factors &#x2F;other&#x2F; than economics.  If you&#x27;re college educated and white or college educated and an immigrant your economic mobility in the US is very high, if you are not college educated or not white (but a non-immigrant) your economic mobility in the US is very low.  In the EU there is less disparity, but less overall mobility, which can be accounted for partly by the broader parts of society receiving higher education, and partly by the more progressive taxation which prevents massive jumps in wealth accumulation and is used to ensure a higher minimal standard of living for the poorest in society.')
