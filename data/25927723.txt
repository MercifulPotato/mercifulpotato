It&#x27;s a matter of education because an overwhelming majority of the population isn&#x27;t competent enough to fact-check memes on facebook, let alone wikipedia, and if wikipedia doesn&#x27;t do it either, then that responsibility is pushed all the way back to the scientists doing the actual research.<p>This is an incredible lack of redundancy if you consider how important wikipedia has become in shaping public opinion. It&#x27;s a system where the scientific publication process is the single point of failure and this article clearly shows that it <i>does</i> fail rather often.<p>So what way is there to make this process safer? There needs to be at least another link in the chain that confirms information, preferably two or three.')
