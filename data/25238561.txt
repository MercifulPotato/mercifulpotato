But due to a different reason: all we know about reality is our theories. How we could state, that rules of the universe are simple? As I see it, we could state, that our theories are full of simple rules. But the universe have no theories nor rules outside of human&#x27;s mind. It is completely our inventions, our dreams, our hopes that the universe have some rules.<p>We could state that our simple rules works, but what does it mean &quot;to work&quot;? For example, a spider sees reality not like us, it feels vibrations of it&#x27;s web, runs to a source of vibrations and start to bite, to wrap intruding object with web. It would do it to a tuning fork, if you pressed it to spider&#x27;s web. His simple rules of reality works though. Despite the fact that sometimes spider bites steel of a tuning fork without any benefits for the spider.<p>How could we know that our theories not just extended version of spider&#x27;s? With the same issues, like they make us to do something absolutely pointless. How could we evaluate this fact? To ask our theories? But our theories already predicted that this pointless thing we do would be a good thing. We might ask our theories again and we&#x27;d get the same answer.<p>This statement seems as a tautology for me. Our rules are simple, because they are simple. Our theories work because they tell us, that they work.')
