There&#x27;s a good number of towns in North Florida under consent decree for financing themselves via tickets from motorists that are passing through. The towns set up speed limits on major roads that had nothing to do with road safety and everything with fleecing travelers. You&#x27;d also think that the local cops would try very hard not to stop anyone who looks as if they might attract the Fed&#x27;s attention. That leaves the poor and indigent - business as usual.<p>Also in today&#x27;s news: the DOJ reached a settlement with Purdue Pharma. Yes, totally legitimate, all within the confines of the law.')
