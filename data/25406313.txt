What are the features you would add or change? For me it is simply user book reviews and summaries. My expectations are limited, so I don&#x27;t see what you see.<p>I believe that Amazon owns GoodReads. There&#x27;s a natural conflict of interest, but at the end of the day sales are sales.<p>Last I heard, commissions for Amazon affiliates were not only for the linked item. For example, if you link them to the book, but they go on to buy a toaster oven, you&#x27;ll receive a commission for the entire purchase.<p>If you think more user engagement is necessary, that&#x27;s fine. Strategies could be developed to drive more engagement.<p>If the problems you see in the site are shared by others, I think you could have something viable. Please don&#x27;t let a can&#x27;t-do attitude stop you from experimenting. Web development is an open landscape for adventurers.')
