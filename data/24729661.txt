Calling people was terrible compared to the convenience of social media, sure it was more intimate but most people aren&#x27;t looking for intimacy in every interaction they have with their friends. A lot of the time they just want to shoot the breeze. People like memes, seeing what trendy garbage with avacado on top their friends ate, and they like having an easy way to coordinate a group meetup without making ten phonecalls.<p>I recognize that some people do get addicted to social media but for most people the only thing they&#x27;re addicted to if anything is convenience. We&#x27;re already at a point where many people feel more comfortable giving out their public insta than their phone number to new acquaintances because of how much more control they have if things go badly. Before social media parents were complaining that cell phones were turning their kids into shut-ins who just wanted to text all day instead of having real conversations. The whole dialogue is just another repeat of people feeling like something must be wrong because it&#x27;s not how they think the world should be.')
