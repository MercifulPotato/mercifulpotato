Supply and demand still exist. Moderating facebook is still a low skill desk job.  The pay and benefit floor may be raised across the board, but I don&#x27;t see what the market force would separate moderating facebook from the other jobs with comparable pay today.<p>Sure, you could quit a job moderating facebook and not have to worry about keeping yourself solvent.  But the same goes for every other job.  What would separate them from the jobs that they&#x27;re on the same level with today?')
