That just seems like the same old mistake of thinking that wealth is zero-sum.<p>Isn’t most of this stock market gain from new wealth that is being created? Much of it goes to people wealthy enough to own stocks, but if it’s new wealth that’s not a wealth transfer, plus not all of it does. Companies with higher stock prices will tend to hire more, reinvest into growing the business which requires more employees. Amazon has been on a hiring tear all year, for example.<p>Then there was also the whole CARES act this year, and the follow-up package that should be passed any day now. Which offered an unprecedented level of unemployment insurance for laid off workers and actually reduced the poverty rate in the country over this summer to lower than pre-pandemic levels.')
