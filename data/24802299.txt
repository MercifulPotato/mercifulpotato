It also automatically groups together similar links.<p>This extension is ideal for people who have too many tabs open. Most times I have so many tabs open that titles are not even visible. Omni is built for the lazy. Its algorithm analyzes your history, tabs and bookmarks and keeps learning the more you use it. All your data stays local and is optimally indexed.<p>Our goal is that you won&#x27;t have to lift your hands off the keyboard and any tab will be only a few keypresses away. Omni will be the fastest tab switcher you&#x27;ve ever experienced, your personalized search and navigation companion.<p>Pro tips:<p>- Use alt + k or option + k on MacOS to start searching<p>- Use alt + a or option + a on MacOS to navigate using aliases (golinks.io alternative)<p>- Use the tab key to move between groups<p>- Installing Omni does not require a Tefter account<p>- If you have a Tefter account, right click any link or click the extension icon to add a bookmark<p>- Omni replaces the browser&#x27;s default new tab page, you can disable this by following the instructions  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.tefter.io&#x2F;features&#x2F;apps&#x2F;#new-tab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.tefter.io&#x2F;features&#x2F;apps&#x2F;#new-tab</a><p>- Type &#x2F;s to trigger 3rd party search {Google, DuckDuckGo, YouTube, ..}<p>- Type &#x2F;go to search your aliases<p>We&#x27;d love to get some feedback and I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions!')
