The ad industry has forgotten that you can advertise without collecting hoardes of personal data, and they&#x27;ve convinced the rest of us that it can&#x27;t be done.<p>The point here is that sharing data in the way Grindr is sharing it with third parties is not core to its business. That is, no one signs up for Grindr because of that functionality. Folks sign up to Grindr to find and message others. That functionality does not require the type of data sharing being reviewed in this case, and that sharing of data is distinct from merely displaying advertising.')
