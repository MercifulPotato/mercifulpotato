Thanks for introducing me to Contextual Electronics! This looks like a resource that fits the bill for what I was looking for almost exactly.<p>&gt; you&#x27;ll need to dive into firmware and higher level software on the web side of things<p>I was expecting that, and it isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m too afraid of getting my hands into. I am thinking maybe something a little beefier then the ESP32 (like a STM32, specifically the STM32MP157A) so that I have a little more room to play with. I think the ESP32 won&#x27;t have enough RAM for what I really want the device to do.')
