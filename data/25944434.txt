Only projects whose profit exceeds the cost of capital should be executed.<p>* Stock prices influences a firm&#x27;s cost of capital, eg when raising more money.<p>* Relative stock prices also influence, in mergers, say, who takes over whom.<p>* Via all these levers and more, stock prices help select which projects of all possible ventures are realised, and who manages them.<p>* All of this is aimed at funding those projects that produce the highest output relative to the resources dedicated to them.<p>* All of this only works if stock prices are a somewhat accurate reflection of the prospects of a firm; in other words, if the share price reflects the fundamental value of the firm.<p>* Short sellers (and long buyers) that analyse firms and trade when they perceive a discrepancy between share price and fundamental value can trade upon that insight, which will have two effects: a) it will tend to bring the share price closer to the fundamental value, and b) it will be profitable for the firms that are correct in their assessment.<p>That&#x27;s basically the big picture story.')
