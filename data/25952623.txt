The streamers generally don&#x27;t pay per stream, they pay a fixed cost for a fixed amount of time of unlimited streams.  At the same time, if a user is streaming or not is negligible cost.  They build the infrastructure assuming everyone will stream, because unlike a gym, most people drop the service if they don&#x27;t use it.')
