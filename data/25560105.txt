The majority of their arcade collection was still 2D though, and they probably have considered it to be too expensive to bring that 3D tech to the homes. Especially Daytona looks much worse on the Saturn than on arcade, so there&#x27;s that at least. Their 3D tech was much inferior to what SGI offered, and it might have been that they didn&#x27;t want to give up on what they developed in-house. At least the part that they added 3D very late in the development cycle is very clear if you look at the system architecture, the rest might very well be up for discussion.')
