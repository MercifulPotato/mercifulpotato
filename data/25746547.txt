The goal of this research is to develop well founded approaches to deal with the users intended semantics for null values in a database. Ultimately we want to generate approaches and practical tools that can increase the information one can extract from a database.<p>In order to develop approaches and tools that manage several meanings of null values, we need to first understand what those meanings are. We want to understand what you think about SQL handling of null values. Is it what you expect? Is it problematic? We would highly appreciate if you could help us out by filling this survey:<p>Link to Survey: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edinburghinformatics.eu.qualtrics.com&#x2F;jfe&#x2F;form&#x2F;SV_2sGboKoH7vqL6yp<p>We have also partnered with data.world who is collaborating with us on this research.

We are on track to have the largest survey from database practitioners about NULL values.<p>Thank you so much for your help!')
