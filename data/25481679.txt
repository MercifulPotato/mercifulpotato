That is not to say everyone won’t eventually run into the issue with time but I think it is a little overblown in the moment with all the bandwagon hating.<p>I have run into very few bugs over my 45 hours and when I have, I think it’s been in places where something was meant time to clean up. Such as going back to a npc after a long interaction that lead me away. So maybe bug frequency has a little to do with play style which I bet can vary person to person and is not compared in-depth via quick internet comments.')
