Perhaps unintended, this seems to be the net result with AMC. A few days ago they probably wondered how to keep the lights on. Now they&#x27;ve sold some stock at a premium and have a lot more cash on hand to trudge along as (hopefully) vaccines mostly resolve their issues.<p>I can imagine the emergence of a different sort of activist investor: large groups that find distressed companies they really want to do well, and instead of the company getting eaten by a private equity shark, they&#x27;re given the resources for a turn around. (Some-- many? -- would fail anyway)<p>I recognize this probably unrealistically optimistic, but I imagine some Occupy Wall Street veterans are having a big laugh right now either way.')
