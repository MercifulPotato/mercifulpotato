I personally know people who can read well beyond the 600 WPM and even into the 700 WPM easily, but whom are not able to explain to me (let alone teach me) how they do it. It seems to be somewhat innate.<p>How do I train myself to at least get into the 400 WPM range?<p>Are there any courses or training material out there that worked for you?<p>Were you a slow reader like me who managed to become faster?')
