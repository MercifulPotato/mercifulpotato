They always seem like point scoring exercises or agenda-driven based on personal opinions and subjective assessments. In this case it&#x27;s not even clear who the author is...<p>China (and they are not alone) has done relatively well against the virus, so far certainly better than the West in general. It&#x27;s just intellectual honesty to recognise this whatever we might think of the Chinese government.<p>Can we trust all the Chinese government reports? No. But when they lift most restrictions and life is mostly back to normal this is not fake. They cannot hide serious outbreaks. Case in point they still enforce local lockdowns here and there as cases arise.<p>I think there are two main aspects in what they are doing:<p>1. Strict lockdowns, strictly enforced but with people also complying by themselves.<p>2. Comprehensive monitoring, and track and trace systems in place after lockdowns.')
