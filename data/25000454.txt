It&#x27;s that there are some people crying wolf who see something as erotic material when it&#x27;s not. Do you see the difference there? Getting to the heart of why they see it this way when others don&#x27;t is an interesting question.<p>There&#x27;s an ugly implication of the &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; standard -- <i>something</i> in the individual&#x27;s brain has realized that what it&#x27;s getting from the eyes is supposed to be exciting. How could they otherwise make the claim? That&#x27;s got to be an unsettling experience for a lot of people. The self-disgust this causes is likely to be so visceral and panic-inducing that it will be hard for someone experiencing it to understand that the reaction is not universal.')
