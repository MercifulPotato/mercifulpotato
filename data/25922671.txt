One difference between these platforms is that they&#x27;re very optimized for the &quot;typical app deployment&quot; process, whereas Ansible and such are more generic.<p>Just getting a simple deployment script in Ansible requires programming a bunch of steps - copying archive, verifying it, unpacking it, then atomically configuring the system to use the new version, finally cleaning it up - whereas with k8s you just let it know you want to Deploy something and it does.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s only true if you already know k8s, but then again if you work with both toy and larger projects, chances are you&#x27;ll have to, sooner or later.')
