However, I don&#x27;t know whether this surveillance network is worth the costs that are to be associated with it.  The cure costs more than the problem.<p>Ring is an Amazon product.  Ring videos stream to AWS s3 servers.  Video is processed through AI and used in an unlimited number of ways for Amazon&#x27;s purposes and not just policing.  We&#x27;re going to wind up paying Amazon through taxes for an unnecessary neighborhood surveillance platform that it gets to monetize in countless ways. Politicians, whose greatest contributor to re-election campaigns will be an anonymous source affiliated with a lobbying outfit contracted by Amazon, will insist that the program is valuable but never substantiate the claims with much else than anecdotal evidence.  Society functions well enough today without these services and it costs us far less than it will tomorrow.  Don&#x27;t forget that.<p>Mozilla Foundation is ringing the alarm bells about public surveillance when it should be alarming us about paying more taxes.  We&#x27;ll be paying taxes for <i>unnecessary</i> technology services.  The programs will involve long-term contracts, too, so forget about voting in a new mayor to change things.')
