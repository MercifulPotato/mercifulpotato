I worked at an online traffic school for traffic tickets that is licensed in Texas and part of the requirements is that you have to buy, update monthly and store all 28 million drivers license info on your system to make identity questions out of.<p>So if you signup, an example identity question might be what are the color of your eyes, or weight, or your zip code, and so on.<p>They deliver these files on a ftp server with a zip file.<p>On top of that you have to create identity questions out of the cars the person owns but it is not a downloadable file you have to scrape the contents of an online site you buy access to which gives you access to every car the person owns.<p>Lastly, to complete clearing their ticket in Texas they have to have a certified copy of the driving record from the DMV.
