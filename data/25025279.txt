Having a standardized query language is much better.<p>&gt; How is writing queries in the front end and exposing those queries a good idea<p>It&#x27;s better than making x technical requests for one semantic requests because it&#x27;s easier to keep track of what is requested and what is just correlated by time.<p>&gt; How is exposing the back end data structures a good idea?<p>If you do that with either REST or GraphQL you are either doing it wrong or you care about speed a lot and generate your graphQL from your backend structures.<p>GraphQL is especially nice if you have one backend and one or two frontends that you control.')
