Item(by='tannhaeuser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602404671, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743484, text='I feel like it might be too late to untangle the mess the web has become without strong market regulation. With Google pushing for QUIC, DoH, ever-increasing scope of browsers and JavaScript, CSS insanity, etc. The time where US antitrust instruments could&#x27;ve been effective might have passed over ten years ago when Google bought DoubleClick and YouTube, and Facebook bought WhatsApp, etc. Today, it seems only a regulated market covering hosting, DNS, mail based on standardized services, without &quot;free&quot; vertical add-ons (privacy-invasion-as-business-model) with mandatory transferability to another provider in a DNS-like model could work. And it would help if gov, for once, fund web standards rather than relying on private parties with W3C-like funding models since, clearly, the domain of creating standards for browsers has been taken over by Google as well in the absence of any other funding. If then, over a period of several years, we could rollback most of the abominations on the web since 2010, and force a choice of browsers on desktop and mobile, and a number of telcos competing for web and mail spaces, plus ad providers, we might be going somewhere. Ain&#x27;t going to happen, though.')
