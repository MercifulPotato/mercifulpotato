Basic in 80s micros was effectively the operating system, a more apt comparison in terms of today&#x27;s technology would be sh&#x2F;bash: its main purpose is to be a quick interface, and while you certainly <i>can</i> program in it, but I doubt it has more educational value compared to something more structured.<p>I also don&#x27;t agree with the notion that a more immediate programming environment will cause more people to understand programming&#x2F;computer science. The notion that there exist machines that you have the power <i>and</i> responsibility to arbitrarily program yourself is the biggest hurdle.
