It&#x27;s ultimately the fault of the consumer. They bought an expensive device but still accept to pay 30% to apple for every app they buy, forever. Yes, ultimately it&#x27;s still the consumer that pays for this (companies will of course factor in the store prices before launching). not to mention the censoring power that apple and google now wield; they can close down any app with &quot;hey, you didn&#x27;t abide by the T&amp;C that we wrote ourselves and keep amending&quot;.<p>also, consoles and phones are not the exactly same story. phones are ubiquitous now. everyone has a phone, not everyone has a PC and very few have consoles. it&#x27;s one thing to get a cut of every transaction and another to get a cut of a few transactions. imagine your ISP is allowed to take a cut of every payment you make.')
