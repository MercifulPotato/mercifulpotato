And there&#x27;s probably a good chance that Joe Biden did meet Pozharskyi at some point.<p>But they didn&#x27;t have some kind of scheduled meeting, so it seems unlikely that any business was done.<p><i>The Post story included a screenshot of what the paper said was a 2015 email from Burisma adviser Vadym Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden, thanking him for “the opportunity to meet your father.” But the email doesn’t indicate whether Pozharskyi was describing a meeting that had already occurred or one intended to occur in the future. Nevertheless, the Post reported that the existence of such a meeting undercut Biden’s long-held assertions that he had no involvement with his son’s business dealings.<p>Biden’s campaign would not rule out the possibility that the former VP had some kind of informal interaction with Pozharskyi, which wouldn’t appear on Biden’s official schedule. But they said any encounter would have been cursory.</i><p>Notably:<p><i>Burisma’s website lists at least some of Pozharskyi’s meetings with U.S. officials, including a meeting in November 2017 with then-ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and a series of meetings with members of Congress, though the company lists only Reps. Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.) and Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) by name. It lists no meetings with Joe Biden. Pozharskyi also reportedly met in 2018 with Kurt Volker</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;biden-campaign-lashes-out-new-york-post-429486" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;biden-campaign-lash...</a>')
