Stack Overflow works very well though, a question-answer format is perfect for support requests. Its also much easier to search or link to. I think that Github issues feel closer to that for many people.<p>Its also important that the project clearly specifies where to ask for help. I&#x27;m often reluctant to open issues that aren&#x27;t bug reports, but the project isn&#x27;t clear where I should ask.')
