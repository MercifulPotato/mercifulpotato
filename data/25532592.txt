He has absolutely recently been working from those assumptions you give.  And I&#x27;m not sure what you are saying the distinction is between the approach you recommend and what he is suggesting in that paper.<p>I mean for an example of people that are really tuned into the real requirements of AGI, look at Joshua Tenenbaum and his collaborators over the years.<p>I don&#x27;t see people being in denial about conscious reasoning.  I do see quite a lot of loose and ambiguous usage of that word.  So maybe you can try defining your use.  Self-awareness, cognition that one is aware of versus subconscious cognition, high-level reasoning, &quot;what it feels like&quot;, localization and integration of information, etc. are all related but different things.  But researchers have been trying to address those things.  Maybe their papers have not been as popular as GPT-3 though.')
