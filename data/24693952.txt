Item(by='mncharity', descendants=None, kids=[24694034], score=None, time=1601947874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24693111, text='&gt; One issue is that the scales don&#x27;t well-match. [...] <i>many</i> time-scales<p>Indeed, teaching of scale pervasively fails.  Physical, temporal, and other.  But it&#x27;s also taught very very badly.  Thus it seems an open question how well it might be taught, and to whom.<p>Might we teach it better?  This[1] (mine) illustrates one speculative approach to teaching size down to atoms, for a young and outreach audience.  And here&#x27;s[2] an old attempt at helping develop a feel for torque, down to picoNewton-nanometers.  Many years back I started on a temporal zoomer - don&#x27;t know if it would have worked, but I&#x27;ve not seen anything similar since.  I recall some work on teaching deep time in intro geology as being rather nice.<p>Interactives with physically realistic molecular motion are vanishingly rare, and I&#x27;ve never seen a one with temporal zoom.  So I suggest we&#x27;re not even trying yet to explore whether we can teach this well.<p>Those last two &quot;Inner Life ...&quot; videos are regrettably even more misleading than the original.  Motion in the original was aphysical, but at least it was simple.  Those two retain that aphysicality, and add aphysical jiggle, further obscuring how badly you&#x27;re being misled.<p>Creating educational content to support an excellent understanding of science is ghastly hard.  So much so, that I suggest we&#x27;re not even really trying yet.  Which would mean how hard it will be to teach, once such content exists, is necessarily an open question.  I wish I knew of folks exploring it.<p>[1] first section of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clarifyscience.info&#x2F;part&#x2F;Atoms" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clarifyscience.info&#x2F;part&#x2F;Atoms</a> (page loads slowly - was meeting prep, not intended to be public)\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clarifyscience.info&#x2F;part&#x2F;ZoomB?v=A&amp;p=CK6Ji&amp;m=torque" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clarifyscience.info&#x2F;part&#x2F;ZoomB?v=A&amp;p=CK6Ji&amp;m=torq...</a>')
