That is literally what they did.  The trailing closure syntax <i>is</i> Smalltalk keyword syntax, and so Smalltalk keyword syntax is used for that one special case.  Which exists in addition to the non-keyword trailing closure syntax and the non-trailing (regular argument) closure syntax.<p>&gt; but it&#x27;s not fair to say Swift &#x27;added Smalltalk syntax to address a special case&#x27;.<p>Can you explain how it is &quot;unfair&quot; when that is exactly what happened?  Smalltalk syntax is really compact, there just isn&#x27;t that much there.')
