On a $0.99 sale typical rates are 3% + $0.30. I’m quite certain Apple doesn’t pay full rate, but it’s entirely probable that they lose money on smaller transactions.<p>They have soft costs for app review and distribution but I can’t imagine they are significant whatsoever relative to merchant fees.<p>This is a fantastic loss leader to build marketshare and nurture app growth. They will probably have a lot of fledgling devs plow that incremental money right back into ads in a ‘virtuous’ cycle.')
