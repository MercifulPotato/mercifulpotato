I settled for DNAT for v4 &amp; DROP^ for v6 because that&#x27;s what I could get done that evening and it didn&#x27;t (and hasn&#x27;t) seem(ed) to be a problem.<p>^(as in, anything trying to use a different IP, if it&#x27;s already destined for my DNS that&#x27;s fine. The hope being that it falls back on v4 at least, even if not the provided DNS over v6.)')
