If you expect a task to be completed in 1h, just give 2h. Of course that implies that you don&#x27;t give a task which would take an expected 6h to complete.<p>Of course these are things to consider from the company side, if they think they want to hire people who can program under high pressure, they should probably keep that as part of the interview, for both the company&#x27;s and interviewee&#x27;s sake.')
