Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604442514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24981766, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve often heard HNers state that Project Zero is unwilling&#x2F;uninterested in protecting the interests of the vulnerable host<p>I think that&#x27;s usually people that just vastly prioritize the interests of the vulnerable host compared to the interests of all the users.<p>To my eyes it&#x27;s obvious there&#x27;s a trade-off to be made between protecting the company and protecting the people affected.  Too little time is detrimental to one party (sometimes both to some degree), while too much time is definitely detrimental to the other.  It&#x27;s a fine line to walk, but the best thing you can do is be consistent.  Nobody is served well if the companies&#x2F;projects in question work under the assumption that more time will be given because it has to others in the past, and then it isn&#x27;t, as the company may not have correctly prioritized the fix, and then the public is left vulnerable as well.  But to not be consistent leads to abuses of the system where things just don&#x27;t get fixed.<p>At this point, I don&#x27;t think anyone can accuse Project Zero of being inconsistent, and 90 days is a long time to get something fixed if you put the resources towards it that it needs.  I have little sympathy for a company that mismanages this process at this point.  For an open source project, there&#x27;s always groups and lists you can go to and ask for help if it seems overwhelming for the project you have.  Presumably if it&#x27;s an important enough project some person or company that cares about it will donate some time.  If nobody is willing then my guess is that the project&#x27;s not that important to people.<p>There&#x27;s also the possibility that the problem is so large or so fundamental that fixing it is a herculean task.  Maybe in that case people are better off moving to an alternative if they care about the problem.  Sometimes things are so bad the best choice is just to jump ship.  It sucks for that company or project, but they have no right to my usage, but I do have a right to choose what I want.')
