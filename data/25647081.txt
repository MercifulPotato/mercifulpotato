This is complicated if you have a big monolith with a diverse traffic pattern - so knowing your auth API can support up to 1k QPS on your existing h&#x2F;w is not super helpful for example. There are ways to work around this, but kind of complicated to enumerate all the scenarios in a comment.<p>This still needs some sort of state building, but this should be a lot easier than setting up state using a UI &#x2F; clicking buttons.')
