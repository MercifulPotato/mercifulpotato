She lives in Amsterdam while I am on the other side of the country. Why? Because I am planning on moving there so why would I try to find a relationship at my current location.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;ve used it plenty of times before traveling to set it to a country where I will be going. I am very clear about not wanting a hookup and just meet up with locals and that has been working quite well.<p>Not everything is about having a hookup.')
