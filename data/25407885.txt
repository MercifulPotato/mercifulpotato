Mr. Bourla wanted the vaccine done by October and as many as 100 million doses by year’s close, enough for 50 million people. Instead about half that will be produced.&quot;<p>It&#x27;ll be very interesting to see just how many people will take the vaccine over the next 6 months or so. I just had two nurses tell me that they will NOT be taking the vaccine, they are too scared of it. Based on what other folks have said, I&#x27;m guessing the number is going to be much lower than hoped. I am really hoping I&#x27;m wrong. It doesn&#x27;t worry me at all.')
