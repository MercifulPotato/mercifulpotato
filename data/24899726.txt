It publishes a lot of &quot;tabloid&quot; stuff that&#x27;s worth skipping - celebrity sitings, silly videos that went virals about cats or people trying to escape the police by doing cartwheels, and outlandish headlines. But if you read certain sections (Sports, Business, Metro), the articles are written as they would be in any other outlet (with the exception that maybe the Opinion &amp; Editorial section is more conservative leaning than other NY newspapers).')
