If Google shouldn&#x27;t be paying to take the content and redistribute it, who should?<p>Personally I think there should be state funding for unbiased news so that neither the reader nor Google need to pay directly, but that&#x27;s not where we are right now, all the important journalism is published by for-profit websites and it&#x27;s behind paywalls. Given that, I don&#x27;t think it should be surprising if a news site sees Google harvesting paragraphs from their articles and embedding them into results and goes &#x27;hey, who said you could do that without paying for it?&#x27;<p>Google Search infoboxes for a person or place or other topic typically are crammed full of information that Googlebot pulled from various parts of the internet. It&#x27;s really useful to have that info! But if the websites that the info was sourced from rely on ad revenue, well, Google&#x27;s spider didn&#x27;t click on any ads.<p>I don&#x27;t think Google paying news sites for the privilege of indexing them is going to fix the revenue model for online news, but I also don&#x27;t believe that the value of those news snippets is zero. As the article notes, their attempted solution was to switch to Headlines Only (which is what I get in the US right now), but the court objected since that was an obvious attempt to avoid paying by shipping an inferior product.')
