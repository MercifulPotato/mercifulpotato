While I&#x27;ve also gone through derailleurs they do seem to handle power better than planetary drives and have the additional advantage of feeling far more like a direct drive. One of the advantages of a bicycle is its simplicity, there is not much between your feet and whatever goes for road you happen to be on. I&#x27;ll gladly give up 2% of efficiency to keep the system simple, repairable with off-the-shelf parts which can be found anywhere in the world and affordable.')
