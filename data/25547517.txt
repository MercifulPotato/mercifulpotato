One of them didn&#x27;t even mount in the .git directory, it just propagated some commit info via environment variables. I also like to split the publishing of artifacts from the deployment process to make sure it&#x27;s repeatable. This also ensures that the CI pipeline doesn&#x27;t have direct access to production.')
