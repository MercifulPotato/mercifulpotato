It was the map included in the Fire phone and tablet, and also it&#x27;s used in the online shop, such as for showing the parcel on the map, among other things. When I left HERE it was also heavily using AWS, so it&#x27;s a two-way relationship.<p>For those who may not be familiar with HERE, they&#x27;re huge on Enterprise, especially in Automotive, logistics but also on public sector.<p>HERE used to be part of Nokia and used to power their maps application. It&#x27;s now owned by a wide consortium where the well-known German car making companies still have a majority. They also heavily use HERE maps and location based services, as many other car makers do. Not sure if they still do, but when I left, it was heavily used by Microsoft for Bing maps. Yahoo and Facebook maps were all based on the HERE map data and used many of the the same backend services.<p>Note: I currently work at AWS and previously worked at HERE but this message is not written on behalf of my current&#x2F;former employer.')
