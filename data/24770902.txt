If I wipe out the bootloader on a phone its unrecoverable because I don&#x27;t know how to flash it directly to the chip and I don&#x27;t have a copy of the bootloader to even flash. Its a brick because I will never be able to use the device again. If I send it off to the factory in china they could certainly restore the device to working condition again but it would cost more than a new device if they even accept my one off job.<p>If a DRM system triggers on a car and I can&#x27;t disable it its now bricked if the dealer won&#x27;t come and fix it.')
