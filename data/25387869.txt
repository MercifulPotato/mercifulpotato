Neither time did I think they did a good job of hearing the sides of the case and deciding on solid principles or written foundations. It&#x27;s pretty much a matter of who sees it and makes a subjective call. It&#x27;s also shocking that the first several tiers of customer support is seemingly run by volunteers (or otherwise ill-equipped people).<p>The success of the trust and brand issue is largely due to the number of well meaning hosts far outnumbering the bad and AirBnb keeping the bad stories not get viral too often.<p>The &#x27;keep your rating high&#x27; has been around since eBay and could easily be copied.
