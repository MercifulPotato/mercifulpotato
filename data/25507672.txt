I’m talking about Technical debt arising from organizational flaws and issues and your statement made me realize this concept doesn’t exist. Nobody has ever dealt with this form of technical debt ever in the history of existence.<p>You’re right, everything I said is completely wrong. I’m not a biased person so I admit when I’m wrong.<p>Also note that this post is not sarcastic. I am 100% serious and being honest here. You are completely right. This is not a joke. It’s rare for people to do a 180 flip so I can see how this post can come off as sarcasm. I am not most people and this post is earnest.')
