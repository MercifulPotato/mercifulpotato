We basically only compare our health system to the us. And americans, if they compare to anyone at all, really only look at us or the uk. and we both have a version of medicare for all effectively.<p>I reckon the bulk of americans would be surprised to learn that europe does <i>not</i> have medicare for all as their solution or that the private sector has a substantial role.<p>A substantial amount of americaâ€™s dysfunction is due to entrenched tax code provisions (health insurance not being a taxable benefit, mortgage interest deduction, govt mortgage market insurance backstops, etc), and this is mostly invisible as the discourse focusses on government spending only.')
