Unless we had footage of them at the time, the two scenarios are very difficult to distinguish.<p>Some war stories have paralleled this.  Troops cut off from chain of command have talked spoken of non-existent leaders (officers, sergeants etc) giving them instructions.  After the fact this can look like lies, made up stories to excuse some behavior.  They may have actually perceived the individual, or they may only later <i>remember</i> that they perceived the individual.  They did not consciously create the person, but nevertheless the person only appears in their minds after the events.  Some 9&#x2F;11 survivors spoke of being rescued by people who we now know did not actually exist.  That doesn&#x27;t mean the survivors don&#x27;t truly remember them.')
