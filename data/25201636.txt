I can’t ask them to work late or work more days, because I don’t own them.<p>It is my job as a leader to ensure that their time is protected, and I’ve pushed back on management multiple times when last minute changes were requested and my team would need to work more to fill that request. I put myself in the line of fire and say that I don’t have the capacity in my team to fulfill that without cutting work.<p>I ask my team to tell me if I ever overstep and they feel uncomfortable saying no when they really want to.<p>I also encourage all of my employees to interview outside the team&#x2F;company so they know their worth and understand that they have the ability to leave if they ever feel our power dynamic is being abused and I don’t do anything to fix it.<p>Leaders can effectively manage teams and deliver on vision without abusing the employer-employee power dynamic. It makes leadership more difficult since you have less flexibility in the capacity of your team (capped at 40 hrs&#x2F;week and can’t suddenly expand to 80 hrs&#x2F;week), but it makes for better teams and happier people.')
