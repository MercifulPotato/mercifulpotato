I donâ€™t think so<p>I agree.<p>It would be swell if, as part of the bigger open source movement, Jeff, Bill, and Larry - who at their disposal have AWS, Microsoft, and Google - competed with one another to submit the meritocratically superior implementation of our meritocratically determined open source standards, and then we, as custodians of the open source project, would select the winner, merge it, and use it - to the exclusion of all other implementations - not because of bias, but because of the truth underlying our meritocracy.<p>The question for me is - when we engage in said meritocracy, with all these BDFLs calling the shots, will they be the ones to negotiate with Jeff, Bill, and Larry? Or will we?')
