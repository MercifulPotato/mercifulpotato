Huge cash cow. They lost that for a while due to the iPhone and Google and stuff moving to the Web and mobile.<p>Now they’re back.<p>The fonts and aesthetics remind me of using Windows apps 20 years ago. This ain’t Google. Small, crisp verdana, tahoma or whatever.<p>Meetings done right.\nOffice - Word, Excel - integrated. Tons of plugin support.<p>Compared to Slack, this is way better. And compared to Google Suite, well... Teams is faster and actually feels like a product teams would live in day-in and day-out. No need for slack, zoom, gmail and a hodgepodge of other things.<p>Microsoft also has a huge cache of businesses who would literally onboard their entire company and pay monthly recurring revenues. They have successfully gotten back into the Microsoft Office business.<p>Except this time it’s recurring revenues and on the mobile too. Even if Microsoft doesn’t sell mobile devices. They are going to eclipse Google with businesses if Google keeps doing its cute slow Web based interfaces, imho.<p>And I say this as a person who has not used Windows for 15 years, who hardly ever used Office or Office 360 until literally trying Teams as part of a consulting gig.<p>It’s amazing. And it’s very Microsoft.')
