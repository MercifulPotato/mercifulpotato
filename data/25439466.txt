The phone doesn&#x27;t become a brick after those 3 yrs though, all apps and tools remain updated independently of the OS, actually Androids receive those software updates for longer than iphones. I&#x27;ve got a few very old phones and tablets that are still as useful as on their 1st day, though well behind the current stuff.')
