But I haven&#x27;t been enlightened by LISP yet so perhaps it&#x27;s just me.<p>In particular,<p>&gt; Many domains see repeated patterns that are difficult or impossible to express as a library. Macros can allow those patterns to be expressed in a more concise and less error prone way.<p>On the contrary, I believe such generic multi-domain libraries would be a hot mess to maintain. These abstractions would be way too high level, and undoubtedly different fields have significant, if small,  different requirements.')
