Reddit r&#x2F;sino is a great place to read the opposition. \nThere are ALWAYs two sides to these stories. Many are fabricated to apply for diplomatic immunity.<p>Uighers represent a very small minority of the overall Chinese population, but almost all domestic terrorism (when the campaign against their culture started in 2014). Yes, their religious culture is being attacked, yes many (most) are good people, yet as Muslims they self-identify as separate from the han culture. It also is used by &quot;bad&quot; Uighers to do hide crime, not pay taxes, etc. The muslim community has a very us vs them mentality which is not healthy for national unity that china ccp desires. So the Chinese are cracking down. China has a 5000 year old culture and a majority of people experienced significant hardships and starvation in the last century. They emphasize national unity (vs individalism) in a way western people cannot even begin to understand, but belonging to such a group is not entirely bad. This Uigher generation is suffering so the future uigher can fit into the society better.')
