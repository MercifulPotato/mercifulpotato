Partly because they&#x27;ve always had one of the best assemblies of kernel people and other heavy-hitters, and are just generally credible for production.<p>With CentOS (before this latest news) possibly making a lot of sense for when you don&#x27;t have the budget for RHEL, or don&#x27;t yet have it, like for startups.  Which then gives an easier upgrade path to nobody-ever-got-fired-for-buying-IBM&#x2F;RHEL.<p>I don&#x27;t have as much confidence in Ubuntu, and the last few months of monitoring security update regressions hasn&#x27;t reinforced confidence.  And the Grub problem this year, which could&#x27;ve bricked some remote devices for me, and where some other distros seemed more earnest and upfront about the problem.  I&#x27;ve also grown skeptical of Snap (especially on workstations and servers, though I haven&#x27;t yet ruled it out for appliances, as an easier path than Yocto).<p>For personal systems, I&#x27;ve been using Debian Stable for about 20 years (which I initially moved to because the APT network package management experience was vastly better than scouring various RPM sites or building from source, and later decided I also like the principles).  And recent Ubuntu experience is making Debian compare favorably for some kinds of production use, though I&#x27;m aware of some of the substantial weaknesses of that.<p>Of course, then there&#x27;s containers, which sometimes encourages a stripped-down distro within the container, and different requirements for what&#x27;s hosting or orchestrating those.')
