The latter optimisation model was not exact but it could generate close-to-optimal strategies for e.g. pension savings, buying houses and how to best spend the savings after retirement. The best strategies were then fed back into the exact model, evaluated and presented to the user.<p>It requires a pretty complex tax system to really generate a lot of value for the clients so its value was lower in the neighbouring countries that had separated their social systems more from the tax system.')
