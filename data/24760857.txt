The underlying functionality and performance of the implementation is excellent. The user experience is poor, it took me several years to get really fluent. There are still things I know I don&#x27;t know and some occasional surprises. The repos are such a success story that they won&#x27;t go away for years. But if someone came up with a more consistent user interface that would not harm. It&#x27;s a huge job though, if you want to cover the full functionality. And if you don&#x27;t do that you will create a new inconsistency, because power users will sooner or later need to fall back to the current user interface.')
