(Full disclaimer, I didn&#x27;t make the concept, and can&#x27;t find the post that I read it from)<p>For every long rest, you get a limited number of spell slots - for example at level 5 you get 4 level 1 spell slots, 3 level 2 spell slots, and 2 level 3 spell slots. These are all the &quot;major&quot; spells you can cast before you need to long rest again.<p>Some things may be more straightforward, and only take a level 1 spell slot. But it&#x27;s still possible to run out of those. Luckily, you&#x27;re able to use a higher level spell slot to cast that same spell. Sometimes this makes the &quot;spell&quot; more effective (using a higher level spell slot for programming might relate to intentionally putting more focus on it), other times you&#x27;re just burning the higher leveled slot.<p>Other actions&#x2F;spells may take more focus&#x2F;concentration&#x2F;energy&#x2F;effort to do, akin to using a higher leveled spell slot. Naturally you can&#x27;t do as many of those without resting.<p>Still other actions&#x2F;spells are trivial for you to do. You can do those as many times as you&#x27;d like, and you don&#x27;t feel (significantly) affected by them. These are your cantrips - the simplest spells, that can still be very useful.<p>I like this variation of the theory not just for the gaming flavor, but also because it changes the concept slightly from &quot;this takes more spoons than that&quot; to differently sized spoons, which feels more in line with how I relate to the tasks that give me trouble.')
