In contrast, drywall, painting, and landscaping tend to be lower-skilled and easier to draw from the general labor pool.<p>You can have a high-productivity manufacturing center start with a pre-fab &quot;core&quot; built out of a modular shipping container, and pre-fab roof trusses. In parallel, you prep the site including any lot development and laying the concrete foundation. You then install the core and trusses on site, and can finish up the drywall and paining very quickly.<p>The core contains all the complex plumbing, electrical work, HVAC and kitchen work. The finished house looks indistinguishable from regular construction, and you can stand up single family homes or duplexes in under two months.')
