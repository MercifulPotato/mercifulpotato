Your experience is also not particularly insightful regarding the future of VR - your expectations appear to be for a finished, polished device, and anything short is sufficient for declaring a whole category dead.<p>Progress isn&#x27;t linear.  There have been significant jumps in the past few years. Sales appear to be supply constrained.  Many people have lots of joyful experiences.<p>That said, your conclusion may be correct.  Predicting the future is hard, and your subjective perspective doesn&#x27;t justify the certainty with which you comment.<p>That said, this is probably not a constructive conversation for either of us, or HN.  I wish you a pleasant day.')
