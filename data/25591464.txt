I always have a command line attached to my notebooks. When using jupyter lab I attach the  build-in terminal and place it at the bottom. When using notebooks I attach it from my terminal.<p>The experience in Rstudio is still better imho. Itâ€™s also a more mature text editor and ide than jupyter.')
