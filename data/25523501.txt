The poster who called it &quot;casual racism&quot; may well have been jumping to conclusions. It&#x27;s totally possible they didn&#x27;t use the most generous interpretation of OP&#x27;s words hastily accused them of something that was not intended or even present in OP&#x27;s statement.<p>If they were alleging bias or bigotry based on nationality, it&#x27;s not the dictionary definition of racism but it&#x27;s something equally bad. You and I both know what they were actually alleging, right? So nitpicking the specific term they used is counterproductive to the discussion - especially when there isn&#x27;t an easy, single word to describe bigotry based on nationality or national origin.<p>I&#x27;m objecting to the logic that goes &quot;racism = bad, X group isn&#x27;t a race but a nationality&#x2F;ethnicity&#x2F;religion&#x2F;&lt;something else immutable whose -phobia word isn&#x27;t well known&gt;, therefore this != racism, therefore this != bad&quot;. I know you mean well and I hope you understand where I&#x27;m coming from.')
