Item(by='xapata', descendants=None, kids=[25072028], score=None, time=1605199771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071390, text='&gt; living in captivity<p>That&#x27;s a big leap, and you&#x27;ve given no explanation for it.  Perhaps we have different understandings of what captivity means, so it&#x27;d be helpful if you define your terms.  To me, captivity is a location (or metaphorical location, so a situation) you want to leave, but can&#x27;t.  In the article, the narrator does not indicate a desire to leave, or any difficulty doing so if they wished.  The bit about being recorded hints at it, but we&#x27;d have to assume there are no other cities in the world, or some other unstated bit about a police state.')
