The National Guard&#x27;s superiors are the DoD and the President, not the Mayor.<p>Approval of DC National Guard reinforcements was ultimately a job that was squarely in the Trump Administration&#x27;s responsibility.<p>------<p>It is clear that everyone underestimated the scope of the threat on 1&#x2F;5th. But virtually everyone who was &quot;near&quot; the Capitol was going full-on panic mode by 2:30 (when the building was fully breached).<p>Well, everyone except the DoD &#x2F; DC National Guard for some reason.
