If you have iMessage in your phone it’s completely tied to Apple whole data  gathering context because your phone is made by Apple.<p>I understand what you’re saying. If the App is only collecting certain amount of information on its own, then they should only list that right? ... But that’s unfair with the rest of the vendors because they are forced to list everything they track, while iMessage obscures it by saying “the app doesn’t collect anything”...yet the phone is and iMessage is the default messaging system for iOS.<p>I’m a loyal Apple user but this is anti-competitive behavior. As much as I love Apple’s privacy focus, it seems that they’re using it as a proxy to unfairly compete with other companies and claim that they only care about the end’s user privacy, which is clearly not true.<p>Apple does and will use your data to push Apple products. They should be transparent about that.')
