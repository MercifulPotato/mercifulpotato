Hardware switches packets out equally viable pathways by hashing some of the attributes of the packet. Hash output % number of pathways selects which pathway at every hop.<p>Hardware does this because everyone wants all packets involved in the same &quot;flow&quot; (all packets with the same src&#x2F;dest IP and port and protocol (TCP)) to deterministically go through the same set of pipes to avoid packet re-ordering. If you randomly sprayed packets, the various buffer depths of routers (or even speed of light and slightly different length fibers along the way) could cause packets to swap ordering. While TCP &quot;copes&quot; with reordering, it doesn&#x27;t like it and and older implementations slowed way down when it happened.')
