I can ask it to tell me who the artist&#x2F;track is.  I use it as a radio, I can play FM stations around the country.  I use it to set a timer, countdown, alarm.  I use it for a calendar.  I ask it to read bedtime stories, or to entertain the kids, what sound does a horse make, etc.  You can do a lot with it, but it&#x27;s really worrisome too.  Sometimes I turn it off, but I hate that I have to walk over to it.  I&#x27;ll like a switch I can control from my phone or an external device...')
