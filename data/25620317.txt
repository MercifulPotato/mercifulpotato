It&#x27;s there because zig doesn&#x27;t have overloaded function params. Print must take two arguments.<p>The || syntax is used elsewhere in zig, if statements, catch, switch, etc.<p>There&#x27;s no requirement for a function inside a struct to act on the contents of structs, so it&#x27;s reasonable to use structs as namespaces.  This is what is happening when you @import, for example.  The imported file becomes a struct.<p>This is quite different from a lot of other PLs, but it is <i>pleasantly</i> consistent when you get used to it.<p>There is a usingnamespace keyword to make a structs public contents spill out into the current scope.  It&#x27;s to be used sparingly.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m wrong! It&#x27;s an anonymous struct with number fields, not an anonymous array.')
