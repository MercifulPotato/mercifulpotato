Item(by='defen', descendants=None, kids=[25036854], score=None, time=1604935432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25032844, text='I think &quot;Trump asked the Russians to find Hillary Clinton&#x27;s emails&quot; is entirely uncontroversial. Saying he asked the Russians to &quot;hack&quot; the &quot;Democrats&quot; involves two inferences and seems like a statement designed to maximize discord. The Russians are not in Donald Trump&#x27;s chain of command, there are other ways to find her emails than hacking, and Hillary Clinton is not &quot;the Democrats&quot;.<p>This will be my last post on the topic because it reminds of the &quot;blue dress&#x2F;green dress&quot; thing someone posted way up thread. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re posting in good faith, and I assure you I am too, but it is just not at all obvious to me why someone would say &quot;Donald Trump asked the Russians to hack the Democrats&quot; instead of &quot;Donald Trump asked the Russians to find Hillary Clinton&#x27;s emails&quot;.')
