This isn&#x27;t even including just having new systems for moving electronic US dollars around in Apple wallets etc, and cashing into local currency as needed through other services.<p>Bitcoins &quot;real&quot; value is a storage of value, which is currently based on speculation desires of holders, which in theory could hold forever (or at least longer than you can remain solvent as a short or long enough for you to 10x or 100x so who cares) but could also disappear forever and not be missed once gone.<p>The only moat is belief, which really who knows if that is sticky or not. There is no tangible functional moat.')
