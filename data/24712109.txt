This assumes that current tech industry labor conditions will continue indefinitely, which seems unsustainable.<p>There&#x27;s also a strong libertarian or at least individualist strain of thought in both Silicon Valley culture and in engineering which presumes that those high salaries are because of one&#x27;s inherent 10x rockstar ninja abilities, and not because of market conditions. Also often a trend towards apoliticism, wanting to just be left alone to code and not engage in the dirty tribalist business of politicking.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s a widespread conception that &quot;unions have failed, unions just can&#x27;t work.&quot; This despite that labor unions did work in the past, do continue to work outside of the U.S., and somehow an industry focused on disruption and innovation is unable to improve on unions.')
