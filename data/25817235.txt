It feels that I&#x27;m not progressing as an engineer and basically what I&#x27;m doing every day is working with legacy stuff or editing config files which is very monotonous. No challenging stuff or learning something new. Overall TC is way below the market (SF Bay Area).<p>I&#x27;ve been doing some leetcode in a free time but it feels that it&#x27;s not enough.<p>I tried to apply to some random positions applying but got a rejection because I feel that my resume seems unattractive because what I&#x27;m doing is hardly applicable for software engineering; technologies I&#x27;ve been using either legacy or not popular.<p>Are there any ways how to get out of this situation?')
