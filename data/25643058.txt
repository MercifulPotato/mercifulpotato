You can read it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;2773108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jama&#x2F;article-abstract&#x2F;27731...</a><p>The results: &quot;In this randomized trial that included <i></i>152<i></i> adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset within 7 days, clinical deterioration occurred in 0 patients treated with fluvoxamine vs 6 (8.3%) patients treated with placebo over 15 days, a difference that was statistically significant.&quot;<p>Not bad results, but seems like a big jump to suggest that all doctors change their treatment procedures based on this study. I&#x27;m interested to see larger studies, especially with longer follow-up durations.')
