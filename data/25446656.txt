Waiting a day and doing another test means that the low-level infection you missed yesterday has had another day to replicate, making it easier to detect.<p>You&#x27;re also probably much more infectious when the virus is at levels that are detectible by the antigen tests, so even if you miss it when it&#x27;s at a low level, as long as you detect it when you get really infectious it can help lower your chances of transmitting it.')
