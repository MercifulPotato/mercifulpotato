Really excited to share what we&#x27;ve been working on!<p>Storylocks is a collaborative, chapter-based writing platform  inspired by the choose-your-own-adventure books we read as kids. We wanted to create a platform that lets creative writers &#x2F; hobbyists contribute to larger communal &amp; ongoing stories, but without the pressure of having to write an entire novel on their shoulders.<p>There are plenty of other writing platforms out there, but we set out to create one that has a more collaborative approach from the get-go. If you like it, feel free to sign up and create a story - maybe pen the first chapter too :) Cheers!')
