Scaling vertically via hardware as much as possible is IMO the most developer-time saving way. Once that&#x27;s exhausted you&#x27;ll have to decide which one is easier.<p>The biggest mistake I see is people spending a lot of time designing for horizontal scalability and then running a cluster of under-powered servers when a single powerful machine would do just fine.<p>There are very few things that are easier in a cluster (uptime perhaps?) and many that are easier on a single machine. Once you add the requirement of having to work in a cluster, every new feature will have to respect that. If your system is doing anything interesting you&#x27;ll be hitting all the distributed computing dilemmas pretty fast.')
