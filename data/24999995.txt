Three ways that are de-facto standarized for CLIs for discoverability (where UI has almost no de-facto standards like this):<p>- `man $program` - Usually shows EVERYTHING you can do with the tool<p>- `$program --help` - shows a brief help with flags, parameters and commands<p>- `$program $cmd --help` specific help for that command<p>Most CLI tools implement these and most of everyone who is using a terminal daily knows about those three ways.<p>In the GUI world, you sometimes have a &quot;Help&quot; link in the menu bar, that either opens a little widget or a web page. Nothing like man pages for GUIs.')
