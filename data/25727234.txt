I have never been on Parler&#x27;s site so I can not check the veracity of their supposed implied or direct support for seditious acts but that does not seem to matter anyway, it is enough to stand accused to be considered a witch and burned at the stake.<p>Build your own is the device, keep your equipment on your own premises, make sure not to have single points of failure - that implies you need to have a backup access provider just in case your internet connection gets cancelled. Don&#x27;t rely on electronic payment processors, you can use them but make sure to have a backup. Don&#x27;t rely on a single bank, have multiple accounts, preferably in more than one country.<p>It is a sad thing that it has to come to this but I think we&#x27;ll eventually end up with politicised service institutions which cater to &quot;progressives&quot;, others which cater to &quot;conservatives&quot;. They won&#x27;t state this directly but it will be known that a conservative builder is better of at this bank and that insurance company, he&#x27;ll prefer to buy this coffee and that brand of razor, etc. A shame, really, the more divided society becomes, the harder it will be to find a common cause when such is needed, e.g. in case of a national emergency like an epidemic.')
