As a language, F# is _very_ good (although  not as good as the original OCaml, whose features had to be cut to be able to run on CLR). It&#x27;s just not first-class citizen, so not everything may work with F#. And F#&#x27;s own development and features are blocked on CLR -- instead of F# charting its own path, each feature first has to be available for C#&#x2F;CLR and only then will F# developers implement it (higher-kinded types are just one example).<p>But it&#x27;s still much more pleasant &quot;syntactic sugar to write the CIL bytecode&quot; than C# can ever be.<p>&gt; even Scala is dead<p>I beg to differ! Thankfully, Scala is very much not dead. Scala 3 is around the corner, with many more features and, even more importantly, several simplifications. And the community is also much larger compared to F# (or any other ML language, like Haskell). Innovation also takes place in the realm of libraries, like ZIO for example.')
