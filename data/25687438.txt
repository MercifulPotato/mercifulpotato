Item(by='simple20200107', descendants=None, kids=[25702316], score=None, time=1610128105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25684800, text='T-Mobile has phones as cheap as $150 (admittedly probably not great but still work), and quality phones as low as $400 or $500 for lower end or older iPhone&#x2F;Pixel models. If you don&#x27;t know if you can spend $150-$500 for a minor emergency, then you don&#x27;t have an emergency fund which is easily the #1 priority for personal finances. Same for the Aeron - if you don&#x27;t know if you can afford a $150 chair, you shouldn&#x27;t buy it. The amount of the sale is irrelevant by the way - buying something you don&#x27;t need that is 90% off is still a waste of money.')
