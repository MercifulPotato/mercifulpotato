I was curious, and it looks like the parser code to retrieve the data is open source; so here&#x27;s the relevant module for Australia:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tmrowco&#x2F;electricitymap-contrib&#x2F;blob&#x2F;24ea22232a43cb54d3733e7c97c281855225efb2&#x2F;parsers&#x2F;AU.py" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tmrowco&#x2F;electricitymap-contrib&#x2F;blob&#x2F;24ea2...</a><p>The production mix (energy generation by source) source URL is listed on L326.<p>Opening the dataset in LibreOffice Calc, filtering by Region = QLD1, filtering for Current Output &gt; 0, and sorting by Current Output descending does seem to show that the vast bulk of production reported has fuel source descriptor &#x27;Black Coal&#x27;.<p>If that&#x27;s a bug in the reported data or source, hopefully the ElectricityMap team can jump in to take a look.  The data initially seems legit, from searching for some of the power stations listed.<p>Edit &#x2F; addendum: worth searching for Australia in the project&#x27;s GitHub issues too; there&#x27;s some existing (although not directly related) investigation &amp; validation work ongoing for that module')
