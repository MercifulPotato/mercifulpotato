I live in the liberal &#x2F; Democratic state of Washington, where most of the public officials have taken Covid seriously. To my horror, I discovered it was VERY difficult to get a Covid test. I searched online for facilities that did testing, and called 10 of them. Most of them either put me into eternal hold or told me I wasn&#x27;t an existing patient. Finally, I drove to a Walgreens after being told by a rep that I would be tested there. Nope, pharmacist refused. Finally, I went o a private testing company. I spent 4-5 hours calling and driving just to get this done.<p>Imagine how many people are quitting sooner than I did and actually have it.')
