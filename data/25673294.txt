I didn&#x27;t know this was so bad. I&#x27;m simply annoyed that some social groups use Facebook to organize, our neighborhood group, the parenting class, so I just can&#x27;t be a part of that and try to move individual people, like my immediate neighbors, onto other platforms. But &quot;bills, ordering food, govt services, parent teacher communications&quot;, that&#x27;s extreme.<p>At least for bills and govt services I wonder, who approves something like that?')
