Realistically at the bleeding edge more and more logic is going into FPGA (and maybe ASIC t some extent). Your software is primarily there to make sure that you&#x27;ve processed the previous tick and re-configured the FPGA rather than actually competing in tick to trade. Given that&#x27;s the case the software doesn&#x27;t need to be the fastest, it just needs to be fast enough.<p>Meanwhile if your logic isn&#x27;t going into FPGA you may well just not be super competitive anyway and therefore the priority is time to market.')
