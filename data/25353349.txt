Turns out that marginal returns on additional education are pretty close to zero. This is depressing, but pretty incontrovertible when you compare between A) returns on education in high-expenditure countries like the US vs low-expenditure EU countries (very similar) B) return on education in the same place across time, with the trend usually being that education expenditure goes up over time and educational returns don&#x27;t change.<p>Above a certain minimal level of education, demographic outcomes like crime rate seem to be 70-80% predicted by entirely heritable characteristics, with very little environmental interaction.')
