Countries <i>love</i> money laundering when the money is coming from overseas and the crime happened not in their jurisdictions. It&#x27;s free money that circulates in the economy, pays some taxes and help their exchange rate. The only reason some of these money laundering hot spots (like Hong Kong or the Emirates) started clamping down on these operations is that the USA and Europe pressured them to. Switzerland removed its secrecy because of FATCA, not because they wanted to.<p>This law passed because 1. The regulator do not care about small guys; 2. They don&#x27;t think small guys are moving that much money and are more trouble than profit; and 3. It looks like they are doing something. It also helps employ some people and maintain big cities real-estate by fake restaurants or shops. Ever wondered how some of these joints are able to pay rent and employees with so little customers?')
