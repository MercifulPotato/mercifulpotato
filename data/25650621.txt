Having walked through the process as a volunteer, you have a much clearer picture of how your donations are spent, and yes you are more likely to donate.<p>Trust has to be earned one way or another.<p>Piggybacking on this home building example with an extreme example: how would you feel if you donated for years to some non profit which builds houses, but later learned that child labor is used to build those as well as cheap, structurally unsound materials, with the non profit CEO pocketing millions?')
