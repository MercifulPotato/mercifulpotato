Even if someone supports renaming a school called Lincoln to something else, the ... extreme nature of such a thing is a consideration for people to consider whether or not SF is a nice place to live.  Because there are people in charge making decisions like this, and people in charge wield power, and if you live in SF you&#x27;ll be subservient to these leaders.<p>I&#x27;ll add, the fact there are people who downvote information is quite possibly another strike against SF.')
