Micro-benchmarks show that it produces programs that run between 10-70x time faster than Python. Flyable is certainly one of the fastest and easiest ways to accelerate your Python code. It finally allows Python to compete in the ring of fast and efficient languages without having to add nasty non-python stuff that some other implementations need.<p>Here is a quick demo (1 min) :<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ed55eb4bf05d4de3bed4443bdb130fc3<p>You can freely register to the beta to try it out at<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;flyable.dev&#x2F; !<p>Thank you !')
