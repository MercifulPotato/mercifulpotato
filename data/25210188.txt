More than anything they seem to want a good partner, somebody who understands them, and is kind, considerate, thoughtful, and interesting.<p>When I see posts declaring that women are, as a class, only interested in a tiny percentage of men, that suggests to me that those men aren&#x27;t very good at being kind, considerate, thoughtful, and interesting. Which is too bad, because those are fairly easy things to achieve, and shouldn&#x27;t be the bar to a relationship.<p>There are lots and lots of other things that get in the way of relationships. Those are hard things, and require a lot of picking through people to find a pair that is able to work on hard things together. That will fail right off the bat if they can&#x27;t do the easy things.')
