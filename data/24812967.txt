In the last year, I had contributed in ways that had tangible benefits to my teammates; however, I&#x27;m not certain of how to repeat these sort of feats.<p>The feedback from my manager is that I&#x27;m doing well, I get along with my team, and everyone seems to pull in the same direction without ego.<p>What should I do? Do I coast and hope for finding the work that needs to be done? Or do I look somewhere else?
