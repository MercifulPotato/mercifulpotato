Not one single &quot;hey, so we set up a terrain avoidance radar and blasted it with variations of 5G communication and guess what?&quot; (my suspicion is the answer would be &quot;no effect&quot;, but let&#x27;s at least do the study, huh?)<p>Radar altimeters use vastly more power than anyone would waste on mere communication. They also don&#x27;t depend on subtle variations in the signal to communicate.  It&#x27;s basically just listening for a return and measuring time-of-flight. Timing measure is more complicated, but doesn&#x27;t depend on subtleties of the signal that could be easily interfered with.  (Full disclosure: I&#x27;ve worked on Herc terrain-avoidance radar, but that was forty years ago.)<p>Note also that commercial aviation pilots don&#x27;t use terrain avoidance radar in normal flight operations. It&#x27;s an emergency system. If you&#x27;re low enough to need it, you&#x27;re supposed to have an airport in sight. If you start getting the &quot;Terrain. Pull Up&quot; warning, several things have already been going wrong for a while.  If you blocked the TAWS system of a commercial airline in normal flight, it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;d even know it.  You&#x27;d have to wait around for a lost or damaged aircraft that was already about to crash, which is a pretty unrewarding hobby.<p>To be honest, I&#x27;d be surprised if the military didn&#x27;t already have a pretty good idea how to spoof terrain avoidance radar, it would be the kind of thing that might be nice to have in a special operations toolkit. But I doubt it looks like sitting on the end of a runway with a cell phone.  More like humping several car batteries, a dish antenna and a Halliburton case full of electronics to the top of a ridge. (Which, another thing: terrain avoidance radar is the opposite of stealthy, you wouldn&#x27;t use it for special operations, especially when you have access to GPS, satellite maps and inertial navigation systems).<p>Even a 5G transmission from ground to geosynchronous orbit would be columnated by a dish, so would only interfere with a moving altimeter for a fraction of a second, and those systems are designed to handle transients. I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t a potential issue, I&#x27;m saying you&#x27;re not going to find out if you limit yourself to interviewing bureaucrats.')
