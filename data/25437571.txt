This forces you into upgrading all of your Ring-depending dependencies in lockstep. You cannot upgrade any until all of these dependencies support the same latest version of Ring.<p>Then you won&#x27;t need to upgrade everything in lockstep.<p>That said, I still do recommend everybody only use the latest version.')
