We have people who use single-scheduler-multiple-nodes clusters at home or at work, and it works quite well! If the scheduler crashes, work continues to run uninterrupted, so there&#x27;s little reason not to start small and scale up.<p>The problem is largely that it&#x27;s tricky to separate out and accurately address these various personas. People looking for a systemd alternative are obviously highly technical and will likely figure everything out through experimentation. However, &quot;small&quot; cluster users need to be carefully educated on the differences between an HA cluster (3+ schedulers) and a single scheduler cluster.<p>Not only that, but we would need to automate testing for each of these recommendations to ensure changes don&#x27;t break an official recommendation.')
