And then that English is translated into code. And at this point, it&#x27;s really just for the sake of Gecko â€“ every other major player just uses a derivative of Webkit.<p>So, if you had Mozilla take stewardship over Blink, you wouldn&#x27;t really need a &quot;standard&quot; anymore. Everyone could just use the same rendering engine, and the code itself would act as the &quot;standard&quot;. Each vendor could then build their own chrome around it.<p>Instead of everyone trying to implement the same stuff the same exact way in multiple rendering engines, forces could be combined.')
