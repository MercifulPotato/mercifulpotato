It&#x27;s an artifact of programming blocks -- you want your movie&#x2F;show&#x2F;sport&#x2F;etc. to start on the hour or half-hour, but the thing before it rarely will end when you want it to (a few seconds of slack time to switch to the next item).  If you have some small-enough unit of time left between the end of the movie and the start of the next slot, you either commission a bunch of micro-length shorts or you run internal promos to fill the gap.')
