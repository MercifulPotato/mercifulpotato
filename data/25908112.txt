Some regulations, maybe some pressures from some agencies about which they are not allowed to talk about. Etc.<p>But at some point I have to wonder about the mind of someone decisive in the company when &quot;are we the baddies&quot; question appears. Do they rationalize and think that &quot;well, we need to do this because security botnets blahblah users have no idea what we are dealing with here and it&#x27;s for their own good even if they don&#x27;t understand it yada yada&quot;, or do they just don&#x27;t give a shit. Or maybe it&#x27;s like with me disliking my government - I definitely don&#x27;t like it but I don&#x27;t feel like fighting that giant machine at the moment, I can&#x27;t do anything on my own, it would require cooperation and a plan and I have some stuff to do.')
