I very much doubt the validity of this argument.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not against testing your employees for phishing attempts. That is extremely valuable. I&#x27;m against using something with an emotional impact as the pretext of the phish, when I believe a more neutral pretext will do just as well.<p>A separate note is that according to the pictures shown, it seems this is also a particularly bad example, as the email has legitimate headers, showing that it&#x27;s coming from godaddy.com - so it would only rely on employees distrusting the contents to recognize it as phishing, which is a bad lesson to teach.')
