Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=[25166868, 25165785], score=None, time=1605909948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25165355, text='&gt; What I&#x27;m commenting on is that anything that is not already completely bought into Apple&#x27;s stack is not there yet, and that reveals where Apple&#x27;s priorities are.<p>Not remotely.<p>It reveals who priorities updating their software to Apple&#x27;s new platform. Apple can&#x27;t control who ports a given piece of software to their new platform and how quickly it gets done. The surface area is too large.<p>All Apple can do is get the tools out there for the people who are doing the porting.<p>Most likely Go and Rust aren&#x27;t ported simply because porting languages is hard and time consuming.<p>&gt; Anything that&#x27;s cross platform or depends on cross platform components needs to play catch up now.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why this is remotely surprising or noteworthy. Apple needed Xcode, Swift, and Objective C running in order to build MacOS. There would not be a platform to try to port to if Apple&#x27;s toolchain wasn&#x27;t working <i>prior</i> to day 1.<p>Rust, Go, React Native, are all by necessity going to be rely on Apple&#x27;s toolchain to run on Apple, so by nature they take longer to build.')
