It&#x27;s not &#x27;a lot&#x27;. Everything running on those phones is a GNU&#x2F;linux application. The fact that there are binary blobs and that the UI was closed source doesn&#x27;t take away from that. The post I was replying to was complaining about linux phones, not about &quot;open hardware&#x2F;open source&quot; phones.')
