Now, 20 years after his speech, we are still stuck with the same notions (such as everything being a string). It&#x27;s not that there are not plenty of alternatives around, however, expectations are so high that it&#x27;s almost impossible to make a new computer system economically viable. On the other hand, the hacker and maker scene is very active, some of them building operating systems and hardware such as tiny Lisp-based machines [2] and OSes [3].  (My only gripe is that most of the new &quot;avant-garde&quot; systems are still text&#x2F;file-based.)<p>I&#x27;d love to see a next wave in personal computing, starting with a clean slate, building on the research, insights and learning from the mistakes that have been made. I have no doubt that it will happen, the question is only when.<p>As for interoperability: Even on the same platform there are countless problems getting software to talk to each other, so I don&#x27;t think that a new system will make the situation any worse.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.herpolhode.com&#x2F;rob&#x2F;utah2000.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.herpolhode.com&#x2F;rob&#x2F;utah2000.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tindie.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;lutherjohnson&#x2F;makerlisp-ez80-lisp-cpm-computer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tindie.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;lutherjohnson&#x2F;makerlisp-ez80...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mezzanos.herokuapp.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mezzanos.herokuapp.com&#x2F;</a>')
