If the water is fully frictionless, it will form a wave moving in phase with the moon, and extract no energy.<p>2. If the water is a solid, it will not move, and extract no energy.<p>1.5. If the water has the perfect viscosity&#x2F;friction&#x2F;resistance to flow, it will be 90 degrees phase away from the moon, and extract the most energy.<p>The real moon is more like 1.1.   Adding more resistance in the form of water turbines will get us closer to the 1.5 scenario, extract more energy, and cause the tides to stop sooner.    Anything humans can build I suspect would be insignificant though...')
