It&#x27;s very big and well funded for a <i>computer science</i> research organization, yes, and most CS departments can&#x27;t match its resources. But the NIH budget is $40 billion, and private pharmaceutical companies do another $80 billion in annual R&amp;D. It&#x27;s interesting that this kind of breakthrough didn&#x27;t come from those sectors.')
