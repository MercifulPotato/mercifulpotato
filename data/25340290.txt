I&#x27;m definitely for ideas that make taxes less regressive, for instance getting rid of the lower long-term capital tax rate is probably good idea and a simple way to raise effective tax rates on the wealthy in a massive way.<p>So you agree with my point.<p>The rest of your comment, I think you&#x27;re making things a little too black and white.  You make it sound like people can either bring attention to the wealth inequality that exists today(&quot;demonize those at the top&quot;), or they can buckle down and do &quot;the hard work of making real, tangible improvements in the lives of those at the bottom,&quot; but not both.  I think both of those are possible at the same time.  Either way, could you please share a specific example of the hard work of making real, tangible improvements in the lives of those at the bottom?  It seems to me like you&#x27;re echoing the old pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps argument, in a third party sense?  Because I&#x27;m really not sure what sort of hard work for making real, tangible improvements wouldn&#x27;t require some kind of money.')
