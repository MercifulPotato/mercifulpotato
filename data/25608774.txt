Background: &gt;7 years at a FAANG.\nIn the &quot;corners of the company&quot; I saw (multiple teams) they <i>do</i> care for people. They invest in us via courses (with transferrable skills, not only internal technologies), by letting us pick projects that are good for advancing our career and learning something else, even when the product would benefit from the n-th quick delivery of results on an already familiar topic.\nThey invest in us by considering us as humans and whenever someone had personal issues, there was some solution offered.\nI saw a low-performer turned into a consistently high-performer by a manager who cared and carved out the time to help the person.\nI saw the effort spent on collecting <i>facts</i> for fair performance reviews - for both ends of the spectrum.\nI saw people having trouble with their direct manager getting moved to other teams, where they ultimately thrived.<p>What is the biggest perk, to complement the big salary? My colleagues. I worked with really amazing people, and learnt a lot from them.<p>Did I end up in the only few good spots at the company and spoke mostly with people in the remaining good ones? Statistically unlikely. I&#x27;m aware there are rotten parts, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the majority.')
