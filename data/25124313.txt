Calling it &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; and doing _nothing_ else is on those trips is, for want of a better word, &quot;cute&quot;.<p>None of these are acts _of substance_.<p>The _fact_ is that no power wants to poke the bear.<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I&#x27;m not saying those nations are wrong to avoid a substantial act. I&#x27;m not even saying China occupying those islands is wrong, nor am I saying it&#x27;s right. I&#x27;m simply saying that no power has or will stand up properly to China. The govt &#x2F; armed forces &#x2F; press &#x2F; etc don&#x27;t like the expansion but they&#x27;re not actually going to do anything about it.<p>As a result, in a couple of decades, the frog will be slowly boiled, and eventually the whole region will be assumed to be China&#x27;s. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.<p>&gt; Similarly, it&#x27;s absurd to claim that there&#x27;s no opposition to Chinese expansionism<p>If you mean me, I made no such claim.<p>I simply said there have been no acts of substance to demonstrate this opposition.<p>I dearly wish I could read and speak Chinese. I haven&#x27;t read the blogs you speak of (so I&#x27;ll accept I&#x27;m ignorant on that), but with that said, is it really a shock that right wing blogs in country A says that nefarious forces in country B or C are itching to invade them? I see that ridiculous narrative often. Americans &#x2F; Australians &#x2F; insert-preferred-power-here thinking China will invade. It&#x27;s tiresome and repetitive. For all of China&#x27;s expansionist angst and insecurity-driven surveillance, I don&#x27;t think of it as a warmongering nation.<p>I didn&#x27;t follow your point about Caesar.')
