I had to do a full text search feature for some text of questionable sources, and some users had taken to using the full width characters for emphasis (I think, they clearly had rules in their head for whey they&#x27;d use it, but I didn&#x27;t know what the rules were).  There are libraries that can handle the official Unicode normalization rules, but users don&#x27;t exactly always pay attention to the official rules, so I get to start finding all sorts of weird little corners of Unicode.<p>Though, as I understand it, the full-width characters are there not for any modern use cases, but for historical reasons having to deal with older character sets.<p>Still interesting.')
