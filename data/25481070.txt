Johnson&#x27;s decision is easy, go with the expertise or ignore it and make something up. Things for some reason seem now always to have to be presented as the policy of one political &quot;team&quot; as if a country can be run by relying entirely on a small group of politicians to come up with all the ideas.<p>We should be using statisticians, virologists, public health advisors, doctors, etc., to come up with suggestions. Maybe a few separate groups. Johnson&#x27;s decision then is &quot;shall I try and circumvent this expert advice or not&quot;.<p>Seems like politicians have no idea how to delegate, and press are so poor at reporting they can&#x27;t somehow cope with presenting things that aren&#x27;t personality competitions.<p>The best thing Johnson could do is sanction his advisors and make sure of the rule of law in their regard - he&#x27;s used his father as a personal representative in governmental actions, but his father has been publicly and openly breaching the rules. Who could possibly honour &quot;Johnson&#x27;s&quot; advice when he won&#x27;t even hold his own personnel to that standard. It&#x27;s beyond ridiculous and shows utter contempt for the British public IMO.')
