My experience is limited to the North-East&#x2F;East-Coast though, so it&#x27;s possible that this is a more regional thing, or possibly even specific to the industries I work in.<p>It&#x27;s possible that state-level laws come into play here too. For example the fact that non-competes are <i>not</i> enforceable in California, where they are generally enforceable on the East-Coast could be a factor in the kind of relationships companies favor.')
