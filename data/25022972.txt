Or anyone else?  If this was just a gaffe factory then surely it would be a staple of the presidential interview genre, no?<p>But it&#x27;s not.  Only Trump got asked that.  Ever, as far as I know.  And the reason isn&#x27;t because we were looking for a gaffe but because <i>there was (AND REMAINS!) significant doubt as to whether he would support a peaceful transition of power</i>.<p>I mean, the current circumstances right now disprove the theory you just proposed.
