I paid less than $200. It is new, it has 15 inch tocscreen and a celeron CPU, passmark score of which blows almost all other chromebook computers that I have seen advertising in the price range double the price of mine.<p>I use it to work with my company provided Amazon Workspaces windows virtual desktop. It has a client for chromebook. It is sitting next to my Core-i7 dell laptop and I only use the dell for video conferencing as the voice and video doesn&#x27;t translate well over virtual desktops. It is the best computer investment I made, in the sense of bang for the buck.\nBy the way, when work is slow, I can minimize the AWS client and do my daily surfing reading HN etc on the same computer.')
