They are net exporting renewable power to Victoria. The fact that Victoria exports back non-renewable power isn&#x27;t in their control.<p>Tasmania is an exceptionally small state. Population 500K. Based on the renewable power sources available, they must rely on a network for stability. Otherwise, they would have to massively over-develop their power infrastructure. This itself would be unsustainable.<p>The issue is not that Tasmania needs to over-build. It&#x27;s that Victoria needs more renewables. If TAS was a net importer, that would be a different story.')
