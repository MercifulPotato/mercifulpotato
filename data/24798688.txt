I would know, I grew up in an Eastern European country in the 1980s. We had shops. What I think you possibly mean is that there is little selection. That is true. But the context here was whether the relevant <i>information</i> was there: Of the things that are there, what do they prefer? What sort of things do they ask for that are not available?<p>The difference to capitalism is that in capitalism this kind of information does trickle &quot;upwards&quot; to the wider economy, because the store orders more of the popular stuff and less of the unpopular stuff. In a planned economy, the information is not propagated upwards because the planners don&#x27;t care, or wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything about it. But the &quot;local knowledge&quot; that the OP mentioned is there.<p>(Also I&#x27;m confused whether you count 1990s Finland as a non-capitalist system.)')
