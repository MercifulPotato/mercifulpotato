A setup like this isn&#x27;t really feasible for an apartment. For an apartment or if you rent a house, you could call a local water filtration company and have a reverse osmosis filter tank installed under your sink. I think they also offer smaller carbon filters that sit under the sink.  You could also just buy a small water cooler dispenser (for drinking water) and have 5 gallon tanks delivered as needed.')
