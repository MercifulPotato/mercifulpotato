Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[25954938], score=None, time=1611897918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954091, text='&gt; Humor me for a second - what happens the the (unlikely event) they ALL hold until it hits $10,000, and the &quot;infinity squeeze&quot; really does happen?<p>At some point, you can&#x27;t squeeze infinite money out of short sellers. In theory, if they&#x27;re still short when the price passes a threshold higher than their margin limits, they&#x27;ll get margin called and forced to sell. If the brokers and clearing houses didn&#x27;t get the risk math right, they&#x27;ll have to cover some of the difference. This is part of why RH had to pay (a lot) extra into collateral pools just to trade GME at all today. I don&#x27;t exactly know which parties bear the risk in extreme scenarios.<p>Practically speaking, if they suspect a squeeze is happening they&#x27;ll start competing against each other to get order fills. If they all set sell limits at $10K, they risk losing out to someone who sets their sell at $9999. That person risks losing out to someone who sells at $9800, and so on down the line. Again, there isn&#x27;t actually infinite money to be extracted from the system, so it becomes a competition to sell before your WSB peers.<p>Even worse, the subreddit will be full of posts about &quot;buy the dip&quot; and &quot;diamond hands&quot; that encourage the naive players to <i>not</i> exit the trade. This creates more room for savvy players to get their sells in before the situation resolves and the price comes crashing back down. Again, it&#x27;s a race to the bottom.<p>Sadly, much of the profit going to WSBers will come not from hedge funds, but from other WSBers who think they&#x27;re &quot;buying the dip&quot; or front-running a short squeeze when in reality they&#x27;re just buying shares from other WSBers.')
