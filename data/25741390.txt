Add more ram, CPU, etc to the DB host\n  2. Create DB read replicas for higher read volume\n  3. Shard the DB (reads and writes)\n  4. Offload logic to stateless clients, who you can easily scale horizontally\n</code></pre>\nSo option 4 is reasonable if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t do the other options.')
