He (sensibly) doesn&#x27;t ascribe the Technium with consciousness, but he does assert that as an entity, it possesses something identical to or closely akin to intentionality.<p>I don&#x27;t personally agree with Kelly about much of his Technium thesis (although some of his observations are fascinating). But even I were to agree about the Technium having intentionality, I don&#x27;t think that even Kelly would claim that the current manifestation of that bears much sign of it.  What we have now wasn&#x27;t created by the Technium, for the Technium, it was created by humans, for humans, utilizing machines for purposes we define.<p>It could be that in 1000 years someone will look back and see the Technium&#x27;s own designs visible in these things, but for now I would say they are at least invisible and most likely non-existent.<p>Because of this, I will continue to view the technological world as &quot;human created&quot;, certainly for as long as it serves human intents rather than those of the (putative) Technium.')
