The emails go to the 1GB mailbox, I can access them over my phone. Once I fire up Outlook, they are siphoned down and live on my Outlook forever. My emails are around 5-6GB of .pst file(s). I backup my whole disk in two manners: selected files and folders of my C and D drives on Carbonite, and one massive (80GB) Acronis .tib file (clone of my C: - SDD) again on Carbonite. My Carbonite &quot;footprint&quot; is well over 1.5TB.<p>So my backup is 3-2-1.<p>3 places: local disk, external drive, Carbonite (not affiliated)(I just love their unlimited storage and ability to encrypt pre-transmit)<p>2 different physical locations: home&#x2F;on the move &amp; Carbonite cloud<p>1 online: Carbonite (nice and encrypted).<p>I keep some gmail accounts handy, a couple of hotmail accounts, but EVERYTHING forwards to my mail mailbox. These accounts are used for things I don&#x27;t want to have a real name-surname (like a silly game or other &#x27;stuffs&#x27;). I won&#x27;t cry if I lose them.<p>I have been operating like this for 20 years. I do have the cost of the domain name and mailbox service, but the cost is nothing to the pain one gets of losing access to ALL the stuff from the &quot;free service&quot;.<p>I do NOT use any of the Google&#x2F;MS-Hotmail ecosystem, no &quot;online drives&quot;. This setup works for me. Perhaps it may work for you&#x2F;your lifestyle, perhaps not. Just putting it out there to show that one can have a perfect IT lifestyle without using any of the &quot;free&quot; stuff.<p>Edit: I am not affiliated to any of the companies mentioned above (MS, Carbonite, Google). I just made the decision 20 years ago to stay away from them (incl. Dropbox, Microsoft free or paid storage), and keep everything offline&#x2F;on me, and of course accepting the risks that come with it (house burning down, burning a CD&#x2F;DVD as backup method back-in-the-day), etc.')
