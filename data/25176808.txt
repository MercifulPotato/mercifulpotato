The golang GC has pretty short pause times but its actual throughput in GB&#x2F;s collected does not stand out. Short pause times are nice for interactive systems but don&#x27;t matter as much for eg batch or background jobs, where total time to completion is much more important. The sister comment also has a link to a GH issue detailing many more specific flaws of the GC.')
