The issue basically comes down to pensions not being pre-funded, right? Although one could argue that by paying a substantially lower salary than the private sector, they are sort of funding the plan by saving money now.<p>It seems the real answer to this would be to have a more generous version of social security at the federal level. And the interim answer is to switch to defined contribution pension plans at the local level, I suppose. Though one thing I don&#x27;t understand is how governments plan to attract workers when they pay substandard salaries and don&#x27;t even offer very generous benefits anymore. I was looking at government jobs with the city here (which has a defined contribution pension pretty similar to a 401k), and across the board it was so much worse than any private sector job I&#x27;ve worked.')
