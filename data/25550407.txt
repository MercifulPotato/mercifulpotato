From what I remember, GNU stow was not really able to do that properly though, because of the way it handles nested un-existing directories. I. E. It will symlinks a whole directory if it does not previously exist, which will make later deployments of new symlinks inside impossible. Also it did not handle absolute symlinks.<p>For these reasons, I used &quot;xstow&quot;.<p>Edit: just had a look at the latest version of GNU stow, looks like they corrected the folding issue, that&#x27;s great!')
