Works cited as Arabic are copy paste translations from India.<p>Question to be asked is if Islam is so progressive then why it insists on blind following of weird and regressive rulers. How can someone develop scientific temper when you can be simply stoned, hanged flogged for merely having an opinion.<p>Arabia was still a desert with no social,architectural, or technological progress up until oil was discovered. Ottoman ruled for many centuries but I don&#x27;t recall any &quot;scientific&quot; achievements under there rule. I would love hear if someone has counter view.')
