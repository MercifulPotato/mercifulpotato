It&#x27;s a bit like people arguing for anti-natalism. It&#x27;s interesting, but morally redundant, somehow?<p>The hangup for me isn&#x27;t the certainty of death (&quot;relax, you&#x27;re going to die&quot; is a credo I try hard to live by - even though I fail much of the time and worry about death as much as the next person...). It&#x27;s just something about breeding a thing to kill it.<p>There is also something in there about the distance and hypocrisy of many meat eaters when it comes to facing up to what they are putting in their mouths. The thing you see at a supermarket is a million miles away from a hanging carcass; I know a whole bunch of people who don&#x27;t even tell their young children that the thing they have on their plate is that thing walking around in the field over there - and that seems to me to also be quite disingenuous.<p>I&#x27;m failing to make a good point. But the broader thing for me is as I said - I&#x27;m genuinely not a rabid vegetarian (I used to get drunk at uni and sometimes end the night eating kebab along with everyone else...) - is that I&#x27;m interested in the combination of reasons which for me have built up into a fairly compelling case over the years. I should say as well - I actually do quite like the taste of meat even though it&#x27;s been a long, long time - but I have no intention of going back, which is what interests me.')
