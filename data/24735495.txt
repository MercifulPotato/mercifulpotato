Getting the check image, it was:<p>1. Not my name for the payer<p>2. An out-of-state address<p>3. Check was not on my bank&#x27;s paper, they did the logo wrong, etc.<p>4. Signature was someone else&#x27;s<p>Essentially, <i>everything</i> was wrong but the account number. The bank cashed the check, and blamed me. I got very angry about that, and basically sat in the manager&#x27;s office until he agreed to refund my money.<p>A couple months later, I ran out of blank checks, and went to the bank to order more. They gave me a song-and-dance about the advanced &quot;security paper&quot; for the expensive check blanks they wanted to sell me. I literally laughed, and told them you guys don&#x27;t check the name, the address, the signature, and certainly not the paper, and walked out and bought more checks from an online company.')
