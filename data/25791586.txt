From the investor, regulator, customer perspective there are many problems that are not startup solvable.<p>1. End-of-life and maintenance guarantees. Transferring nuclear waste and processing them is not cheap. You need to put capital aside to pay for these. Startup going bust and leaving customers to handle with   the rest is not an option.<p>2. Regulations and safety. Just like standard nuclear, you need government subvention (not direct money transfer, but a law that puts upper cap to damages).<p>You can solve these with scale. If you build 1000s of standardized units of small heating reactors,  special waste management and transportation solutions for just this type becomes economical.  If they sell only 500, lifetime cost can be astronomical.')
