Were those people symptomatic at the time of transmission?  If not, how long was the asymptomatic transmission window when they were super-spreading, based on their traced contacts?<p>Historically, we quarantine the sick.  Covid responses have quarantined the healthy, based on claims of pre-symptomatic transmission.  If we can quantify an observed transmission window (2h? 1d?) in pre-symptomatic super spreaders, before viral load reaches a threshold that causes symptoms, then we can better estimate transmission risk.')
