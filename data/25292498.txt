To stay with the example here: despite this particular incident, there are many laudable contributions to social causes that Google has supported over the years.<p>- The idea that professing some sort of belief which one acknowledges as &quot;good&quot; is nonetheless somehow &quot;bad&quot; when not accompanied by action just doesn&#x27;t make much sense. It is still PR for the good cause. When it&#x27;s convincing, people will act on it.<p>Example: Apple has been making lots of noise, for years, on issues such as environmentalism or privacy. They have been accused of &quot;virtue signalling&quot;, or &quot;greenwashing&quot;, etc. I don&#x27;t think those accusations are valid, but in any case, even if they have been the most cynical liars, their statements will have the effect of setting expectations for them and their industry peers. They will attract talent that believes in these ideas, and, over time, will turn them into reality.<p>- The term &quot;virtue signalling&quot; is used exclusively by the political right. Are we to believe they have any actual interest in, say, increased diversity, and are concerned about &quot;virtue signalling&quot; because it is somehow damaging to their cause? No... that doesn&#x27;t make much sense, does it? Instead, it&#x27;s used by these people because their real opinion just cannot be openly stated in polite company any longer. So it&#x27;s rather convenient to come up with a concept that uses the generally agreed-upon &quot;goodness&quot; of your opponent&#x27;s stated believes against them.')
