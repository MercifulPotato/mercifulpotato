You don&#x27;t <i>have to</i> trust your internet uplink, the protocol would work over carrier pigeons or with dead drops. You don&#x27;t <i>have to</i> trust exchanges, just exchange bitcoin for local currency with your neighbor. And even if you use an exchange you shouldn&#x27;t store money there anyways. The minimum required trust is tiny (basically you yourself), but of course as Schneier points out the amount of trust involved in practise isn&#x27;t nearly as low, and for many people the failure cases are much worse')
