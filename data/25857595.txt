For example, I want to see all the beginner dumbbell exercises on the same page, or all the advanced stretches, etc.<p>Btw, just tried the &quot;nordic hamstring curl&quot; which was new for me... never thought calisthenics could be so scary!<p>EDIT: I have one question: why are female&#x2F;male videos separate?  We all have the same muscles and can do the same exercises, can&#x27;t we?  It would be slightly more &quot;inclusive&quot; if you could select different models without necessarily specifying their sex.')
