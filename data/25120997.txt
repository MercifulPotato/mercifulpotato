You can disagree with someone without refusing them service. I don&#x27;t see any ethical dilemmas in serving someone you disagree with. You are free to disagree with that principle.<p>Let&#x27;s not separate a single example, the entire example list is as a whole, i.e. any of the situations listed are that to  the person involved. Sure for you it doesn&#x27;t, however, someone else will have a different opinion with respect to dealing with other political stripes. There are people who won&#x27;t deal with other religions in this day and age.<p>&gt;&gt; Growing pains, but an employee who is competent or incompetent will face the same dilemma because of what I suggested earlier.<p>I typed this in a way it was not clear. The growing pains will heal. The competent and incompetent employees will always be slaves, their competence won&#x27;t help them.<p>And yes, I sleep well.')
