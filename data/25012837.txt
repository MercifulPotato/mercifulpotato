C, Pascal, FORTRAN, and friends all had a compile step which meant that you had to operate a text editor and command-line... BASIC was so much more immediate and straightforward to learn on.<p>The other great reason so many of us 40-somethings got our start on the BASIC-wielding micros was that our universe was pretty small and the simple things we could make our machines do were still fancy. These days it seems that you won&#x27;t interest kids with anything short of a 40fps multiplayer battle royale game with millions of polygons on screen. Random number guessing games are lame, Dad.<p>The early web was a lot like the early micros -- you had to make your own entertainment as you quickly ran out of things to do, and the things you were able to make were comparable to the things built by well-founded teams. The opportunity to add something new and useful to the web is largely past, and any window is even smaller if you&#x27;re not a venture-backed team.<p>Old man out. &lt;mic drop&gt;')
