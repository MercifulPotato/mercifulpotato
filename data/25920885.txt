Better current customers sing your praises internally + externally than say you&#x27;re yet another couldn&#x27;t-care-less quarter-driven bigco &#x2F; sales-driven vc co: growth wins.<p>* Put new stuff in new plans&#x2F;tiers. Gitlab VPs seem to be choosing a weak balance here.<p>I&#x27;m all for offering higher prices. Trick is, when adding stuff, people should pay more for more, and same &#x2F; less for standing still. Let hungrier&#x2F;spendier teams spend more, and cost-sensitive ones happily spread the good word.<p>Not what happened here? Gitlab seems big enough that all this doesn&#x27;t really matter though, they are probably reaching a customer size and capital-intensitive enough moat that they don&#x27;t care toooo much.<p>---<p>A good contrast is github &#x2F; microsoft, which also is way into clever pricing:<p>- Way cheaper per-user at all tiers. We got tier-shifted at some point, but don&#x27;t recall any pricing funniness during that.<p>- Adding customer abilities to spend infinite amounts, but via new layers, like pay-as-you-go CI&#x2F;CD offerings that do not gauge existing users. I expect the prices to go down, not up, as they figure out more scaling tricks &#x2F; computing improves and they try to get users more addicted.<p>GH&#x2F;MS is probably working on a much bigger timescale than GitLab, as GH doesn&#x27;t need to look at juicing numbers to fundraise &#x2F; sell while buyers are willing, and instead focus on being a friendly shift-left answer to AWS&#x2F;GCP')
