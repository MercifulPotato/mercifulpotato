Maybe even do away w&#x2F; speed limits just go as fast as you &#x27;feel safe&#x27; going with the only limit being the max. In cities you&#x27;d have sensors&#x2F;grids everywhere to detect non-car traffic, and regular cars could even drive over the mag-lev, or it could be a separate track, and you can go in&#x2F;out of mag-lev&#x2F;drive modes. Maybe it parks you, til you&#x27;re ready to take over control (say you&#x27;re napping on the commute). Alarm goes up, you wake up. Stretch, even get out and stand up for a minute, get back in. Buckle up - drive the final block to where you want to park at your job, or if it&#x27;s a country side location, up in the mountains, etc you might drive for longer then park where ever.<p>Essentially you could just cover cities and highways to nearest gas stations. Car&#x27;s running out of gas&#x2F;electricity it routes itself to nearest depot.<p>Going cross country and want to stop at lunch? Program the car, and it&#x27;ll pull to nearest gas station in tim-buk-two and let you figure out where to go from there.<p>Point: A&#x2F;I self-driving aren&#x27;t the only way to get autonomous cars. 50&#x2F;50 re-thinking infrastructure, sensors, car-to-car communications could get us a lot closer faster.')
