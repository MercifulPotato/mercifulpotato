It hasn&#x27;t been through complete Stage 3 trials, so we don&#x27;t know if it works or if it works well.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the Oxford&#x2F;Astrazeneca vaccine is bad. This is however very unwise. It would definitely erode trust in vaccines if the Oxford&#x2F;Astrazeneca were to have significant side effects. Which would erode trust in science in the long term.')
