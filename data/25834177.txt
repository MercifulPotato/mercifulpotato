That at least suggests that its overall balance is relatively neutral, even if specific individual programmes it broadcasts may not be.<p>I do feel that in recent times, the BBC&#x27;s big name current affairs programmes have often given politicians of all parties an easy time in interviews, which I think is more worrying as a trend. I think the BBC should still challenge government representatives to explain and if necessary defend their policies, and should also still challenge the Opposition and smaller parties when their own representatives make dubious claims even if they&#x27;re not currently in power to implement them.')
