These are also not trivial problems to solve for a poor country, without assistance from more developed nations.<p>So, the question is: is there the political will in the developed world to help the developing world bootstrap renewable energy?  History suggests not, unfortunately, but I would love to be wrong on this.<p>Edit: I forgot to mention, as well: lithium batteries eventually lose capacity and need to be replaced.  So, storage is essentially an ongoing maintenance cost in this scenario.  Google tells me that the Megapack costs ~$300&#x2F;kW, all in, so, add that to the cost of your renewable energy. [0]  Once you do that, if you&#x27;re thinking short term, fossil fuels start looking really, really good.<p>Not to mention that lithium is a limited resource, and the mining of lithium is absolutely <i>terrible</i> for the local environment.<p>Google also tells me that the Tesla Megapack comes with a 15 year &quot;energy retention&quot; warranty. [1]  So, you need to make this investment every 15 years.  And, unless the prices of batteries go <i>way</i> down per kWh, that can add up real quick.<p>---<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;tesla-megapack-powerpack-powerwall-battery-storage-prices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;tesla-megapack-powerpac...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tesla_Megapack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tesla_Megapack</a>')
