AT&amp;T has to comply with splitting up but did AT&amp;T go extinct? Even though the situation isn&#x27;t explicitly the same, the concept that government regulations are changing the market and it&#x27;s direct effects are fairly similar. In the case above, Ericsson and Nokia are players that the government want to see exist in the market but for this specific aspect of the industry, they want to see a reduced role.<p>IMHO, it&#x27;s government trying to work better on a very important topic (for the nation, for the people, and for the global market place [more competition for Huawei).')
