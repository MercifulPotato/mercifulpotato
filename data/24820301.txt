Bose does a lot with the perceptual aspect of audio, which makes me dislike their speakers (the sound is too thin, not moving enough air) but impressed with their noise cancelling until Sony got serious recently.<p>Sort of into the noise cancelling thing, and a side sleeper, so I agree with you there’s not a great set of options.<p>I own last 3 generations of Sony full size noise cancelling head phones, Sony’s latest wireless noise cancelling, Apple’s AirPods Pro, two prior generations of Bose QuietComfort, and last two generations each of the in-ear wired noise cancelling earbuds from Bose and Sony.  I go try out new models from other manufacturers, and am not finding anything compelling outside of the two well known brands and the AirPods Pro.<p>The only ones among all these I’ve found useful for sleeping <i>in a bed</i> are the Bose Sleepbuds (v1, I don’t have v2).  For the sleepbuds, the reviews go into sleepability:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newatlas.com&#x2F;wearables&#x2F;bose-sleepbuds-ii&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newatlas.com&#x2F;wearables&#x2F;bose-sleepbuds-ii&#x2F;</a><p>That said, the most effective I’ve found for sleeping <i>on a plane</i> are the semi-wireless behind neck &#x2F; in ear headphones from Sony (WI1000X&#x2F;N and WI1000XM2) using their foam gel ear inserts. (In fact, for using any of the earbud models on planes, if they don’t have it already, I do replace rubber ear inserts with memory foam type ear inserts.)<p>But none of the active models work for me for bed because I’m a side sleeper and even then, all night battery without wires is another deal breaker.<p>Only the Bose Sleepbuds were all-night comfortable, but careful selection from among available sounds turned out to shut out the world to a degree that I stopped using them on travel out of concern I might not hear something that should wake me.  In other words, the sound perception dampening was too good.')
