The rules are setup to be so loose that there is no way to prove any fraud.  As I said below, registering to vote as an entirely fictional person is absurdly easy in many jurisdictions. In California, for instance, one can skip any identity checks by simply marking two checkboxes: one indicating they have no ID, and one indicating they have no social security number [1]. Voila - in under 2 minutes, you have invented a brand new, registered California voter.  Combine this absurdity with automatically sent out mail-in ballots in many states, and you have a disaster waiting to happen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covr.sos.ca.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covr.sos.ca.gov&#x2F;</a>')
