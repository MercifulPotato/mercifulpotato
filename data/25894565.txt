I&#x27;m still thinking how to add how some form of configuration so that those customizations can stick. (The new release I published today has support for an AUTOEXEC.BAS, so probably that combined with some global environment variables could do the trick.)<p>As for graphics, definitely. I want to add the features you mention as well as PLAY for music... but that will require some reworking on how the web UI works and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d add those to the CLI. But these are definitely in my mind.')
