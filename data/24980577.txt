Don&#x27;t buy $30 smartphones). I have 2fa. I use both Authy (syncing) and WinAuth (local, with encrypted backups) to manage my secrets. Entering the code is enough to sign in.<p>The second time, I was moving from an old phone to a new phone; I turned off the old phone to remove the SD card before turning on the new one, and it worked fine without turning on the old one until after signing into accounts, when I needed to transfer data for some FOSS apps (termux, Fdroid, etc).')
