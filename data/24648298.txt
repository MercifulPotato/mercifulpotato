It&#x27;s an acknowledgement that there can be a tradeoff between safety and convenience.<p>If it&#x27;s OK to hold your child in the backseat of a taxi to the airport, why shouldn&#x27;t it be OK to hold your child in the backseat of your friends&#x27; car on the way to the airport?<p>My guess would be that it&#x27;s a question of numbers. You want 99% of kids to be in child seats, and can allow a few exceptions (since e.g. nobody does a commute to daycare in a taxi). But if you allowed private drivers to avoid car seats in limited circumstances, people would abuse that privilege and never use a car seat, turning that number down to 70% or lower')
