Item(by='sudeepj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610334904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722204, text='&gt; would throw their work over the wall to me<p>I can relate to this. One way to look at this is that dev-team is where majority of IP is created and not in teams like support&#x2F;qa&#x2F;docs&#x2F;PMs. Over the period of time, they are also the reservoir of domain knowledge.<p>This often results into nuisances like:<p>1. Instead of reading product docs people will ask questions directly over slack (e.g Do we support Windows 2008? Do we have feature X?)<p>2. Adding dev team in a slack channels in which sales can directly ask questions which ideally should be answered by Product Managers.')
