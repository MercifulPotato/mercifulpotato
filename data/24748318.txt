How selective of me!  &#x2F;s<p>I suppose I should also have included all the projects that were abandoned before ground was even broken?<p>&gt; Also, I&#x27;m not sure why you think weapons programs have anything to do with nuclear power generation&#x27;s supply chain. The supply chain issues pertain to the construction of pressure vessels, pumps, and pipes that need to withstand the more difficult environment inside a nuclear reactor.<p>It includes such things as instrumentation, enrichment, fuel fabrication, and (most importantly) manpower and expertise.<p>&gt; Trillions of dollars wasted is &quot;no big deal&quot;?<p>Investments are made on expected payoff.   The expectation that renewables will do well is high.   The off chance that they do not, oh well!  Nuclear could be a backup in that case.   There is no need to pump trillions into nuclear now to restore your putative golden age.<p>(I&#x27;d actually put carbon capture over nuclear as the backup plan.  Nuclear would be the backup to the backup.)')
