The code is delivered to the client and the client runs the code on their system.  No GPL violations have occurred.<p>That said, I believe it gets trickier once we start compiling the code.  Say I want to develop a piece of software for my client and I don&#x27;t want them to have the source, Octave doesn&#x27;t really have a way to do this, but MATLAB does and since MATLAB has purchased all of the requisite licenses, we&#x27;re good to go.  Julia makes me more uncomfortable.  We can make binaries with PackageCompiler.jl, but if we do, we should be subject to the provisions in the GPL.  That&#x27;s no different than any other piece of software, but Julia, Octave, and MATLAB all use these libraries and most people don&#x27;t know that something like the chol command hooks into SuiteSparse in the backend.')
