So I&#x27;d count this as an example of why WebGL will not replace &quot;proper&quot; desktop OpenGL anytime soon.<p>Also, it appears to be reflecting by the same amount everywhere, which makes it look more like glue than like glass. Typically, glass has a fresnel reflection, meaning that it reflects more strongly the lower the angle between the light and the surface. That&#x27;s why glass bottles usually reflect at the border (which is curved away from you) but are fully refractive in the center (which is facing you).')
