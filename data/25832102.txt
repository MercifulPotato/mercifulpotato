It happens around the same time endorphins flow and you feel so good after. And then you feel improvement and achievement. You have to overcome some discomfort to get better, so trainers and coaches teach that mindset too. And it pushes you further and plus, you can imagine yourself as sort of tough hero. And you can brag about it.<p>The issue is when it becomes addictive and it is not good suffering anymore, but rather deliberate destruction of body with long term consequences.')
