He doesn&#x27;t want to do the hard work that goes into becoming a dictator. Dictators come to power very often through legitimate means and deft political work. It&#x27;s not like all dictatorships come to life through violent means. It&#x27;s not the case. It&#x27;s going back to a democracy that HAS to be violent.<p>Also, if the GOP controlled both chambers of Congress, the odds that Joe Biden would be sworn in on the 21st would be very slim. There is your dictatorship. You might say that we would essentially become a parliamentary system, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what we were GOING for.')
