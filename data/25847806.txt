In particular this line:<p>&gt; When you are feeling sorry for yourself call someone less better off than yourself. I have an older, infirm friend and when I feel sorry for myself I often give him a call. This reminds my problems are just feelings, not real problems.<p>And no worries if it&#x27;s not a book recommendation. Anything helps.<p>I&#x27;m 43 and I&#x27;ve also been thinking about friends and friendship deeply, for quite some time. Add the fact that at age 30 I left my home country (Italy) to travel the world, for work (Luxembourg, then Singapore, then San Francisco). Long distances make it harder to maintain your existing friendships. But perhaps people that didn&#x27;t move much have experienced similar problems anyway.<p>Edit: forgot to add that this line here is also really insightful - and thankfully, it&#x27;s not news for me:<p>&gt; my best friend is my wife. Don&#x27;t ever take your partner for granted if you have one. There are very few people in the world who will ever be actively interested in you.')
