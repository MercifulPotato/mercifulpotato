But the actual design is not bad IMO. For what Go wants to be (a modern C), it is not a bad design. But who wants a modern C? I don&#x27;t. But if Go were available in the 90s, I would have jumped at the opportunity to write programs in it.<p>&gt; Python is decidedly not dying... it&#x27;s still the dominating game in town for ML and data science. I&#x27;m surprised anybody would posit that Python were dying. Perl definitely feels like it should be in Ruby&#x27;s camp.<p>I didn&#x27;t say that I would consider Python a dying language. But considering Ruby dying and Perl don&#x27;t, is very weird. OTOH Ruby and Python aren&#x27;t gaining any new usecases (but also aren&#x27;t losing anything rapidly AFAIK) whereas Perl ... has any left besides very legacy code?<p>Putting Perl and Python into the same group and Ruby in another is certainly an interesting choice.')
