Testing if NaN == Nan is &quot;false&quot; according to the IEEE [1].  (Probably not all languages follow IEEE&#x27;s recommendation.)<p>Functions: some functions are trivially the same, and some functions are trivially different, but deciding whether arbitrary functions (for instance, f(x) { x + x } and f(x) { 2*x } return the same values and have the same side-effects for all possible inputs is generally not something a compiler should be expected to do.  So any record with a function as a field can&#x27;t really be tested for equality.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;38798791&#x2F;nan-comparison-rule-in-c-c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;38798791&#x2F;nan-comparison-...</a>')
