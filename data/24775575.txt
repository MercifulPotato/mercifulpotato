However, when you look for it at time T at all of those locations at once, you only find it in one of them. If you perform the experiment many times, you will find it at all of those locations some amount of the time. But then, if you try to use the Schrodinger equation to model movement before AND after interaction with the detector, you will not be able to find the particle at any position that doesn&#x27;t match what the detector initially saw.<p>That is, say the Schrodinger equation predicts the particle has the same amplitude at locations X and Y. Then, after interacting with something at locations X and Y at time T1, it will have some amplitude at locations X1, X2, Y1, Y2 at time T2.<p>Now, if we try an experiment where the interaction at time T1 happens with a particle, and you have detectors at positions X1, X2, Y1, Y2, you will find it with equal probabilities at any of the 4 locations. However, if at X and Y there is a detector, and you detect the particle at X, it will never be found at positions Y1 or Y2. You have to update the Schrodinger equation after you find out that the particle is found at X, which is never how classical mechanics work.')
