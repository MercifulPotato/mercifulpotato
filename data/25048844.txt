I’m sure HN has spam detection and removal in its ever improving code, but there would still be a lot to handle manually when it comes to guideline violations. In my experience elsewhere, there may be cases that aren’t clear cut as to whether they’re appropriate or what the writer intended to convey. Especially on a forum where people from different cultures converge, there’s a lot of space to misunderstand and be misunderstood.<p>At the same time, being able to read and learn from other people’s thoughts is always a stimulating experience. It gives opportunities to develop better mental models on certain things and also be able to explain certain things better to others.<p>So yeah, there are pros and cons, but I wouldn’t want to do this without a few other people who can take the workload and provide a break when it gets too tiring and exhausting.')
