It is the very true fact that economies of scale and efficiencies of vertical integration exist that make regulation and anti-trust law so critically important to prevent the world from being made up of an oligopoly of maybe three giant companies that each make one of everything you might ever own, all beautifully integrated with their own products while being almost entirely incompatible with the products made by the other two, with cross promotions from tying and forced purchases from bundling all making it difficult-to-impossible for a new company to independently introduce anything new without replicating the entire vertical stack of an incumbent.')
