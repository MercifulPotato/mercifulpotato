I a plane, you get out of a stall by building airspeed - nose down and throttle up.<p>If you do a sudden nose down and throttle up in a gyro at the wrong time a couple of things can happen - you can build up an unsafe amount of airspeed and you can put air the wrong way through the rotor, slowing it down. If you do that too low you&#x27;ll crash (a gyro without a spinning rotor is just a brick).<p>Basically avoid doing things which cause negative G. This is important enough that it&#x27;s printed on a placard on all UK certified Gyros, but is also really easy to avoid doing.')
