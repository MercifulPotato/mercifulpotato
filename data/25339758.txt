As far as I can tell, the author is a professor in the sense &quot;he&#x27;s good at teaching&quot;, but <i>not</i> as in &quot;college&#x2F;university professor&quot;. It matters not because of credentialism (again, quality seems ok), but because it misleads on the intentions of the channel: The channel is very prolific (1+ video per day) and clearly going for maximized views (meme-filled thumbnails with big captions), complete with donations, Patreon, and merch store (you can buy a t-shirt). Nothing wrong with it, but if an institution allows that kind of moonlighting, I&#x27;m interested!<p>2. The course is a playlist with 4 long livestream videos (2h, 3h, 3h, 4h). Still impressive, but it&#x27;s not what the title is trying to imply.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s hard not to call clickbait.')
