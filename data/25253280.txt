Often the calculations are very heavy and if you have a lot of data coming in you need to spread the load.<p>In dicom, a brain scan almost always span many, many dicom files. So when you push over one series, it can contain N images. Which means that there are N transactions to the server.<p>You cannot simply round-robin the load because all dicom files that belongs to the same series (study) must end up on the same worker.<p>So the goal of WolfPACS is to inspect the DICOM headers as they files come in, and route the files depending on the StudyUID and Calling AE.<p>So it is possible to associate certain workers with certain clients. So how a worker is picked is very flexible. Maybe you want to do some A&#x2F;B testing. Or you want to take a worker offline &quot;softly&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wolfpacs&#x2F;wolfpacs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wolfpacs&#x2F;wolfpacs</a>')
