Item(by='oh_sigh', descendants=None, kids=[25742033], score=None, time=1610414207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738389, text='Yes, I agree the woman was out of line. But her behavior may be explained as her just describing the man in a manner she&#x27;s seen on TV shows(the perp is 6&#x27;, stocky, wearing flannel), because she also said something along the lines of &quot;I&#x27;m going to tell them it is a black man in a dark shirt and a baseball cap&quot; or something like that. Keep in mind this lady was a vocal supporter of BLM before this incident happened. And the man had already said, basically, &quot;Put your dog on the leash or I&#x27;m going to do something you aren&#x27;t going to like&quot;, which really does sound like a threat.<p>It&#x27;s possible she decided on the spot to weaponize the mans race against him, or it&#x27;s also possible she was scared out of her mind that this stranger was accosting her for a minor thing she does all the time (or, she&#x27;s just off her rocker).<p>Anyways, my point wasn&#x27;t about the lady&#x27;s behavior which was clearly wrong regardless of her reasons, it was more about how the guy in that situation created a situation and then publicized it. I can&#x27;t really feel sorry for the burdens put upon him, since he went out of his way to make what happened a news story, instead of, again, just chalking it up to crazy people behaving crazy (or racist, which is just another flavor of crazy). Like I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve been stereotyped in NYC because of both my race and gender, but I didn&#x27;t go out of my way to make a news story about it. I didn&#x27;t even let it affect my day. Everyone has choices about where they spend their mental energy. Getting into a scuffle in central park because someone has their calm dog off leash near them is not where I would choose to spend mine.')
