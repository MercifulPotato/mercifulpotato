For me, I&#x27;m happy with a shared struggle towards some goal (though of course it cannot become the norm.) Pressure-Ease-Pressure-Ease cycles are also fine for me.<p>...but if all that results on a nice pat on the back while some salesperson or product manager gets promoted, then it isn&#x27;t really a shared struggle anymore. Rewards need to be distributed to the entire team that struggled, not just the ones presenting the project.<p>Further, i think organizations need to understand that different people want different things. Consulting firms have a firm-wide up-or-out policy...but tech companies should probably subscribe to a up-or-steady policy where some choose to worker more intensely for growth while others choose to work normally and remain stationary.')
