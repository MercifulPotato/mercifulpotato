Some do. Some don&#x27;t.<p>Apple is trying to protect people (and their public image) from the scammy people who swap the cheapest shit on your phone and still charge a premium.<p>Then when the phone explodes and takes someones buttock with it, it&#x27;s WAY too late for Apple to say &quot;but it was a 3rd party battery, which was dodgy and installed carelessly&quot; - the Court of Twitter has already decided that Apple is evil and their phones are crap and here come the class action suits.<p>So the only sane way is to make sure people can&#x27;t get dodgy components installed on their devices.<p>Also, if every Apple Genius was Rossmann-good with similar tools, they could solder out single components and fix pretty much anything on site.<p>But they&#x27;re not, so they are instructed on how to swap the smallest viable part when one section fails. That might mean swapping a whole case when one rubber foot falls of, but that&#x27;s still easier and more cost-effective than training everyone to be a soldering and electrical engineering genius.')
