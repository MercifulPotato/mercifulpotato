Hawaii only accepted tests from a very limited number of providers which complicated things, but after some effort I made an appointment and got a test. The rest of the process was very painless. We all had to keep masks on for the entire flight of course since there was no requirement that we all have a negative result before getting on the flight but it was comforting to know that nearly everyone else on the flight would have had a negative result so as to avoid the mandatory 14 day quarantine upon arrival.')
