And it&#x27;s a cool feature. Can I expect most libraries to provide types so that I know I&#x27;m calling them correctly? Is it going to be an uphill battle for my team to use them, because the community at large doesn&#x27;t find them necessary? The default for a majority of Python codebases is to not use types, and that&#x27;s totally fine, but that also means that rather than type annotations solving the super-grand-OP&#x27;s concern, they&#x27;re going to potentially add friction.<p>It&#x27;s <i>likely</i>, and that&#x27;s FINE, that you&#x27;re going to be in dynamic-land when you&#x27;re working in Python, due to the preferences of the community, and it&#x27;s cool that you can use annotations if you yourself want to get some nice signature checking.')
