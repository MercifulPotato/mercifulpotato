The language of Algebra, the language of Organic Chemistry, the language of Music Theory, etc, etc ... what superpowers does mastering those languages unlock?<p>To me, watching someone work who already mastered those languages in action can be very inspiring, even if haven&#x27;t reached that level of understanding yet.')
