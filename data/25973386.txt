Windows 10 is fantastic in this regard.<p>MacOS on the other hand sucks. Basically the recommendation is to run a lower and blurry resolution if you want bigger buttons and text...<p>At the same time, iOS has great scaling and text sizing options, and macOSâ€™ interface is so abstract that it should be very easy to vectorize it, enabling seamless scaling to any size wanted.<p>Really baffling.')
