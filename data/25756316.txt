Don&#x27;t make assumptions about a person&#x27;s politics from the mere existence of software on their device.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with Parler users or anyone else per-se.<p>There is, however, a problem with violent insurrectionists.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that a small group of people planned and executed a violent attack on the seat of US government, although unfortunate is nowhere near a strong enough term for their acts.<p>I don&#x27;t know you, but if you don&#x27;t participate in violent acts to support your political agenda and respect the rule of law, I have no problem with you.<p>Assuming that&#x27;s true, even if (and I don&#x27;t know one way or another about that) I vehemently disagree with your policy perspectives, I will defend your right to hold and advocate for those perspectives.  Because that&#x27;s what a free society is all about.<p>On the other hand, those that believe it&#x27;s okay to use violence, lies and intimidation to achieve their political goals have no place in a free society and should be shunned, ridiculed, and if they perpetrate acts of violence, punished.<p>I&#x27;d posit that anyone who believes in our constitutional system of government and the rule of law would agree with all of the above.')
