This is why the ONLY democratic part of the US government at its founding was the House of Representatives.  Over time we have made more and more parts of the federal government &quot;democratic&quot; like the Senate, and most recently the push to change the election of the President to be pure democratic as well.<p>This has been a DISASTER for individual liberty')
