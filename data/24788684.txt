Mapped an office space in QGIS. The IMDF format is actually quite nice and portable. Itâ€™s really just GEOJSON with some extra properties and can be migrated to any map&#x2F;service that uses the format.<p>The actual blue dot generated after mapping is pretty spot on. A slight delay while it catches up to you when walking but honestly some of the best in class when it comes to performance.')
