The standard answer is we&#x27;re too bony and taste bad.  Maybe that&#x27;s the reason, but it doesn&#x27;t sit right with me.  Sure we might be bony compared to seals, but how do orcas know we taste bad if they won&#x27;t even take a nibble?  Orcas seem to have zero curiosity for how we taste.  Contrast this with sharks, which are known for taking a taste once in a while.  Are sharks, glorified fish, really more curious than these hyper intelligent mammals?  Maybe, but that seems suspect to me.<p>Here is what I believe; whales are capable of passing knowledge down through their generations, just like us.  The power of their language is not yet fully understood, but I think it reasonable to assume they are able to express at least simple ideas like <i>&quot;Can I eat this?&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;Do not eat that!&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Those are dangerous to us.&quot;</i>  A language which can convey those ideas may be sufficient for whales to have memory of industrial scale whaling.  I believe Orcas likely remember that humans are very good at killing whales, and subsequently know not to fuck with us.  (They may also be able to reason this out by observing our capabilities today, even if they have forgotten what we once did.)')
