Next time it&#x27;ll be a Discord or Telegram board or something. It&#x27;s just... so easy<p>It&#x27;s not so easy. There are concentrated tech players. There&#x27;s decentralized systems but they aren&#x27;t there yet in terms of usability for millions of people to just log on and use seamlessly like they do w&#x2F; Reddit. It may get there eventually, but its nowhere close to being available.<p>And then you have different layers of protocol that are all more or less centralized. AWS, gcp, Azure isn&#x27;t going to host illegal or risky content. And even if you get around that, you&#x27;ll have to contend w&#x2F; the ISPs that can just block arbitrarily if they so choose.<p>Yes, you can get around all those, but not on the scale to make a meaningful impact and the barriers will deter all but the most fervent supporters, and they likely wouldn&#x27;t have enough money or influence to cause the havoc they&#x27;re causing today.')
