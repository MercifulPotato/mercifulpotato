They spend a few years on it, and it fails to get much traction.<p>There is a network effect around c++, sure.  But industry standards are there for reasons, and usually most of them have a core at least that is sensible.  People keep coming back to c++ mostly because it works, and it turns out often if you start with a safer and cleaner language you get 80% of the way there much faster, but a lot of the 20% that&#x27;s left over is performance related and you just can&#x27;t get there no matter how hard you try.<p>So from a business point of view, the pain level of c++ (and associated costs) is somewhat known, but most other approaches trade that off against project risks people just aren&#x27;t willing to take.<p>It&#x27;s not inherently crazy, even in 2021 to start a new high performance  project in c++.  Obviously the exact requirements matter, but there is a subset of what it can do that we don&#x27;t really have a obviously good replacement for.  What would be crazy is starting a new project in it that doesn&#x27;t really need any of thee things it&#x27;s good at.')
