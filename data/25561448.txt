A few points:<p>1) you can only test-driven-develop so much in games, and that line usually stops at the engine level because the game itself is in flux so much. Automated testing is confined to making sure that checkins build on every platform. Game dev engineering is fundamentally different than programming in other fields because the goal posts move constantly.<p>2) If an engineer writes code expecting there to be no more than 1024 physics objects in the system, tells the designers and artists this, but then they turn around put in 2000 colliding pieces of silverware on a dinner table &quot;because it needs to feel like a big feast&quot; is that an engineering problem, or an art and asset management problem? Because something like 80% of my bugs are shit like this.<p>3) Professional game codebases use their own styles (i hesitate to say dialects) of C++ that do the things we need them to do the ways we need to do them. We don&#x27;t use anybody else&#x27;s framework; all of the bonus stuff we&#x27;re doing lives in macros that can be inspected if an issue arises. But, please don&#x27;t push your language purism on anybody else. What a tired argument to have.')
