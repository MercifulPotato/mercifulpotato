Item(by='MaxBarraclough', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611145362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840263, text='&gt; when it was first used it had a broad scope for more or less anything where source was made available to users<p>I&#x27;m not sure the early history of the term really matters. Presumably early aeronautical engineers and early physicists had to all agree on the terms of their field. It&#x27;s fortunate that they did so, and now that their field is mature, their terms are clear and unambiguous.<p>Someone without an education in physics might not be able to intuit that physicists use the terms <i>strength</i>, <i>hardness</i>, and <i>toughness</i> in distinct and precise ways.<p>&gt; The OSI definition is a newer more narrow definition adopted long after the term was in broad use.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a more considered, more precise, more meaningful definition.<p>&gt; the literal meaning of the words open and source do not have connotations beyond the source being available for viewing<p>I already gave the example of <i>flap</i>, a precise term-of-art in aviation that reuses a non-technical English word in a way that cannot simply be intuited.<p>I also don&#x27;t see that <i>open</i> needs to be a synonym of <i>viewable</i>. I think it&#x27;s fine that <i>open</i> be used to refer to something broader, as in the Open University for instance.
