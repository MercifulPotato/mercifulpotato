I don&#x27;t get the point about salesmen here.<p>Companies are not perfect optimizers. Arguably not even that strong. If someone in Purchasing is willing to reward their buddy instead of picking the best vendor for the job, well, that happens. It&#x27;s noise. Doesn&#x27;t change the overall behavior of the company. And it only happens within limits - do it too much, and the person in Purchasing will find themselves fired, maybe even charged with a crime. If they&#x27;re too good, maybe they can kill their own company - much like a sickness can kill a human. Other companies will then be more vigilant.<p>Also worth noting that companies strive to improve their process and develop various means of ensuring and enforcing accountability - this, in essence, is trying to reduce the &quot;noise&quot; of individual humans within the larger AI of the company.')
