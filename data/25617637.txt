The average lag would maybe maybe drop under a year for some (and it will depend on which feature, road update faster than building if you account for gps data).<p>However I really don&#x27;t see why OSM would necessarily lag more than Google Map or any commercial database. Because the more OSM usage is widespread (directly or through apps) the more human &quot;field sensors&quot; you get to update the map. Same way that I don&#x27;t think many commercial encyclopedia can claim that they are more up-to-date than Wikipedia to record new facts.')
