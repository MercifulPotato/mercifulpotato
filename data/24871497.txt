In my ~50 year lifetime there have only been 3 viable third party candidates for President. Of those, John Anderson got 6%, Ross Perot got ~19%, and Ralph Nader got 2.4%. If you&#x27;re under 40, you&#x27;ve probably never heard of John Anderson. He was a Republican who turned independent to run against Reagan in 1980, so no party affiliation. Perot didn&#x27;t have a party and dropped out of the race early, only to enter it again a few weeks before the election. Nader ran as a Green candidate. So at least on the Presidential stage, those rules don&#x27;t seem like they help any party in reality. In very rare cases they help a particular candidate with 1 election, but even at Perot&#x27;s almost 20%, there was no chance he could win.<p>It probably makes much more sense to vote 3rd party locally until such a time as your favored party becomes big enough to actually matter in Federal elections. But for races like President, we&#x27;re stuck with our crappy system until we can get the political will to change to not be first past the post. I really wish we could do that.')
