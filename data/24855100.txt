I know it isn&#x27;t supposed to be trainable, but I&#x27;ve dabbled in guitar for 10+ years and singing for 5+, and I&#x27;m at a point where I&#x27;ll randomly hear a chord--nothing fancy, just a triad--and I suddenly place it in song with the same chord in the same key. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m actually matching pitch, or if I&#x27;m picking up on timbre differences.')
