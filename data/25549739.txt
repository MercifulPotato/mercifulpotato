Or you may put your career on a lower pitch only to have your wife and you decide it won&#x27;t really work out. In reality, it&#x27;s more like you start to climb for a fat purple fig only to find it rotten, or just edible. At least in some of the cases, and it won&#x27;t be your fault and your success depends on how you deal with the said fig. Maybe you can still climb to another?')
