Item(by='karmakaze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608064233, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25432233, text='GraphQL has two notable advantages, neither of which are measured here. First by allowing the client to specify precisely what to retrieve the backend isn&#x27;t catering to a specific client. This allows for decoupling so each team can develop quicker and with fewer changes down the road.<p>Of course REST can also be decoupled only needing to follow conventions and defining the resource formats. What it doesn&#x27;t provide is the second benefit of GraphQL which is eliminating round trips for accessing related resources. This is sometimes done by creating an intermediate &#x27;BFF&#x27; service on the back end to serve requests as the client would like them but now that&#x27;s sensitive to both client and REST API changes.<p>In short, it&#x27;s not about the development speed of the first client&#x2F;server. If that were the case use gRPC etc, generate the interface, implement and you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s about the supporting ongoing changes. Perhaps gRPC or similar will become prevalent enough to replace both REST and GraphQL.')
