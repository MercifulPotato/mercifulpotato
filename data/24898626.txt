I told my friend last week that I&#x27;d like to come work construction with him and will be quitting my decently-paying programming job to go do so in 3 weeks. I&#x27;d started to interview at another tech company and realized that I couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of programming for someone else again. I burned out so hard at my current job I can&#x27;t conceive of working anywhere as a programmer and enjoying it. So I&#x27;m going to go pour concrete and frame walls and hope that someday I&#x27;ll sit down at a computer and want to tell it what to do again. I do remember that magical feeling. I just can&#x27;t feel it anymore.')
