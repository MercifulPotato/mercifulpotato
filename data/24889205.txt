On the other side, we have come a long long way when it comes to efficiently using power. The combined power usage of my bathrooms lights is probably less than 60W. The largest MacBook uses less than a moderately trained human can produce. On average, fridges need paltry amounts, compared to what they needed a decade ago.<p>Certainly, running a vacuum or boiling water won’t work with human power generation, but if you want that as a backup, you probably can fall back to a broom and use a gas&#x2F;multifuel cooker in the meantime.')
