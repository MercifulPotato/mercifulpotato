It was easy to write simple GUI-applications with a bit of network stuff. But some day I had an issue and had to look at the assembly-output (it uses flat assembler as the backend) and saw something like `push eax` immediately `pop eax` and somehow I started to write stuff in fasm before I finally settled with rust. Yet I miss the simplicity of writing GUI-applications with pb in Rust.')
