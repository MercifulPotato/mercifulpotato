Presumably others do as well, but those are the ones I looked up.<p>I wonder why that is.<p>Edit: Further thought. Most of the major cities I&#x27;m aware of (especially capital cities) in those countries are pronounced fairly accurately (with room for accents, of course). That&#x27;s actually a really interesting set up.')
