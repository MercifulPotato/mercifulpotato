When I ditched Facebook about 10 years ago, I lost contact with a whole bunch of people who weren&#x27;t really part of my life anyway, they were simply &quot;names I recognized.&quot; On the other hand, it had no effect on my actual friendships or family connections. We all know how to contact each other and we do. My social life is probably better after dropping social media simply because I&#x27;m spending less time scrolling in front of a screen.')
