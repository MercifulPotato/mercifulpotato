Heres an extension - a general understanding of how an enzyme works to catalyze chemical reactions, is that it binds the reaction intermediate with higher affinity than the two substrates; thus if we have this reverse ability, we can start inventing enzymes that can catalyze any arbitrary chemical reaction, even ones that need energy input, so you could imagine for example enzyme systems that can convert plastic to fuel!')
