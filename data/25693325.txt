Item(by='dvdgsng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610152156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25681724, text='&gt; One is &quot;Verify your login&quot; with no option to verify, only skip.<p>The idea is to verify the new login on ANOTHER session, if available. This is required for reading encrypted messages. When you see this message a notification will show up on all of your other Element devices asking you to verify that new session (using a QR code or a bunch of emojis). You can also select &quot;This wasn&#x27;t me - your account may be compromised&quot;, which gives you a hint what to do next (change passwords, etc).<p>My best guess here is that you have some old sessions lingering around, which you should remove from your account once logged in. However you do need your Security Phrase or Security Key to recover your account, which creates a new verified session and then you can read your old encrypted messages, too.<p>&gt; &quot;Help us improve Element&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t accept a no and keeps asking again and again.<p>Can&#x27;t reproduce this, sorry.')
