Your own [1] link even says:<p>&gt; “While the software upgrades and changes are enough to get the plane back in the air, the agency is still demanding the development of a so-called synthetic sensor (that will be ready in 20 to 24 months) to reach even higher safety levels.”<p>This seems clear that we&#x27;re talking about a conditional airworthiness rather than absolute confidence, safest plane ever made, etc etc.  Recall that you said &quot;It&#x27;s probably far safer now than other models&quot;.  Why are you saying that given that the experts you quoted are using the paragraph above for this plane, when they don&#x27;t have similar concerns and requirements for other models?')
