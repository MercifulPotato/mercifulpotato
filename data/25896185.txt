Yet we didn’t really realize how much heavier the automatically generated critical CSS was.<p>Is reducing the total amount of CSS per page so you don&#x27;t have to calculate the critical CSS at all an option?<p>To throw my own page into the ring, here&#x27;s a non-trivial product website of mine where the homepage is 0.3MB total over the wire and renders in 0.4 seconds for me (includes custom fonts, payments, analytics, large screenshot and real-time chat widget):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.checkbot.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.checkbot.io&#x2F;</a><p>The major tricks I&#x27;m using is keeping the website CSS small (CSS for homepage + rest of site gzips to less than 8KB), inlining all CSS, rendering default fonts before the custom font has loaded, SVG for all images (this saves a ton), and not using JavaScript for content (which blocks rendering).<p>The screenshot in the header is in SVG format and inlined directly into the page along with the CSS, so the moment the HTML arrives the browser can display all above the fold content. Logos are another good one for the SVG + inline treatment.')
