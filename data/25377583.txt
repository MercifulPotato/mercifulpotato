Beyond the functional, beyond the Lisp, what is special and unique to Clojure is its style of data modeling. Using plain immutable data-structures creates a very unique style, and I think there isn&#x27;t enough conversation about that. So it lacks best practices, and possibly support around it as well, in tooling and in style.<p>It&#x27;s hard to discuss your particular case, but what I wonder is if there wasn&#x27;t a different way to model things that would fit in the Clojure data-droven model. And if not, would there be new patterns or even some extension constructs to it that could allow it to fit?')
