I just wasn&#x27;t taking it seriously enough.<p>I took Calculus my first semester and scored over 98 on every test. No one else in the class scored above 80 on any of the tests. The teacher was dumbfounded.<p>I, of course, have a degree in mathematics... Undergrad math was... boring.<p>The only reason I didn&#x27;t continue down the path of high level math is because it isn&#x27;t profitable. It is also hell on the mind. Few understand that but it is very easy to get lost in a world of math if you are good enough at it. It consumes your entire mind. It is somewhat beautiful in that way, but doesn&#x27;t lead to one become very balanced as an individual.<p>Cooperation is for pussies. Those who make the biggest difference in history are those who give zero shits about anyone else and devote their lives to furthering what they pursue. Very few teams can hold a candle to a dedicated prodigy.<p>There are these things called books. There are tons of them.
