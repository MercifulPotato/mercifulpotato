For Instacart this is a huge win, faster fulfillment and probably even higher accuracy of fulfilled orders. For chains this is also a great win since they can utilize their employees more, make a little extra off Instacart, and potentially even optimize their store layouts better to cater to this new style of shopping.<p>Also the headline is quite misleading given that there are only TEN union workers... so &quot;all of its union roles&quot; is misrepresenting the whole thing a bit.')
