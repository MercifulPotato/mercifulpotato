Google shows several results on this.<p>For some anecdata, our 5000 person software company held a survey early in the year and 30% said they wanted to be remote. Then the company shaped policies around that to allow remote work in the future. When the time came for people to proactively request to be remote, it turned out to be around 50% (and I assume that will rise as people figure out what they want, where they want to be, how life is during non pandemic shutdowns etc.).<p>I think what it ultimately comes down to is a significant number of people will want to continue to be remote; it&#x27;s not just a few people.')
