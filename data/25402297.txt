Was it also on the DDR subreddits a while ago?<p>I meant to ask the first time I saw it -- if I&#x27;m understanding this correctly, the entire frame consists of parts that can be either printed or just sourced off-the-shelf? I&#x27;ve personally had &quot;pad build&quot; on my backlog, and have been playing around with modifications of the Cobalt Flux design on paper ever since a failed attempt to put one on risers (apartment noise issues...), but wood- and&#x2F;or metalworking have generally been barriers to actual implementation.<p>Maintaining it up until that point is actually also how I DIY&#x27;d my first controller (to replace a broken USB adapter), and finally learned to solder.<p>(It also just became less of an issue between living in a region with a few different cabinets I could drive to and the L-Tek pad releasing around a year or so later.)')
