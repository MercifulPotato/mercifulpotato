Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, even leading experts in low-level algorithm optimization. Lemire was upfront about making a mistake, and not at all defensive about it; if you are reading it that way, it’s just you.<p>It is clearly the case that the M1 CPU&#x2F;SoC has a significant performance advantage in typical branchy single-core code, but much less advantage if any for certain kinds of heavily optimized numerics. Beyond that high-level summary, it’s good to dive into the details, and spark discussions.<p>Everyone is just now getting their hands on these chips, learning how to work with them, and trying to figure out how to best optimize for them.')
