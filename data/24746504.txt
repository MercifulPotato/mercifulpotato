Some states do have provisions for the arrest of the Sheriff. Here&#x27;s an example from Indiana:  &quot;A warrant for the arrest of the county sheriff shall be served by the coroner or any other person to whom it may be legally directed. The coroner, who shall commit the sheriff to the county jail, has custody of the jail and its prisoners during the imprisonment of the sheriff.&quot;')
