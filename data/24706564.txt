It will actually benefit US industry by forcing companies to only select the most highly skilled workers. It will raise standards in all industries.<p>It will even give foreign workers an incentive to improve their skills in order to meet higher entry requirements. This will give people something to work towards.<p>In the software industry, managers and company owners have a false idea that they can get things done faster by throwing more people at the problems and having access to cheaper labor is the solution... Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work like that. There is such a thing as a 10x or 100x developer (companies like Netflix have already figured this out). Unfortunately, most companies will not figure this out on their own while they are addicted to cheap labor. Companies need to be taken to detox.<p>In a normal capitalist environment, these cheap-labor addicted companies would be wiped out at regular intervals, but in our crony-capitalist environment the government is keeping them on life support; so the least the government can do is force them to increase their standards.')
