This claim was made my &quot;Maxwell&quot;, but they didn&#x27;t provide any proof.<p>Some VPNs were using kexts before Big Sur, some weren&#x27;t. Wireguard for example is a normal AppStore app which integrates with the OS VPN support. It would suck to be confirmed that it&#x27;s leaking traffic.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, a VPN will not protect you from threats on a hostile network.')
