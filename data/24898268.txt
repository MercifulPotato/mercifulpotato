People&#x27;s utility function is not purely monetary over an infinite time horizon. Trading allows you to trade off price and risk over multiple time horizons.<p>For example, a trade where someone needs to convert his assets into cash due to a family emergency benefits both sides. The person with the emergency takes liquidity from the market and pays a premium because the trade is time-sensitive - he needs cash the next day. Other liquidity traders may profit from such &quot;uninformed&quot; flow in the long term, but both parties are happy because they got what they want.<p>Another example is trading off risk and hedging against certain changes in the world that would affect you.')
