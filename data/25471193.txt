I am only 26 but feeling pretty burned out, my health has gone to s<i></i>*, and I don&#x27;t find the work as interesting anymore. I am thinking about possible careers outside of tech but not sure what to look at. I&#x27;m slightly worried about the pay cut (Â£130k as a contractor in the UK) but I want to do something more active and social.<p>I know a few of you out there have mentioned having similar ideas -- what did you end up doing to move out of tech?<p>Also, merry Christmas :)')
