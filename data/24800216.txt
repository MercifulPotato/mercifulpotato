Speed limit for the area&#x2F;road I am in.<p>2. Real time radar report telling me how many cars&#x2F;pedestrians e.t.c are around me.<p>3. Information on common accident types in the area I am driving in.<p>4. For my corner of the world, it will be good to get a report on road status before I take the route - something like gravel, cratered e.t.c<p>I suspect that something like this would sell like crazy for existing cars. Basically a thing were I install a camera&#x2F;sensor that is hooked to such a device.')
