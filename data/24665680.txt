Coffee and Coke Zero became very disappointing. I was swabbed and confirmed diagnosed with it.<p>It really did me in and I’m not sure I completely recovered form it yet. Took me 3 months after it was over to be able to run more than 30 seconds again. I could do a 5km run easily before. It’s a struggle now. But I’m in my 40’s so I expected a longer recovery cycle.')
