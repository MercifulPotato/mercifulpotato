Gas-turbine generators can simply discharge to the air, but high-efficiency dual-cycle generation includes a secondary steam phase, requiring cooling.<p>Solar thermal may utilise secondary cooling (though rarely, possibly never, does).<p>Solar and wind benefit by energy storage, for which pumped-hydro remains the best option.<p>Long-distance power transmission is exceptionally efficient.  China&#x27;s major population and industry are in its eastern provinces, power needed elsewhere can be transmitted with low (~6%) line and transformer losses, though with disruption risk from storms, natural disasters, or accidents.<p>&quot;Reggionally limited&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem a huge ipediment.')
