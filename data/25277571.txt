There are certain intangibles like that that can surely enrich the experience.  Interesting that the educational value is being diminished by the absence of something without a price tag attached to it. Not as if colleges are saving money when students can&#x27;t interact -- putting aside electricity or costs of that nature -- so it&#x27;s not easy for students to justify that they deserve a rebate. Be nice if the more well-to-do schools dug into their fortune and made amends for the disparity b&#x2F;w expected and actual value.')
