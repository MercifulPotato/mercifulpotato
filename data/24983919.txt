Item(by='ocdtrekkie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604437268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24983706, text='Masnick appears to have little interest in honestly representing any position he claims to address, nor does he actually successfully address them.<p>For example, in whether or not Section 230 removes the incentive to moderate, he <i>claims</i> that before 230, there was an incentive to not moderate, which Section 230 removes. He fails to address reality here though: That the primary force behind moderation and not moderation comes from ad revenue, and Section 230 simply makes tech companies not liable for those very financially-motivated decisions.<p>He also buys into the &quot;regulations actually harm the little guy&quot; narrative big tech is known for using to defend a law that solely serves to enable mass-scale algorithmic moderation, while doing nothing meaningful to protect human-curated decisions. Intent is very important in law, and small human moderators doing their best effort are perfectly fine pre-230, but large companies using algorithms to maximize engagement and revenue at the cost of human society really needs 230 to survive.<p>Large companies that need to be regulated generally claim regulation won&#x27;t really hurt them, but hurts small businesses. This is, of course, a completely ridiculous claim: If it helped them more than their competitors, they&#x27;d be all for it. Regulations can (and generally are) careful to include proper methods of handling businesses from small to large, and we&#x27;ve seen this bad claim from Google when trying to discourage privacy legislation like GDPR.<p>He also addresses the conversation largely as someone who doesn&#x27;t recognize the vast disparity between the large companies Section 230 protects, and the smaller parties it harms. For instance, while recognizing the first amendment is a largely suitable way to handle <i>legitimate</i> cases that Section 230 would apply to, he dismisses it by saying that Section 230 helps avoid nuisance or &quot;frivolous&quot; suits. Of course, if &quot;nuisance suits&quot; is the problem, perhaps we should admit that the three most valuable companies on the planet can more than afford to handle nuisance suits without additional legal protection.<p>I&#x27;d love to find a good write up by an &quot;opposite shill&quot;, but honestly, that&#x27;s pretty hard: Google has invested more money into political lobbying than literally anyone else at this point. They&#x27;ve bought everyone who can be bought.<p>And, while we&#x27;re talking about not doxxing... how much work for Google have you done? A lot of your HN history seems to be largely defensive of them, and I found at least one comment clearly denoting you at least did work for them. I can confidently say I&#x27;ve never been paid by anyone working for or against Google... can you? So perhaps we should leave scouring each other&#x27;s profiles out of it? The HN moderators would almost certainly prefer it.')
