Maybe the truly critical things should also be vacuum-gapped (and put into Faraday cages while we&#x27;re at it)?..<p>But the system still has <i>some</i> connection to the outside world, right? That means we could run some heavy GPU load and measure the variation in its power consumption, which apparently has been tried before: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helpnetsecurity.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;13&#x2F;data-exfiltration-via-power-lines&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.helpnetsecurity.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;13&#x2F;data-exfiltration...</a><p>Along these lines, the excess heat has to go somewhere, so maybe one could measure the variation in the work of the coolant system. I couldn&#x27;t find any research about it right away (BitWhisper is similar, but a bit different), but I trust someone has already tried that.')
