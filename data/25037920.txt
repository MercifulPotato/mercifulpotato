My initial thoughts:<p>1. Title&#x27;s use of &quot;architecture&quot; is overly vague, but they do define it somewhat in the intro. It still doesn&#x27;t seem to overlap with the main bulk of the HN community.<p>2. Authors aren&#x27;t listed up front which is frustrating for anyone that has spent time with enterprise work.<p>3. It&#x27;s part of a site called &quot;nocomplexity.com&quot;. This is frustrating for anyone who&#x27;s been around the industry for some time because there is a lot of material (good and bad) on these issues. &quot;Complex architecture&quot; and &quot;complicated architecture&quot; often get used interchangeably when the terms mean different things. Many domains are necessarily more complex than others, but you can make a complicated solution to a less complex domain. It&#x27;s even noted in the Zen of Python.')
