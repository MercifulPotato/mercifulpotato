Head over 4chan and you&#x27;ll see a factory line of ideas being thrown at the wall to see what sticks - which is then further spread across social media.<p>4chan has always been like this. Pre-2007 it was basically the boiler room of the internet. You could find memes before they hit mainstream along with all the shitty ones that didn&#x27;t make the cut.<p>I&#x27;m sure this natural filtering was disrupted when we brought millions of users online for the first time and convinced them that social media <i>is</i> the internet.')
