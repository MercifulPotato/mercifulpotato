You demanded evidence from a blog post commenting on a wide discussion, that they have been involved in for years.<p>There are plenty of arguments by plenty of people making this point. You can agree or disagree with that, but you can&#x27;t demand that they convince you.<p>If I say that a free press is important to democracy, you cannot demand that I &quot;prove it.&quot;<p>OTOH, If a (my) legislating body has officially resolved something, as they have, <i>I</i> do get to demand that they tell me what it is. Telling me that they expect big tech to implement a system where police can gain lawful access to my data without circumventing encryption is... pissing on me while telling me it&#x27;s raining.<p>And yes, Orwellian, in the simplest and most iconic way. This is a resolution to ban encryption. Plain and simple. The resolution&#x27;s language is all about how they respect privacy and encryption. This is Ministry of Love language, and it&#x27;s Orwell all the way down. The only way to progress as they clearly wish is by changing the definition of the term &quot;encrypted.&quot; More precisely, taking away the &quot;end-2-end&quot; caveat or some other way of encrypting while circumventing encryption.<p>Incidentally, instead of &quot;police,&quot; the resolution refers to them (5 times) as &quot;competent authorities.&quot; This is like an Orwell homage... maybe an intentional wink. If I ever write a 1984 knock-off, the police will be called CAs.')
