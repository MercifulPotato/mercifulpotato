If that leads to everybody involved being even slightly better off, why should that be considered some kind of negative complex?<p>On that front, human pride and societal norms can be very weird beasts: Way too many people who would really need the help of somebody else, often are either too proud or too scared to actually ask for that helping hand. Too hard-coded is the fear of appearing vulnerable&#x2F;embarrassed, particularly in-front of strangers.<p>At least that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve noticed in Western societies, where begging (which is also a form of asking) is often considered some kind of scam and with demands to never support it by actually giving anything.')
