The question &quot;why haven&#x27;t we seen aliens visiting mars&quot; presupposes that we ourselves have observed mars so thoroughly that we should have expected to see such evidence. Given that we have only been closely observing mars for a few decades, either we&#x27;d have to get very lucky to see an alien visiting mars right when we just happen to be looking, or they would have to visit mars on an extremely regular basis. The fermi paradox is fundamentally about our specific lack of observation, for all we know the martians have already made contact and thus there is no paradox for them.')
