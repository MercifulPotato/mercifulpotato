They built many experimental vehicles of increasing size. This end up with their suborbital New Shepard. This was to be their first commercial vehicle and they have spent many years doing iteration on that. There is some market there but its questionable how big.<p>Once BlueOrigin had figured out the landing stuff and SpaceX was showing orbital landing already. BlueOrigin stated to spend a lot more money and seriously started building a Falcon Heavy class vehicle called &#x27;New Glenn&#x27;. This &#x27;New Glenn&#x27; rocket is really quite huge, but it is very likely not gone launch before 2022.<p>New Glenn is not quite on Starship level, its is more comparable to Falcon Heavy. It does not have a concept of second stage re-usability (at least not to land it).<p>BlueOrigin is also working on a moon lander platform. Together with some other companies the bid on NASA Moon Lander contract.<p>For BlueOrigin suborbital might be a distraction but its the only remotely commercial thing they have.  New Glenn is years away.')
