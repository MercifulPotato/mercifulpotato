I&#x27;ll accept the F2 interface only working on a standard keyboard with a basic monitor port and a restricted selection of USB devices. Needing to use it at all is an exceptional case that only techies need understand.<p>Sound, fancy graphics, mouse, disk encryption. These can all be delegated to the OS loaded from the hard disk. You don&#x27;t need any of these in the BIOS.<p>The reason for wanting a simple BIOS is so it can be protected from being modified by malware. That&#x27;s the prize.

It can boot up a live-USB copy of Linux quite happily, but if I ever add a set of future-USB ports that the BIOS doesn&#x27;t know about, I&#x27;ll have to be content to using the old USB ports on the motherboard just to get the alt-OS started.')
