I don&#x27;t understand how the &quot;selling shares&quot; would work though.<p>I could imagine one mechanism is that you make bets on how popular content will be, and get rewarded if it is popular (number of clicks, comments, etc.) ie popularity handicapping.<p>What do you do with the rewards of your bets? Maybe allow you to bump stuff to the main page? Promote content? I couldn&#x27;t imagine paying for this, however.<p>Alternatively, you could use the mechanism to identify people who are good at identifying interesting content, and having a leaderboard of people who find cool shit. That might be monetizeable.')
