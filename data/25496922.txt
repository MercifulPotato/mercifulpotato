Most college isn&#x27;t very structured in the first place.<p>I think it is a problem with expectations.  Kids seem to take on massive debt, then wonder why the job they get after spending four years at a school taking lots of classes that have nothing to do with the skills they need doesn&#x27;t pay well enough to make their debt seem worthwhile.<p>The truth is that lots of kids are pushed into a path that wastes a huge amount of their time, energy and money, because what they need to actually become valuable is going to happen after they graduate.')
