At least in the USA, Brostep has practically supplanted Dubstep and co-opted the name. This has been occuring for about the past 10 years. A big factor is the &quot;drop&quot; part of Brostep sounding very attractive to non-EDM people who head-bang, and to whom traditional Dubstep would be percieved as &quot;boring&quot; or not stimulating enough (without intoxication). This has led to a re-enforcing cycle where domestic EDM festivals reach greater audiences, and so they keep promoting Brostep as Dubstep.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m not a fan of this shift. I prefer EDM from the era of the track you linked to, and&#x2F;or contemporary artists who emulate the older styles.')
