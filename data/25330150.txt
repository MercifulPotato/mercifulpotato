When you procedurally generate terrain, for example, you do it in a way that is coherent and has structure similar to what you find in nature. You have areas that are the same height, areas where the height varies slowly or quickly. But you don&#x27;t generally just have random bits of terrain stuck together. This music sounds like random bits of notation stuck together. There doesn&#x27;t appear to be a time signature or chord progression or any melodic development. I think building that type of structure into it would be a good first step.')
