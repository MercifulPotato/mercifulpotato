As explained in the linked pull request:<p>- Let&#x27;s Encrypt is a busy non-profit organization. We can help maximize their budget by not using it as the exclusive default for every server.<p>- ZeroSSL does not have rate limits and is also publicly trusted. And yes, it is free to use it with ACME.<p>- ZeroSSL offers a graphical dashboard where you can log in and see and download your certificates.<p>- Having more than just 1 free ACME CA is a very, very good thing for the PKI ecosystem.<p>This is the beauty of standardization; if you give a server a URL, you can give it two and three and four, and not have to worry about global reliance on a single source.')
