As explained in the linked pull request:<p>- Let&#x27;s Encrypt&#x27;s servers are extremely busy and their operations run a frugal non-profit budget. We can help reduce some of that load by not using it by default for every server.<p>- ZeroSSL does not have rate limits and is also publicly trusted. And yes, it is free to use it with ACME.<p>- ZeroSSL offers a graphical dashboard where you can log in and see and download your certificates.<p>- Having more than just 1 free ACME CA is a very, very good thing for the PKI ecosystem.<p>This is the beauty of standardization; if you give a server a URL, you can give it two and three and four, and not have to worry about global reliance on a single source.')
