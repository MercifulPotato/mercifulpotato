Who knows if the US is metastable.  Things have been going nuts with the legal system here but it is also 250 years old.  Most european democracies are a much younger experiment (and france is on what, attempt #5?  Maybe #6 if you count subsumption into the EU as an unrecognized, but fundamental change in political dynamics).')
