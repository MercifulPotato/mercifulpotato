Sometimes you need to be lenient in what you accept<p>The best way to do this is to TURN the input into valid UTF8 though. Like replacing any uninterpretable-as-utf8 bytes with the unicode replacement character (U+FFFD).<p>Which is what most well-behaved software I&#x27;ve seen does with bad UTF-8.<p>I work with lots of text processing, including processing old legacy files etc. Just refusing to go forward with bad input (&quot;just fail fast&quot;) would work a lot less well.<p>Can you imagine if you tried to open up something in UTF8 in a text editor, and it just refused to open it, telling you nothing but &quot;Bad UTF8&quot; or maybe &quot;Bad UTF8 at byte 19734&quot;? Not super helpful.<p>But yeah, you want to TURN it into valid UTF8 as early in the pipeline as possible, while logging&#x2F;flagging&#x2F;notifying what was done. You definitely don&#x27;t want to let the bad UTF8 just continue through the pipeline like that unless you really really have to, that way lies madness.')
