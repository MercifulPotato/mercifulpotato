I do want to allow it but protect the content from accidental edits. Every time I publish a Notion page and forget to lock it, it is being accidentally modified. Some people notice it and undo. Some don&#x27;t. In the combination with useless page history it is very difficult to reason whether the edit was accidental. The page could remain in accidentally modified state for a long time until author notices it.')
