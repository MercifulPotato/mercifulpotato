If I&#x27;m working I&#x27;ve already set my system to say (a) I&#x27;m working, and (b) only receive from colleagues.  Then they can choose to wait (because I&#x27;m working), ping me (because they will need a response when I get a break), or ask now (because they need the answer now).<p>If their judgement turns out not to match my expectation then we can talk later about priorities, and each adjust to the other, thus improving the working relationship.<p>&gt; <i>IMHO, your preferred workflow makes it seem that your time is more valuable than the other person&#x27;s as you&#x27;re now asking them to hang around waiting until they can actually ask their question.</i><p>Not at all, there is a balance.  Sometimes what I&#x27;m doing really is more important than answering their question, sometimes it isn&#x27;t.  If what I&#x27;m doing <i>is</i> more important, then simply blurting the question into my message stream, as suggested by the article, is a &quot;Bad Thing(tm)&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s why I say ... &quot;It Depends&quot;.  I believe it depends on the question you want to ask, and the current working context.')
