The customer would bring the card in and the merchant would make a signed carbon copy and call it in or deliver the receipts to the bank every day, which would settle the accounts between banks over a week or so, with the credit card provider carrying some level of liability. This is one of the reasons credit cards weren&#x27;t accepted most places until networked POS terminals and instantaneous verification made the trust more practical.<p>Some merchants have their own verification steps in addition to the terminal like Best Buy checking a customer&#x27;s ID to see if it matches the card and one of these special cards wouldn&#x27;t fly if anyone actually looked it. It&#x27;s not like you can walk into a Lamborghini dealership with one like you can with a Centurion card (which has some sort of concierge service for verifying large purchases IIRC).')
