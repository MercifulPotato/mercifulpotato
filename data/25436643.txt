If anything it says the opposite, but the real focus of is asking for documentation writers to publish their source files. (odt&#x2F;doc files, latex&#x2F;rst&#x2F;md sources, etc...) My personal opinion is that open source projects should probably do this, when a project is taking patches to the source and contributors can&#x27;t also contribute to the docs then the docs will lag behind.')
