This is stuff I expect my engineers to do. I wouldn&#x27;t let my engineers get away without understanding the business or not obsess about the user experience.&quot;<p>Ironically I am now a product manager and what I have learned is that the answer is very simple: &quot;perfect engineers (using your definition) are FUCKING RARE.&quot; In a startup you probably can structure your org around a handful of them, but by the time you&#x27;re say Google-size (and way smaller than that) if your demands for a dev is &quot;must be great at UX&#x2F;business too&quot; you just won&#x27;t hire that many people, so you allow yourself to scale by breaking out the roles instead.<p>I miss the days of doing it all and try to get into it as much as I can, but I can&#x27;t recommend that as a company strategy.')
