To them, their website is &quot;just IT stuff&quot; and they simply don&#x27;t have a notion that it would involve any security.<p>To them you&#x27;ll likely seem like an overzealous geek that shouldn&#x27;t mess with their business website. I&#x27;ve experienced this before myself and it&#x27;s not particularly a good position to be in.<p>Their site has most likely been technically abandoned, i.e. no one capable is in charge anymore.<p>It&#x27;d be best to talk to the owner, show them your &quot;hack&quot; (change it to cats on your phone and let them verify in their browser) and offer them to fix it for free.<p>That&#x27;s how one does these things in our small country. ;-)')
