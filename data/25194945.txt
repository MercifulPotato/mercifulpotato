Or do you plan to go to the hospital and pay out of pocket?  Or, like some other voluntarily uninsured people, will you ask for medical treatment and then just not pay?<p>&gt; than work a low waged job and pay for Obamacare.<p>Why would a &quot;low waged&quot; job be a requirement, unless that&#x27;s the only job you can get?  You can pay for Obamacare with a middle or high wage job too.  You can also pay for it if you are self employed (which is a lot of people on Obamacare).')
