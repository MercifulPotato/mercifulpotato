As a result buses need to be big to amortize the cost of the driver across lots of users. But big buses don&#x27;t work well in low demand times of the day. The only option is to run them less frequently, which sucks for users. And big buses don&#x27;t fit down small streets. And fewer larger buses means fewer routes. Self driving buses could solve all these problems.<p>I&#x27;d still prefer to walk or cycle, but I&#x27;m probably biased because I live in a warm, dry and flat part of the UK and don&#x27;t have kids.')
