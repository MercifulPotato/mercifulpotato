It&#x27;s the same as &#x27;arguing&#x27; with an anti-vaxxer at this point.<p>I&#x27;m not going to go into detail on the power relationship here. If you&#x27;re going to deny that a university instructor and a student have a power disbalance between them, and that sexual relationships between them are usually illegal but certainly pretty much always inappropriate and against all policies, I&#x27;m not sure what to say anymore.<p>I linked AN ACTUAL POLICE AFFIDAVID that confirms that this woman not only wrote a lengthy document on their affair, but also how she posted that online, wrote the victim&#x27;s job about it in an attempt to hurt him, and posted the victim&#x27;s naked pictures online (among other things). I&#x27;m not sure what sort of evidence you would consider valid short of you being there watching it happen. And this is just the AFFIDAVID, there is a lot more out there, easily verifyable from various sources. But maybe someone should call the Tallahassee Police Department, ask for Kameron O&#x27;Hara, and verify that he actually wrote the affidavid, as you seem to think that someone forged this whole document including forging the name and signature of an actual office of the TPD (which he is, that&#x27;s easily verified with a single Google search)?<p>&quot;and the average person who has no legal background eats it up as the wholesale truth.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s rather rich considering that between you and me, I suspect there is only one person with a law degree, and it&#x27;s not you.<p>If all of this is &#x27;hearsay&#x27; and &#x27;made up&#x27;, where did the mugshots in the OP come from? Let me guess, it&#x27;s all deep fakes set up by the Cabal, as a pre-emptive move to discredit her in case she would go on 2 years later to become a whistle blower for a virus outbreak nobody knew would happen for at least 6 more months? Please.')
