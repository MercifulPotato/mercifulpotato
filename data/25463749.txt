It takes <i>hours</i> to properly cook meals for an entire family. That&#x27;s time I&#x27;d rather spend doing something else since I don&#x27;t really enjoy the process of cooking itself. There&#x27;s also the time required to prepare the dining room, clean the dishes, shop for ingredients and supplies and more incredibly boring tasks that I&#x27;m probably forgetting. Doing this every single day is just so tiresome!<p>Of course people would rather open an app and order some delicious fast food which arrives in about 20 minutes. It&#x27;s not healthy but it wastes less time.')
