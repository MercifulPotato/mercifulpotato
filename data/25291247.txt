Now, clearly, wholesale costs are going to be lower and the government revenue share lower still, but you&#x27;d only need 0.5% of that to offset the entirety of US aid to Colombia.<p>Prices from: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.addictioncenter.com&#x2F;drugs&#x2F;how-much-do-drugs-cost&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.addictioncenter.com&#x2F;drugs&#x2F;how-much-do-drugs-cost...</a><p>Production capacity from:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;0aa6474b944f4ff8eb9e7e9cffffce87" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;0aa6474b944f4ff8eb9e7e9cffffce87</a>')
