The cars have 3 second gaps between them.<p>At 30 mph: 160 cars max throughput\nAt 60 mph: 180 cars max throughput<p>In the 30mph example, for the first 2 minutes, 0 cars have completed the 1 mile stretch, for the period 2-10 mins, cars pass the finishing line every 3 seconds. 160 cars complete the 1 mile stretch in 10 mins.<p>In the 60mph example, only the 1st minute is spent without traffic completing the throughput analysis. For the period 1-10 mins, cars pass the finishing line every 3 seconds. 180 cars complete the 1 mile stretch in 10 mins.')
