For a hair dryer you&#x27;d strongly prefer more power now to get it done quickly, so all the cheap best selling hair dryer models are 2kw (e.g. as amazon shows at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;s?k=hair+dryer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;s?k=hair+dryer</a>), it&#x27;s pretty much the default power level for a hair dryer, and many hair dryers (intended for hair, not for warming up engine blocks) have more than 2kw.<p>In USA the default seems to be 1.85kw (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;s?k=hair+dryer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;s?k=hair+dryer</a>) possibly because 2kw appliances are trickier for the 110v wiring.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m also surprised by the assertion that &quot;the Russian for hairdryer (фен) happens to also mean a regular fan&quot;, as IMHO it does not, a regular fan would usually be called вентилятор, not фен. Фен means either a hair dryer or (as строительный фен) a heat gun for construction work.')
