In that case, it works in your favor: it&#x27;s just more data that you&#x27;re a bona fide AZ resident.  I was pointing out that if your children stay in CA while you go to NV, it works against you.<p>And AZ isn&#x27;t NV.  The FTB pays special attention to NV in particular because it has no income tax.  Someone who moves to AZ isn&#x27;t so obviously trying to skirt CA state income tax.<p>My case was a little special because I sold a lot of stock right after leaving CA, which makes it a little suspicious to the FTB.')
