The Pleiades cluster looks the same all year round.<p>Depending on how one defines the limit of what can be seen, there are either 0 stars, or 6 stars, or 9 stars, or hundreds. But only someone with very, very exceptional eyesight under very, very exceptional conditions can actually see seven stars but not nine.<p>Source: I&#x27;ve been observing the cluster, and the sky as a whole, for decades. I&#x27;ll draw the locations of the six notable stars just as easily as some will draw the big dipper. And I&#x27;ve never, in decades of observing under many different conditions from different latitudes, ever seen seven stars.')
