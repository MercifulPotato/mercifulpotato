We can explain choice and free will in bottom-up terms, which complements the article&#x27;s explanations of memory and signaling.<p>In the classic video game &quot;Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; (chosen to fit the article&#x27;s theme), there is a maze of signs. Each sign points towards another sign. Reading the signs in the order that they point to each other, following the chain of arrows, leads to a prize. The player is local and does not know where the prize is, but the signs encode global information about the maze. The player&#x27;s memory is limited and can only remember one sign at a time, but that is sufficient. It seems to me that cells communicate and act using similar local&#x2F;global distinctions.<p>&gt; We reject a simplistic essentialism where humans have ‘real’ goals, and everything else has only metaphorical ‘as if’ goals.<p>This is the philosophical meat of the article, and the tough takeaway for the reader. The reader must admit that their <i>own</i> goals, since they are human, are not quite &quot;real&quot; in a way which somehow transcends the accidental success of blindly-evolving low-level components. Rather, humans do the same sort of predictive modeling, blind guessing, and lucky incidence that we see in &quot;simpler&quot; life forms.')
