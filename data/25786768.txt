You can see terraformed mars quite often in SF, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about. Not even the flying islands that hist the power sources keeping the planet warm.<p>You see in tgis story, there is one thing kinda hiding in plain sight - it&#x27;s terraformed Mars <i>with Earth strength gravity</i>.<p>Yes, not 1&#x2F;3 g but full 1 g and they did it during the terraforming, it&#x27;s not a mistake by the author.<p>So how exactly do you triplicate planets gravity withou importing 2 times of it&#x27;s mass in the proccess ?<p>By buikding a Mars spanning series of particle accelerators that accelerate <i>dense macroscale objects to near lightspeed</i> under the surface.<p>Thanks to the theory of relativity things behave as they had much more mass as they approach lightspeed, which is exactly what you need to simulate two more Marses of mass needed to achieve 1 g like on Earth - bam, artificial gravity using known physics! :-)<p>Just don&#x27;t thing about the insane amount of energy requured to accelerate so much muss in your accelerator racetracks to lightspeed. Or what would happen if even just one of these superlaminar dense capsules anaged to collide with the accelerator wall, making all other crash as well. Very close supernova might seem like a firecracker in comparison.')
