We see corporate abuse happening all the time, every day.  If I had to speculate it&#x27;s that corporate executives have very strong incentives to do everything to make or save a buck, up to and including the things I&#x27;ve mentioned and more.<p>The things I mentioned previously did not involve any lapse of judgement at all.  Saying that is just being an apologist.  I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re suggesting lapses of judgement are responsible for these things, merely that actually suggesting so would make one an apologist. They are all done with eyes open, focusing on the dollar signs at the end of the road, public interest be damned.')
