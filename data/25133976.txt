Git knows what the upstream branch for this branch is. It should know what the remote-tracking branch for that branch is. So why isn&#x27;t there a command to merge that branch in?<p>Git remote-tracking branches are just a cache except when they&#x27;re not. A better model would be for every command that can interact with remote refs to fetch first by default (like pull does) but take an option to &quot;work offline&quot; and use the remote-tracking version (which would then be a proper cache). Or vice versa, for every command to not fetch unless given a parameter that tells it to. It&#x27;s ridiculous to have to guess which commands will fetch or not.')
