I don&#x27;t trust Mailchimp&#x27;s &quot;sole discretion&quot; and interpretation of what is &quot;inaccurate or misleading&quot;. What is true and factual is constantly in flux and subject to intepretation and debate. For example, an intelligent Democrat or Republican person, in many cases, have completely different views of what is &quot;true&quot; and &quot;factual&quot;. I could apply this to many non-political examples as well.<p>I&#x27;m going to look into moving to one of the many of the cheaper, more trustworthy competitors if what you have commented is true.')
