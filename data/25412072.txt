It does not impair the value proposition of utilizing middlemen. When a consumer buys something for £120, £20 of this is VAT, and will be remitted by the retailer to HMRC.<p>Now, relevant to your point is this: the retailer claims a credit for any VAT she paid when she bought the goods from a middleman. And that middleman will claim a credit for any VAT he paid when he bought from the other middleman. The VAT charged on each transaction in the chain is eventually claimed back. So whether is 1 middleman or 100, VAT does not cause any tax drag. In other words, the existence or number of middlemen in the chain does not change the total amount of VAT collected by HMRC on a consumer&#x27;s purchase of £120 (£100+VAT).<p>My reading of the Australian GST is that the mechanics are similar to the above: i.e. GST is charged on all sales, but that GST-business can claim back any GST they paid on things they used in their business.<p>So this leaves me to wonder: what are the main differences between the operation of UK VAT (as described above) and Australian GST?')
