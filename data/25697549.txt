One idea is to have ELVM with macros (which can have parameters); unsupported operations can be implemented using macros. Macros can be expanded independently of the backend, so this does not require changing the backend code. By examing the 8cc code, I guess that it might be possible to do it like that. Also ensure it can work correctly with different word sizes (and some backends might have option to control word sizes).')
