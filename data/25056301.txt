Alternatively, how about an annual levy of 0.5% on all wealth, including bank balances?<p>I think there may be something else going on. &quot;Essential&quot; work has been allowed to continue, and &quot;essential&quot; had basically been defined as anything directly contributing to economic output.<p>Meanwhile, the productive desk jobs have moved to the home. This leaves two categories of jobs high and dry, the jobs maintaining the office building, and the bullshit jobs.<p>The problem is that the existence of bullshit jobs is part of the current deal, and estimates range from 40-50+% of how much work in a western economy is pointless. If the bullshit jobs disappear, it threatens that model and ultimately capital holders. The people may decide to tax capital!')
