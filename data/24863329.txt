The only modern day comparison that I can make is to Harrod&#x27;s in London.<p>I have many childhood memories of visits to Hudson&#x27;s.  The elevators were pneumatically powered and I can still hear that escape of air.<p>You could say that Hudson&#x27;s like many old department stores was a victim of people moving to the suburbs and the emergence of shopping malls - and you&#x27;d be wrong.  Hudson&#x27;s built Northland which is the first shopping mall in the U.S.  The main problem was their ill fated merger with Minneapolis department store Dayton&#x27;s and the decline of Michigan&#x27;s economy.')
