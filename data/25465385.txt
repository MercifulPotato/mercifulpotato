But because Git doesn&#x27;t work with patches, it actually only simulates that, using heuristic algorithms such as 3-way merge. This works most of the time, but not always (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pijul.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;why_pijul.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pijul.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;why_pijul.html</a>).<p>- Conflict resolutions in Git cannot be modeled as patches, and you need `git rerere` to simulate that. This is not anecdotal, since conflicts is the one situation where you need the best and most intuitive tool.<p>- Short-lived branches are another poor simulation of patches: if Git were really working on patches, you would be able to create a branch &quot;after the fact&quot;, meaning that you would work (possibly on multiple features at the same time), and push different parts of your work separately, without having to worry about branches before you start.')
