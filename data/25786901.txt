There&#x27;s nothing in the world that could hold them in place.<p>I assume they are charged - or how are they keeping them in their &quot;track&quot;? No physical material could handle it. So they have to be charged, well the Synchrotron radiation generated would be enough to sterilize anything nearby.<p>So &quot;known physics&quot; is a bit of a stretch.......... :)')
