They give 0 indication what is acceptable or not.  That varies widely on who picks up your garbage.  The second part is china stopped importing a lot of it.  Turns out many were just bundling it up and shipping it to china.  That ended a couple of years ago.  That imploded the whole recycling market.  The money in it dried up except for very particular items (usually metals).  Everything else, no one really wanted it.<p>To make people <i>want</i> to recycle you need to positively enforce it.  If you goto a negative (such as a tax or fine) the incentive to do it falls off quickly.  America used to recycle&#x2F;reuse tons of stuff.  Pepsi and Coke figured out a decent cost to their system was the reuse of their bottles.  So they funded groups that worked against that.  People would put a deposit on the bottles and containers.  If you returned it you got the deposit back.  If you tossed it someone else usually would find it and return it and get the deposit.  It was a positive incentive.  Instead now we have this weird thing where companies produce garbage and blame the customers for not &#x27;taking care of it&#x27;.  We have no real reason to do so other than feeling good about yourself.  In some cases the ability and economic reality is not really there.<p>Most single stream systems are basically 2 trucks.  One picks up the garbage.  The other picks up the recycling.  Garbage goes straight to the dump.  The recycling goes to a sort center.  They dump it all out on large conveyor belts with a bunch of people standing next to it picking out what they can and slicing open any bags&#x2F;boxes they see.  Pulling anything that is obviously not for the stream (pizza boxes, magazines etc).  The magnets pull out anything metal.  The plastics and glass are sorted out usually by weight color and symbol if they have the machinery for it.  Otherwise it is manual.  This all takes time and money.  If you are making 50cents for a 2ton bail of plastic the economics is not there.  But if you say make 500 dollars for a bail then maybe it is there.<p>In a neighborhood I once lived in the recycling guy decided he was not going to pick up anything except pop cans and newspaper.  Everyone was mostly recycling correctly.  Suddenly my neighbors and I had 2x the garbage to deal with.  They all dumped it into the other bin and never recycled again for years.  It took only one small negative thing to change from &#x27;happy to help&#x27; to &#x27;meh not doing it&#x27;.  The boxes they had it in were obvious.  One week everyone was doing it, then almost none.  I would drive around the neighborhoods near mine and he had done it there too.  They had to change the way they pickup garbage to undo what 1 guy did in 1 day.')
