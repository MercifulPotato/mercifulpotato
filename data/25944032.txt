It&#x27;s a short squeeze. It&#x27;s nothing new. It&#x27;s the plot of the 80s movie &quot;Trading Places.&quot;<p>A hedge fund bought short position futures contracts for 120% of the available stock on the market. That&#x27;s the underlying reason the price is going up: because they&#x27;re forced to somehow buy more than 100% of the available Game Stop stock because they agreed to sell it to the people on the other end of those contracts for a set strike price.')
