I can not think of a single commercial organization which would even dare to claim they could protect against state actors or even provide any legally binding, quantitative assessment of their security that should inspire any confidence in their ability to defend against a single competent individual. You can just look to Google Project Zero to see a continuous stream of evidence of singular skilled professionals breaching these systems within mere weeks to months. Hardly comparable to the resources of state actors who can deploy hundreds or thousands of skilled professionals for years. To go from being unable to defend against skilled individuals to being able to defend against state actors would require on the order of a 100,000% improvement in capability by the &quot;best and brightest&quot;.')
