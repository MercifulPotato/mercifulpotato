Spending 40% of their money on fund raisers looks wasteful, but if they didn&#x27;t spend that much on fund raising the total amount they would have to spend on the useful work they do would be much less.  That is also why the board and CEO positions are really pay to play: the board of these places are all people who are big donors, and the CEO is chosen by the connections she has to people who will donate big dollars.<p>You must admit people who have the kind of money to throw around to buy a board seat probably have some business success as well as interest in the subject, so it isn&#x27;t all bad. It gets people who care and are good.<p>That is the alternative view of the situation. There is some real merit, but I&#x27;m not sure how much I believe it.')
