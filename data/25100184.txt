A long hose with nozzles plugged into the mains water that has to be manually turned on. It may not be automatic, but turning things on and off when I need them isn&#x27;t the problem, like using light switches isn&#x27;t the problem. There aren&#x27;t any coyotes around here and the winters are mostly frost free, so I&#x27;m hoping this doesn&#x27;t become a burden like the tech you mention!')
