Learning, maybe, but they both point to &quot;extracurricular&quot; time spent programming, which shouldn&#x27;t affect someone&#x27;s hiring. I&#x27;ve been on hiring panels and have pushed specifically against that mentality, because I strongly believe what a person is interested in outside of their work shouldn&#x27;t affect my decision to hire them, as long as they&#x27;re competent during the interview.')
