You can see it in action @ 0:17 in their sole released video[1], where the robot snaps flat during the ascent phase.<p>This was done primarily to increase the likelihood that the vehicle would land on all four wheels, in order to maximize energy dissipation by the wheels on landing and thus minimize shock seen by the body. As a secondary benefit, footage from the onboard camera stood a chance to be usable during a hop, instead of being a blurry mess. Lots of great details in their patent filing for the robot[2].<p>Source: I helped design this robot<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6b4ZZQkcNEo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6b4ZZQkcNEo</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US8849451B2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US8849451B2&#x2F;</a>')
