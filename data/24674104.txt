Thanks.<p>And in fact this happens a lot with a lot of situations - people forget (including me!) that very little “happens to us” without our input.  (Obviously some things are totally out of our control, but I’d argue less than we might think.)<p>This reminds me of a kid I met years ago. He always seemed to be in some bad situation or another - a personal injury lawsuit, a fight with a client, a fight with a boss, etc. He always framed it as bad luck - lots of bad things just happened to him and he was pretty melancholy about his lot in life.<p>It wasn’t until I spent a week with him on a group trip that I got some more perspective - he made a lot of bad decisions. If someone called him a name, he wouldn’t walk away - he went in and started yelling (made the personal injury lawsuit make more sense). If one of his clients had a request, he didn’t just adjust - he fought back and argued.<p>The whole thing was eye opening for me. It wasn’t that bad things happened to him - it was that he regularly made choices that put him on a path to bad things happening.  He just never quite realized that and, of course, never reported those parts of the story.')
