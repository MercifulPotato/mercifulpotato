After all, what possible recourse do we have after we start seeing these notifications on our messages? Certainly the government won&#x27;t start telling us the exact reason they are snooping. The very fact that your conversations had been snooped on by the government might imply there is something shady about you. Where there is smoke, there&#x27;s also fire, right? And this still has us relying that governments won&#x27;t start pressuring clients to have special code which bypasses the notification when it is convenient for them.<p>No. The government must not be allowed to deny the citizen his right to have private conversations.')
