It feels like being transported 15 years into the past, and (this one is Apple&#x27;s fault), I have to pick my video format carefully if I want to import onto my iPad, which generally, I do.<p>Everything, from the menu, to importing, remote control, all of it: it just doesn&#x27;t work great, the ergonomics are terrible.<p>Great camera though.
