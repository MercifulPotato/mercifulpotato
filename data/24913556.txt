I thought I remember reading that scurvy patients recover pretty quickly, and according the the NHS[0], it&#x27;s about 48 hours to start feeling better and 2 weeks to recovery.  Maybe scurvy is different, or perhaps we are assigning different timelines to the &quot;it takes to to incorporate the missing nutrient&quot;, but that does seem to be in opposition with your statement.<p>(Please note - this is not a &quot;show your sources&quot; challenge, I&#x27;m genuinely trying to understand the recovery process from malnutrition better.  My guess would have been that the malnutrition is quickly remedied, but the 2nd order damage might take longer.  Is that what you meant, and I just misunderstood?')
