Item(by='grumple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607645689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379228, text='&gt; I see no evidence that this harms consumers at all. Quite the opposite.<p>Then you are blindfolded. Many companies refuse to build for ios or charge more because of it. This isn&#x27;t theory, it&#x27;s fact supported by those companies and even the smallest amount of applied reason.<p>&gt; I like the walled garden and have no interest in it going away. I like that my mom can install apps and not worry about them spying on her.<p>Apple is spying on you. Perhaps you missed the bit where they phone home with every app that you open, thereby fingerprinting and tracking you.<p>&gt; I like that developers aren’t allowed to use their own payment processors. I don’t want to input my credit card into your black box payment system that might or might not charge me correctly.<p>This is a nice feature, but consumer choice exists. don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t use apps that require a different payment processor.<p>&gt; I see that it does harm developers, but that’s a different conversation entirely.<p>It&#x27;s really not. If the people making the apps lose, that&#x27;s a problem.<p>&gt; If you want to install whatever apps you want, buy an android phone! And have fun while their bloat ware and preinstalled crap spams you with notifications and scams you.<p>No thanks, I like my apple integrations but I also want to install what I want.')
