Fair enough, Google stops using their content.  They complain again leaving one to conclude that what they really want is a cut of Google&#x27;s revenue model --- amount to be set by them.<p>Next stop, simply abandon the Australian market as unworkable --- which I&#x27;m sure will produce further complaints. At that point, perhaps Google can negotiate a payment to stay. I suggest half the amount of taxes Google currently pays in Australia --- payable to said content creators.')
