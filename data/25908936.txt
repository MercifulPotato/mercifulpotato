The security consultant we paid to tell us that agrees.&quot;<p>Researcher: &quot;Your machines have USB ports exposed, can flash firmware, connected to the internet, don&#x27;t produce an auditable paper trail, and I hacked into a machine personally.  100% secure is demonstrably false.&quot;<p>Voting Machine Company: &quot;Well, a third party verified that it is 100% secure so we&#x27;re going to sue you (and probably not win) but it will cost you tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend, unless you cease and desist.&quot;')
