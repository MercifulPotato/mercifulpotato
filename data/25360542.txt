Exercise also has all sorts of non weight loss health benefits that aren&#x27;t tangential but complementary to weight loss, including staving off weight-loss induced muscle loss. Without a doubt, you can&#x27;t lose weight without getting a grip on diet, but I don&#x27;t think a diet only approach is a good one.<p>I had problems keeping a healthy weight in my past and the method that worked best for me was to target a diet a bit below my metabolic rate, one that would have me losing weight at a slow but steady clip (and would also start to trigger the lizard brain to eat eat eat), then add moderate exercise to the equation.')
