Then the docks containerized and electrified.<p>Then the neighborhood was for employees of the local Ford plant. Then they downsized and replaced most people with robots.<p>Now the neighbourhood is for a mix of people being housed by the state (the unemployed, single mums etc) and people working service jobs in Central London who take the train up every morning.<p>That&#x27;s all in the last 90 years. Less really as my house is one of the older ones.<p>With covid meaning everyone works from home, us service workers might all move out over the next decade.<p>My point is, people (including governments, companies and other groups) find uses for the infrastructure (including houses) that they have. Not the other way around.<p>And this is all cyclical: I remember when the inner cities were &quot;crime ridden hell holes&quot;. They depopulated. Then suddenly people (often gay men apparently?) moved in and suddenly you can&#x27;t turn around with seeing million dollar appartments, 8 dollar coffee places and high fashion outlets...')
