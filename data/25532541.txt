Their CC app is one of the biggest piles of garbage I have ever had to use. Adobe gave me a free month this year. I tried the latest version of PS vs Affinity and uninstalled after a few minutes. The uninstall process took over 30 minutes because for some reason CC itself was broken and had to be reinstalled before being uninstalled. There is zero reason for this.<p>PS has a lot of good points, but one giant bad one: no real support for multi-threading. I have a 1GB test folder of images that Affinity can resize in 16 seconds. It takes PS one minute and 15 seconds longer to do the same task. Affinity uses all the cores available to it; PS uses only 1.<p>I have an old copy of CS6 that I use for adding text to photos, and that&#x27;s all I use PS for anymore, and maybe the occasional touch up. It is small (install is 500MB), does not require CC to manage it, doesn&#x27;t spam my system with a zillion services and various programs that launch on start up, and it doesn&#x27;t need an internet connection to install or use.<p>Adobe is absolutely sitting still and everyone else is in the process of catching up or outright blowing past them in certain areas. Affinity 2.0 will probably be what a modern version of PS would be if Adobe didn&#x27;t have outright contempt for their customers.<p>I&#x27;ve been a PS user since if first came out, and was befuddled as to why they changed some keyboard shortcuts. I tried the new version this year and thought something was wrong with my PC or my keyboard. All of the shortcuts are second nature to me, and changing them after all these years for no good reason is a baffling decision.<p>Adobe won&#x27;t change their ways because they have massive lock in with professionals everywhere.')
