If that has the &quot;C&quot; variant, then you are almost certain to have the &quot;G&quot; variant of rs35044562 which puts you into the higher risk covid group. (don&#x27;t take anything here as medical advice, just digging into the data to see if you can find out something helpful).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikitree.com&#x2F;g2g&#x2F;1067199&#x2F;new-clinical-study-links-covid-effect-particular-dna-segment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikitree.com&#x2F;g2g&#x2F;1067199&#x2F;new-clinical-study-link...</a><p>&quot;A new genome-wide association study has identified a section of chromosome 3 where particular alleles are associated with severed effects after COVID_19 infection. This was then confirmed by a clinical trial of patients. The reported risk SNPs are having Cytosine (C) at position rs10490770 and Guanine (G) at rs35044562. These are in &quot;full linkage disequilibrium&quot;, meaning if you have C at the first spot then you almost certainly have G at the second. And you can now check for C at rs10490770 in some 23andMe, Family Finder, and Ancestry raw data files, or directly on 23andMe using Browse Raw Data.<p>You can search for rs10490770 in your or other people&#x27;s 23andMe v2,v3,v4, Family Finder and MyHeritage v1, or Ancestry v1,v2 raw data. It&#x27;s not on the GSA chip, and therefore not on 23andMe v5, FTDNA v2, or MyHeritage v2. It is on Ancestry v1 and v2.&quot;<p>So you can search your 23andMe data for rs10490770 by going to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;you.23andme.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;you.23andme.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;data&#x2F;</a><p>More information and options are at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;customercare.23andme.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;115004310067-Navigating-Your-Raw-Data" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;customercare.23andme.com&#x2F;hc&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;articles&#x2F;115004310...</a>')
