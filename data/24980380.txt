Type system is good but not as good as others.<p>Scala: absolutely amazing type system, but lots of unneeded stuff too. JVM packaging is a huge pain, and pretty heavy weight. Native compilation options are few and have slow executables in comparison.<p>OCaml: tiny ecosystem, multicore is always one year away, some weird ergonomic choices.<p>Haskell: lazy, IO has terrible ergonomics, and the community consists of pie-in-the-sky type theorists.<p>I would kill for a Dotty-like (Scala 3) native programming language that could omit all of the bullshit that was required to fit into the JVM and work with java libraries.')
