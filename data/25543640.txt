When working with e-commerce&#x2F;finance I used algebra. When making a 2d game I used geometry. When making a 3d engine I needed to learn about vector, matrices, etc. When working with weather forecasting there where formulas involving sin,cos,atan etc. So while you do not need math to get started in programming&#x2F;development, you will definitely stumble on it.
