The RAM is on the package, which makes it very performant and 16G is a reasonable limit for an Air-like computer. The Mini got cheaper and more powerful, so it is not a bad trade off. I strongly assume, that there will be variations&#x2F;successors to the M1 which are going to support more memory and also more IO (more USB-4 ports, more screens).')
