Yes, we know the Authlayer (now Zefi) guys very well as fellow founder friends.<p>1. Sure. Here is one of our case studies with a new Neo-bank that got launched recently in India - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;fintech-for-everyone&#x2F;enabling-the-banking-infrastructure-for-zoozle-b8452ae04c09" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;fintech-for-everyone&#x2F;enabling-the-banking...</a><p>2. Yes, that is by design for this early stage as the pricing varies based on the API choice and volumes. Happy to walk you through over a call based on your product&#x2F;use-case anytime - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;raunak_dembla&#x2F;introduction-to-decentro?month=2020-10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;raunak_dembla&#x2F;introduction-to-decentro?...</a><p>3. Absolutely. Our model is always in sync and up to date with regulations, since we work directly with the banks and their compliance teams.<p>4. Currently, it is all REST APIs but we will roll out web SDKs too at a later point in time.<p>5. I think one of the points worth mentioning is how in SEA, the money flow works differently than in the Indian scenario. For example, there is no concept of a nodal account in Singapore, unlike India. Of course, now India is also transitioning to an escrow from the nodal altogether.<p>6. We have shared some details here and will be adding more from time to time - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decentro.tech&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decentro.tech&#x2F;careers</a>. Specifically, there are a couple of layers that we add for encryption, encasing and archival.<p>7. Interesting mention. We will check it out :)<p>Cheers.')
