You&#x27;re attributing qualities that linux has to things that linux exclusively has. Your entire rant about emulating the functionality of Hazel with scripts is something you can do with either operating system. The fact that hazel exists is because it lets people that have neither the time nor the disposition towards writing their own program for their own use case and still get a lot of the benefits of such. In fact, even those that do have a proclivity towards scripting their own maybe would rather do something else with their time.<p>&gt; On Linux, you dream up the code in the language of your choice and it will work forever.<p>...I&#x27;m sorry, how is this exclusive to linux, exactly? You can do the exact same thing in MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD, etc. Also, maybe some people just don&#x27;t want to fucking program every function and application they run on their operating system?<p>&gt; Your learned skills will transfer one-to-one to programming you do for your job or hobby<p>While I understand that there exists a much higher population of programmers on HN than on other websites, please stop assuming that 1) everyone here is one and 2) that everyone wants to spend their time writing software in their spare time and 3) even if they do like programming in their spare time, that they want to spend it writing automation scripts.<p>&gt; instead of being weirdly specific and locked down to this one, overpriced app&#x27;s clickity click interface.<p>What is overpriced to you is potentially someone else&#x27;s pennies. I don&#x27;t really think the jab at GUI interfaces is appropriate, either.<p>&gt; Of course scripting is not exclusive to Linux, but it is the only OS that was and is built with it in mind.<p>Again, this is just plain ignorance.')
