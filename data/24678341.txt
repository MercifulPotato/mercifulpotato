No commute these days? Leave your charger in another room and start working. Once you get in the zone, you&#x27;ll find it hard to leave to get your charger, similar to how you delay going to the bathroom when watching a movie, even though you could just hit pause.<p>You&#x27;ll be surprised. By the time your laptop&#x27;s battery is at 6% or 5% you&#x27;ll be slaying dragons.<p>This is extremely useful when you want to implement a feature or fix a bug and you&#x27;ve been dragging your feet. The code doesn&#x27;t need to be great, but you&#x27;ll often have a prototype&#x2F;proof of concept with the right<i>ish</i> abstraction, which you&#x27;ve been dragging your feet on.<p>Some of my most effective work was done on a bus: &quot;Come what may, I have 40 minutes to solve this issue&quot;. When I did it twice a day, that&#x27;s a lot of issues taken off the backlog.<p>It also works with learning something you&#x27;ve been delaying. &quot;I have 40 minutes to go through this tutorial on Kubernetes&#x2F;Docker&quot;. I won&#x27;t learn all the subtleties, but it <i>does</i> work.<p>Call it Bus&#x2F;car Driven Development, or Battery Driven Development. Basically introducing a hard, physical, constraint that is a bit more real than a pomodoro timer. You actually have to get off the bus&#x2F;car, or the laptop actually dies. It&#x27;s more exciting than an alarm going off.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23547259" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23547259</a>')
