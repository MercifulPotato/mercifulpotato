It would also be presumptive to know what the article writer had in mind as well.<p>That said, and this might be an age thing, I&#x27;m not sure. When I see these computer science concepts and constructs that were figured out half a decade ago or more, which have their particular usefulness and limitations. It is hard for me to believe intellectual honesty motivating those kinds of posts.<p>It&#x27;s the same recipe. Take something trivial, well understood, and write a post with a title that suggests something highly opinionated, and possibly contrary to what the reader might have experienced themselves. Then explain how in some use case, it doesn&#x27;t fit very well. Then, maybe for the kicks of it, walk back on the original &quot;click-baity&quot; statement that got people to read it to begin with. And wrap it up as if there some deeper or more profound knowledge to be gained.<p>I will admit, I haven&#x27;t read the article, because my bullshit detector started ringing. When you&#x27;ve seen a hundred of these, you don&#x27;t need to read one more. But I&#x27;ll take a quick look now, for the sake of it. Yes, pretty much the same recipe as I mentioned. Perhaps slightly less pointless than I had expected.')
