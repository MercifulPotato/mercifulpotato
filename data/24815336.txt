If so, how does one rewrite the liability laws for farm equipment?<p>And while physical modifications may reduce manufacturer liability - what about software?  And the ability to reset the software so that evidence of the changes are no longer present?<p>There&#x27;s a challenge with the law for repair and liability for farm equipment that needs to be reconciled.  That liability issue doesn&#x27;t exist for other domains (modifying a personal computing device).  You aren&#x27;t likely to find a $6M claim against Apple for ripping someone&#x27;s arm off - that is an issue with farm equipment.')
