If the demographics changed then the parties would adapt so that again they both just barely have what they need. The parties would adapt by campaigning to different groups of voters or changing their policies to attract the other party&#x27;s voters. It&#x27;s a waste of resources and concessions to gain more voters than are useful for winning.')
