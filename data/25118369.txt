You&#x27;ll be instead looking at how they&#x27;re moving so slowly on digital cameras &#x2F; electric cars.<p>Digital vs film cameras are, I think, a pretty good analogy here in a lot of ways, both in terms of business and technology. Digital cameras were more expensive than film and, initially, less performant but had low operating costs and more convenience. It was a transition where the eventual result was clear to most people except for, perhaps, film camera buffs, but the pace of change was uncertain.<p>Some companies like Nikon and Canon anticipated and adapted to the transition and did really well. Some, like Fujifilm, found their niche using the expertise they had. Some, like Kodak, were so firmly planted in their ways that they gave up their massive lead waiting for the tide to turn rather than risk disrupting themselves.')
