To give the correct citation:\n&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;\nBy analysing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 158 radiocarbon-dated bones of the extinct New Zealand moa, we confirm empirically a long-hypothesized exponential decay relationship. The average DNA half-life within this geographically constrained fossil assemblage was estimated to be 521 years for a 242 bp mtDNA sequence, corresponding to a per nucleotide fragmentation rate (k) of 5.50 × 10–6 per year. With an effective burial temperature of 13.1°C, the rate is almost 400 times slower than predicted from published kinetic data of in vitro DNA depurination at pH 5.\n&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;\nfrom <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsocietypublishing.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1098&#x2F;rspb.2012.1745" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;royalsocietypublishing.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1098&#x2F;rspb.2012.174...</a><p>Or in laymens words: the half-life of a DNA molecule per nucleotide depends on the environment and is in the order of magnitude around 1 million years. Else, we would not have any ancient genomes by now.')
