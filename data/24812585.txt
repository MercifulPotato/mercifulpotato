They give them zero room to warp or bend so they just shatter. It was not fun when I had to manage a fleet of them. With around 200 laptops total we constantly had a stack of 10 rotating in&#x2F;out of the Apple store for broken screens.<p>The only thing worse is the fact that the duty cycle on the USB-C ports is so stupidly low. We ended up getting everyone these little port saver things because we got tired of sending laptops in for worn out ports.')
