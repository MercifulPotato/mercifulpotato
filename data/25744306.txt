Canada is bringing 400,000+ new immigrants per year until 2023 for permanent residence status, most of which are skilled workers of some kind. Probably a safe bet between that those three are setting up shop here in part because they can bring in international talent into North America more easily then with the US cracking down on it&#x27;s immigration policies.<p>No idea on what effect it will have on salaries here though.')
