Disclosure: I care deeply about the design of things, almost pathologically. Just finished watching the new S class demo. I am horrified. Nothing seems right to me. Multiple displays, mood lighting, chaotic UX and Visual language from Windows Vista.<p>Cars are heavy objects that are dangerous and simple logic dictates that the driver eyes must be engaged with the road and car surroundings constantly. Removing hard control surfaces, knobs and on&#x2F;of switches and replacing them with touch interfaces, create mental overload and increase the risk of less control.<p>Lets examine infotainment options that is needed in a car:\n1. Navigation. 2. Music consumption. 3. Apps, Games, Movies for the passengers.\nThis are things that iOS and Android do perfect. \nAside of privacy concerns and tracking, if car companies bring back the proven UX with knobs and buttons and everything else is just a mobile os it will be fine with me.<p>P.S.\nI find more satisfaction in long trips with my 20 year old Jag than in someone of the new cars with all around touch interfaces with fingerprints all over. Don&#x27;t let me start on usage of &quot;black piano&quot; materials trend:)')
