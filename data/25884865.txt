One handed open and close. The thumb hole doesn&#x27;t catch on stuff as a stud would. I preferred the version with the molded clip rather than the wire clip for the same reason, but I lost that one and had to replace the knife.<p>Good blade, well made, small enough that people who don&#x27;t &#x27;get&#x27; pocketknives don&#x27;t lose their shit when you pull it out to open a box or envelope or cut up an apple.<p>Everything else in my pockets is pretty mundane, though I do keep my bifold wallet in my hip pocket instead of my back pocket. I find that&#x27;s a lot more comfortable for sitting or driving for long periods. Supposedly it makes it harder for pickpockets as well?')
