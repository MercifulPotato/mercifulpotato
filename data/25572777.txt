Standard synths and sequencers abound, and there are lots of weirdo instruments to play with too.  Using Audiobus or AUM lets you drop effects onto audio synths (or any sound source really) and control them via sequencers (check out Fugue Machine), most apps support this.  It’s a lot like playing with modular synths, and you can stick GarageBand or some other DAW at the end to record your improvised sessions; I believe some can do multitrack recording as well.<p>I bought an iPad Pro back in 2016 specifically for music production.  I got a lot of mileage in particular out of Loopy, the most versatile loop “pedal” I’ve ever seen.  $5 gets you a 12-track looper&#x2F;mixer with an intuitive touch interface and lots of advanced features.  It’s iOS only though.')
