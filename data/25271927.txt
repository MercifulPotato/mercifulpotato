Just &#x2F;join it, if it doesn&#x27;t exist it gets created. Or perhaps have a 1-1. But because this affects everyone, it&#x27;s easy to make it the culture to not spam irrelevant stuff in the main channel, making it a non-problem that threads could alleviate.<p>In practice you&#x27;re going to get violators, but that happens with Slack as well. In part because Slack&#x27;s thread UI sucks so occasionally you&#x27;ll wake up and see a couple people in after-hours last night who just didn&#x27;t care and filled up 50-100 messages on the unthreaded channel, forcing people to skim through it or if they were foolish enough to leave notifications on after-hours to get all these pings.<p>One nice thing basically all modern chat systems have is easy group chat, so you don&#x27;t have to create a new room, but rooms are nice too. e.g. any time we had a customer case requiring a few people to look into it, we&#x27;d just create a slack channel for it instead of using threads on the team channel. After a while someone would archive the channel.<p>Then there are people who use threads and occasionally click the &quot;send to whole room&quot; option which really screws up notifications. You&#x27;re looking at it right there in the main team chat, but you have to open the thread or your notifications to dismiss the notification.<p>Next time I&#x27;m forced to use Slack I&#x27;ll use Ripcord. You know what UI I miss most and would help Slack&#x2F;Discord&#x2F;Element tremendously? Tabs.')
