Usually I&#x27;m at my best focus in front of a whiteboard and talking to myself out loud, because walking distracts me. I work in a busy office where there&#x27;s a lot of noise (which I&#x27;m sensitive to) and where I can&#x27;t speak to myself loudly, so I feel I&#x27;m not very productive. Teleworking has been awesome')
