However, it took me a long time to learn its API. One of the pain points I have with the official API site is that it doesn&#x27;t have search functionality.<p>I rely heavily on good search in other API sites like vue.js reference website. It makes the learning curve flatter. So I made a third-party API site with search function for paper.js, check it out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paper-api.wentin.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paper-api.wentin.co&#x2F;</a>')
