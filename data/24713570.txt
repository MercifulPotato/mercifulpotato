Anyone who has taken a cryptography course will know it.<p>It&#x27;s not the fastest algorithm (by big-O; probably is in practice), though. You can do a matrix decomposition, exponentiate the eigenvalues, and convert back. Speed will depend on how you do the exponentiation, and that&#x27;s gets into a pile of optimized numerical methods.')
