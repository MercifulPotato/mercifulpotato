Also make sure to change starbucks&#x2F;RandomWifi location every time and for extra-paranoid reasons, maybe wear some toupee and fake moustache in case they try to get camera recording from the starbucks. I would also do most of the work from home, just run all the db&#x2F;code updates from home and then sync&#x2F;push the update at RandomWifi so you just need to stay there a few seconds. You don&#x27;t even need to get in, just stay outside walking and click the push button from your laptop quickly. Never do it on the same hours either.')
