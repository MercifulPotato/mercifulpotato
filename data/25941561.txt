Do you think that programs designed to work in current terminals (e.g., vim) should stop working with the new terminal technology?  That seems a bit tough for progressive adoption.  Otherwise, how  do you think that these programs should be changed?  Or wrapped in some intermediary &quot;terminal emulator&quot; so that they can run unchanged in the newer terminals?')
