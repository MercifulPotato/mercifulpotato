This year I decided to invest my free time in creating two channels for Painting(art in general) and Drawing (design focused), all is planned and tested and the only thing left on the table is video platform. YouTube as a platform rewards &quot;dopamine reaction&quot;, controversy topics, kick-bait thumbnails, short form format and so on. Yes, there is a ton of good stuff that is actually hard to find because the Algorithm is fine-tuned to work in absurd way by pushing non relevant content. As a creator after recent changes to UI&#x2F;UX you cannot tailor user experience in full. Using playlists is not enough of a tool for me.<p>YouTube is useful for big brands with lots of content with high revenue and everyone small is pushing it hard to find a way to be liked and stay relevant to &quot;monetization&quot; practices. At this point if you as creator don&#x27;t rely on ad-revenue YouTube is not your place.')
