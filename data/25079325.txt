It would be wrong to make predictions about a real system, without studying validity of that prediction.<p>Authors clearly state &quot;an earth system <i>model</i> shows ...&quot; not the &quot;Earth is going to melt&quot;. They say &quot;we encourage other model builders to explore our discovery in their (bigger) models, and report on their findings.&quot;<p>Authors work with their model, use it to calculate some results, they do not pretend, that the results are the Truth. Authors know what validity is, they ask others to take a look at it.<p>Nothing wrong with it.')
