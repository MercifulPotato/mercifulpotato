Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=[25369159], score=None, time=1607568455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368189, text='&gt; Only 2 nuclear weapons out of the 10,000s made have ever been used. Almost no one announces they are building a nuclear weapon, it is usually done in secret. So this argument does not really hold.<p>The entities that have, so far, made nuclear weapons are nation-states.  I think most people would agree with the following statements on that: (a) it&#x27;s hard to prevent nation-states from making them (not for lack of trying), (b) many of them already made them long ago (U.S., Russia, France, China, etc.) and we&#x27;re not trying to say that was illegal, (c) the concept of &quot;illegal&quot; at the level of nation-state actors is ... to say the least, very different in implementation, and possibly in concept, from that of &quot;illegal&quot; at the level of individuals.  Many people think that nations making <i>more</i> nukes is bad, and some are in favor of disarmament treaties, but I don&#x27;t think they believe international law either does or should mandate disarmament for all nations.  Some would say it&#x27;s hypocritical for the nuclear club to try to prevent other nations from developing nukes; I suspect others agree it&#x27;s hypocritical but <i>also</i> don&#x27;t want those nations to develop nukes.<p>The question in this case was, &quot;So, hypothetically, it should be your right to own nuclear weapons [personally]?&quot;  It would be impractically difficult for one person to make nuclear weapons by himself, without essentially buying or stealing all the important stuff from elsewhere.  And if it <i>were</i> easy for one person to make nukes, then probably no ideological system could resolve that easily.  There might be some middle ground of possible scenarios that&#x27;s important to resolveâ€”e.g. if a company wants to make a nuke to use for, I dunno, their own Project Orion or mining a mountain or doing an interesting underwater experiment, then should that be illegal?<p>We may end up facing the &quot;one madman <i>can</i> create a superweapon&quot; scenario with biotech.  Perhaps, by that time, everyone will have their own hazmat suits and their houses will have UV decontamination chambers to fight off SARS-COV-5 or whatever.<p>&gt; What I think most people do is they see from a practical standpoint that having unrestricted access to nuclear weapons is extremely dangerous and work backwards to justify why it fits their ideological framework.<p>Yep, I cheerfully admit this is what I&#x27;m doing.  At least I stated it as &quot;I think it <i>may</i> be possible to resolve the issue&quot; after mentioning problems with my proposal, instead of asserting &quot;my ideological framework resolves this easily&quot;.  Though I probably should have made the &quot;how would an individual <i>get</i> access to nukes anyway, and if that <i>were</i> easy, then what would <i>any</i> legal system be able to do about that?&quot; point first.')
