It&#x27;s all tribal knowledge. &quot;I do it this way because that&#x27;s how my grandma did it and it works for me.&quot; That&#x27;s fine enough, but it makes for a frustrating experience as a newcomer with no way to evaluate the credibility of different sources; it&#x27;s just everyone&#x27;s word against everyone else.<p>This is especially confusing given how long cast iron has been around; you&#x27;d think that someone would have taken an interest in cataloguing what actually works, by now.<p>So while this post may not be good science, or very much of it, I still appreciate that it exists.')
