I&#x27;m not convinced Android and the Chrome web store do ANY checking &#x2F; vetting. I have more trust in Apple&#x27;s stores.<p>Vetting could be better with a lot of companies as well; remember not so long ago when Windows Defender decided a critical system file was malware and broke a ton of systems?<p>Verification. Vetting. Gradual release. Automatically disable extensions if they changed ownership, or if there&#x27;s suspicious activity on the account of the owner (e.g. new login in another country).<p>And they need to take a MUCH harder stance on malware. Right now they&#x27;re not even acknowledging there&#x27;s a problem, let alone acting on it.')
