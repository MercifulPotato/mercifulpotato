The estate tax was a one-time wealth tax. It is true that wealthy people do get around many rules but that is not a reason to not have a property tax or to never have an estate tax tax - largely they still pay as paying a lot to move money around is often times not worth it.<p>The government doesn&#x27;t have to use your &quot;dollar more effectively than you&quot; if you have different goals. If the government wants to build a school and you don&#x27;t want a school you don&#x27;t get to choose not to pay taxes for the school. Other than just increasing the national debt (which I&#x27;m for) we tax people. A wealth tax would be a way to either increase revenue to increase spending OR increase revenue so that other forms of revenue can be cut.')
