Everything that runs is always machine code as there is no interpreter or VM (though you might say that Julia&#x27;s bytecode is the LLVM IR).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rogerluo.me&#x2F;images&#x2F;julia-compile-diagram.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.rogerluo.me&#x2F;images&#x2F;julia-compile-diagram.png</a>')
