They also have claim over &quot;engineer&quot; when used as self-promotion as a business or an independent contractor. However, they weren&#x27;t able to have the claim on it as a job title stick. So, assuming you don&#x27;t have PE quals: your consulting firm could not be gwerbret Engineering. Your job title at Microfang could be Software Development Engineer.')
