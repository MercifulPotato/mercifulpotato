Military, commercial surveillance (&quot;adtech&quot;), finance, healthcare, legal, institutional administration. None of these things are <i>entirely</i> useless, but are still mostly zero-sum or redundant waste. Technological progress is continually making us more productive, but instead of realizing the gains (eg full time employment being under 10 hours per week by now), our economy is structured to keep creating endless make-work jobs. We&#x27;re trapped in a paperclip maximizer for human labor.')
