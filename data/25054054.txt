I like that the author chose a version of Church Slavonic letters like Ѧ Ѫ Ѩ Ѭ instead of making up new ones. This attempt also seems to try to build etymological bridges to other Slavic languages (mostly Russian, though) like for example spelling rzeki as реки, rather the more phonological жеки.<p>I would prefer the Ukrainian or Belarussian versions of Cyrillic were used as a model, as they are closer to Polish (with the exception of the palatalisation of е, the norm in both Polish and Russian and almost rare in Ukrainian).')
