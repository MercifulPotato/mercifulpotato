I said that the &quot;violence&quot; called for in the article linked wasn&#x27;t any more than kicking disruptors out of a private event with force (something justified in that case), and the exact words I used were <i>IN ONE CASE</i> regarding the stage-rushing incident. It&#x27;s up thread for all to see.<p>You edited your post after being called out, and that&#x27;s now your scapegoat.<p>It is literally never justified for a politician to ask his supporters to physically assault a peaceful protestor.  Full stop.  You can squirm, gyrate, and try to justify it, but it&#x27;s not OK.<p>&gt; I stand by my original point that the original march was legitimate, and that Trump told the crowd to go home.<p>You can stand by whatever you want.  Trump released a pre-recorded video that &quot;we love you, but go home&quot; - 6 HOURS after the Capitol was stormed.  HOURS.  At that point it didn&#x27;t matter, reinforcements had arrived and the building was already cleared.  Furthermore, telling violent insurrectionists you &quot;love them&quot;??? Really?')
