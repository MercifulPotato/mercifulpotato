And there&#x27;s a situation where municipal governments essentially have no power to actually stop out of control cops.<p>But there are lots of people who want to do something but aren&#x27;t going to dive full tilt into actually challenging the serious problematics of a violent police force. So there&#x27;s a huge market for &quot;do something small&quot; which involves challenging fairly petty expressions of racism.<p>Basically, on &quot;the left&quot; and &quot;the right&quot; you have experts taking people&#x27;s real grievances and turning them into &quot;feel good&quot; symbology. The idiocy of the social signaling is annoying but the way the actual grievances go unaddressed is a considerably worse problem.')
