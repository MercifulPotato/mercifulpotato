Item(by='bazooka_penguin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610321803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719736, text='I don&#x27;t think we necessarily disagree, I just want to address this.<p><i>But to equate all right-wing speech with terrorism seems to be succumbing to a self-fulfilling prophecy while at the same time justifying the very actions you&#x27;re opposing.</i><p>I&#x27;m not equating it to terrorism, I&#x27;m saying that they have indicated they want separate systems and, really, a separate society. If you take right-wing talking points at face value, what we have now is a shaky middle ground, a society wherein the powers that be both reject them and also employ regulations that make it difficult for newcomers to make their own banks, lay internet cables, etc. which is why you see right wing memes about &quot;make your own google, make your own banks, etc&quot;. And these aren&#x27;t new talking points, one of Trump&#x27;s promises going into his presidency was to get rid of as many regulations as he could in general: financial and economic, environmental, governance, etc. and democrats&#x2F;the left are usually blamed for loving regulations. So if that&#x27;s the case, split the country and let them do what they want with their government, from scratch. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m saying we should go around and take all their belongings and march them down to Florida or something and leave them like cavemen. I make it sound trivial because I&#x27;m not an expert or anything, but for the purposes of this discussion I think it&#x27;s a better alternative to civil conflict and I don&#x27;t see how we&#x27;re going to fix the divide.<p><i>If we truly want inclusive political discourse, we need to acknowledge the validity of traditional conservative viewpoints while drawing a clear distinction between those viewpoints and reactionary terroristic violence. With this understanding in mind, newspapers such as the NYTimes have long featured conservative columnists with critical viewpoints. Perhaps such mainstream publications should try harder to do this.</i><p>I&#x27;m not really disagreeing but I think we&#x27;re past the point where publications matter. Social media has created this new world where you&#x27;re able to discover people you didn&#x27;t even know existed. In the past you might know your neighbors and accordingly, you&#x27;d move to a neighborhood that suited your tastes. For example, that&#x27;s basically what white flight was (I&#x27;m trying to be brief, not insensitive), it&#x27;s real, that&#x27;s how people act. And they&#x27;d remain in their local bubble and only have a vague idea of the rest of the world, neatly summarized by the news. People would get mad at ideas and vague demographics, and occasionally figureheads like politicians and public businessmen.<p>Now, on &quot;public&quot; social media like twitter, you can find virtually anyone who has a certain belief or is a certain way and just yell at them for existing or thinking a certain way. You and your friends can pick them out for doing something and mob them on social media, dox them and get them fired, and attack every social aspect of their life. This isn&#x27;t even unique to politics per se, this happened to a woman who made a terrible joke about AIDS and Africa, among many other people for non-political reasons like being accused of crimes or plagiarizing art. And this is in ADDITION to getting mad at ideas and demographics and figureheads. So the divide that used to be vague has been refined to an individual level, and to make things worse people categorize each other and place them into enemy tribes based on beliefs and people they follow on social media. You follow Biden on twitter? You&#x27;re a &quot;demoncrat&quot; and you&#x27;re the enemy. If you follow Trump you&#x27;re a &quot;nazi&quot; and you&#x27;re the enemy. You liked some youtuber personality that&#x27;s this way or another and you&#x27;re automatically a SJW or a white supremacist, etc. It&#x27;s borderline impossible to escape and you don&#x27;t even have to be a part of social media anymore, it&#x27;s become somewhat normalized to pick individuals out for their wrong doings and have an online mob use any means of communication they can, not just the internet, to attack you. You&#x27;re unfortunately suspected of being the Boston Bomber because some guy saw bad photos and created a psychotic conspiracy that put you in the middle? A literal international mob from around the world is coming to harass your family and make them miserable even though you&#x27;d been dead before the event occurred. Now, mobs certainly happened in the past at smaller, local levels, and they did target individuals often to even worse effect (e.g. lynching), but the digital space has made discovery of individuals easier than ever before and made it borderline impossible to hide your presence.<p>edit: formatting')
