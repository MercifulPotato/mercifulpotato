She doesn&#x27;t care. She tells me unrealistic things too.<p>For example, she says that I should pursue my expensive hobbies too, like track nights with the 1LE Camaro (which I felt I had to sell when getting married). Where would that money come from?! Should I just not pay the mortgage, or stop saving for retirement? She has also said if I don&#x27;t like my job that I should quit. I&#x27;ve explained that it would be a significant pay cut since I have experience in non-marketable tech (FileNet and Neoxam). Again, where will that difference come from?<p>I&#x27;ve suggested she pay portion of the bills, but she won&#x27;t. If she makes 30% of our income, then why can&#x27;t she pay 20% of our shared bills (mortgage and utilities). I even explained it that way, but she won&#x27;t do it. Not even a counter offer.')
