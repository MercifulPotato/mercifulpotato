Like gay or yankee, it should be reclaimed as at least neutral if not a mark of pride. But to the extent that it can&#x27;t be spoken it can&#x27;t be rehabilitated.<p>Of course there are a lot of people who disagree and believe that prostitution is just wrong, and that calling someone a whore should be pejorative, like calling someone a thug. While I disagree with this, those people should be able to express themselves freely too.')
