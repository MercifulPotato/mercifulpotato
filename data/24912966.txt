At this site, we used a bunch of different platforms: OSF&#x2F;1, Solaris, Linux, HP&#x2F;UX, etc.  So we had a large filesystem containing the source code, and built binaries for all the different platforms, and this included heaps of things, from Bash upwards.<p>A colleague of mine accidentally ran rm -rf on this filesystem.<p>It was taking a loooong time, so he realised and killed it, but not before it had removed a heap of stuff.  Because this was something that could be rebuilt, it wasn&#x27;t backed up, so we had to go through the process of downloading the tarballs, and recompiling everything for all the different platforms.  It took a few days to recover most of it, and weeks to completely restore things.<p>The day after the incident, when he arrived at work, he found his keyboard was missing a few keycaps.  It took him a while to realise that there were four gone:  &#x27;R&#x27;, &#x27;M&#x27;, &#x27;-&#x27;, and &#x27;F&#x27; ...<p>Good times.')
