Item(by='the_mitsuhiko', descendants=None, kids=[24686502, 24688072], score=None, time=1601886420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683713, text='&gt; In a few years battery electric vehicles will get to the performance levels of current F1 hybrids, but by that time the mantle of the pinnacle of auto-racing will have been taken by FormulaE<p>I strongly doubt that Formula E will be a drop-in replacement for Formula 1.  It&#x27;s a completely different (and unfortunately so far very boring) replacement for Formula 1.  If anything my guess is that once they figured out the battery problem so they can go on bigger courses, they will introduce electric vehicles in the Formula 1 and start phasing out Formula E.')
