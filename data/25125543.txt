They work; the market works.<p>You do realize Tesla was on the brink of death long before the the first Carbon Credit was sold in 2012? There was a real possibility that Tesla would have never made it to get to that point were it not for the external investments, Elon&#x27;s own money and the DOE&#x27;s loan that made it possible to make that possible for them to survive long enough to be able to be in that position to do so.<p>Markets may work for many aspects as a medium to achieve desirable ends, and are definitely better than State involvement, but despite being a self professed Anarcho-Capitalist with a massive Agorist and Environmentalist bend I&#x27;m not convinced that Market forces alone are able to address the damage we have collectively inflicted as Species to the Environment. Actions have to have consequences for something so dire and if prison and fund seizure is widely accepted and used as a deterrent for the most heinous of crimes in Society for the Private Citizen then it must also apply to the State, Hedge-fund and Corporate class. These immunity decrees need to be abolished, and their actions are not something we should allow to be settled out of court.<p>Selling the affluent class Teslas isn&#x27;t going to undo the damage to the polluted and depleted Oceans, or arable farm land and aquifers being used as chemical dump sites by State subsidized Corps. It has to be more extensive than that and punishing Politicians, Banks, Corporations and People with jail time and fund seizures used solely to reverse these issues will be what had any chance to curtail this.<p>&gt; It sounds like putting people in jail doesn&#x27;t work?<p>No, as I mentioned it was the selective application of the Law that is the issue; by making it clear that everyone involved was going to prison and have their assets clawed back from their entire careers in those Industries will there be any chance for it make any significant impact.<p>I cannot divulge the specifics but if you just heard the way the Reps from Bosch I dealt with on daily basis spoke about this knowing all they had to do was pay out a small amount in refunds in relation to VW you&#x27;d understand why I hold these views.')
