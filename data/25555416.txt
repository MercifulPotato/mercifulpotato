Just because you may not be able to break something down into first principles, does not mean that the knowledge is useless.<p>Yes science is different from logic. Programming functions happens in a limited axiomatic world that simulates logic. This makes computer science a bright target for mathematical formalization. This is entirely different from science.<p>&gt;It might be true that much of systems design is based on anecdotal evidence and intuition, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s enough of a reason to ignore the field of design entirely.<p>I never said ignore the field. Often we have no choice. No one calculate the best work of art. Art is created by design.<p>&gt;For example, the concept of abstraction in software design may be based primarily on the intuition that human beings are bad at holding too much complexity in their minds. But any software developer who has written more than one program will agree that abstraction is crucial to good design.<p>The concept of abstraction, good abstractions and bad abstractions can be separated from design and formalized into exact definitions. That is my argument.<p>The reasoning behind why a human would want to do that is irrelevant.')
