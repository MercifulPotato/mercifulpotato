It&#x27;s a starter question, then a harder question, then another if there&#x27;s time; each is answered with an algorithm written on the board in mostly-valid code. Your on-site loop (pre-2020) is four to six 1-hour sessions back to back, plus a lunch break.<p>The only work environment it simulates is one where every feature is developed in a 15 minute sprint that&#x27;s literally overseen (like over your shoulder) by a boss who&#x27;s put you on a PIP; there&#x27;s no collaboration and no google; nothing is expected or allowed from you except a working output; and you&#x27;re fired if there&#x27;s any issue raised in code review.<p>It&#x27;s more like an exam, but it&#x27;s not even that: exams are meant to see what you know. The whiteboard interview just offers you as many ways to fail as possible and sees if you make it.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s either one. I hesitate to call it hazing, but... as a trial to prove your dedication to the group by doing arbitrary and unpleasant things, for some it feels similar.')
