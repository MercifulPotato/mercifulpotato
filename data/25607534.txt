I was provided with an onboarding buddy, who warned me that Apple is trigger happy firing folks.&quot;  Para 2: manager made a likely inappropriate joke about last name.  para 3: not really relevant?  para 4: project was raw.  para 5: onboarding buddy was not super helpful with onboarding.  It may well have been the case that onboarding buddy was not an expert on the project, or that OP was hired because of his or her specific expertise on this project.  etc.<p>For better or worse, I don&#x27;t think going public with this story is going to be viewed as anything but a he said &#x2F; she said mess.  None of which means I think Apple treated him or her well, or that the team wasn&#x27;t a mess, or anything else.<p>It may well, however, come up when googling the author&#x27;s name for quite a long time.  That&#x27;s an additional factor to think through.  It may be the best outcome for the author is to leave this behind, seek some therapy to help move on, and get a job at a company that doesn&#x27;t treat him or her like this.')
