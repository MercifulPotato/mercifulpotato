If I was going to pull this stunt, I know I am going to get into a lot of trouble as is.  So with ADS-B, I can at least let other planes see my GPS&#x2F;Altitude and I can leave all the other data empty.  This does not provide who I am, but shows at least some attempt to mitigate risk.  The FAA are all about mitigating risk.  Also less likely I would get a face full of prop.  The person doing this could turn it back off at lower altitude to avoid people seeing where they landed.')
