Even if no person wanted gold for its &quot;imagined&quot; value, it would still have value because it&#x27;s used by many actual companies in actual products (electronics etc). E.g. Every iPhone contains about 0.0012 ounces of gold.<p>Bitcoin has no value other than imagined by people. I.e. Greater Fool theory.')
