If Trump tried to only apply a two week quarantine to people coming from Mexico people would be against it. If he&#x27;d done a quarantine for all people entering the US back when there were only a handful of cases we&#x27;d be in a much better place right now. I suspect that would have been viewed as an overreaction by many people but based on what we&#x27;ve learned since then I think people would&#x27;ve come around.')
