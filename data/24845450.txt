Item(by='Cloudef', descendants=None, kids=[24845899, 24847477], score=None, time=1603264387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24845370, text='There&#x27;s many problems with meson and cmake, but as for meson. Meson is the kind of build system that makes using tools hard as it forces certain workflow to you. It detects the compiler and tries to be too clever what you can do with it and what you can&#x27;t. For example recent mishap was that it detected emscripten compiler and didn&#x27;t allow me to use it as non cross-compiler and so on. There&#x27;s no way to build static libs, if the project hardcodes shared library building. The codebase is also pretty nuts, I welcome you to go read it.<p>(GNU) Makefiles with some standard variables and pkg-config are still the king. Cmake and meson can work okay for very simple projects, but other than that I&#x27;d recommend always using native build system for each platform, or going Makefile + mingw route (if you need windows builds).<p>Using native build system eventually saves you time and headache, especially when these &quot;portable build file generators&quot; don&#x27;t support some feature you absolutely need, or doesn&#x27;t allow you to put that command line flag in one of the tools that gets executed under the hood.<p>CMake also absolutely sucks at finding system dependencies when everyone uses those &quot;FindFooBar.cmake&quot; files with hardcoded search paths and what not, instead of using pkg-config. This forces many packagers to hack the projects build system, because the project would otherwise link to wrong library, or not find the library at all. With pkg-config the distributions can provide the correct paths and flags when linking against something.<p>Autotools, while slow and generates tons of shell script that&#x27;s compatible with all sort of ancient shells and platforms, still manages to offer a standard interface to packagers and fine tune exactly how things get linked, how things get configured and where stuff gets installed. Autotools in general is less headache to packagers than meson or cmake.')
