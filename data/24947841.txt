I pointed out that a number of them are being affected by a <i>GLOBAL PANDEMIC which the rest of the world is currently suffering from too</i>. The ones that have any hope of being separated from that I talked about. If we want to talk about those other stats relative to how the rest of the world is doing on them, I&#x27;m happy to do that too. But anything else is unbelievably disingenuous.<p>My graph reading needs brushing up? Do you know which years Obama was president? Are you reading the same graph (the one you linked) that I am? The deficit was larger in Obama&#x27;s presidency in multiple years than it has been at any time in Trump&#x27;s.<p>What policies have affected your loved ones? I&#x27;d love to talk about them.<p>How did Trump make education worse? Explicitly please.<p>How has Trump encourage voter suppression?<p>In Trump&#x27;s presidency, there was the lowest black unemployment rate there has ever been. How exactly is it his fault that &quot;race relations&quot; are in the toilet? Did he shoot unarmed black men? Did he applaud it? Has his repeated denouncement of White Supremacy[1] not been good enough for you? The fact that you think race relations are EVEN CLOSE to what they were in the fucking Civil War era makes this the dumbest conversation I&#x27;ve had on the internet this month.<p>Seriously, stop reading the news, it&#x27;s rotting your brain.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hAfw4bmtxrE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hAfw4bmtxrE</a>')
