And if it still bothers them, they can make themselves feel better by donating some of the money to charity.<p>Also, people who do things they know are wrong can mollify their consciences by comparing themselves to people who do even worse, and then patting themselves on the back for not being as bad.<p>They think things like, <i>&quot;at least I&#x27;m not literally robbing anyone&quot;</i>, and the robbers think, <i>&quot;at least I&#x27;m not physically hurting anyone&quot;</i>, and those that hurt people think <i>&quot;at least I&#x27;m not killing anyone&quot;</i>, and then killers think, <i>&quot;at least I&#x27;m not torturing anyone to death,&quot;</i> and the torturers tend to have some excuse too, like doing it for the greater good.<p>Unless you are literally the worst of the worst there&#x27;ll always be someone worse you could compare yourself to and think that at least you&#x27;re better than them.<p>There are already some examples of this kind of justification in this very thread.')
