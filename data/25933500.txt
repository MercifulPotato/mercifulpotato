(But I bet it would be different for upper middle class Black people.)<p>Statistically, and adjusted for age (which is really important because there is quite a big difference in median age between racial groups in the U.S.) asians are actually less likely to get shot by the police than whites. Latinos are about the same&#x2F;a little bit more likely. Black people are twice as likely to get shot by the police.')
