Our platform analyzes each new build against your previous release, packages them together with a minimal app size increase, and lets you identify and roll back a buggy release at the click of a button. Long-term, we will support additional platforms (i.e. Android, web) and hope to become the single control surface for releasing new features and code.  As a founding team, we bring inspiration and experience from our time at Airbnb, Facebook, and Square; we’re backed by a great set of seed investors (Homebrew, Neo, &amp; Box Group), onboarding beta customers every week, and just beginning to build our team - if this sounds interesting to you, and you are excited to shape what engineering at Screenplay looks like, we’d love to chat!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;screenplay&#x2F;f5829b80-8050-48c5-9350-89967e603512" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;screenplay&#x2F;f5829b80-8050-48c5-9350-899...</a>')
