I&#x27;m using a Dell Precision laptop shipped with Ubuntu and certified and all that jazz, and it continues to have problems that just don&#x27;t happen on the Mac side of things. I use both, a &quot;low-end&quot; MBP for &quot;thick client&quot; computing and the Dell as a luggable hypervisor, since I don&#x27;t have the money to spec a mac out with the kind of specs I need for that.<p>Even with a recent kernel, it continues to have power management problems, and the intel wifi chipset occasionally just decides to stop working. It&#x27;s fine, especially given the good price I got, but it&#x27;s been a hassle, and more than occasionally I wish I&#x27;d spent the money on upgrades to the Mac instead.<p>(And I say this as someone with a libre POWER9 desktop and a pinephone -- I love tinkering and live Linux, but when I&#x27;m working for a paycheck I get tired of dealing with Linux&#x27;s issues)')
