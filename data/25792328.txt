The term &quot;the dark ages&quot; was developed by Petrarch, a man who was so obsessed with the Romans that he had himself crowned with laurels to signify his inheritance of Rome. And this is also largely unrelated to history of science, since &quot;the dark ages&quot; (as expressed by both Petrarch and pre-20th century historians) does not refer to loss of scientific knowledge.<p>&gt; Not having records being categorized metaphorically as darkness, and more records as &quot;Enlightenment&quot; is pretty high regard for a word used the same way in the contemporary context as something an accountant or dentist keeps in a filing cabinet.<p>But Petrarch was hundreds of years before the Enlightenment and would have hated it. He believed that the Romans were the peak of civilization <i>ever</i>. It was not possible to top them. The idea that modern humans could improve upon what they did would have been anathema to Petrarch and most Renaissance thinkers.<p>But most importantly, these historians of science would take issue with Blow&#x27;s conclusions from specific examples. He lists a few &quot;lost&quot; technologies and then concluded methods to prevent technological loss that are entirely unrelated to the examples he lists. At most, all they demonstrate is that it is possible for some things to go unrecorded.')
