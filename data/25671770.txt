Item(by='chadlavi', descendants=None, kids=[25674725], score=None, time=1610031529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25657198, text='This is cool, but you might want to adjust the feature lists in your pricing section! Since items are crossed out on the free plan, it would make a lot more sense for both lists to have the same features. It&#x27;s confusing that it says &quot;No additional guests&quot; on the free plan, but then that is crossed out; you could misread this to mean &quot;NOT no additional guests&quot;, which is kind of nonsense but might lead someone to believe that they _can_ have unlimited guests on free.<p>Similarly, you have &quot;Unlimited meeting minutes&quot; listed and crossed out on free, but you don&#x27;t even offer that on the paid plan, only a 240min max. You probably shouldn&#x27;t tease unlimited meeting minutes like that.')
