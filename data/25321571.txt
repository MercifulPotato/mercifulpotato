We use them to make things or to examine things, no to think about what we want to make, or to think about what is best to make. That&#x27;s for philosophy.<p>And yet philosophy is utterly incapable of telling us what to make or do. People often come to philosophy with the hope that studying philosophy will help them live a better life or help them make sense of life. The truth is, it won&#x27;t. They can devote their life to studying philosophy and they won&#x27;t squeeze a single drop of utility from that parched rock.')
