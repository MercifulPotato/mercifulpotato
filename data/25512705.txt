I think there&#x27;s a lot of parallels here to another article today, on webcams being ultra-uncompetitive. Discussion also talked about monitors in the same way. There&#x27;s a very low expectations for these products &amp; few people trying for better.<p>There is 2.5Gbit and 5Gbit ethernet happening. These are both significantly easier to implement than 10Gbit, which everyone is withholding, reserving for &quot;enterprise&quot; (&quot;who needs that much speed?&quot;) but the whole thing screams scam, when far far more complicated wifi chips are so cheap, when 40 &amp; 100Gbit are not that expensive. 10Gbit is not easy but all these 5Gbit, 2.5Gbit options; it strikes me as more about tiering, about having a range of products to sell, rather than update to something modern. Everyone is upgrading at minimum possible speed while leaving pricier options free of competition.<p>Meanwhile, intel just shipped two 40Gbps USB4 ports on their new cpu chip. Which can directly connect two computers with just a regular cable. Unlike ethernet this is very short range though, measured in meters. Although rumblings about optical keep showing up, which would throw everything into chaos. Wifi though, now, is multi-gigabit.  It&#x27;s making ethernet look bad.')
