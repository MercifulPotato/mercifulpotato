Most of these people can not setup an account, but some of them can. They collectively managed their internal accounting and only need to go to the blockchain when a settlement with someone from the outgroup needs to be done. What is so hard to understand about this?<p>(2) Yes. <i>IN EUROPE</i>. I talked about Brazil. How many times is it going to take for you to understand  that having good market competition in one place means absolute jack shit in another?<p>(3) You can not hold CAD or NZD or USD or EUR on a bank from Brazil. You have to convert it and there is a 6% fee for it. This is <i>on top</i> of the exchange rate fee from transfer wise.<p>The alternative I am proposing, however, is to receive crypto, sell it to BRL at the exchange (often at a better price than the USD equivalent, because there are people willing to pay the premium) and withdraw it <i>free</i> of charge.<p>In this case, crypto is giving me the choice of intermediary: a crypto exchange that I know will give better rates and faster transaction times. I could go further and convert the crypto to a stablecoin like USDC, EURS or DAI <i>at the exchange</i> and hold it there. I can use the exchange (if I trust it) as my informal bank which <i>can hold</i> crypto currency that is paired to something stronger than BRL or ARS. Worst case, I don&#x27;t trust it so I withdraw local curency, but rest assured that it will be a good deal because crypto exchanges will work with rates closet to the market and not what the Central Bank is willing to pay me.<p>You keep arguing with unrealistic hypotheticals when you could actually ask people outside of your bubble and they will tell you the thousand different ways where the status quo is worse. Do you really think everyone is these places are so stupid?')
