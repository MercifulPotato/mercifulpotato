Item(by='8fingerlouie', descendants=None, kids=[25927138], score=None, time=1611746787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25902030, text='I spent a long time devising a solid photo archive strategy.<p>For &quot;current year&quot; photos i store them on my NAS, backed up nightly, locally and remote.<p>Every year i then archive the previous years photos onto an identical pair of M-disc BDXL discs (100GB), and store one copy locally and one copy at a &quot;temperature controlled&quot; remote place. I use no compression, encryption or archiving. If there is degration of the physical media i want to minimize the damage.<p>Along with the archive BDXL media, i store an external drive which contains a complete copy of all photos. I also update this drive every year, and run a non destructive badblocks test on it as well as a long smart test before updating it. The drive is then updated, and rotated with the remote one (typically when storing new M-disc media), and i repeat the process for the retrieved drive.<p>Again, plain ext4 filesystem (i HOPE FAT32 will finally be dead in a couple of decades), no compression, archiving or encryption.<p>I never delete the photos from my NAS. The archive is simply &quot;disaster recovery&quot;. I only archive photos. Any document will probably have little value in a decade or two.<p>I&#x27;m also fully prepared to migrate my entire archive onto whatever the &quot;next big thing&quot; in archiving becomes. No archives are truly forever. Optical media can go away, USB 2&#x2F;3 will certainly become obsolete at some point. There&#x27;s no point in having an archive i cannot access.<p>And yes, i have considered just creating physical copies of the images and storing them in identical photo albums, but sadly nobody &quot;develops film&quot; anymore, and everything is printed, which also degrades over time, and unlike film of old there are no negatives to reprint images from.')
