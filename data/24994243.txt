If you believe that it&#x27;s a correct description of an effect caused by genetics, then it would be descriptive instead.<p>But what your comment nicely illustrates is that whether someone considers something sexist depends on whether or not they believe it to be true. As a result, people who are unwilling to accept certain objective truths might consider descriptive science to be sexist.<p>If I say &quot;women are biologically different which causes them to have different skills&quot;, that can be argued both ways. Some people might focus on lactation and agree. Others might think about mental skills and strongly disagree.')
