My hope would be to be able to make everything sustainable as an open source project by the community for the community.<p>I’m looking for someone who could help me either build this forward or help with business side of things and raising money for building the business itself. I’m capable of handling the technical side of things but to get to next level we would need more both deep backend and frontend knowledge. I’m located in Finland, but everything in this project is set up to be remote first and location or timezones should not be a big problem.<p>Contact: ville @ project domain')
