Some of the problems I&#x27;ve worked on:<p>- How do we design software that will let institutions collaboratively build machine learning models on data they cannot share with each other?<p>- How should we visualize experimental data affecting the entire metabolome so our scientists can comprehend the results?<p>- How can we extract labels for geographic regions from natural text written about those places?<p>- How can we build a gamified incentive structure to encourage the kinds of solutions that are scientifically valid?<p>- Is it possible to model the effects of changes in immigration due to COVID on the US election?<p>I love small teams and have gravitated towards startups because I like having my fingers in many pies and taking ownership of important things. Looking for a client or employer to be an early engineer on a project that I care about; especially interested in anything in energy transition &#x2F; cleantech.
