I&#x27;m interested in understanding what is the typical investment (in terms of people, salary, and time) to develop a backend solution (leaving maintenance aside). I&#x27;d also be nice if you can roughly explain the scale and complexity of the backend solution you built.\nFor example, I worked on a knowledge-graph backend solution consisting of an API and N workers consuming tasks from a queue that took ~2 years to develop, 3-4 full-time backend engineers and a total investment of around 300k USD.')
