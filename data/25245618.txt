Item(by='codevark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606663567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25245206, text='I started programming in the 70s, on Z80s and a PDP-11. Then I moved to the Apple IIe. Also got a bit of early exposure to MS-DOS in the early 80s. When I first was able to get my hands on an Amiga 1000 (my friend got one as a graduation present), it completely blew my mind. The Amiga is still my favorite, and I have several that still boot up and work fine, even though they are quite a bit older than my kids, who do not always boot up and work. :) There are a bunch of things I still miss when working with Windows (for &quot;work&quot;), even though it is well documented that Microsoft ripped off a bunch of ideas and features from the Amiga (and early Macs). There are, of course, some things I&#x27;ve gotten used to in the intervening years, like increased CPU speeds, but the UI of my old Amigas is actually sometimes more performant than a brand new machine running a modern OS with thousands (or millions) of times the available resources. Go figure.')
