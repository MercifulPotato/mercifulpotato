Item(by='susam', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607258111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322922, text='&gt; Reset &#x2F; normalize may not be the best terms to use, but effectively that is what you are doing.<p>Like others and I have mentioned before, this is not what this CSS is doing, not even <i>effectively</i>. Calling it so would be a mischarterization of this CSS because what this is doing is far simpler than reset&#x2F;normalization. This may be splitting hairs but I think good terminology and good conventions form the foundation of a good discussion. I liked it better when you characterized this CSS as &quot;exceptionally basic stuff&quot;. That is indeed what this is.<p>&gt; Sorry if Iâ€™m being harsh, but I rather be honest than give some cursory congratulations.<p>Honest feedback on this CSS is very welcome. Indeed, many others have done so in this thread which helped in improving the CSS as well as the README. That&#x27;s the whole point of a Show HN post. However, in your previous message you began suggesting what type of problems I should solve instead of sharing this CSS. That felt strange because I am just sharing my hobby work here for fun. I especially did not ask for advice on what I should do with my leisure time.')
