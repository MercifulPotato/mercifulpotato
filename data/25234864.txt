It&#x27;s a bit easier to do on moon surface than on an orbital station, but regolith has a limited thermal conductivity, which could be insufficient for an industrial process releasing a lot of waste heat. For obvious reasons we can&#x27;t simply build wet cooling towers as we usually do on Earth.')
