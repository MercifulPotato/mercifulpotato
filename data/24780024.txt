I went through a process of offering a phone number and countless CAPTCHA&#x27;s, which would result in my account being reactivated but then deactivated again upon the next login. Eventually I got the &quot;We have already reviewed this decision and it can&#x27;t be reversed&quot; ban-hammer.<p>I&#x27;m sort of beyond outrage or even annoyance at this point… it&#x27;s all just kind of funny and stupid. When I try to figure out a way out of this pickle, the best idea I can come up with is making a bot that logs in to Facebook, wanders around &quot;Liking&quot; q-anon posts, and then I&#x27;d have an account that Facebook would accept as a real human being for when I need to get actual work done with their platform.')
