The extent of other regulatory burdens remains unclear.<p>The point is, unless some highly unexpected new regulation comes in, it looks like banks at least kept the business and decision making in London, and only moved enough operational staff to EU to support operations there.<p>Funds for sure seem to have stay put in London, some moved but this is definitely a minority.')
