You are the one making the what-ifs, while I am merely refuting your points as they come.<p>&gt;&gt;Not if they&#x27;re making entry to the attic right outside the room you&#x27;re in so they can work on that and watch the door.<p>Read that back to yourself. The intruder is both in the attic and at the door at the same time.<p>&gt;&gt; You might be suprised at how often burglars use tools they find in the target house.<p>So 5 minutes to locate where the occupant keeps the ladder, fetch the tools from their car (unless they were carrying them under their arm when breaking in) and&#x2F;or break down a door before the target climbs out the window.<p>Realistically, the occupant of the house is most likely dead within seconds. But if they have some kind of head start, the police advice is to find a secure location from which to call the police.
