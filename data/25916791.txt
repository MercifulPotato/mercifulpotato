Farmers looking to secure their pay for future crop deliveries.  Banks looking to remove interest rate risk on mortgages they&#x27;ve issued.  Shipping companies looking to remove the risk of fuel fluctuations on their future transport costs.<p>Fluctuations of cost inputs and uncertainty of future revenues can be a company death sentence as they cause cash flow shocks.  They have real value to the economy.<p>Often, they are only possible if there is a liquid market of people willing to take the other side of these transactions.  Narrowing the spread between buy&#x2F;sell prices on these derivative contracts allows more companies to be able to afford them, and that makes many low margin businesses able to exist at all.<p>Despite all the hate on social media, these markets have material value.  ...even if there are these anomalies like this Gamestop incident.<p>I imagine the SEC is going to shut down that Reddit sub because these types if activities actually destroy liquidity but discouraging short sellers.<p>Regulation plays an important role in keeping markets running smoothly.')
