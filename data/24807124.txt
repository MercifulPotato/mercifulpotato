New Hampshire has, for decades, been in aggressive pursuit of revenue from MA residents.<p>- The shopping malls just across the border where MA residents don’t have to pay sales tax - just tolls (An employee at the Salem Apple store once divulged to me that it was the highest grossing Apple store in the world)<p>- The state run, tax free liquor stores just across the border that attract droves of MA residents<p>- The ease of procuring fireworks and weapons (the former illegal in MA, the latter far more difficult to obtain) just across nearly every border crossing<p>New Hampshire might to some extent have a valid point here, but it also feels like they won’t tolerate a taste of their own medicine.')
