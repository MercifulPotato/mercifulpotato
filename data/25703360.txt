Item(by='ratww', descendants=None, kids=[25704274, 25707926], score=None, time=1610218815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25701958, text='No, it&#x27;s nowhere near reasonable for her to do what she did. Everyone has a damn iPhone and they have very few models which all look very similar. The kid even had his own phone case which she asked him to remove. It&#x27;s unreasonable to ask a stranger that just appeared in an elevator to give their phone to you.<p>And maybe it&#x27;s a cultural thing but I&#x27;ve never seen a grown woman tackling a 14 year old kid to the ground like this, and if I ever do you can be sure I will call the police. Just because you&#x27;ve seen it often doesn&#x27;t mean it should be normalised.<p>And no, she&#x27;s not being &quot;destroyed&quot; by the racism accusation. But she might be destroyed if she goes to jail and gets a permanent record. And she had it coming. Actions HAVE consequences.')
