I enjoy it when folks write about things other than the technical. We&#x27;re human; first and foremost.<p>For myself, I won&#x27;t get into it, but I have spent the last 40 years living a life of <i>rigorous</i> self-honesty, and self-evaluation. I take daily personal inventory, and often immediately admit wrong and move to correct any errors.<p>I&#x27;m not very competitive. In order to compete, one must win, and when one wins, someone else loses. I have found that we can often work together to achieve far more than is possible alone; no matter how talented and energetic we are. I can be on a team that may be competing against another team, but often, there&#x27;s no need for competition, and I never compete against my team members.<p>I&#x27;ve also spent that last 40 years helping others, and being of Service. Many of those I help have been the victims of someone else&#x27;s competitiveness, so it gives me a good baseline to reflect on what &quot;competition&quot; looks like, on the losing end.<p>My lack of competitiveness has often been read as weakness. People that know me, know that&#x27;s not a particularly helpful approach, when dealing with me.<p>I just find that we get a lot more done, when we stop trying to beat each other, and see how we can use our differences and orthogonal viewpoints as a concrete mix.')
