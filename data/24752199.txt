Personally, I <i>like</i> doing coding stuff on the side. And even though I&#x27;m not going to let any company tell me what side projects to do (I use these projects to reclaim some autonomy), I&#x27;m also not going to leave them out of my CV to be &quot;fair&quot; to other candidates. After all, they won&#x27;t leave out their superior university or FAANG experience either.<p>I think what we want to limit is employers pressuring people into side-projects as a form of unpaid overtime. Other than that, I&#x27;m not sure if I see the problem here - but I guess I&#x27;m a part of it too.')
