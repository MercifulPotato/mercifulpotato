The replacements would have no reason to believe that their lives wouldn&#x27;t also be in danger if they didn&#x27;t certify Trump as the winner of the 2020 elections. At that point Trump has effectively side stepped the Constitution and usurped power through violence - which is literally the end of the republic.')
