It took me a long time to get used to 0 indexed, primarily in college and later in working with more C inspired languages, yet I think 0 indexed is superior. Why?<p>Numbers in programming start at 0, even in the languages with 1 indexing. Period. When I initialize an integer, unless I explicitly set a value, it’s 0.<p>From a purely pragmatic standpoint, making the first number an invalid location in a list just adds unnecessary complexity and increases the odds of off-by-one errors. On the same token, there’s nearly no benefit to starting at one.')
