It says nothing about the provability of mathematical formulae, since math isn&#x27;t a formal system.<p>If you accept the a priori&#x2F;posteriori distinction, you&#x27;re abusing words to claim that pure mathematics - the classic example of a priori knowledge! - is a posteriori. A priori knowledge isn&#x27;t knowledge that we come to know is true through an experience (like proving something), it&#x27;s knowledge that is true regardless of any particular experience.')
