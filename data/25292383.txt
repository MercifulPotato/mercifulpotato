Congrats on the release. I&#x27;m a little concerned the new physics will be buggy but whatever, I&#x27;m upgrading my project.<p>The really cool stuff in my opinion is the water system, the sky system (beautiful volumetric clouds!), and the full body solver for ik animation. The last one isn&#x27;t a new thing for game engines, but the first two far exceed any free nature rendering tools I&#x27;ve ever seen. The hair seems really cool but I get the sense it may be hard to get into.<p>The accessibility of making high quality looking games is very good these days. That makes a big difference in terms of maintaining a willingness to keep plugging away at a project. Especially if one lacks the artistic skills to make up for it at the beginning.')
