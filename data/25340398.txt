The showed up at her house and knocked on the door for 20 minutes until she eventually answered the door, and was arrested.<p>They <i>did</i> go into her house with guns drawn, presumably because the other people inside were refusing to come out.<p>To people who are shocked that they would do this: there are like a billion guns in The United States.  The cops are doing this because the threat of somebody shooting them is real.  To avoid this: when the police show up at your house, with a warrant, come outside unarmed.  Part of the respect of due process is reciprocal.  They have a warrant, which was granted to them by a judge.  They aren&#x27;t <i>requesting</i> to come into your house, they are <i>ordering</i> you to leave, as a part of a functioning judicial system.<p>On this person&#x27;s twitter account, she calls these people the &quot;gestapo&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but no these are not the gestapo.  The gestapo were a secret police used by the Nazis.  They showed up at people&#x27;s houses and <i>killed them</i> or <i>sent them to death camps</i>.  They didn&#x27;t use a warrant, politely knock on your door and try to call your phone for 20 minutes, and eventually take you to a jail cell where you would be granted a trial.<p>I&#x27;m so fed up with the holocaust denial that these people engage in when they make these outrageous comparisons.  The Nazis were <i>NOTHING</i> like contemporary America.  NOTHING.  They were loading human beings into train cars, sending them to industrial killing facilities, and killing them.  Sometimes they would perform vivisections on them, they would be raped, and tortured, and starved to death if they waited long enough to be killed by the gas chambers.<p>That is so, so, so far from anything that is happening in The US, and every time somebody tries to make one of these comparisons it only causes people to forget who the Nazis were, what they did, and <i>how horrific</i> it was.<p>This woman&#x27;s home wasn&#x27;t raided, she was served a search warrant.  These people weren&#x27;t the gestapo, they were a civilian police force.<p>Stop this.')
