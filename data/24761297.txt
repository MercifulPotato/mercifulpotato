Item(by='Kronopath', descendants=1, kids=[24761372], score=3, time=1602551326, title="Ask HN: Is there a website/app blocker equivalent of HN's “noprocrast”?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='For those not aware, HN has an anti-procrastination feature in the account settings called &quot;noprocrast&quot;. If you turn it on, when you visit HN, it only lets you interact with the site for the next &quot;maxvisit&quot; minutes, and the limit only resets after &quot;minaway&quot; minutes.<p>E.g. if you set &quot;maxvisit&quot; to 60, set &quot;minaway&quot; to 720, and access HN at 4 PM, you can use the site until 5 PM, at which point it locks you out for the following 12 hours.<p>I&#x27;ve found that this is an <i>excellent</i> anti-procrastination measure. It takes what is usually an impulsive decision (&quot;I&#x27;m just going to check this website real quick&quot;) and turns it into a conscious choice (&quot;Do I want to start my one daily HN session right now?&quot;). Rather than impulsively taking 5 minutes here and there, I have to take my time on this site all at once, so I only come here if I think it&#x27;s going to be an actively good use of my time.<p>The problem is, this seems to be rare among productivity apps and &quot;screen time&quot; features. Most of them do something different, such as:<p>- Time limits for apps that only count time when you have them foregrounded<p>This doesn&#x27;t work as well, because &quot;a half hour&quot; on a particular app can easily cost you more than a half hour of productivity if you split it up. Every 5-minute session distracts you from what you were doing before.<p>- Scheduled or ad-hoc downtimes for apps<p>These tend to be really inflexible, and my time isn&#x27;t this well-planned. Both this and the previous feature just train you to hit the &quot;Ignore limits for the next X minutes&quot; button.<p>- &quot;Screen time reports&quot; telling you how much you&#x27;ve been using an app<p>This feels more like a guilt trip than an actual anti-procrastination measure. You know where your time has gone, but not how to fix it.<p>So are there any website and app blockers that actually take this strategy, letting you ad-hoc allocate contiguous blocks of time to access apps or websites, then locking you out for a while after that time is up?')
