Are you legitimately concerned that, unchecked, flat earthers might actually &quot;turn&quot; the entire population?<p>Not at all, but the fact is that these beliefs <i></i>are growing<i></i> at all thanks to the web. There are always going to be some people with completely illogical fringe beliefs. Conspiracy theories were always a thing. It&#x27;s just not that despite the quality of these conspiracy theories dropping (seriously...the Earth is flat? That hasn&#x27;t been a topic of debate for a loooong time), their reach and number of adherents are going up. That seems like a pretty clear regression in our society. We shouldn&#x27;t be complacent about regression.<p>&gt; ... a decentralized approach is the only approach that does not come with a high probability that the majority will be coerced or gaslit into holding false beliefs at some point in time.<p>But I don&#x27;t understand <i></i>how<i></i> decentralized tech is somehow going to be more immune to this than the current web, which is already decentralized in most ways. Anyone can host a blog on their PC and publish what they want. We thought the blogosphere was the start of this golden age. But people aren&#x27;t techies, they choose to centralise with providers like Google for gmail (email is a federated, decentralized protocol!) and Facebook for social media.<p>If IPFS takes off, what makes it immune from people going with the same massive provider all their friends and family are on? There&#x27;s no hard barrier stopping everyone from moving off Google and Facebook tomorrow with the current web, but they won&#x27;t. The big players understand this, that&#x27;s why Google pays Apple billions a year to make Google the default search engine. That&#x27;s all it takes to ensure everyone keeps using Google. Competition is literally a click away, people just don&#x27;t click.<p>That said, I do support the decentralization efforts. It seems like an improvement over the current technology. I just don&#x27;t buy into the hype that it&#x27;s going to cure any of the problems we&#x27;re seeing now. Our problem is less one of censorship, more overload of bots and bad actors.<p>&gt; If everyone agrees that the earth is flat it may as well be so.<p>Except that it&#x27;s a real, measurable regression in our knowledge as a species. I get the point you&#x27;re making but that doesn&#x27;t give me comfort, hence the pessimism.')
