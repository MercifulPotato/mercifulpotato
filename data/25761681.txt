In super simplified terms, it is over clocking our brains part by part.  It continues until mid to late 20s.<p>&gt;After infancy, the rate of myelination slowed during childhood and adolescence, but exhibited continued growth until the end of the third decade. Specifically, mean MFLD during later adulthood (defined as ≥28 y) was significantly greater than in adolescence and early adulthood (11–23 y; Welch t, P = 0.000059; Mann–Whitney U, P = 0.00016).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;109&#x2F;41&#x2F;16480" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;109&#x2F;41&#x2F;16480</a><p>Our (dorsolateral) prefrontal cortex is one of the last parts to myelinate.<p>&gt;The last areas to myelinate are the anterior cingulate cortex (F#43), the inferior temporal cortex (F#44) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F#45).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Myelinogenesis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Myelinogenesis</a><p>This is the area of the brain that handles things like planning and abstract reasoning (though it isn&#x27;t the only area involved in such thinking).')
