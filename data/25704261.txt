Item(by='iLemming', descendants=None, kids=[25706789], score=None, time=1610223417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25699920, text='&gt; Clojure people have a lot of insecurity around Haskell<p>I beg to differ. I think it&#x27;s the other way around. I rarely see Clojure folk bashing on Haskell - they usually admit Haskell&#x27;s strong points or any other language. They very often borrow ideas from other languages, libraries, and tools. \nI&#x27;ve heard they are figuring out interop with Python and R. They&#x27;ve built Clojure-like Lisp dialects that work on Golang,  Erlang, compile to Lua, etc.<p>Haskellites, however, get sad and defensive anytime someone mentions that it&#x27;s not so widely used in the real world.')
