I think there&#x27;s such an interest in seeing the genius behind a work which actually involves the collaboration of a group to actually succeed. Just like in team sports. There are great players who are great because they won a lot of championships, had high scoring totals, etc. But in most cases, they also had the best teams. The genius lifts their collaborators up and the inverse is also true. I wonder sometimes about great players in my favorite sport and have doubts about the career outcomes of some of their peers that seems to have a lot to do with how good their teams were, as well as how fortunate they were to avoid injury, etc. There are analogies to those factors as well in business, but they don&#x27;t garner as much fascination as the idea that there&#x27;s one person who really makes the thing go.')
