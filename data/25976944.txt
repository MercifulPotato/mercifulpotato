Item(by='arthurcolle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612078629, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25976062, text='To clarify, assuming the actual float of BTC is around 15e6 max (around 6e6 is presumed missing forever due to user error) ever, once all the bitcoins have been mined, and you use my figure of 1e8 USD per single BTC, then you get a market cap of 1.5e15 (1.5 quadrillion). Right now there&#x27;s around 90 trillion in &quot;total money&quot; (narrow + broad money) in the world, so 1.5 quadrillion is around 16.667~ times that amount.<p>Again, with fiat currency inflation, implied economic growth projections and technological efficiencies to be gained, will total money be around 1.5 quadrillion dollars? Eventually, sure. Especially if you denominate this in dollars, which obviously have been devaluated to the extreme. These are huge figures, but that doesn&#x27;t sound so crazy when you really think about it. Especially on a 50-100 year time horizon.')
