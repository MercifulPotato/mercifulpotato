After Catalina I plan to run offline mac for design, photography and video work connected to intranet&#x2F;NAS. Everything that connects to outside network traffic will be properly run on linux boxes. This is the future. You will not own your data until you create a procedure to guard it as permitted by law. Apple is gone, you have now a different company working for shareholders only. Another step that I personally advocate to my friends is to use only software designed to run on multiple os hosts. I cannot risk some corporate decision motivated by pure greed to kill my workflow. Apple has a plan to close Mac Os completely, its their business to make more money by controlling the experience full circle. Thats why I overcome the lust factor and will not buy any Apple product anymore. If I need a camera - I will buy a camera, if I need a phone I will buy something that can be rooted and I have control over it. I expect in near future more commercial software to be made for linux and will pay good money for it without a moment of hesitation')
