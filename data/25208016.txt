The thing with Workflow scheduling and orchestration is that it&#x27;s complex and non trivial. I&#x27;d rather buy a product built by a company with a focus in this area (i.e. Prefect) rather than go with yet another poorly executed but highly marketed AWS product. When I buy a product for my team I buy support and integration first, technology is less important. A lot of AWS products are poorly supported and mostly integrate with other AWS stuff. On top of all of this we are supposed to be running containers and AWS makes all this serverless stuff which defeats the whole purpose of moving applications to containers smoothly running in the cloud.')
