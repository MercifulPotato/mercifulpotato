Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609797770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638498, text='I played SimCity 2000 off of GOG a few months ago (around when I was also playing City Skylines). A few things:<p>1. SimCity2000 has much higher relative costs for infrastructure. Roads, Police, Firefighters, etc. etc. cost lots of recurring money, to the point where a typical player even on $20,000 &quot;Easy&quot; mode will probably fail the first few times they play. I&#x27;ve never run out of money on City Skylines, literally never. But even with all my experience on SimCity 2000, I can &quot;fail to bootstrap&quot; on medium ($10,000) or hard (Bonds&#x2F;Debt) mode. (Especially if an unlucky early game fire  disaster happens). In contrast, the recurring costs in Skylines is so puny that I forget about that aspect entirely.<p>2. Disasters in Sim City 2000 force you to rebuild occasionally. Or at least, carefully consider the placement of your items. (Ex: low-lands may flood, getting destroyed. Airplanes may crash, causing fires near airports). Despite being a pain in the ass, the chaos of disasters grossly changes the feel.<p>------------<p>Ultimately, Skylines has more similarities to Rollercoaster Tycoon and&#x2F;or Tropico than SimCity. Skylines simulates every individual sim (with HEAVY emphasis on traffic). The emergent behavior of each individual sim following simple rules is a particular style of gameplay.<p>However, SimCity was more of a abstract economic simulator, where larger decisions had more pronounced effects. Opening commercial roads to neighbors would create trade between cities. Airports and&#x2F;or seaports need to be managed with your neighbors. This style of gameplay: a &quot;big picture&quot; city simulator, ultimately plays extremely differently than City Skylines.<p>In City Skylines: building an airport or seaport causes a traffic spike that you need to manage. In SimCity, building an airport or seaport causes an increase in commercial demand and&#x2F;or industrial demand. Its just fundamentally different.<p>--------<p>Really: its just that one thing: Skylines&#x27;s infrastructure costs are laughably low. There&#x27;s no worry about ever running out of money... no matter what you build, you&#x27;re always flush with cash.<p>In SimCity, you&#x27;d worry whether or not you&#x27;ve saved up enough cash to bootstrap a new section of your city. In Skylines, you just build it, and if it doesn&#x27;t work (unforeseen traffic issues or whatnot), delete it and build it again.')
