One issue I can think of is the losses of transmitting that much electricity from 1 area to another (1000s of miles away). the losses of transport coupled with the losses of &quot;storage&quot; and &quot;generation&quot; make it more expensive. I don&#x27;t know the actual costs, just ideas I think about.')
