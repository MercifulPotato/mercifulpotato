That&#x27;s lazy design. Completely demotivated me to try to do sidequests &#x2F; other ways to improve myself before moving to more difficult quests&#x2F;areas. I mean what would be the point? Just facing more difficult enemies.<p>Compare it to the game who gets the difficulty balance just right with static setup, and every gain makes a bit of difference and game is never frustratingly hard nor too easy. Areas of initial struggle become walk in the park. To me that&#x27;s rewarding.<p>Maybe some middle road where enemies can get a bit harder, but still they become more defeatable as player progresses would be ideal. Or even better - make it tweakable in the menu (but that&#x27;s a mammoth effort to do and test)')
