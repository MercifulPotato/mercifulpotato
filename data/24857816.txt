Item(by='traceroute66', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603373841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857022, text='Oh ...Sky.<p>For those not intimately familiar with the UK ISP industry, allow me to fill you in.<p>Sky&#x27;s home-broadband service was a spin-off from Easynet which was a spin-off from UKOnline (Easynet&#x27;s business broadband went Interoute -&gt; GTT).<p>UKOnline were a fantastic ISP back in the day, really, really good.<p>Then Easynet bought them. They kept the techies, which meant things still got fixed correctly and in a timely manner.<p>The shit didn&#x27;t really start hitting the fan until the Easynet spinoffs started.  Once the residential customers moved to Sky and the business customers moved to Interoute ... that&#x27;s when the service levels dropped off a cliff.<p>As for who to use now ?<p>Well, others have mentioned Andrews &amp; Arnold.<p>I would concurr. They might me more expensive than the rest, but they employ techies who know their stuff. And if their techies find out you are a techie, they will treat you as one and have a proper conversation, you don&#x27;t need to beg and scream to speak to a level 3 tech .. at AAISP, most techs are highly knowledgeable.<p>Not only that, but the Andrews &amp; Arnold management and monitoring system is one of the best I&#x27;ve seen. They&#x27;ve got these fancy graphs they generate 24x7.  And you can see the full activity log in relation to your account (even down to notes left by Openreach engineers when they came to fix your line).<p>Not only that, but Andrews &amp; Arnold will do things other ISPs won&#x27;t do.  You want some static IPv4 ? No problem.  You want a &#x2F;48 IPv6 ? No problem.  Want to manage your own PTR records ? No problem.<p>For home users and small businesses who can&#x27;t yet afford a leased line, Andrews &amp; Arnold is the dogs bollocks.')
