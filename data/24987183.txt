Yes, you tend to find yourself writing a lot of code because of the lack of generics, but that is being fixed as we speak. Generics has a draft and it looks nice from a Go developers perspective.<p>And Go let&#x27;s you communicate by copying. That&#x27;s what a Channel is. Pass a struct and that is copied.
