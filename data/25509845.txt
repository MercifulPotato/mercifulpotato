I think that propagating the values of free software is important, so I&#x27;m certainly supportive to a large degree.<p>But I think HN is the place to discuss nuances such as these:<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s very unclear to me how Purism and the FSF reconcile the FSF criteria regarding &#x27;Nonfree Firmware&#x27; with the blobs on the device. It&#x27;s also unclear to me what the distinction is between this part of the criteria and the RYF certification.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ryf.fsf.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;criteria" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ryf.fsf.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;criteria</a><p>Furthermore, the FSF&#x27;s criteria regarding non-free firmware seems problematic, and it directly affects the Librem. Purism has been working with the FSF in pursuit of the RYF certification, and all of the responses I&#x27;ve found seem to be somewhat evasive of the fact that it may be the Librem will <i>not</i> get firmware updates, and that this is in accordance with RYF criteria.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.puri.sm&#x2F;t&#x2F;does-respects-your-freedom-certification-allow-updating-of-proprietary-firmware&#x2F;9484&#x2F;14" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.puri.sm&#x2F;t&#x2F;does-respects-your-freedom-certific...</a><p>The response from the CSO almost confirms this.<p>I find a lack of firmware updates to be possibly more of a concern than whether or not only my application CPU is running only free software.<p>What the FSF and company define as &#x27;software&#x27; also still seems to be problematic.')
