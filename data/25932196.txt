Visually impaired people have as much right to use stuff as you and I do, and the law says so.<p>From a purely economic point of view: if your competitor&#x27;s website supports the visually impaired, and yours does not, then even though that&#x27;s a relatively small market segment you&#x27;re probably giving away 100% of it. And blind people have friends and family too, and they&#x27;ll also send all of those people to your competitor.')
