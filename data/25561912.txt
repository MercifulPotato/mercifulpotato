The people who labor on public housing construction projects in SF are rarely city employees directly and generally employees of construction companies.<p>The items that make this expensive have to do with the standards that must be met, zoning and approval processes, and so on. These are things that a private construction firm, under contract with SF, does not find easier or cheaper.<p>Personally, I like the idea of SF maybe getting in the way of housing construction a bit less. But I also understand that voters seem to like the system as it is. Plus, only some of these laws are readily changed by SF - the plebiscite for public housing law is a state prop from the 70s. Many of the other requirements are also propositions at either state or local levels.<p>As you say, it&#x27;s completely true that the government can change the relevant laws. It&#x27;s just perhaps more subtle than that, as there are multiple levels of government involved and some of the relevant laws are quite challenging to change.')
