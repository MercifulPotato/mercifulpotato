That means more people and tax revenue to solve problems.<p>I&#x27;m not the state government though, I&#x27;m an individual with a life outside of my house. When the majority of the time for any activity outside of my house is sitting in traffic or waiting in lines, it&#x27;s difficult to enjoy the area you live in. For this reason, I find myself heading further and further out of town to find areas or activities that aren&#x27;t completely congested. Tax revenue won&#x27;t make the lines shorter or traffic less. To do either would require bulldozing all of the housing and building up, at least where I am. Unfortunately, whenever this is done, luxury condos or apartments are the result, with rent that&#x27;s higher than a mortgage, even for around here.')
