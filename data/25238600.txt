(And &quot;opioid use disorders&quot; too, they were paying rebates for those too).<p>I don&#x27;t understand either the ethical OR business sense of this. Very confused.<p>I haven&#x27;t been paying too too much attention to this stuff, and I never before felt like saying anyone should face prison over any of this -- but incentivizing overdoses, are you serious?
