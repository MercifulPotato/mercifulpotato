People take ubers today. Heck, people take taxis today.<p>I think a bigger challenge for Waymo is going to be getting trust and regulatory favor. Everyone keeps clinging on to the &quot;oh, comparing prices, waymo is cheaper than uber because there&#x27;s no driver!&quot; narrative, but from what I&#x27;ve seen from the few reports so far, the prices aren&#x27;t all that different from other services.<p>I can also imagine quite a few other not-so-flattering narratives being relatively realistic:<p>- &quot;I&#x27;ll never trust some faceless AI w&#x2F; my kids in the car! I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more and get a real person behind the wheel. Support the local economy, you know?&quot;<p>- &quot;Oh, so you want a license to put an entire class of workers out of jobs under MY government term?&quot;<p>- &quot;I got a trashed waymo car and customer support ignored me when I asked for a refund!&quot;<p>- &quot;I took a waymo after partying a bit too hard and now I&#x27;m locked out of all my google accounts with no recourse!&quot;<p>- etc<p>I think people on HN often give way too much weight to the &quot;cool tech&quot; aspect of waymo, and disregard the very real and very significant meat bag aspect.')
