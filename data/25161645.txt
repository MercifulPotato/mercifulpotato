I&#x27;d be curious if this had a similar issue. I went with the Bosch table without a lift for $169 US, and it&#x27;s nice that I can put it under my bench when I&#x27;m not using it. I use it with the fixed base on my DW612, which means I can move just the powerhead to the plunge base when I don&#x27;t need the router table, so I&#x27;ve only had to buy one router. Works pretty well, and the Bosch comes with a whole bunch of options for jointing and workholding as well.')
