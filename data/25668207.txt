E.g. having a young kid, it&#x27;s used for: the class&#x27; group, arranging playdates, etc. Not using Whatsapp makes it much harder to arrange your social life and that of your kids.<p>Then there are also many organizations&#x2F;companies that use Whatsapp to set appointments, for chat support, etc.<p>In many EU countries Whatsapp is pretty much replaced SMS. Only a small minority of folks have Signal or Telegram. iMessage is probably the only other thing that shows as a blip on the radar, but only a portion of the population has iDevices.<p>I agree that this is a bad situation, but WhatsApp became popular when it was still independent and their profit model was charging 1 Euro per year (which was much cheaper than SMS). Now abandoning Whatsapp is difficult due to network effects.')
