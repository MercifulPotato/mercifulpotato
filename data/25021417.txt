Item(by='ookdatnog', descendants=None, kids=[25022657], score=None, time=1604795433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018434, text='&gt; Entering the country illegally makes you a criminal.<p>If you define &quot;criminal&quot; as &quot;any person who has committed a crime&quot;, and &quot;crime&quot; as &quot;any illegal act that can be punished by law&quot;, then yes.<p>By that definition, everyone who has ever received a parking ticket is a criminal too, though.<p>Seems more sensible to reserve this loaded term (in US context) for the violent crimes and property crimes the FBI releases statistics on.')
