Would that be compatible with OpenStreetMap? Because then we could make OSM be a more complete map of the planet. Are you aware of any project that can show which places (from those other open sources) are not yet tagged on OSM?<p>Edit: to clarify, I&#x27;m not proposing an import (which is usually a hassle), but just a comparison to explore how many places are in open data but currently not in OSM.')
