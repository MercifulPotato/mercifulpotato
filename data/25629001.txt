Why using openmp while the others don&#x27;t? why use recursive functions? The C implementation is not correctly optimized. People just paid more attention to Rust and other languages. Rust can be as fast as C, but &quot;faster&quot; is really misleading. BTW, I use clang all the time since it&#x27;s better than GCC.')
