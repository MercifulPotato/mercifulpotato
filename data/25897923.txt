It relies on the central authority of domain registries.<p>By that definition, almost every chat app is centralized, especially if you include the step of downloading it over HTTPS.  In any case, it would be possible to further enhance email using something like SMTorP so that .onion addresses are used instead.[0]<p>&gt; And then if you do decide that whatever encryption scheme you&#x27;ve chosen is right for you, there&#x27;s no guarantee any significant mass of people supports it.<p>The same is true of any system which is proposed as an alternative to email.  Admittedly it will be difficult for a UI to convey the security properties of messages when you are interacting with users whose email clients don&#x27;t support the recommended extensions, but there is always the risk that a recipient will copy-paste the plaintext of your securely sent message into an unsecured channel.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mailpile&#x2F;Mailpile&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SMTorP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mailpile&#x2F;Mailpile&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SMTorP</a>')
