That&#x27;s going to be a hard sell to poor africans desperate to get out of poverty.<p>&gt; The environmental debt from coal&#x27;s CO2 emissions will far exceed costs of solar.<p>Expecting poor africans to give a shit is going to be a real hard sell. Especially when the climate problem is almost exclusively a rich european creation and poor africans had nothing to do with it.<p>Caring about climate is an enterprise of the privileged few. Unless we are willing to subsidize billions of poor africans and others around the world to the tune of trillions of dollars, I think africans and everyone else are going to go with the lowest hanging fruit. It&#x27;s 2021 and hundreds of millions of africans live with electricity today. Think about that. It&#x27;s insane. Considering the centuries of suffering they endured, if they have to burn down the planet to get some semblance of good life, then so be it. Let europe live in mud huts for a few centuries.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aa.com.tr&#x2F;en&#x2F;africa&#x2F;600-million-africans-go-without-electricity-iea-chief&#x2F;1502097" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aa.com.tr&#x2F;en&#x2F;africa&#x2F;600-million-africans-go-with...</a>')
