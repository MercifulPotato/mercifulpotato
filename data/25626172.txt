It was pretty clumsy before it got less clumsy - and it makes me sad because a lot of the graph-based databased technologies glomed onto it pretty early on - and I mostly like where they say they are going. And their base compile Suxxor and they messed up their community with the new compile Python3 style.<p>I guess Kotlin is cool and clean - which is good. And has no ecosystem - which is bad. But stapling JVM language together for ad-hoc purposes is what we have learned how to do, neh?<p>For my part, I&#x27;m probably going to go back to high performance renderers and embedded systems. Like the man said bad in the day: &quot;You can all go to hell - I am going to Texas&quot;. (Unfortunately I have been there for 30 years since I learned that I hate it.')
