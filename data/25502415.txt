Now I tend to write code as if it were written by a beginner: verbose and boring, with no magic.&quot;<p>Theres nothing wrong with charming magic in your code, if it really does something special and is not just used for the sake of it - it only gets into dark magic, when you forget or are too lazy to add proper documentation in the end. \nWhich ... happened to me, too many times.<p>But otherwise very much yes. Clarity and simplicity should be always goal number one. But since simplicity is hard to reach at times and time is short, it is always about the balance.')
