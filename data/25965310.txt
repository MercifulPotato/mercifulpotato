For example, on a 10-bit display - does my &quot;legacy&quot; website showing #FFF, show a <i>true</i> brightest-white color, or would I need to use a special definition to achieve it? Unfortunate, as I&#x27;m sure the hex value for a 10-bit 3-tuple is not quite as &quot;perfect&quot; as #000000-#FFFFFF. e.g. like `color: rgbhdr(#0x3FF3FF3FF)`<p>If I use a non-HDR-aware color-picker app (or take a screenshot), and pick HDR content versus normal content, is there a translation layer that scales down the value to RGB? Or does it clamp and &quot;overexpose&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s a whole new world. I googled &quot;HDR in CSS&quot; and got this[0] which is not quite &quot;stubborn programmer who thinks this is a gimmick&quot; friendly...<p>Anyone have a good resource that explains how one would use HDR colors in practice? And ideally one that touches on considerations like the interactions between HDR-aware and non-HDR-aware applications.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3c.github.io&#x2F;ColorWeb-CG&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;w3c.github.io&#x2F;ColorWeb-CG&#x2F;</a>')
