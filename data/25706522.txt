(It&#x27;s not like we have any better alternative...)<p>IMHO the .mhtml format should be resurrected.<p>EDIT: And the Pdf format can be abused as well. At least it&#x27;s easy to block JavaScript on HTML, even selectively (uMatrix).<p>I expect to be able to use video in an electronic document, PDF readers don&#x27;t seem to be even able to support MP4, much less the upcoming AV1 !')
