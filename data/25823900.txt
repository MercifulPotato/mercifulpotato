We paid the 50 euros and asked what the total amount would be, assuming that was the co-pay. There was a lot of confusion because the 50 euro wasn&#x27;t the copay -- it was the full-freight amount. Getting a single 15 minutes with a doctor, let alone the prep with the nurses and bloodwork being rushed would be <i>far</i> more than that in USA.')
