Item(by='jeffbee', descendants=None, kids=[25022627], score=None, time=1604792781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25020840, text='Class A architecture&#x27;s main advantage is it is very easy to achieve high objective performance, while trading away heat and power (and consequently size and mass). You can easily get 3rd harmonic below -80dB and you can eliminate even harmonics entirely. All you have to do it spend a lot on heat sinks and commit to a large power bill.<p>The problem is going to be reaching really stellar objective performance with the Class A design, because all those space age (not in a good way) power transistors are very slow and hard to drive, and that limits your error correction techniques. That&#x27;s where these fancy designs are better. Basically they&#x27;re using lightning-fast transistors and a DSP to bridge a power supply directly into a speaker. Objectively these designs have 3 orders of magnitude less total distortion, unmeasurable 2nd and 3rd harmonics, inaudible (-120dB or better) intermodulation products. The space age designs have simply no chance.')
