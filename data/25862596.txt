It&#x27;s my understanding that this work dates to 2017 [2], and that it might not be quick or easy to replicate for new spike protein variants.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41577-020-00480-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41577-020-00480-0</a><p>[2] Pallesen, J. et al.
