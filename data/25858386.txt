That’s not the reason I would recommend anyone learn vim. The best reason for me is that vim is just <i>fun</i>.<p>When you finally become competent, it is an absolute joy to work with. It makes me think about editing in a totally different way. However the road to get to that point is not fun.<p>I started out with basic tasks in the terminal, &amp; vimtutor reps. Then graduated to using a VS code plugin. I would turn it on for 10-15 minutes at a time a few times a day. Usually turning it off once I realize I wasn’t getting anything done :) But solid reps everyday over a few months and I got to where I learned more complex commands&#x2F; movements. Eventually I never needed to turn it off!<p>Then I began the configuration &amp; plugin rabit-hole :)')
