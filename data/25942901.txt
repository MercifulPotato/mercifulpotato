Occupy Wall Street didn&#x27;t work, riots and looting wealthy areas didn&#x27;t work, raiding the capitol building didn&#x27;t work. The corruption is dug in.<p>Voting out the incumbent breaks all these decades long (multi-generational?) relationships with the elites. They will probably reform the relationships to a degree the first time, but if congressional membership dramatically changes every 2 years, those relationships will weaken over time.<p>To whomever disagrees, please help me understand your reasoning.')
