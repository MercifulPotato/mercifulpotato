Turbo Pascal as the first thing I learned after BASIC as a wee youngin&#x27;.  Mostly it was about connecting young hobbiest programmer me with seasoned professional me.<p>Basically, sometime&#x27;s it&#x27;s good just to kick back and have some fun with your work. Aside from that though, my impressions of the language are that it forces you to be a little bit more organized about everything than C-derived languages.  In Pascal, the things that you do to satisfy the compiler are things you can do for anyone reading your code in other languages (not that you would in those languages conventions though...).  And other languages do this even better... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone go learn it unless they had a real business need to.')
