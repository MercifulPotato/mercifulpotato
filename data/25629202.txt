Another problem common to both democracy and employment is the restricted set of options which create an illusion of free choice and consent to what follows - &quot;I chose this politician&quot; or &quot;I chose this employer&quot;.<p>Unlike choosing a politician, you <i>need</i> to choose an employer. This makes the stakes higher. Choosing is not enough, the employer also needs to choose you. And despite that, most people believe in a just-world fallacy in which your job record and position in life is made out of your choices, and you deserve what you get. Everyone gets what the class of capital-owners has chosen.<p>Quid pro quo is the going rate only in the most farcical sense for a large portion of the population where the quid is your finite time and energy, and the quo is being housed and clothed. I personally have some choice in employer, but not a wide variety of choices. I certainly can&#x27;t choose <i>no</i> employer.')
