I really like donating to free software. But sometimes I have to actively <i>hunt</i> for a donation link. So in my opinion, it would be good to low-key advertise it whenever appropriate.<p>Also, while we&#x27;re on the subject: I would love it, if free software came with a token product. For example: a &quot;star&quot; tier that shows up in your online profile, or something. This way, people can donate and make it into a business expense.')
