Item(by='qsort', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606156765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189290, text='&gt; but no author to my knowledge has argued that video games and their players do not at least qualify for moral consideration<p>This is a weird phrasing, to be honest: if an author decides to write on a topic, by definition they believe the topic is worthy of consideration. By the same logic, by how niche this topic is, even by moral philosophy standards, we could deduce that most authors do not believe it is worthy of consideration?<p>Honestly AFAIK, the position that actions happening in a fictional scenario have no moral weight is the default and widely accepted one, with hardly any credible objections.<p>I couldn&#x27;t read the papers you linked because they are paywalled. I&#x27;d be interested in hearing a dissenting opinion if you could outline one.<p>&gt; but your usage of the concept in describing lotteries as unethical targets the descriptive sense - a code accepted by an individual or a community (...)<p>This is a distinction without a difference. Morality in the sense that &quot;all rational people should accept it&quot; is basically an empty set, AFAIK most of the philosophical arguments are &quot;moral implications&quot;, i.e. if you accept X, then you should also accept Y; but it&#x27;s dubious it&#x27;s possible to make any moral judgement in the sense you require.<p>The root cause of my opposition to lotteries, etc. is the moral belief that it&#x27;s unjust to reward or punish people on the basis of events or characteristics they have no way to control. This is a moral intuition, there is no way I can rationally convince you in a non-circular way that you should absolutely accept this fact. If you don&#x27;t, the discussion is kind of over.<p>To make a different example, why do you oppose slavery? (I&#x27;m going to assume that you do) The most likely answer is a variation on &quot;all humans have a natural right to self-determination&quot;, but why is that? Again, it&#x27;s a moral intuition without any absolute justification.<p>&gt; If so, why wouldn&#x27;t we be able to say the same if the papers I have cited make convincing arguments about video games and players of video games?<p>Because I&#x27;m not convinced they do.')
