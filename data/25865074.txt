(I added my edit before you replied I think).<p>Either way, without knowing the full picture from both sides (like a court case going through discovering to fully put out the communciations between Amazon and Parler), we don&#x27;t know the answer.  We see that Amazon canceled Parler with little external communication.  And we see what Parler is saying.  Amazon could share what they communicated with Parler (assuming they legally can), then we could see another side to this story.<p>It would be nice for this court case to go through discovery, then we&#x27;ll know who said what and when.  But until then, we have very imperfect data and have to weigh it as best we can.')
