Donâ€™t Start Work Without Approval<p>This is not a hard rule. It depends on how much you value your time.<p>If you try to change some behaviour that the project wants to guarantee to its users, I might reject your contribution based on the idea it embodies, if my idea as the maintainer is different.<p>If you fix a bug, your chances of simply getting through are much higher, and you may even save me time if your change is &quot;good enough&quot; and I don&#x27;t need to do anything but say &quot;thanks&quot; and merge.<p>I don&#x27;t really care if you report an issue by filing an issue or by requesting a merge.')
