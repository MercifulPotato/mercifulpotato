In addition to supporting LLVM as an optional backend, Zig links Clang and LLD to provide an out-of-the-box cross compilation experience, not only for Zig code but for C and C++ code as well. Using a sophisticated caching system, Zig lazily builds from source compiler-rt, mingw-w64, musl, glibc, libcxx, libcxxabi, and libunwind for the selected target - a “batteries included” drop-in for GCC&#x2F;Clang that works the same on every platform.</i>')
