The software that we use in 2020 and need to be reliable in 2020 is quite different than 25 years ago, heck, the platforms running the software are quite different - in 1995 you&#x27;d be using some program running on an OS on your computer (or through a remote terminal on some other computer); in 2020 you&#x27;d be using some program running on a distributed set of cloud servers through a browser sandbox - and the way how the reliability of that remote system is maintained is simply different from how you&#x27;d ensure the reliability of a local utility program.  That 1995 study is perhaps interesting enough to suggest doing some experiments again, but currently it&#x27;s outdated enough to be simply irrelevant.')
