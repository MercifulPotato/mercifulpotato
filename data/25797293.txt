Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=[25799155], score=None, time=1610749102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787745, text='&gt; There are various levels of epistemic nihilism one can go, culminating into the &quot;We can&#x27;t ever know who or what will be successful&quot; so we should fund everyone equally, maximally equalizing funding. I don&#x27;t agree with this, and will discuss scientific egalitarianism and lotteries in the next part<p>I enjoyed this a lot. Lots of stimulating ideas and a refreshingly robust way of thinking.<p>But... being in the &quot;IDK&quot; camp, and being a self hating empiricist, I smarted a little at the &quot;nihilism&quot; quip. I&#x27;m absolutely not against these kinds of pursuits though. If I held the pursestrings, I&#x27;d give this man (or woman.. who wrote this?) a go.<p>I just don&#x27;t think we can get far beyond &quot;lets give this a try&quot; in our knowledge&#x2F;prediction of what will work here. We&#x27;re talking about how to fund, and therefore organize, science. There almost certainly isn&#x27;t one way, and results will likely be different in different between, fields and such.<p>Game theory also plays a role. Funding methods are legible, and legible criteria (such as citations) quickly become game fodder. The best defence against this might be to throw out criteria regularly. One of the reasons I&#x27;m game for what the author suggests is that the &quot;co-funding&quot; model where private interests provide 50% of the cash to prove merit is extremely played out. There was a rationale there too. I&#x27;m sure you could support it with &quot;n-hypothesis&quot; and such. That breaks down though, a new rationale emerges. Ideally, whatever mechanism is used tries to consciously avoid citation-seo or somesuch.<p>I think there are elephants in the room, when it comes to funding systems. We are, almost by definition, constructing a social system... a society almost. One where livelihood, success, prestige and such are at stake. These can&#x27;t be taken for granted. A concept like &quot;tenure&quot; invents a type of person... a tenured professor. I think we should be thinking and defining these these problems in such terms. &quot;Lets invent X&quot; where X is a type of institution, title, station etc.')
