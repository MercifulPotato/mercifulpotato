The alternative to buying flowers is just spending your money on other things, which is different to the alternatives you have in an armed robbery.<p>Patent law gives patent owners a monopoly (i.e. the gun) over how an invention is used, but just like there&#x27;s a difference between self-defense with a gun and using it for armed robbery, there should be - and increasingly is - regulation that forces patent owners to act as market participants offering something valuable rather than street thugs going for protection money.<p>It&#x27;s fine to dislike patents, just as it&#x27;s fine to dislike anti-competitive or outright dishonest practices around patents. Either alone or both in combination are reasonable standpoints.')
