If people aren&#x27;t able to understand that many forms of election compromise (e.g. ballot stuffing) are indistinguishable from a normal election without properly respected controls and audits.<p>Maybe faith in the process should be shaken, but a volatile transition period isn&#x27;t the time. I have full faith that the election process has a moderately low fraud rate, below any amount that would change the outcome. Even so, the peaceful transition of power is more important than any particular mechanism. If any of the parties involved would like to raise a court case actually alleging fraud (which is why the cases have been dismissed: because they failed to do so, and anything short of this would have no remedy), an investigation would be in order. But it appears that fifty-seven cases have been filed, finding 108 votes whose signatures were improperly validated.<p>So what, exactly, is the problem here? It seems like you&#x27;re raising concerns of things that could have happened, without any actual weight behind them that they <i>did</i> happen. It&#x27;s meaningless.')
