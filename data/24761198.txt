I counted and kept track. Through Colorado north bound i-25, roughly 60% were more than 1 occupant. Through Wyoming, then west bound i-80 was about 40% more than 1. Didn&#x27;t do it on the return trip. Throughout east coast Florida city driving doing it every now and then (especially at traffic stops) ranges from 40-60%. Rainy days seem to be high single occupant days from what I&#x27;ve noticed.<p>Sure, anecdotal, not perfectly scientific or even at a good enough scale... but I don&#x27;t really believe the 10% idea. I&#x27;d love to see where their scientific data is on that.')
