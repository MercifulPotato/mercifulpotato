Yes, you are going to copy all the bytes in the final result once (at least).  But it&#x27;s hard to see how to avoid that, and no, delegating that task to the kernel doesn&#x27;t magically&#x2F;consistently make it faster.<p>&gt; you just create a little node of a couple of words<p>Hmm...&quot;just&quot; creating a &quot;little&quot; node can often be quite expensive on today&#x27;s machines.  And &quot;words&quot; are pretty big, typically 8 bytes per word.<p>&gt; Yeah there&#x27;s non-locality and things like that<p>Well, non-locality and &quot;things like that&quot; are kind of a biggie, these days.  <i>The</i> biggie, actually, most of the time.<p>&quot;...computation is essentially free, because it happens “in the cracks” between data fetch and data store; on a clocked processor, there is little difference in energy consumption between performing an arithmetic operation and performing a no-op.&quot; -- Andrew Black in <i>Object-oriented programming: some history, and challenges for the next fifty years </i>')
