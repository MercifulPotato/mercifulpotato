Python won scripting because it offers a sane way to do sequential, shell-ish things, without having to wade through &quot;man bash&quot; or searching stack overflow for the umpteenth time about the syntax to do something that should be trivial but is anything but.<p>You&#x27;ve inadvertently supported exactly my point.<p>You just advocate for the lazy way out. You know Python, so that&#x27;s what you use and nothing more. God forbid you check out a reference. I mean, your lazyness leads you to believe that having docs.python.com on speed dial for a dozen different major or backwards incompatible releases is ok, but oh God forbid you check up a single man page of a tool that exists since the beginning of time.<p>Ridiculous, and all of this just because you believe you know Python, and that&#x27;s all you have to offer.<p>Shell scripts are standard, omnipresent, reliable, and readily available infrastructure. There&#x27;s no way around it. There&#x27;s no excuse, let alone laziness and refusal to learn, which in this field is outright incompetence. The only reason someone refuses to use shell scripts for this sort of job is dereliction of duty and outright incompetence, and that is not winning in anyone&#x27;s books.')
