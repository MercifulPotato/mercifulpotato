He knew what he was talking about because he crunched the numbers before he attracted attention.<p>How that experience translates into macroeconomic forecasting, such as when he said farmland was the next big play, or now passive investing is bad, I don&#x27;t know. Has he crunched the numbers, or is he using some theoretical framework to try to predict macroeconomic events? In any case his words attract a lot of attention now, even when he may be speaking outside his areas of expertise.')
