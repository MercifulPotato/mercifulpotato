Item(by='nostromo', descendants=None, kids=[25691677, 25691405], score=None, time=1610144683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25689407, text='&gt; we&#x27;ve structured the project as a non-profit entity, so it can never be bought, has no investors, and isn&#x27;t &quot;owned&quot; by anyone<p>Never is a long time.  Non-profits can become for-profits.  Non-profits can also spin off of their profitable components as for-profits -- just like the Mozilla Corporation is a for-profit owned by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation.  Non-profits can sell ads and sell your data.<p>And, of course, non-profits can get money hungry just like any other organization.  Look at how ICANN has found ways to vacuum up billions of dollars from the internet.<p>They also may not technically have any investors, but they have a de facto investor in the form a $100m loan from   WhatsApp founder Brian Acton who is also on the board.  He could have made it a gift, but did not -- which implies he wants the money back at some point.  Signal will need a lot of donations to pay that money back -- or they could decide to sell ads or data.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m happy Signal is doing well, and applaud their efforts.  I hope they succeed.')
