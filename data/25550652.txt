I&#x27;ve wondered what caused the pessimistic attitude and if it has always been this way.<p>(Of course, it could just be the people I hang out with, but I suspect it is pretty common for people to be harsh on themselves)<p>Your theory explains it. Life is always throwing us a lot of stuff at once (<i>especially</i> if 65% of our mental capacity is taken up by a smartphone). It is a game where we usually only have a general idea of what to do, lots of reasons not to do it, and not enough time to decide about everything.<p>If you stop and think, you are probably doing much more right than not. But overall, in the game of Life, you are also blowing lots of opportunities that you are aware of and simply don&#x27;t have the time and resources to get right.<p>&gt; skill growth in the game happens slowly by your mind learning to make many of the optimal decisions subconsciously, thus making things slowly more manageable. But that&#x27;s not an easily visible, tangible change. And it still leaves you with twenty things you could be doing better, that are &quot;obvious&quot; in retrospect.<p>Maybe we should focus more on our slow advances. Players that consider themselves good, enjoy the game more and probably do better at it (in RTS and in Life).')
