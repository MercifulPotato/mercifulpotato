There is &quot;working at Google on Something, with People&quot;. There&#x27;s a great deal of variety within Something, and variety within People. There&#x27;s cutting edge research, there&#x27;s the boring slog of what <i>must</i> be done, and there&#x27;s everything in between. There&#x27;s 20% time, where you can define your own Something. There&#x27;s very hard work being done on a massive scale to ensure user and customer security and privacy are pervasive through everything.<p>Plenty of xooglers will tell you exactly what they thought about working at Google. You will hear all types of opinions when you do. Cachet simply isn&#x27;t a factor for most.<p>Apply Occam&#x27;s razor to the stories that xooglers tell. Are they all lying and &quot;covering up&quot;? Or is the diversity of opinions you read about <i>real</i>, and reflective of the experiences of that writer?<p>I&#x27;d go with with real.')
