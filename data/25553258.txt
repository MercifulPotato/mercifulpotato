It does so by wrapping the script in a docker image.<p>It also automates the annoying part of docker: mounting local paths for apps that need to interact with the host&#x27;s file system.<p>I need to write a blog post on this if anything to gather feedback. I&#x27;m still not 100% sold on the idea and there are some edge cases. Still, a fun experiment.')
