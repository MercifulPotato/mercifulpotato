As you say, it&#x27;s not a huge thing, but at least I&#x27;m not participating.<p>&gt; Generally smaller operations as they end up priced out of the market.<p>I would love to see some legislative reform on the large scale use of antibiotics in meat raising. That wouldn&#x27;t necessarily help smaller farmers, but it might push larger scale farms into somewhat less heinous practices.')
