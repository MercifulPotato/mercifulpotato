FAANG pays so &#x2F;many&#x2F; paychecks that the expectation really is that high for people who can pass a FAANG interview. There are a lot of people who &#x2F;can&#x2F; pass the interviews but choose not to, effectively taking a pay cut to go work on things they&#x27;re passionate about; only a few of these end up working in &#x27;boring&#x27; parts of government. The US Digital Service was meant to make it a broader&#x2F;better path, though.<p>Your people description (B) is worth considering, too: I (personally) am unlikely to take a job I think I&#x27;m &#x27;overqualified&#x27; for unless it&#x27;s in a specific problem area I really, really care about. And &#x27;overqualified&#x27; sounds near synonymous with &#x27;few growth prospects&#x27;: if the opportunities are there, why haven&#x27;t they been taken?
