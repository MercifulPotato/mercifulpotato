Perhaps we should try to figure out why hoards of teenage kids would drink cough syrup or hand sanitizer. Perhaps the problem is that we pay to much attention to underage kids. Maybe if there wasn&#x27;t an age limit, underage drinking wouldn&#x27;t be so taboo. And underage drinking would not be a problem and binge drinking might go down.')
