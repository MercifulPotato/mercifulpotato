E8 at Facebook is extremely rare. I can’t remember the exact percentage when I was there, but it’s around 1-2%.<p>E5 at FB is a terminal level, many engineers don’t get beyond that. I worked on a team of several hundred engineers and we only had one or two E7s, and nothing higher.<p>To put this in perspective: at FB, E8 is the individual contributor equivalent of engineering director.')
