Wordpress is desperately uncool, you will be using a tool old enough to vote, you will be using old, proven technologies, but <i>it fucking works</i> and once you have set up your blog you can just keep coming back to it and actually making posts about whatever you want to share with the world, instead of abandoning it, then coming back a while later to check out a new blog setup built on whatever this month&#x27;s hot language&#x2F;framework is.<p>And you can get plugins to make that Wordpress blog auto-post to whatever the hell people use nowadays. Own your own data, be immune to having it all vanish when something happens to your account on Hot Social Site, or to the entire site.<p>I write less on my site(1) than I used to, twitter&#x2F;mastodon has eaten a lot of that energy, but it is still where I go for anything lengthy, and it is still where I post my big comics projects.<p>1: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;egypt.urnash.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;egypt.urnash.com</a>')
