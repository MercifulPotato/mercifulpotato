I have text-only browsers that are much faster for reading HTML.  And I have numerous TCP clients that retrieve web pages and resources as fast and usually faster than &quot;modern&quot; browsers, and are always more reliable.  Heck, the W3C&#x27;s libwww project still compiles and works well behind haproxy&#x2F;stunnel.  The functionality I need is fast, reliable text and URL retrieval.<p>I do need the big, graphcal browsers for online shopping, banking and so forth, but that is not what I am most of the time I am using the web.  I do not need them to enjoy the web&#x27;s content.  I never expected I could survive without the graphics but it has been far easier than I thought, and it&#x27;s getting easier.')
