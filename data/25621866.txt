Whatever people think of UBI, if the numbers don&#x27;t add up the idea is simply dead in the water.<p>The pandemic relief checks in the US, or furlough schemes in Europe, are also quite different in that they are an emergency response to an emergency situation. They are meant to be a sporadic measure and indeed are not sustainable.')
