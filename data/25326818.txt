On my current macbook, all the compatibility issues of needing a particular piece of weird software for some client project have been easily solvable by keeping a bunch of VMs with various Windows and Linux versions. You don&#x27;t want to pollute your host with various short-lived installations of different (often incompatible) versions of various tools anyway, having separate virtual environments (with revertable snapshots!) for separate tool needs is quite convenient.<p>Hopefully we&#x27;ll have ARM versions of Linux working as virtualization guests on Apple hardware soon, but losing Windows compatibility will be a pain for me, it will require either ignoring the new Mac hardware, or keeping a separate Windows laptop, which is a pain.<p>Perhaps having a remotely accessible cloud Windows machine will be the way to go; last time I tried it, it was a pain to use the GUI remotely doe to stutter but perhaps now neworks and machines are faster and this might work better.')
