You can&#x27;t just tell people to shut up and listen to the experts.<p>The efficacy of vaccines is one of those things that is almost impossible for the average person to verify.  I can get in a plane and confirm for myself that it doesn&#x27;t fall out of the sky.  I can&#x27;t get a vaccine and directly compare it with my chances of catching the flu without one.  That&#x27;s the reason why people widely trust the safety of planes, but there exists an anti-vax movement in the US.<p>Even with alternatives to first past the post, the complexity is of a wildly different scale than blockchain.

I&#x27;d have to pull out reference material and then start with the basics of hash functions or something to explain blockchain.')
