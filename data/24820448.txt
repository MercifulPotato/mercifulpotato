Not long ago I worked for a company that had a 24 hour live news broadcast. How do you think they handle this?<p>One specific example I can recall is closed captioning. These are federally required on all TV broadcast channels, including live. The company had a contract for a third party to manually transcribe the broadcast in real time. One initiative we wanted to explore was automating this process using speech recognition software. This was difficult because it turns out that incorrectly transcribed closed captions can lead to lawsuits. So the company that was contracted to handle the closed captions also provided insurance&#x2F;indemnification against their service causing any lawsuits. No AI speech recognition solutions that were available also included this insurance so it was deemed too risky to switch.<p>One of the underlying assumptions in all of this Section 230 talk is &quot;it&#x27;s too hard to moderate the deluge of user generated content&quot; .... so why even bother trying I guess? Why is that the underlying assumption? Why isn&#x27;t the assumption: You can publish as much user generated content as you are capable of adequately moderating? The idea that the current free-for-all is some inherent &quot;right&quot; is perplexing to me.<p>&gt; so many, if not most, forms of one to many real time communication would have to be discontinued due to lack of the ability to moderate in real time. Hence they would be lost along with the value they generate.<p>Again, that doesn&#x27;t seem like the necessary conclusion. It prevents centralized platforms from publishing massive deluges of unvetted content. They are not in a position to moderate the billions of videos, chat posts, images uploaded each day. So, maybe instead of leaving the free pass we&#x27;ve given them open we question: is it reasonable for single entities to be the sole publisher of billions of unmoderated pieces of content? That doesn&#x27;t mean all content everywhere goes away. It creates limits on what sole entities can accomplish.')
