Business travelers who fly internationally or coast-to-coast regularly\n  2. Business owners who regularly put very large business purchases on their cards, especially AMEX cards that don&#x27;t have a real limit. When you put $50k&#x2F;mo on your Delta AMEX, you&#x27;ll probably never have to pay for a personal flight.')
