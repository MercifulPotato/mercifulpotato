Also I am no native speaker, please forgive me. Still posting with throwaway because I feel weird.)<p>I am in a weird place where I don&#x27;t really know what to do with my life and I am trying to find out &quot;who I really am&quot; and what truly fulfills me.<p>So I started thinking a lot, and trying to answer questions like: Everything I do, who do i do it for? Do i do it for me, or for someone else? If I don&#x27;t do it for me, shouldn&#x27;t I spend my time with something else, something that makes _me_ happy? (And I am not talking about relationships here, obviously I will be there for family and friends. I am talking about the time I am free to spend on whatever I want, like job and free time).<p>At first I was pretty convinced that most of the things I do are 100% for me, to make me happy.\nExamples:<p>- My job as an SW engineer: nice salary, bright future, very sought-after, personal interest, can use my creativity and so on. All positives things.<p>- Or one of my biggest hobbies, besides IT: Acrobatics and exercising in general. It&#x27;s fun, it&#x27;s healthy, it&#x27;s cool, I look better and can see my progress week after week.<p>BUT THEN I asked myself: would I still do these things if I were completely alone? If I were the last human to ever exist?<p>I most certainly would not continue to program. What would be the use? \nAnd then for sports: I might actually continue with this a little bit, but mostly because I wouldn&#x27;t know what else to do with my life. And it certainly would not be fulfilling doing this by myself.<p>This bothers me. I now feel like I am living a very superficial life. And I am wondering, how do you feel about this? What things are fulfilling you, do you life your life for you, or for others?')
