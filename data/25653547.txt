You can&#x27;t boot your Intel of AMD CPU without their signed and sometimes encrypted code. You can&#x27;t even initialise a single core, let alone the DRAM controllers.<p>Everyone likes to point at Apple, because that&#x27;s easy, but it&#x27;s neither new nor big nor special. There are practically three things at play:<p>- root-of-trust, if you have a better solution than CA-based signing, by all means, let the world know<p>- NDA&#x2F;IP&#x2F;Lawyerisms<p>- Apple and many others aren&#x27;t selling hardware, they are trying to sell experiences or ecosystems, and that is the only reason they exist at all and also the reason a lot of the beige box hardware companies are either less visible, less profitable or both<p>Is it fun? No. But it&#x27;s not some sort of automatic malice or &#x27;haha you don&#x27;t own things but you thought you did&#x27; all the time either.')
