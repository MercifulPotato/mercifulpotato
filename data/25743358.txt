Item(by='myWindoonn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610434917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741517, text='When they say &quot;Itâ€™s not something that Chapek and his team can really fuck up, especially as shareholders and people within the company look to it as a core part of their future,&quot; I agree, but I read it differently. In theory, it&#x27;s not possible to fuck up Disney+: Just take content from the Disney Vault, price it appropriately, and slowly convince families to transition away from their expensive DVD collections to streaming. It&#x27;s an exploitative and rude business model, but solid and time-tested.<p>But, that said, the circumstances have shifted following The Mandalorian&#x27;s success. Now, Disney+ has a new baseline for not failing: It must produce a new Mandaloranian-level hit every season. This suggests that, like Fox&#x27;s TV programming in the 90s and 2000s, Disney+ will have to invest in many risky experiments in order to continue being worthwhile, even though the bulk of their subscribers only care about the shows currently being milked.')
