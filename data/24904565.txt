My parents would drop me at the station in Detroit, and my friend&#x27;s mom would pick me up in A2 and I&#x27;d spend the weekend at their house. It wasn&#x27;t exactly a long journey, but it saved everyone a bunch of windshield time, and it was a cool independent thing for a nine-year-old to be able to do solo.<p>I had no idea that train didn&#x27;t run anymore. I wonder what happened to it!<p>Seconding the natural beauty, though. I finally had the sense to spend a good chunk of last summer up north, too.')
