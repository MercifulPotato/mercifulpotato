Item(by='jjoonathan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606339453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213299, text='Ehhh... the ratio of &quot;bump in the night&quot; problems that affect just me to genuine outages that cross regions and affect others is about 1:1, and then about 1 in 4 or 5 of the cross-region problems blow up to the scale where they feel forced to update the dashboard. So I disagree, I think a canary flock would be both meaningful and useful.<p>As you point out, though, the status dashboard isn&#x27;t truly meant to be either of those things. I don&#x27;t have any illusions about it ever changing.')
