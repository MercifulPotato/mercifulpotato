Everything the majority of customers care about in the US is available on IPv4 and <i>sometimes</i> ipv6. If v6 goes down for your customers, they probably won’t even notice. If you don’t have v4, you don’t have a business.<p>It hasn’t even been that long that Amazon EC2 has had v6 support, which is where a huge chunk of the Internet is hosted.<p>The network admins at ISPs are just providing connectivity the customers demand.
