Since Fluoxetine is so widely distributed (because it&#x27;s Prozac), there is quite a bit of observational data that Fluoxetine is also correlated with reduced clinical severity. Obviously, even a strong correlation is not causation but it is certainly grounds for prioritizing investigation, especially since Fluoxetine&#x2F;Prozac is very well-tolerated, inexpensive and widely available in mass quantity.')
