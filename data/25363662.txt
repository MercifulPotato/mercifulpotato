Adblockers currently only work by having full access to every tab, iframe, page, etc. What happens when an adblocker is sold and the new owner secretly installs spyware to steal all of your passwords and cookies? This has happened multiple times already with extensions in the past.<p>It seems to me like Chrome is trying to limit use-cases that require full access to every single site you visit. How will Firefox solve this problem better than Chrome or Safari? It seems inevitable that the status quo for these extensions is going away.')
