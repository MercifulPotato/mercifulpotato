A status symbol, or if it&#x27;s really just for personal enjoyment, then a gimmick that will amuse you the first 10 times you launch from the lights.<p>Sure, having a reasonably quick car is useful for overtaking and pulling out, but then we&#x27;d regard performance as being &#x27;good enough&#x27;, rather than marking down a car for doing 0-60 0.2s slower than another.<p>I wonder if EVs will change things.  It seems the likes of Kia and Nissan are able to put pretty powerful and efficient electric engines into their motors (150kW is not bad).  I think what limited the availability of high performance ICE cars was the fuel efficiency and tax.  If that&#x27;s not such an issue with EVs, then performance will become less of a bragging point I guess.')
