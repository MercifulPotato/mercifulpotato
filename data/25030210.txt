The US media is only lightly censored, as opposed to the fully censored Chinese media. The US has not implemented a social credit system to turn its own population into a secret police. The US doesn&#x27;t cover up global pandemics and then &quot;disappear&quot; anyone who talks about the cover up. The US is not the worlds biggest jailer of journalists. The US is not a one-party system which has outlawed protests etc. The US does not execute mass-scale non-consensual organ-harvesting of religious minorities to fuel their organ tourism industry. You should be thankful that speaking against the US government won&#x27;t get you kidnapped and tortured like it would in China. If this was China, your very comment could lead to your death.')
