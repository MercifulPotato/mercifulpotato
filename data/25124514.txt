I was writing a desktop Windows&#x2F;Mac app using swing 10 years ago.   The look and feel that came out of the box was fine.  At first it was metal.  It was a light blue with gradients to white on the buttons.  Then they came out with Nimbus - I think that one was based on SVG or something similar.<p>No client complained about either of those.  And at the end of the day you could always call a method to get the platform look and feel and it could look like Windows or Mac OS.  I had a menu to change this in the app itself.<p>I never found the UI development hard.  I was hand coding it in the beginning.  I thought the Layouts were pretty straight forward (except grid bag which I never used).  Eventually NetBeans had a decent UI designer and I used that.<p>I think the sloppy or slow UI&#x27;s came from developers who never took advantage of the Observable &#x2F; MVC aspects of the UI components.')
