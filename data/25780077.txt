And I have to give him credit -- his explanation of parallax as it pertains to Go-Fast is compelling and probably accurate. We don&#x27;t have a whole verified narrative with multiple angles&#x2F;witnesses (besides the two pilots) to enrich that incident.<p>I&#x27;m referring to the Nimitz incident. I don&#x27;t mean to offend you, but I can say confidently there is information you have yet to consume on that incident. Taken alone and with no context, the IR video isn&#x27;t convincing proof of anything, and West points that out, while ignoring that there is other information. But there is more verified info from the original NYT piece that makes this case special [0]. How do you explain the fact that passive radar from the ship was tracking this object on and off for two weeks before they finally deployed a squadron to investigate it? How do you explain the fascinating pilot testimony (they had multiple angles, by the way) of the white round object flying around erratically, then mirroring their descent, then shooting off into the sky [1]? Or the fact that their primary radars were being jammed (technically an act of war)?<p>Any of these pieces of information taken alone could be inconclusively explained away, but as you compound them, forcing a &quot;normal&quot; explanation looks more and more like the Catholic church telling Galileo that the cosmos orbit around the Earth.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;ufo-sightings-navy-pilots.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;ufo-sightings...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Eco2s3-0zsQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Eco2s3-0zsQ</a>')
