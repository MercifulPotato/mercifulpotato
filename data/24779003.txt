Oops.<p>&gt; Always restrict your mapped ports to localhost (as in 127.0.0.1:3306:3306) unless you really want to expose it to the world<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that typically you don&#x27;t even need to publish your database port. If you omit it, containers on the same network can still communicate with each other.<p>Very rarely do I end up publishing ports in production. If you wanted to connect to postgres you could still docker exec into the container on the box it&#x27;s running on and interact with your db using psql that&#x27;s already installed in that container.<p>A while back I wrote a blog post on the difference vs exposing and publishing ports at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;docker-tip-59-difference-between-exposing-and-publishing-ports" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickjanetakis.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;docker-tip-59-difference-betw...</a>.')
