I&#x27;ve been successful in life so I don&#x27;t see why you are insisting I need to watch this show.<p>I get my news and current affairs elsewhere.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d also like to add that no one in my circle has ever asked me &quot;hey did you see that thing on the Today Programme last night?&quot;. In fact very little conversation about TV programmes in general. Rather conversation involves &quot;have you watched xyz on Netflix yet&quot;. Perhaps this is a generations thing? (I&#x27;m 40.)')
