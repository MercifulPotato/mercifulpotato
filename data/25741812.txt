You say that velocity is the derivative of position, acceleration the derivative of velocity, etc.  And that&#x27;s all fine, down to 16 decimal places, give or take.  Past that, quantum effects become significant.  You don&#x27;t have a clean mathematical identity: perhaps velocity is <i>approximately</i> the derivative of position, acceleration is <i>approximately</i> the derivative of velocity, but below the Planck scale, these quantities aren&#x27;t even continuous!&quot;')
