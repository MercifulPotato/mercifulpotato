There&#x27;s a funny Twitter account that was tweeting a new federal crime every day for a while.<p>In case you&#x27;d like to know how to research your question when you see a government announcement on a criminal case:<p>1. Scroll the bottom of the page.  If it&#x27;s the website of the government agency that brought the case, they&#x27;ll almost always link to a &quot;complaint&quot;, which is almost always a PDF.<p>2. In a criminal complaint, each crime charged is usually called a &quot;count&quot;. Search the PDF to find the &quot;count&quot; that matches up with the crime you&#x27;re interested in. In this case, the means-of-identification charge is count two.<p>3. Look for a &quot;citation&quot;, a reference to a section or other numbered subdivision of a law within that count, in the part that spells out which law they&#x27;re being charged under. Here: &quot;Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028(a)(7) and 1028(f)&quot;.<p>4. Go to the official website of the government that law comes from.  In this case, it&#x27;s the US federal government.  Their info portal is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.govinfo.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.govinfo.gov&#x2F;</a>.<p>5. Search for the citation and find the law and its text. The portal will usually provide some notes after the text of the law about which bills introduced or changed that particular subdivision, and when.  Sometimes they&#x27;ll even provide commentary or citations to cases decided under it. I&#x27;ll leave that part to you if you&#x27;re interested.<p>6. For extra background, try searching for the name of the bill that introduced the law on Wikipedia, or even on Google. You can often get a sense of what was going on at the time, who proposed the bill and how the vote for it panned out, and so on.')
