It&#x27;s a dramatic flattening of the layers we think of as natural in our programming world. Of course we write source code describing a class that is compiled into an object file which is loaded into a JVM. So just write the bytes that makes the JVM have a class directly into its memory. And on the other side, that anything obeying the same mathematical axioms can be treated as the same, be damned how it&#x27;s implemented. Those two taken together can make it seem like witchcraft until you realize that all the conventions of our craft are just that: conventions.')
