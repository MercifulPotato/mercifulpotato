For the average developer, it is just a procedural language with weird excessive syntax, annoying separation between interface and implementation and way too picky about where you declare your variables.<p>You don&#x27;t need to have written a compiler. Just have wanted real modularity. You can get it with some popular and mainstream OO languages (Java, C#), but it&#x27;s horribly broken in many other mainstream languages (C++).<p>Separating interface from implementation <i>shines</i> when dealing with larger teams, and can really be nice for compile times which improves feedback loops.')
