Item(by='ilitirit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609025360, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25546787, text='&gt; The darling of those who wish to explain why incompetent people don’t know they’re unskilled, the Dunning-Kruger effect may actually just be a data artefact.<p>This doesn&#x27;t strike me as true. Or rather, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a <i>significant</i> observation that <i>some</i> people may want to try to explain why <i>some</i> people are incompetent. In my experience, people don&#x27;t try to &quot;explain&quot; incompetence in general. They will rather talk about specifics - e.g. &quot;Some people believe this because of the misconception that X implies Y&quot;. Even if their own rationale is incorrect.<p>This is very different to saying that &quot;They are stupid because they don&#x27;t know that they are stupid&quot;.<p>Yeah it may come up as a flippant comment about an individual (or &quot;fringe&quot; group like the Flat Earth Society) in casual conversation, but when I consider how much I&#x27;ve read about and discussed the DK effect, I can&#x27;t say that the implications as stated in that the quoted piece actually has a significant basis in reality. In other words, DK may be the &quot;darling&quot; of said group, but the self-same group is not very significant in any way in my experience.<p>YMMV.')
