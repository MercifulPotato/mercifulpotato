Though interestingly I don&#x27;t have the same problem you have.  What gets me is that the detent between the momentary switch and the full signal is stiff enough that I somewhat regularly inadvertently flash oncoming traffic when activating the turn signal.  Because the pull resistance on that stalk is much lower than the pressure required to overcome the signal detent.')
