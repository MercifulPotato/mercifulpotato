But, they work in the shadows. Since the rise of interest in neural network methods, I&#x27;ve often described their work as &quot;machine learning where epsilon goes to 0.&quot; It&#x27;s not sexy, but it is extremely useful.<p>For instance, Ferragina previously helped to develop the FM-index that enabled the sequence alignment algorithms used for the primary analysis of short genomic reads (100-250bp). These tools were simply transformative, because they reduced the amount of memory required to write genome mappers by orders of magnitude, allowing the construction of full-text indexes of the genome on what was then (~2009) commodity hardware.')
