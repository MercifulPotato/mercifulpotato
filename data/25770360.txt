Many were outdated and I could no longer get them running. I was not an Erlang pro, so perhaps they did still work, but no instructions on how to get them working.<p>Some offered documentation and I followed every single step, until something did not work any longer, like adding certificates. Simply could not make it accept the certificates I created using openpgp moments earlier and of course no documentation on what the certificates need to look like. I think that was Cowboy. The lack of beginner friendly documentation made me desparate. There must be one good and simply working web framework, I thought. I found a chat for N2O and entered that, asking questions and how to do something minimal with N2O, not a whole chat, which was the starting point of the framework, the only example it came with, which it already created, when you followed the tutorial or some steps I had found. I had seen interesting things in a video about it, particularly and how it handles &#x2F; creates JS inside Erlang.<p>When asking for help and mentioning, that no other framework had worked and that I need more documentation, which there is a lack of, I was told to stop &quot;trolling&quot; and to &quot;f* off&quot; ... That was only one person (one contributor of the framework actually), but others did not offer any insight or help either. That was when I stopped looking into Erlang in my free time, trying to get a web project going. I simply gave up at that point.<p>Erlang itself is a great language. I often mention it as a language, where a lot of things are already there for a looong time. Concepts, which more and more languages now adopt for themselves and hype about. I have to agree with lack of beginner friendly documentation though, which is not &quot;Look at the code!&quot;')
