A lot of first-time pilots, private plane or helicopter, practice and learn how to fly out of El Monte or Brackett (Pomona).<p>I&#x27;ve checked FlightRadar24 during the protests of June and it seemed like most of the tail numbers of the helicopters flying around the SGV were either Pasadena Police Department, LA County Sheriff, or a private (news?) helicopter. Lately the ones I&#x27;ve seen aren&#x27;t showing up on FlightRadar24, oddly enough.')
