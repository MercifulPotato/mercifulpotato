I have created YT channel for my daughter&#x27;s cello teacher, where I uploaded Dmitri Shostakovich &quot;Prelude&quot; played by them.<p>A few moments later I&#x27;ve received information that this piece is &quot;demonetized&quot; (I wasn&#x27;t even trying to monetize it) because part of this &quot;song&quot; is a copy of some other &quot;song&quot; owned by someone else. That other &quot;song&quot; was in no way related to the Prelude besides it was also played on two cellos.<p>I&#x27;ve started some &quot;dispute&quot; process not because I am planning to earn money on this channel, but to somehow stop that idiocy that YT keeps pushing.<p>If Google is using the same &quot;AI&quot; that was used to compare those movies for the purpose of matching ads with those who does not use ad block, I am really sorry for advertisers, who are paying money for this.')
