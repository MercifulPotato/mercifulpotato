Rome was surrounded by peer competitors, and OP says their most effective use of elephants was against non-peer competitors like Spain or Gaul.<p>So why would competitors continue to use elephants? Not because Roma was susceptible, but because THEIR boarder competitors were susceptible.<p>Elephants were not worth it to defeat well-trained troops, but were more than worth it to defeat smaller, less disciplined armies&#x2F;militias.<p>My guess is that Rome&#x27;s peers were often using elephants to keep smaller competitors in check, and only used them against Rome because they happen to have them anyway.')
