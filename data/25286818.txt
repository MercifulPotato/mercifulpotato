Which means it’s less than 1&#x2F;100th the size of Apple’s total hardware business (and technically, I didn’t even include wearables, speakers, Apple TV, and other side businesses that use Apple-designed chips).<p>It is very possible that Apple brings in more revenue selling Apple TV’s than Microsoft does selling Surface products. Given its low price, I doubt it, but if that was a true fact it wouldn’t shock me at all.')
