I would have stress nightmares and even when i did fall asleep, I would soon wake myself up with specific scenarios my mind was trying to work out.<p>I was incapacitated by this, which exacerbated my situation.<p>I eventually noticed that I could fall asleep if I sat with my daughters while they watched TV.  This evolved to me falling asleep with the TV on. ...but the light, noise, and discomfort of the couch made this poor quality sleep.<p>Which then evolved to me falling asleep in bed with earphones on just listening to old tv, not watching.  But I noticed that as soon as the tv show stopped, I would have nightmares again.<p>This evolved into me selecting 8 hours of movies that, on low volume, keep me asleep all night and I&#x27;ve essentially solved my sleep problem - despite this stressful situation persists.<p>My colleagues has instead started taking prescription sleeping pills.<p>I have found that selection of audio is important.   It cannot be interesting or novel.  It cannot be sound only - there must be speech.  It must be content you enjoy, but have seen multiple times before.  ...and it must have peaceful audio without screaming, shooting, abrupt sounds.<p>Interestingly, I no longer dream at all.  The audio has essentially supplanted dreaming.  I know this because on the occasions that the audio fails, my dreams return and are a notable experience.<p>I have been doing this for over 6 months now.   8 solid hours of sleep per night on the same programming all night.  No ill effects noted.  It has been instrumental in coping.<p>Food for thought.  It seems stress caused insomnia can be cured without drugs, and dreams are optional for humans.')
