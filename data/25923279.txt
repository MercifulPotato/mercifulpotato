Reading the time off the ceiling when it&#x27;s dark is the way to go.  I bought one years ago, and it comes with a normal clock and the projector added to the side, and it reads the time via the WWVB time signal.<p>I 95% like it, but: the normal clock part I never use, and the WWVB syncing sometimes goes out (happening more after 7 years of use), and it reads a time 1-3 hours wrong.<p>I <i>LOVE</i> the projector part, it&#x27;s basically all I use.  I&#x27;ve been tempted recently to pull it apart and hook it up to some microcontroller that NTP synced and just ran the projector.')
