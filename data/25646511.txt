Look at plugins for hyper -- people write a few and then quit.  That&#x27;s the good outcome.<p>A more likely outcome is to be like Eclipse which more or less works out of the box to develop Java, occasionally gets a group of plugins put together by a vendor that works, but it will fail if you install enough of them.<p>The trouble is that current gui frameworks do not support encapsulation in that there is a single thread used to draw everything.  If component A takes 10 sec to draw,  component B has to wait.')
