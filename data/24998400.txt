They might for a few days, but afterwards you get used to them. For me greatest realisation was, if I do not want to work or do not have something to work, I will waste time. I can throw out my mobile, but then I will find new ways to wasting time -- surfing random websites on laptop, watching TV, talking to random people, etc. The only solution for this is to assign some work to yourself everyday and have some sort of negative consequences if you are not able to complete that work.')
