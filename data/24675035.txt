I disagree. Qualcomm would have faced serious challenges keeping up with these hypothetical Intel ARM processors back in the early 2010s. They <i>still</i> might, but Intel hasn&#x27;t even tried.<p>Intel was just too proud to do something like that. They wanted x86 to become the smartphone standard, which it obviously didn&#x27;t... and now they&#x27;re suffering defeat on all fronts.')
