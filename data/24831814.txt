They have no interest in you being able to click a button and see media outlets reporting on the wrong things.<p>Personally I believe we need regulation that require these platforms to allow users to opt-out of moderation and timeline manipulation. But again, this assumes those in power have an interest in freedom of speech which isn&#x27;t the case.')
