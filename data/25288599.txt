If I want to run someone else&#x27;s software on my cloud, how I want to do that depends on my cloud. I want docs and binaries, not a full cloud configuration.<p>Some people would want k8s, some docker swarm or whatever, some an aws config, others ansible, etc etc etc.<p>If I want a managed service, I _want_ to pay for that. The price includes people responding to pages and fixing problems, as well as fiddling with configs.<p>And I&#x27;d much rather be paying that money to a small (relatively) open-source company than a behemoth like AWS.')
