Depending on wherever you are from it&#x27;s not some kind of shared obviousness at all. Some countries actually execute people for possessing hard drugs (which I don&#x27;t agree with, but that&#x27;s the reality: don&#x27;t assume &#x27;rights&#x27; are universal). Most of these countries are in South East Asia and have suffered in the opium days so there&#x27;s a history behind that decision too.')
