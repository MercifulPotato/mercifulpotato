Intel&#x27;s microarchitecture at the time, NetBurst, was uncompetitive and relied almost entirely on inertia, and yes, anti-competitive behaviour to retain market share.<p>Core leap-frogged that and Intel remained ahead for the better part of a decade afterwards. To say that Intel sat on its laurels between the time of the first round of antitrust litigation in the early 90s is quite inaccurate.')
