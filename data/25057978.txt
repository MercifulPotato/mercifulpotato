Drug abuse (I use the term abuse because the usage turns out harmful in both works). Philip K. Dick (writer of A Scanner Darkly, and other science fiction) is known to have used e.g. amphetamine.<p>I would assume its because the authors are or have been recreational users as well. Heroin was used as medicine long before it was made illegal. Musicians used it, and wrote about the usage. A lot of the references are hidden, for example Alice D. in Wonderland or Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. When I told my parents about that (they were teens&#x2F;young adults in the 60&#x2F;70s) they were flabbergasted. Its kind of like a wink or nudge, given drug usage or abuse being socially not accepted.<p>Edit: Another thing to add: Religions and traditions are full with drugs references as well. Find the mushrooms in old paintings of say Jesus Christ.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heroin#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heroin#History</a>')
