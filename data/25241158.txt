If, why and how persistently someone was ignored are very relevant questions that we have no facts on. And what the subject of the meeting was.<p>We know that Alysa Butler felt unappreciated. I&#x27;m hesitant to believe the NYT is even representing her opinions fairly. If you read what they&#x27;ve written about carefully, the article doesn&#x27;t have her accusing Coinbase of any sort of racism, the NYT is just weaving her experience into a story that they construct elsewhere (normal practice in newspapers). A &#x27;diversity problem&#x27; is different from racism. 25 year olds being ignored in meetings is not a new phenomenon either in my experience.')
