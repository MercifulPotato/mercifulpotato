It could mean her employment status is off today. Or it could mean she can&#x27;t access any corp material but her status is on.<p>It&#x27;s fairly standard to let the employee leave the building immediately but still on payroll for 2 more weeks.<p>Again, I think it&#x27;s a non-issue. Both wants to part way. Either party can singlehandedly make that date earlier.<p>It seems one side brings up this point because other points are not salient, so they try to make it like &quot;you see they fire me today. I actually want to leave in 10 days instead. This is unethical!!&quot;. It&#x27;s a weak point and muddles the main point.')
