When I played with Scratch as a teenager, though, I remember being frustrated that it wasn&#x27;t just designed to make programming easy, but also to &quot;teach programming to kids&quot;--which meant that it was easy to make games, but basically impossible to &quot;take the training wheels off&quot; and do more serious tasks, because there was no way to access the filesystem or the network or connect with any other software. That was almost ten years ago, so maybe this complaint is out of date--but it does get to what I like about the micro:bit, which is that it&#x27;s super simple and fun to program, but still lets you make &quot;real&quot; things.')
