And I’m left with the option of dealing with it in basically one of a few ways<p>- Configure mutt to prefer html over plain text, meaning a slightly worse experience for mails that are actually better formatted in their plain text originals.<p>- Keep my current configuration and having to press a few extra buttons every so often in order to see the html attached version instead<p>- Making a convoluted system that is based either on associating preferred format with the sender address, sender mail server etc. Or one using heuristics to compare the text and html versions and choosing one based on that. Ultimately this either such type of system would be time consuming to make and probably fragile leading to more frustrations.<p>- Abandoning mutt. Truth be told mutt is not ideal, and at some point I will probably stop using it. But I’ve been using it for years and my setup is at a kind of local optimum, where even though there are frustrations with it it is never any one given point in time where it is worth the effort of making those sorts of changes. Even though in the long run, it would be better.<p>For a while I was toying with the idea of offering hosted email to others as a paid service. If I had say 25 paying customers that paid a real premium price then I could spend time on the setup and have the time being paid time and making it worth the effort. But truth be told I am fearful of doing this because with the way that email works it will be almost certain that mails of my customers end up wrongly seen as spam by some receiving systems. And I don’t want my paying customers to experience that with a service I provide to them for the kind of price that I would have to charge in order to offer hosted mail service in the first place.<p>For the record I would charge $100&#x2F;month. Which for most people is crazy compared to either using a free mail service or paying for example Proton Mail but I believe that there exist 25 people in the world who earn enough and care about the things I care about with regards to email that it would make sense for them to pay this price for it, and because these few people would know that they are paying that price in return for being hosted by someone who only hosts a few people and therefore has time to properly provide in-depth customer service. But like I said because of the likelihood of mails sent by my server ending in spam, it is a no-go IMO.')
