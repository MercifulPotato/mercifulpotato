This happened to a friend from university. He started off with &quot;ogame&quot;. A web based space sim. Initially it was ok and we even went to play it with him (entirely free to play) in our clique. Given we were studying comp sci it also wasn&#x27;t surprising that he programmed himself some helpers for ratios, targeting of other players etc. Shortly after he started Eve Online. Same thing just with an actual nice 3d space sim around it. He&#x27;d optimize the hell out of everything including setting his alarm clock for 3am because his character would finish a skill at that time so that he wouldn&#x27;t waste 3 hours until normal wakeup time. Shortly after he stopped going to uni with us, which worked for a while until he also no longer found time to study on his own and his sleep cycle was completely dominated by the game. I think he never finished uni and I&#x27;m not sure what became of him. Other than probably being really well off inside of Eve.<p>So sad.')
