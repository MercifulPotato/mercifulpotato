So when a Tesla gets into a crash, insurance companies are quick to declare them a total loss because the cost of repairs approaches the value of the vehicle. At that point, Tesla stops supporting the vehicle, meaning all warranties are voided and Supercharging is disabled, even after the repaired vehicle passes a high-voltage inspection by Teslaâ€™s own repair staff.</i><p>I take it most crashed vehicles written off in this way can&#x27;t really be used for parts because Tesla is sabotaging the market for used vehicles and wants to boost sales of new&#x2F;replacement parts at dealerships, correct?<p>Also, is the warranty of a Tesla voided if an independent repair shop makes repairs with such parts?')
