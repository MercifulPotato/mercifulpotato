If you make breaking DB changes you still have the REST layer to buffer them. If REST won&#x27;t cover your breaking changes with data transforms because you are deleting whole tables and restructuring then it&#x27;s time to refactor the front end as well anyway. I disagree with the front end sending SQL directly but a thin REST layer with a little validation seems ideal to me.')
