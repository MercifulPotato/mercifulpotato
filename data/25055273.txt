Here is a more systematic post-election analysis, based on a huge survey (100,000+ respondents), from Fox&#x2F;Associated Press&#x2F;U Chicago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;elections&#x2F;2020&#x2F;general-results&#x2F;voter-analysis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;elections&#x2F;2020&#x2F;general-results&#x2F;voter...</a><p>This one shows significantly lower Black vote for Trump than the Essence article (12% of men, 6% of women) but an even higher Latino vote (39% of men, 32% of women). Both sets of data show Trump losing support from white men slightly. (Which is consistent with pre-election polling.)')
