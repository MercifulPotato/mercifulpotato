I think one of the biggest problems with the bank meltdown of 2008 is that no heads rolled, so it&#x27;s no surprise that there has ultimately been very little behavioral change.<p>&gt; <i>The problem in my mind is when banks are doing fractional reserve without the explicit understanding and consent of their depositors.</i><p>All of them are consenting (FRB is what banks <i>do</i>, they don&#x27;t make money by simply holding a deposit) but boy is there a lack of understanding on how the modern bank works as a business and it&#x27;s effect on the money supply.')
