You are fully entitled to fork the project and remove all those to get everything for free, but if you do then you now have to maintain a fork of the project yourself. The product is not that expensive - for anybody with a salary, even having a meeting to discuss doing this is not worthwhile.<p>* All the core product code is AGPL, to avoid proprietary forks cloning the whole thing and breaking this model (many of the smaller internal libraries that are generic &amp; generally useful are Apache 2 though).<p>* All open-source contributors get free subscriptions, so if you&#x27;re willing to get involved in the project it acts like any traditional free open-source project for you.<p>So far it&#x27;s working well - there&#x27;s a few hundred paying customers, including a good few team subscriptions, and it&#x27;s been making good steady growth for over a year now.<p>This model wouldn&#x27;t work for everything (you need something product-shaped, rather than a standalone library) and I have no idea how it would scale out as a larger business, but it&#x27;s been a very functional model for me to make an open-source project that&#x27;s financially self-sufficient as a solo developer.')
