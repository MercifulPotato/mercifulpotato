That data has no meaning in itself except in the meta.<p>&gt; Even if the clocks are synchronised, there will be some drift and the messages may be processed fast enough that the drift puts their timestamps out of order.<p>If you are consuming from sources which you cannot control the accuracy of the clocks, then you must inherently either reduce your reliance on the need for accuracy (many Windows systems have horrendous clock discipline in their software implementation) or find a way of ensuring accuracy. E.g. close proximity NTP or close proximity PTP etc etc.<p>Hope that makes sense.')
