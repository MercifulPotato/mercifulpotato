Once you hit the peak for that road section, trafic grinds. If, for example, you have a 30 minute comute that spends 15 minutes in congestion-limited trafic and 15 minutes on a speed limited empty highway, you would need to drive 50% faster on those sections to recoup a full 5 minutes, so something like 105 mph on a 70 mph section for a full 10 minutes. That doesn&#x27;t sound realistic.<p>There is a cost to low speed limits, clearly, but it is usually marginal - and when it&#x27;s not, you should address that specific problem of a too low speed limit instead of making speed limits unenforceable throughout. If a section generates lots of speed tickets and no even minor incidents, it&#x27;s clearly a sign to increase speed.<p>&gt; drivers de-rating the risks.<p>True, but the risk rating they assigned to higher speeds was probably not proportional to the actual exponential increase to begin with.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t have more accidents on the fastest roads in the UK.<p>That&#x27;s moving the goal posts. The increase in risk is exponential on any given single road. Some roads are exceptionally safe at low speeds so you can increase the speed quite a bit and keep the risks low, hence the higher limits.')
