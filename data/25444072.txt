I also think it&#x27;s a reasonable idea for Mozilla to focus on Thunderbird the email client since there aren&#x27;t a lot of great alternatives.<p>However, when it comes to a hosted email service, there are plenty of good options already out there (e.g. Fastmail and Protonmail). The same goes for VPNs.<p>I would much prefer Mozilla spend that money making Firefox better, or putting that money in some sort of mutual fund, the proceeds of which would fund browser development if Google ever stopped paying Mozilla.<p>The reason is, VPN services are not hard to build. Email services are not hard to build. Browsers <i>are</i> hard to build, and if Firefox development ever stalled it would probably go away forever.')
