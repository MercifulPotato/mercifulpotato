While python can be great when used in best practice, its level of freedom make it easy for the user to get away with obvious mistakes. It&#x27;s great to have freedom like that when you&#x27;re writing small projects, but a large project could lead to unintended effects that cause more damaging issues than the time lost using a stricter language.')
