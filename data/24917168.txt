In my book a pure function should be named after the result it returns, so in this case I would use the name `definition&#x27; instead of `find_definition&#x27; and `definition_url&#x27; instead of `build_url&#x27;. For predicates I try to avoid an &quot;is&quot; prefix when a simple adjective is sufficient.')
