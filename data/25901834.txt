They started with the same strategy of gradual improvements. They found out (and shard) the same issues Tesla is running into in the past years: Users don&#x27;t pay attention when monitoring a system doing a boring task - even when failures carry a high price. Waymo switched the approach from a gradual L2&#x2F;3&#x2F;4 improvements straight to developing an L4 system; Tesla is locked in to the gradual move due to it being part of their business model, and are now stuck with trying to make self-driving work with unqualified test drivers (i.e. customers) and outdated technical decisions (not using Lidar because they were too expensive back then).<p>So Waymo does have the experience to call out Tesla here.')
