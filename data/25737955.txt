Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=[25742092], score=None, time=1610402422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737454, text='&gt; And every NCPD job was identical.<p>I actually disagree with this pretty solidly - I&#x27;ve seen absolutely trash side missions like Dragon&#x27;s Age 2 where a handful of dungeon templates had slices taken off of them and were repackaged endlessly.  The NCPD jobs (especially the Assault ones) are cheapo quests - but they&#x27;re placed interestingly in the world with custom prop work and differing tactical options.  Depending on your build it may be more or less of &quot;Just rush in with a sword&quot; but viewing them as the random world encounters they appear to be created as makes them rather high quality in my eyes.<p>It&#x27;s optional content for completionists or for you to trip over when wandering around and for that role I think it was well done.')
