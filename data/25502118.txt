On &#x2F;v&#x2F;science right now there is a submission about dark matter and MOND [1], which was also discussed today on HN [2].<p>The title of the Voat submission will give you a good idea of what the place is like: &quot;Another Jew Science Lie to Fall? DARK MATTER not needed?! Evidence of &quot;modified gravity&quot; in 150 galaxies strengthens dark matter alternative. Gravity has &gt;8 anomalies but this one is solvable.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s actually a fairly tame discussion by Voat standards. Here&#x27;s one that was a submission of a video on pilot wave theory from PBS Space Time [3] (or as it is referred to in the comments, (((PBS)))). Voat title: &quot;Kikes have been shitting up science for over a century&quot;. See the comments for how the ether is the right theory and the Jews suppressed it.<p>Here&#x27;s what a movie discussion is like over there [4], &quot;Mandolorian - Season 2&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voat.co&#x2F;v&#x2F;science&#x2F;4169827" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voat.co&#x2F;v&#x2F;science&#x2F;4169827</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25496725" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25496725</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voat.co&#x2F;v&#x2F;science&#x2F;4152241" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voat.co&#x2F;v&#x2F;science&#x2F;4152241</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voat.co&#x2F;v&#x2F;movies&#x2F;4164913" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voat.co&#x2F;v&#x2F;movies&#x2F;4164913</a>')
