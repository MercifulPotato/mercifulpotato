(You are not limited to website and email; you can include other servers too if you want to have, and some are better for some other purposes.) I don&#x27;t use Facebook, I don&#x27;t write on Twitter, and my email is not Gmail.<p>&gt; What neither side can agree on is that EVERYBODY has the right to speak and NOBODY is entitled to an audience. They don&#x27;t understand that an individual&#x27;s right to speak ends where everybody else&#x27;s right to ignore him begins.<p>This part I agree. Everyone should have freedom of speech, but you can&#x27;t force someone to listen if they do not wish to do so. (Of course, it also mean, people have the right to criticize what someone else says, too, that is also important to have.)<p>I am not &quot;right&#x2F;left&quot; wing, I think.')
