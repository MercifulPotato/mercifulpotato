The rest is pretty much the same.<p>This pretty much. I have a long commute as a programmer and working at home with a triple monitor standing desk is so much better... but &quot;water cooler&quot; chats and a meeting room pow-wow is something sorely missing. Some things communicate better face too face with white boards.<p>Everything else I think is true... face to face vs zoom to zoom has to be a hell of a change and, if I was in those shoes (Zero interest in management) I&#x27;d push for people back in the office.<p>Personally... I&#x27;d love a 3 home, 2 in office routine. Would really afford the best of both.')
