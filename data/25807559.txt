This reads exactly like a simple license that went through several rounds of machine translation. Making some allowances for usage and spelling errors, as well as some outright guesses at meaning, here&#x27;s a somewhat fractured full-English translation:<p>See, far wanderer, confronted with raw, programmatic instruction in the most pure form. A hesitation, troubled to the terms that this license affirms. By a voyage to explore the mechanism and ponder the making. Ta da! The remedy: an egress without risk.<p>Leave No Trace via seven principles:<p>0. Modify language in advance. Attach the Jollo LNT license with copies to distribute.<p>1. Not responsible for negligent coding of the program.<p>2. Not sympathetic for negligent coding of the program.<p>3. No permission to modify it under any circumstance.<p>4. No permission to distribute under any circumstance.<p>5. Respect the programmatic instructions.<p>6. (Do) not interfere with  the harmony of a friendship.<p>Edit: jollo.org is kind of trippy.')
