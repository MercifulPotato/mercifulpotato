I just want to store the information that I know it might be useful or important later.<p>(More concretely, I could see this being a single huge text file in which I can make natural language queries; each query generates a view of the file that corresponds to selected sentences in the file that match the query. For example, if I asked &quot;what are the things I have to do for next month&quot;, then it would show me the sentences that correspond to things I have to do for next month. If I queried &quot;exciting ML papers&quot;, then it would show me the sentences in which I link or talk about an ML paper, and I sounded excited about it.)')
