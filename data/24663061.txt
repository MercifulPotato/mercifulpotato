If the top 1% get their income doubled (or the bottom 30% their income halved, or both at the same time) with all else being equal, the median does not change. You really need a high percentile as well. Low percentiles are not that interesting, because the distribution is much more compressed there.<p>In essence, a median that keep climbing nicely is no indication that the situation is not becoming catastrophic. Granted, using the average is arguably worse.')
