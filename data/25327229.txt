That&#x27;s why monospace fonts are so commonly used in the intelligence community for example.<p>Third, if you just add a black bar to a screenshot, there might be residual values of the text left in adjacent seemingly white portions of the image, but they might not be entirely white due to compression effects. Better you run it through a filter before publishing.')
