What if Detroit was desirable due to the economics and infrastructure constraints of that time, but what if people like the other aspects, such as location and weather,of living somewhere?<p>Not that itâ€™s not possible for that to change either, but my point is different pieces of land may be more or less desirable than others outside of economic conditions.')
