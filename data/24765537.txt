It&#x27;s a matter of negative rights vs. positive rights.  The original commenter&#x27;s argument was cogent.<p>In copyright, the default is that no one has rights to your creations but you.  In licensing it as open source, you&#x27;re <i>broadening</i> what others can do with it.  It&#x27;s an active choice.  If granting someone X could result in them doing X where they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t, and you&#x27;d be uncomfortable with that, then don&#x27;t go out and invite people to do X.<p>The hackneyed &quot;common sense ain&#x27;t so common&quot; aphorism is certainly something to avoid though.')
