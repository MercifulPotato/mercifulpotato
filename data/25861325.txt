Every customer I talk to hates it.  Interestingly, the problem most often cited is not that the scaled price is too high, but that it&#x27;s difficult to predict.  Paying $100&#x2F;mo now and $1k&#x2F;mo later isn&#x27;t the problem - it&#x27;s paying $100&#x2F;mo now and paying some unknown large amount later.  The uncertainty it introduces is the real problem, not the cost.  I suspect you&#x27;ll hear something similar - especially for a product whose main focus is financial planning.<p>That aside, this looks like a cool product!  I feel like every tiny startup I&#x27;ve worked at has had some flavor of this problem and solved it with ad-hoc spreadsheets.  Seems like a solid niche.  :)')
