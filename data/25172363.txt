I won&#x27;t address it because the author doesn&#x27;t deserve to be taken seriously. Vague appears to having lived during a coup don&#x27;t make him an authority.<p>I will say, however, that, if you bother to read outside of the mainstream corporate media and sensationalist press, you get a different picture (sadly, many do not, and many allow their irrational biases and hatred for the Orange Man to eradicate any vestige of calm, measured, honest, rationally defensible thought and consideration). Specifically, not that Trump has necessarily won (though some do indeed claim that he won in a landslide), but that there are very alarming reports of voter fraud, significant enough that they could have swayed the election. If they are indeed true, then we are indeed experience a kind of coup, but one carried out by Democrats.<p>Those who dismiss the possibility of voter fraud out of hand show their ignorance of history. It has been a serious concern in American politics since the republic was founded. Recent noteworthy examples include Bush v. Gore, and before that Lyndon Johnson (in Texas) and JFK. Anyone who isn&#x27;t consumed with blinding hatred of the Orange Man knows how unprecedented the media&#x27;s hatred of and obsession with Trump has been these last four years. He upset the establishment, shocked their smug complacency, and made them realize that their control of the country isn&#x27;t as total as they assumed it is.<p>This is neither an endorsement of Trump nor a condemnation, just a description of what&#x27;s happened. When a powerful caste sees its power threatened, its plans frustrated, they begin to freak out. As Chomsky wrote, the press is to democratic republics what the police baton is in a dictatorship. Too many Americans, and Western Europeans, still live in a kind of fantasyland when it comes to how their governments function. They have a kind of romanticized view of government, of the state (certainly, some do have anarchistic views on the opposite extreme, but these are a small minority). Either that, or they hate the Orange Man so much that they essentially don&#x27;t care if voter fraud has taken place as long as Trump is kept out of office. This is a terrible fanaticism no less fanatical than what they accuse Trump supporters of being.<p>The presumptuous, officious way in which the Biden campaign has been carrying itself since the election, the media&#x27;s arrogation of the role of declaring the victor, the categorical ridicule of even the mere asking of questions, that DESPITE there being evidence, means, motive, and opportunity of and for fraud, simply makes matter that much more suspicious. If the Biden camp were truly confident in their victory, they would cooperate and encourage investigations into these reports of voter fraud. Such acts would demonstrate to voters in the middle as well as those on the other side that they are a party of good will. It would win them major points, more than any cheap platitudes about unity and Biden being a president to all Americans. Those may feel nice, and I sympathize with a certain exhaustion with the last four years of constant media virulence, but those aren&#x27;t reasons to acquiesce. By refusing to examine these reports, by dismissing them out of hand, the Democrats are doing damage by communicating to the people that the integrity of elections isn&#x27;t really all that important. That we don&#x27;t need to examine fraud because at the end of the day, who cares.')
