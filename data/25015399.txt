Memory is, especially ECC Memory. Memory price per GB hasn&#x27;t fall at all. And in many cases they are even more expensive. And it is only in recent few years you start seeing &quot;High CPU Instances&quot; because it is cheaper to include a Higher Core Count in the plan than to increase the Memory.<p>And because of the increase in VM &#x2F; Core Count and Tenant, the server are now equipped with multiple High Speed Network connection. And if you look at it from a Cost Per Network Card &#x2F; Port &#x2F; Bandwidth &#x2F; Server &#x2F; Tenant. Price hasn&#x27;t fallen much either. Adding in your cloud &#x2F; VPS instance are paying Electricity, Co-Location and Networking charges, none of these have an Moore&#x27;s Law and are part of the TCO. And if you include the continuous raise of wages, things doesn&#x27;t look all so good.<p>But Zen 2 is barely deployed so its effect on the industry is not here yet. Linode already use Zen 2 and they are already offering better price plan than DO or other Medium Cloud vendors. I expect Zen 3 to be big with many of the Cloud Vendors. And you should see those reflected on pricing.')
