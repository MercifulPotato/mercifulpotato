The problem with Among Us is that one of its mechanics is lying or deceiving. When playing with friends this may not really be a problem – it&#x27;s all fun and games.<p>But, in a work environment, I think some people would be careful about &quot;showing they are good at lying&quot;. Therefore, when it&#x27;s their turn to be the imposter, they will self-sabotage so they don&#x27;t even try to manipulate or lie. I suppose all this depends on how political or close-knit the team you are in is, so YMMV. I can see this working great in a startup, but maybe not so much in a larger company, where a certain amount of politics permeates interactions.<p>I think this takes a toll on how fun the game can be in the end. Which is why, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll recommend Among Us again, because I think some people just don&#x27;t want to show a &quot;dirtier&quot; side of themselves especially in front of others.<p>Side note – I do love Among Us and I am playing it with friends whenever I can. I do think it has some great team-building ideas in it, probably unintentionally, as I don&#x27;t think it was created as a workplace team building game. If there could be a similar game, that would keep the team building, but with less of the deceiving, that could be a real winner for the team-building activity in the age of remote work.')
