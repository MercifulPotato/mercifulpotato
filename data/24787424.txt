These are stack management instructions; you know in advance from the platform ABI which registers are &quot;scratch&quot; and which are &quot;save&quot;, so if you allocate any of the &quot;save&quot; registers in your function you emit the corresponding push&#x2F;pop pairs in the start and end of the function. At worst you push&#x2F;pop a register you don&#x27;t need to - but in ARM64, the stack has to be 128-bit aligned, so you <i>have</i> to push&#x2F;pop pairs.')
