They&#x27;re synergistic. The idea that a hypothetical downgrade attack is enough justification to kill off HTTP everywhere is incredibly business-centric and stupid. Most sites are not transacting currency or private information.<p>A centralized cert is just that, centralized. Even if it&#x27;s LetsEncrypt that&#x27;s still a single point of failure for organizational corruption (ie, what happened to dot org), accidents (as cert providers mess up regularly) and government control. It&#x27;s a long leash but if HTTPS is the only option (as is the trend) it&#x27;s still a leash.<p>Almost all sites should be HTTP and HTTPS.')
