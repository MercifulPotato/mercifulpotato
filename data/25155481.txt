Regular backups of the Enpass file into a folder that is synced to my NAS.<p>Wanted to look into other password managers, preferably open source, but at the time Enpass had the best syncing options combined with a good enough user interface that’s suitable for less tech folks.<p>Edit: I mainly use all the things on my devices, and don’t try to use things from untrusted devices. The only use cases with untrusted are:<p>- copy shop -&gt; Sending the file via share drop<p>- PC of a Family member -&gt; manually typing password from phone.')
