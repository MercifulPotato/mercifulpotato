Startups that innovated on a great user experience and had a flawless execution in the beginning.  I was an early adopter of both of them, and they worked well. Dropbox sync between different machines worked like magic. I still remember some of the nightmares my coworkers had with OneDrive in meetings when the files for the presentations were missing because of the poor sync capabilities of OneDrive. \nDropbox is no failure. Their projected revenue for 2020 is $1.8B. This is 3x more than Slack, but their market cap is 3x smaller. \nBoth Slack and Evernote are facing the most powerful companies in the world offering their products for free or at really discounted rates. What makes their situation even worse is that they don&#x27;t own the content (documents, pdfs, spreadsheets). The documents will be edited somewhere else and then shared in dropbox.  On top of that many other applications like chat offer file transfer and sharing.<p>Bottom line: I don&#x27;t want them to fail ( I don&#x27;t want Evernote to fail too), because it points to a world where only 5 to 10 big tech companies can survive. We need smaller innovative businesses to succeed too. It will be a sad day when a $2B business can&#x27;t survive and is forced to sell.')
