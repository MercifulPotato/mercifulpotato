Although when I tried using the mongo driver, literally nothing worked. I also ran into problems from the generated migrations where I would get errors when trying to run them.<p>Even with these encountered problems, I&#x27;m still willing to give it a try for my upcoming project. I&#x27;ll probably write an article on this if things go bad.<p>For sure, this is less mature then the others out there, but I think it has a bright future as it has a nice syntax and cool features.')
