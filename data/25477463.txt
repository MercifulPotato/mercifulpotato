Either you live in the right place where there is a scene and you might be able to have a career in making your own music, or you need to consider yourself a composer and make music for others (movies, tvshows, ads, ...), this is where the money is at today, not in trying to be a music star. Even gigs don&#x27;t pay that much compared to that, because one needs an audience.<p>As for online services. Spotify is 100% pointless when it comes to monetization, bandcamp is a bit better if you can provide physical goods.')
