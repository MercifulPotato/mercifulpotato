Item(by='mark242', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604637149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001789, text='For those of you hitting ctrl-f &quot;postfix&quot;: Postfix is very much not designed to run within a container. Unless you can absolutely 1000% guarantee that you will only ever have one instance of the postfix container running, you _will_ get data corruption and it is _very_ likely that you will lose email, because postfix does not support multiple instances sharing the same data&#x2F;queue directory.<p>A ReplicaSet, as given in the OP&#x27;s yaml, does not suffice here because it is not guaranteed that the failing pod (which triggers a new pod to start) doesn&#x27;t come back to life. That will almost guarantee your postfix installation to break especially as one postfix instance starts cleaning up files possibly during the time period where another postfix instance hitting the same directory is trying to access them.<p>On edit: yes, Postfix 3.3 can be run as a container process. What I mean is running it within a standard container environment where you would expect multiple instances to run for failover etc.')
