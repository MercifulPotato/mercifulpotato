There is unfortunately no way to do this that doesn&#x27;t break down in mixed-DPI situations because of the rounding issues. If you want to add this to a wayland implementation, I won&#x27;t (and can&#x27;t) stop you, but I think it&#x27;s a bad idea. Just my experience from trying to write various scaled interfaces, it becomes impossible to ensure that anything is pixel aligned after you introduce a non-integer transform in the graph. When the top point in the graph is the screen, that limits a lot what you can do there.<p>&gt;You&#x27;re just sizing the window to integer pixel sizes. Just like every X WM and Wayland compositor does.<p>To be clear, this is if you configured your output scaling to be 2&#x2F;3. 133px is absolutely not correct there.')
