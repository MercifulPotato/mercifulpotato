This is focusing on a completely irrelevant metric. It’s a great motivator for why we need to shift but it has no impact on how hard it will be to replace oil. There’s 100 practical reason for why it’s hard, namely that clean energy sources are not under our direct control to scale up and down as we need more&#x2F;less. We can’t tell the sun to be strongest at 6pm when everyone gets off work so we’ll need more energy. You can force the wind to blow. The best way to solve this is improving battery tech but that’s a HUGE task. What we have currently is a focus on quickly growing increase in clean energy sources as a baseline energy source with a diversified mix of other sources along with natural gas peaking plants that are far cleaner than coal and provide near immediate response times to surges on energy demand which is incredible.')
