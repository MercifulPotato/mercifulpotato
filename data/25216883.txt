By &quot;mental gymnastics&quot; I assume you mean &quot;needlessly drawn out argumentation&#x2F;reasoning&quot;. The essays contain very little of that and are densely packed with arguments and links. Only exception is in Past IV where he gets technical explaining why China&#x27;s data does not violate Benford&#x27;s law as some have suggested. The tldr is that there is little evidence to support the charge of &quot;deliberate cover-up&quot; during initial outbreak or subsequent data fudging.')
