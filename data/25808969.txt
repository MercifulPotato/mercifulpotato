AWS is actually a backwards development of technology in my opinion because it is anti-open source.<p>It is quite straightforward to lease your own server and&#x2F;or build your own and colo. You can even easily setup containers on such, or a cluster of them if you desire.<p>You also don&#x27;t need a domain name to host a site. Plain IP addresses work fine in many situations. There are plenty of &quot;shady&quot; countries who will let you register DNS and do whatever you want with it.<p>Just look at the underground pirate community. None of this weak censorship by silencing Facebook posts is stopping them. Piracy will continue to the end of time, because if you have a bit of tech skill there is very little that can silence a person on the modern internet.<p>And yes, p2p ( without internet ) file sharing is alive and well. Those in draconian environments engage in it. Swapping 12tb drives is quite effective in sharing data.<p>Own microchips? Yeah we are heading that way. Hence the popularity of Risc-V and various &quot;open hardware&quot;. Typically it is sufficient to use your own software stack on existing hardware though.<p>SV execs can&#x27;t do shit about public opinion or the underground community.<p>The free exchange of information is alive and well. It just doesn&#x27;t live on Facebook or Parler or any of that crap.')
