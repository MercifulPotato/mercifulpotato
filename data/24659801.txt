The idea is that your Framework of Choice would do the raw code and you dear application developer would get it in some handy &quot;cooked&quot; way which matched your framework. (For example, maybe outputting isolated components could be simple boolean in your build configuration.)<p>Too many people think that the raw web component specs are meant to compete with frameworks like React etc. But that is huge misunderstanding. They&#x27;re low level APIs which frameworks can build on.')
