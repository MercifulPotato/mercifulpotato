I recall reading an in depth article about a recent vault fire that destroyed many original studio recordings, and that the issues leading up to the disaster were preventable.<p>I think the studios are too short-sighted to see the value of releasing many of these into the public domain, and I think some creativity could turn it into a business model that drums up interest and revenue.<p>Here’s an idea: a studio or record label could run a “Kickstarter” where sales of a commemorative collection could hit a certain threshold to trigger release into the public domain. These could be mainly made up of content that has otherwise fallen into relative obscurity.<p>I mean, I’m no business expert and maybe that’s a dumb idea but it’s at least new and unique.')
