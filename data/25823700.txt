This is a key mechanism for most use cases. However, if you&#x27;re fine with limiting yourself to erasing only during iteration, it&#x27;s pretty nifty.<p>I&#x27;ve also done some benchmarks in the past and found it interior iteration performance due to what I&#x27;m assuming to be inability to prefetch the next address. However, linked list iteration is already relatively slow so I suppose it&#x27;s not a big downside.')
