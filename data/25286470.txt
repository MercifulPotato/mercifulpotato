Why do we always see these errors where white-centric datasets produce white-centric results?<p>While it would be a symmetric situation a vacuum, we do not live in a vacuum. And acknowledging dataset bias by itself doesn&#x27;t address the bias meaningfully. In practice, we often treat the bias as an exogenous factor when it is not, moving it outside the scope of our responsibility. But it is very much the product of our work, a reflection of our choices, values, and beliefs about what to prioritize. We can&#x27;t abdicate our responsibility for it; the stakes are too high.')
