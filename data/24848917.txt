I was merely saying two simple things:<p>a) the fact that a corporation uses a language is meaningless and can&#x27;t be used as an argument for anything - except maybe what to learn if you want to get a job there.<p>b) that all arguments based on Rust&#x27;s novelty, call it &quot;serious language&quot; &quot;mainstream language&quot; or whatever - have merit. Rust is obviously not mature enough for many potential users and you can&#x27;t convince them by talking about RFCs.')
