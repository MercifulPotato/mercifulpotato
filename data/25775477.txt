Item(by='spiffytech', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610626481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765117, text='The folks from Beeminder (a goal-motivation SaaS) created a pile of Perl scripts nearly a decade ago called TagTime (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tagti.me" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tagti.me</a>), which shows pop-ups periodically (but randomly) asking what you&#x27;re doing <i>right now</i>, and feeds that into a time tracker. That tackles one huge issue with time tracking: you have to either diligently switch up your tracker every time you context-switch, or retrospectively guess at what you actually did, and how long you think you spent on it all. Random stochastic sampling gives a solid great long-term approximation of your activities and cumulative time spent, without guesswork or discipline.<p>I love the idea, but I need this to work on my computer, and my phone, and my other computer, and..., so I&#x27;m heeding their call to build a cloud-based version of TagTime. It pings the user via various channels (SMS, Web Push, Slack, etc.) and feeds their responses into Beeminder, Toggl, and IFTTT.<p>I&#x27;d love to add TimeTagger to the list of supported integrations, since the demo app looks really compelling for the way I think about tracking time.')
