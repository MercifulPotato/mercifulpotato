It&#x27;s not even temporally consistent, as you have prior versions of applications with features removed.<p>You can carry a laptop in your pocket. Sony VAIO had a mini edition around 2007. You can also use a bag, which has big pockets, and you can connect to networks and even cell networks.<p>Point is -- your argument here is very weak that the two platforms aren&#x27;t substitutable, and there really is nothing left to say. Have a pleasant evening or morning, as the case may be.')
