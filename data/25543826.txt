I just wanted to share my iTunes library with my daughter. I have an MBP and she has an iPhone, should be easy right? Nope - since we don&#x27;t pay the monthly feudal tax for Music, I had to fish out an obscure &quot;sign in&quot; in Settings -&gt; Music, literally the last option on screen. Why do I have to sign in with <i>my</i> Apple ID on <i>her</i> phone, despite her account being defined in my Family already, just to share a few files? The only logical answer is &quot;because you really should pay the monthly submission fee to Lord Apple&quot;. And of course I expect this will stop working as soon as she steps out of the house.<p>Honestly, it didn&#x27;t use to be like this. Hey Tim, you should at least <i>pretend</i> you&#x27;re caring about something more than your profit margins.')
