Awhile back I tried to reason out how fast we&#x27;d get in orbital trouble if we started ejecting all of our garbage into the sun, just an academic exercise.  Rough estimate by an established astronomer [1] was that we&#x27;re safe in the 0.95 AU - 1.69 AU range, so our orbit could vary from -7.25 mil km to +54.7 mil. km and we&#x27;d stay within the habitable zone.  After that I plugged known values into an orbital simulator [2] and eyeballed how much mass loss that&#x27;d have to be and how long it would take.<p><pre><code>    5,973,600,000,000,000,000,000,000 (kg) mass of the earth\n          597,360,000,000,000,000,000 (kg) we&#x27;re in slight trouble at 0.0001 loss\n                           50,000,000 (kg) per year normal loss to space\n                      126,642,989,704 (kg) garbage landfilled per year\n                      242,944,073,372 (kg) handled total per year\n    World est:      2,010,000,000,000 (kg) per year (300 mil years!)\n\n</code></pre>\nAnother astronomer on mass: &quot;If the force of gravity was halved, [Earth&#x27;s] speed would be exactly the escape speed.
