If you already are well-established socially somewhere, you usually tend to self-select into establishments that kind of cater to those established friend groups.<p>For recent transplants they roam bars until they find one with more singles and folks looking for social interaction.  They do exist, but are probably more rare.<p>My theory of course is that the latter type of bar morphs over time (decade+) into the prior type of bar as &quot;friend groups&quot; get established at the new place.  The new place slowly turns into the old hangout spot.')
