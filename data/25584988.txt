Item(by='Swizec', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609356074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25584886, text='Yeah this only works if you have <i>your person</i> not &quot;some person&quot;. A fantastic example recently:<p>Some newsletter sent a book recommendation list. Instead of clicking links, finding the right format, and dealing with all that, I just slacked my assistant &quot;Hey can you get me all the books from X newsletter on audiobook&quot;. Feels silly to delegate, instead of a task I put off and think about and finally waste time on eventually, it&#x27;s a 5 second thing and I can move on right away.<p>The &quot;not have to think about it&quot; part is the bigger benefit imo.')
