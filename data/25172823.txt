Are they okay with that? can they actually do something about the pages&#x2F;runbooks? (in many organizations it&#x27;s not that simple).<p>What&#x27;s the average tenure in tech? Something like a year  (you can surely imagine that it gets shorter with bad oncall). You&#x27;re constantly having new joiners (and leavers). It&#x27;s not as simple as there being 6 people at the ready at all times.<p>Practically the team starts from zero and have to ramp up to 6 members, how easy is it to recruit 6 dev&#x2F;ops&#x2F;sre? It&#x27;s not that easy and it takes a lot of time and they leave. Outside of a few large organization, teams&#x2F;department might never reach the size where on call is bearable.')
