Iron needs both oxygen and water to rust, so you can store it in a warehouse with just some climate control to manage the humidity.  You could treat it like any other flammable powder, where you keep dust down as much as possible, and keep flame sources away.<p>Fine steel wool will burn readily, yet it keeps underneath the sink and only rusts over a period of years.')
