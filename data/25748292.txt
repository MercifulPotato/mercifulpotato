Using shady business practices and their enormous wealth to kludge any person who could even attempt to compete.<p>Examples include: Cyrix, the 80386 branding (IE, trademarking &quot;Pentium&quot; so that they could force processor companies to be unable to claim &quot;Pentium-compatible&quot; after failing to trademark their CPU model numbers), crippling their compiler on AMD platforms (checking CPU version strings to enable CPU acceleration for things like AVX instead of checking CPUID like it should) and even going so far as to set embargos on their new CPUs until the day of large competitor product announcemnets to drown out the news or make the new products seem potentially uncompetitive and that consumers should wait for intel (more info here; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.overclock.net&#x2F;threads&#x2F;intel%E2%80%99s-behavior-is-pathetic-%E2%80%93-core-i9-10980xe-review.1737224&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.overclock.net&#x2F;threads&#x2F;intel%E2%80%99s-behavior-i...</a> )<p>Hell, they even changed the way they market TDP to be the &quot;average&quot; not the max load.<p>2) Resting on their laurals.<p>CPUs have stagnated in the desktop&#x2F;laptop market for 10 years, meanwhile phones have caught up and even in some cases exceeded the performance of desktop&#x2F;laptop CPUs, to the point where people are looking at Apples M1 as a revolution.<p>3) Aggressively segmenting the market, steering it towards bad ideas.<p>16 PCI lanes and lack of ECC memory are just a few things that are terrible about intel CPUs in the consumer market.<p>Those are not enthusiast requirements, those benefit everyone.')
