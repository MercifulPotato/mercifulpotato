Even for a trip, I avoid charging above 90% because regenerative braking stops working when the battery is nearly full, which results in a substantial change to the way the car handles. You get used to one pedal driving and rarely having to use the brakes, so it&#x27;s very unnerving for the car to not slow down rapidly when you let up on the accelerator pedal.')
