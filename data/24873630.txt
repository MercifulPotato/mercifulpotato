Think of it as a graph.<p>Could you elaborate a little on what you mean by this? bash already has the ability to redirect STDERR and STDOUT independently, and when you introduce named pipes into the mix things can get <i>really</i> fancy (probably <i>too</i> fancy, this is about where your script stops being a script and starts being a program written in perhaps the most inconvenient language available.)')
