Sorry for the exaggerated rhetoric, it wasn&#x27;t needed and may not have been correctly aimed (at you).<p>But, to your points, there are historical forces that bring people good&#x2F;bad fortune - including racism in America. How do you decide which ones are worthy of ex post facto adjustment on a society-wide level? How do you balance and justify that to the orthogonal part of your population; the part that had no role in the history but would still be impacted by the expenditure of communal resources? Keeping in mind here, the wider the net you cast for who need adjustment, the bigger the impact on the orthogonal population.')
