Item(by='geophile', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607800472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400273, text='About powershell&#x27;s verbosity: My pandemic project is yet another pipe-objects-instead-of-strings shell, marcel: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marceltheshell.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marceltheshell.org</a>. It&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; is Linux, not Windows.<p>Marcel is also somewhat verbose. It exposes Python functions on the command line, so when you need to write such a function, it starts getting long. E.g. if you want to sort files by last time modified:<p><pre><code>    ls | sort (f: f.mtime)\n</code></pre>\nThere are abstraction mechanisms to help deal with this. E.g. this defines a command to sort piped-in files by time.<p><pre><code>    bytime = [sort (f: f.mtime)]\n</code></pre>\nSo you can then do this:<p><pre><code>    ls | bytime\n</code></pre>\nStill kind of wordy. I&#x27;m thinking about a way of having flags expand to filters. That would get things as compact as bash.')
