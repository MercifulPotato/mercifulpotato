On the newer models a special led light on the top would indicate if the calculator is in this mode. You can disable this mode only by plugging in a usb cable and connect it to a pc or other calculator.<p>On all dutch state exams they simply checked this light on my calculator. But a friend of mine showed me already that there exsics special firmware that can fake this light so yhea 100% security will never exist.')
