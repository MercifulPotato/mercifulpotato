It wouldn&#x27;t make sense in an immutable language, anyway, because identity only matters if object state can change - otherwise any two objects with identical state are substitutable. But anyway, I would argue that this is the crucial difference that sets apart &quot;objects&quot; and &quot;values with syntactic sugar for function calls&quot;.')
