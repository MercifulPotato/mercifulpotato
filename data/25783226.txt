Whenever a fad needs to be combined with a well-known active ingredient in order to be effective, it makes me suspicious that the fad isn&#x27;t effective at all.<p>The constantly receding goalposts are another sign. With nofap, first it was &quot;before an athletic competition,&quot; then it was &quot;for a week,&quot; then it was &quot;for a month,&quot; and now that a significant number of people have given that a try it&#x27;s multiple months? Not a good look.<p>By this point I&#x27;ve gone from 30% to 90% sure this whole thing is just christian sex angst rebranded for the web.')
