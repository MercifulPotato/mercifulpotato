After using it with almost every web I&#x27;ve developed since 2015 I think they delivered on what it promised to do. It&#x27;s not a 100% quality of life improvement since certain things take a bit longer to do vs not using Docker (starting containers have a penalty, installing a new package dependency takes a long time to build since layers aren&#x27;t diffed for changes, etc.). But overall I&#x27;ve found it very much worth using.')
