In the end, it all became very clear. My mindset from &quot;these guys have no idea&quot; shifted towards &quot;wow, they are smart, I didn&#x27;t get this part&quot;.<p>Basically, they were acquiring customers faster than anyone could follow. Our development goal was &quot;fast and opportunistic&quot;. As you can expect, the product was full of bugs, and customer support had their hands full. It was a shitty product with a lot of customers.<p>I didn&#x27;t see how this would ever turn into a success story. We were digging a grave. But I didn&#x27;t realize 1 thing: we were not selling a product, we were selling the company.<p>In the end, a huge Canadian competitor wanted a foothold in the European market, and so they bought us (and our customers). They were going to introduce their own product to the customers, and so our product was thrown in the wastebasket.<p>In the end, it all ended as planned, and the founders walked away with a lot of money. Basically they built a customer base in EU, and sold that one to another company. Big eye opener for me.<p>Looking back, it is also very interesting to see how they positioned their company within that market, to be acquired.')
