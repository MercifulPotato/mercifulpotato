And finally respecting them. It&#x27;s a trope I&#x27;m sure there was a lot of truth to. A lieutenant in WWI had it a bit better than a private, but not that much better (he might even have had a higher chance of death). He still had to live in the same hole in the ground. Classes which were entirely separated were brought together (as JFK must have been). Social media is not like that. There&#x27;s nothing shared about it, nothing we go through together that could generate a fellow feeling.')
