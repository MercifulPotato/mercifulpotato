In vim, I&#x27;m slowed down by the fear &quot;not to mess up&quot;, since I have to switch to normal mode to edit before switching back to editing mode and continue to type. Or, for instance, in languages without a function composition operator (or pipes), typing out nested functions in order of application (which is not left-to-right) requires A LOT of switching between editing and normal modes just to complete the thought.<p>I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out how others find this desirable.')
