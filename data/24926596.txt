By &quot;better C&quot; i meant using <i>a</i> &quot;safe subset&quot; of the language without going crazy with all its features which is what i see happening often. Having used C++ since the early 90&#x27;s i have seen too much incomprehensible and unmaintainable code just because the programmers had learnt a &quot;shiny new technique&quot; from some book and understood it as <i>everything must be done that way</i>(i must admit i too had fallen prey to this disease for a while :-) Thus for example, i have seen code with needlessly deep class hierarchies, design patterns madness, no free standing functions(everything had to be in a class!), complete ban on macros, template and metaprogramming incomprehensibility etc. C++ is powerful but that must be wielded judiciously and responsibly by the programmer which is only feasible with experience and maturity. Thus it is better to err on the side of caution and restrict usage to a well-defined subset of language features.')
