They don&#x27;t seem to understand that if TwitFace were liable for the crap their users posted, they&#x27;d start moderating <i>way</i> harder. No more anonymity, ability to serve libel lawsuits to any user, hours-long moderation queues to control the crap. It could mean the end of honest online reviews (whatever&#x27;s left of them).<p>And if they try to condition Section 230 liability protections on &quot;neutrality&quot;, it&#x27;ll get shot down in court really fast because forcing any point of view even &quot;neutrality&quot; (whatever that means) is an infringement on free speech. And if viewpoint &quot;neutrality&quot; does become enshrined in the law, every single message board, social media site, or other discussion platform will either shut down (because it&#x27;s not profitable or worth the hassle) or turn into a hellscape of spam, porn, and trolls. Any legal content, no matter how off-topic, disruptive, flame-baity, troll-y, insulting or whatever, will have to be allowed. Otherwise you aren&#x27;t &quot;neutral&quot; anymore, right?<p>Of course, IANAL or a fortune teller, so I may be completely wrong about this.')
