Its something we almost dont use. Who needs clothes ? Or books ? nobody of course<p>Thing is, everything is essential... if my water glasses break, it will be essential for me because i will need new ones.<p>I think its not fair to judge something is not essential just because me (or you) already have.<p>For example if somebody needs to move to a new house, the new house might be empty and at that moment everything is essential.. it will need water glasses, plates, etc..<p>The only essential thing it seems is to transmit the covid drama over television. And accept gov orders (or that &quot;science&quot;) about what is considered essential or not. With that, its essential to punish the entreprenour. Entreprenour is that guy that built a company where me, you, your family work and feed from. When the entreprenour is screwed, the employees get screwed also because they will not be able to work... that will affect their families also because somebody lost a job and income. And not least important are the clients who might need something essential from that entreprenour store that was forced to close.')
