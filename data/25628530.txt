Everybody I know at work uses it, and for a couple years there Hackernews made a collective O-face every time a new version dropped from Microsoft. So it <i>must</i> be good, right? Well, it was different enough from Emacs to force me to get used to an entirely different workflow, but not enough <i>better</i> than Emacs (really, for my purposes, not better at all) to justify making that enormous transition. So back to Emacs I trudge. A reasonable person may make the same call about transitioning from Visual Studio Code to Emacs when they hear advocacy from Emacs users like me.<p>That&#x27;s where Clojure is for me -- in this limbo of it sounds good but it&#x27;s not really worth it for me, personally, to switch. Plus its community has a strong contingent of douchey advocates -- not quite at the level of say, Rust or Newlisp but getting up there -- who act like Rich Hickey was God&#x27;s gift to programming and make me think &quot;So that&#x27;s what Smug Lisp Weenies sound like to the rest of the world.&quot; And that further cements me in the realm of &quot;hard pass&quot; w.r.t. Clojure. Call it an irrational, emotion-based response.')
