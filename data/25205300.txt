When they are not farming, they could develop written language to record their history and debts. Surely if you checked back in tens of thousands of years you would find advanced cities and societies as complex as human ones, except entirely underwater with occasional structures breaking above the surface.<p>Other creatures like chimpanzees could be taught how to work with humans as a cheap form of labor, digging ditches or mining resources.')
