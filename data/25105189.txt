Until the most recent update (10?), I could swipe down from top of screen and I&#x27;d get three rows of icons. I&#x27;d hit Aeroplane mode, which was in its default position (on my device at least) in the third &amp; bottom row in the centre.<p>After the update, they reduced the size of the icon grid to only two rows. To get to the Aeroplane Mode icon, I suddenly had to do an additional swipe to the side to get to the next screen.<p>You can re-arrange the icons on this panel, which I did, but even now a month or two after I still occasionally reflexively reach for the old position. Less and less, of course, but still, the whole thing was annoying.<p>Not a huge deal, but I feel like this process happens to me in almost every Google application. Not just Google, of course - I see this more and more in a lot of software - the value of learned behaviour is not accorded the priority I think it needs.')
