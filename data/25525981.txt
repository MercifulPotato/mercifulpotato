My understanding is the event loop would do async tasks in the thread&#x27;s quiet times, and put those tasks to sleep while it&#x27;s waiting for io and other things, meaning the thread isn&#x27;t blocked. Comparing that to (my understanding of) threads, while you&#x27;re not blocking the main thread, you&#x27;re still blocking the spawned threads while waiting for io.<p>Isn&#x27;t this thread blocking something you would want to avoid if you can regardless of whether or not you have additional threads to play with?')
