We all think we will act to save our lives, acting rationally, but apparently there&#x27;s many people that just freeze in shock, unable to move or do anything even when their lives depend on it.<p>Think I first saw this in a sunken ferry disaster movie, based on real events, where the family says to the son something like &quot;You go, boy&quot;, while they stayed to drown with the ship. Really scary.')
