Have maxed out on all pills. Very soon will be put on insulin. Did lot of running for a decade or more. Diet control is my weak point and toughest to be disciplined about. Not that I gorge on sweets&#x2F;candies - but rice, fried food is something I cannot do a clean breakup with. But as and when I can - do regular exercise (running) and diet control. Very difficult for me personally. Hope once I am on insulin - I can still lead reasonable decent life past 80. Not sure if I know anyone who had diabetes in their 30s and lived past 80s with reasonably good health. :-)')
