That way, you&#x27;d reduce performance of some flows, but perhaps that&#x27;s a small enough proportion of flows that it doesn&#x27;t matter?<p>The state you keep per flow also only needs to be the length of the longest pattern, so if your patterns are short (eg. banning rude words, &lt;script&gt; tags, etc.), it isn&#x27;t much state at all...  I would assume in most cases it&#x27;s just a few bytes.')
