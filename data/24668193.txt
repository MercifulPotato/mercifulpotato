Whenever I was haggled in price for something it was an Indian. If I’m getting spam phone calls it’s the Indian on the other end. Do the most likely people that can bother doing this for a t-shirt are probably Indians. And look, there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a part of the culture and the only way prosper in that society. It’s a shame that the West is too politically correct and DigitalOcean can’t say that they won’t ship t-shirts to India and eliminate the issue.')
