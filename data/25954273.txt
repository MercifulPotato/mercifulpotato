Time will tell if RH actually did anything illegal. If they didn&#x27;t, then your previous Twitter logic should hold....i.e. &quot;they&#x27;re a private business and they can do whatever they want&quot;....right?<p>I think what&#x27;s ACTUALLY going on (whether your cognitive dissonance will allow you to perceive this comment or not), is that since this doesn&#x27;t cut across political lines, <i>you</i> want to treat the situation differently.')
