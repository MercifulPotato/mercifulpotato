I was an early fan of Walter Carlos with his &#x27;Switched on Bach&#x27; series of albums. I had about 4 or 5 of his LPs that I bought in the 1970s.<p>But then he disappeared, so to speak. The only person I could find was Wendy Carlos. Was that his sister, or maybe his wife? Or maybe no connection? Don&#x27;t forget, this was pre-Internet and pre-WWW, when information was a lot harder to find.<p>I finally discovered the truth and was able to continue getting her music.<p>PS. The soundtrack from &#x27;A Clockwork Orange&#x27; is probably my favorite.')
