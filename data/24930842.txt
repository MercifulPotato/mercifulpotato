Losing a bit of money is part of the cost of doing business, as long as it&#x27;s lower then taxes, its still a good deal. Also hyping up a neighborhood you have flippable assets in, lends to wanting to overpay to drive pricing up. Your assumption that fraud follows normal logic is flawed. Read a few federal cases about laundering and you&#x27;ll see, many of them ain&#x27;t so bright. And sometimes money needs to be cleaned on a timeline, so overpaying is again, just another cost. Dangerous people like to be paid on time too, so you flip what you can in the time you have.<p>Source: I know someone who, along with their family, was prosecuted for it on a very large scale.')
