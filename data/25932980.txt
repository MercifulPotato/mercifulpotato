It&#x27;s nowhere near as bad for you as it&#x27;s been made out to be, but it&#x27;s still bad for you.<p>Music is the worst in my opinion. Most of the most popular music is full of terrible lyrics which only promote bad things and rarely ever promote good things. Constant misogyny, hypersexuality, etc. A large part of pop music is selling &quot;sexy&quot; older boy bands to preteen girls (which is super creepy).<p>And kids are addicted to this stuff like crazy. I&#x27;ve seen 8 year old kids throw tantrums because someone told them they can&#x27;t listen to this garbage pop music while doing homework.<p>It&#x27;s not good for small kids to be exposed to sexuality the way pop music does it. And that&#x27;s super obvious. If thinking that makes me a Puritan, then so be it.')
