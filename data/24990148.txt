I think when I was younger I just saw something fun and exciting and went for it.  As the years have gone by, the sheer number of things that I have identified as fun as exciting has become so overwhelming that &quot;fun and exciting&quot; seems utterly unhelpful for narrowing down the possibilities.<p>I can also look back now and see how many things that I was sure I would do in my life haven&#x27;t happened yet.
