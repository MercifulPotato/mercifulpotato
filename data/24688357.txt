Often, when working, you end up with multiple commits which represent a single change:<p><pre><code>    remove debug logging and fix bug\n    more logging\n    debugging\n    typo\n\n</code></pre>\nSquashing these commits together into one coherent change makes for a history that is much easier to understand.<p>Squashing unrelated commits, however, doesn&#x27;t help anyone.<p>(I prefer the --first-parent approach: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180710234754&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davidchudzicki.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;first-parent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20180710234754&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davidc...</a>)')
