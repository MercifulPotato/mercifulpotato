It has been needed for a long time.<p>All it will take is a stronger, more popular leader who feels &#x27;bypassing the rules&#x27; is ok for &#x27;the greater good&#x27; (aka themselves), and we&#x27;re in deep trouble.<p>If Trump hadn&#x27;t spent all 4 years of his tenure actively disparaging, impugning, maligning, and throwing under the bus every military leader or hero he ran across, we could be in a very, very different country today. I&#x27;m still amazed how close he came to winning Arizona considering what he said and did to McCain.')
