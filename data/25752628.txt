I do. Maybe you think no other administration would have had multiple briefings from law enforcement by now. I don&#x27;t.<p>I do not. I would expect that in any terrorist incident, like 9&#x2F;11 or others, that the President would be orchestrating a response. Clearly the President has been implicated in these things so that&#x27;s not going to happen. You have Congress preparing impeachment documents and the FBI has responded to journalists, many of which created immediately hostile narratives about law enforcement. I do not know what else you&#x27;re expecting them to do at this point.<p>If I were the FBI I would not be saying anything either. I&#x27;d have agents out in the field collecting evidence and arresting people, getting the story and having them turn in their coconspirators. If you make some sort of statement it prompts them to destroy evidence.')
