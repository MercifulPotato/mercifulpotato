Clearly the author believes that Facebook are looking for programmers who fit a very specific mould, to the point that they&#x27;re willing to go out <i>in public</i> and state exactly that. I&#x27;d argue that points to a massive monoculture problem at Facebook, but I&#x27;m massively anti-Facebook so I&#x27;m biased.<p>Secondly, the author believes that senior developers, who likely have 10+ years under their belt if they&#x27;re senior, need to spend a solid month revising in order to be successful landing a role there. Maybe that&#x27;s worthwhile as FB pay well, but that&#x27;s a hell of a time investment if you&#x27;re not planning to stay at FB for a long time. That would certainly make me think twice if I was going to apply.')
