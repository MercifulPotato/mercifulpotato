Item(by='mattmanser', descendants=None, kids=[25216285], score=None, time=1606342070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25214395, text='I&#x27;ve worked on these sort of problems, and I can guess why.<p>What happens is that a new field gets added, and whoever&#x27;s adding it claims it&#x27;s really &quot;important&quot; and needs to be seen by everyone. It&#x27;ll invariably set as mandatory to be filled in too.<p>2 years later and some integration breaks because the integration doesn&#x27;t set that field and you end up looking at that really important field and every single project has it set to exactly the same value.<p>Repeat ad nauseum.<p>The other thing I&#x27;ve seen a few times is when assessments or a bonus depends on some field so they make it visible to everyone. Then the bonus scheme changes, but they never hide the fields that no-one cares about any more.')
