These often also have two-day settlement but seem less dysfunctional.  So I’m not convinced that the T+2 settlement is the problem per se. To the contrary, T+2 settlement gives people a chance to correct errors, if any, before anyone takes the money and runs.<p>I can imagine a two-day settlement system that works better. Specifically, all parties would need to post cash with the clearinghouse before buying and to post stock before selling. Customer funds would be expected to be used for this purpose — no broker should ever go bust because their customers bought stock too fast. And, critically, unsettled receipts would be valid collateral, possibly with a small haircut. So, if you sell one stock, you can immediate use (most of) the proceeds to buy something else without needing to come up with additional collateral.<p>In effect, this would be immediate settlement plus two-day escrow.')
