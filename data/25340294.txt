This was a payment to get ATG off Uber&#x27;s books, and given how much money ATG loses sounds like it was basically a &quot;we&#x27;ll pay for a year or so worth of expenses&quot; kind of deal.<p>My biggest question about this deal is that is combining a 600 person company with a 1200 person company (obviously many&#x2F;most of those people will not be sticking around). Those types of large technology merges are extremely challenging in the best of times, but I&#x27;m curious how it will work out in an era where so many people are teleworking (but I don&#x27;t know, could even be better, as there is less opportunity for offhand office gossip).')
