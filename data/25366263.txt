It is more intense every time.<p>However, it seems to fall on deaf ears. Everyone I know is planning to travel or gather for the holidays. There are already social gatherings, at the office or among friends. The weekly markets are as packed as ever (though Christmas markets are not allowed). No one cares beyond wearing a mask, and even that is too much for a small percentage of the population.<p>I try to hold my judgement, because this crisis has mostly spared me. However, the fact is that no one seems to care anymore. If the situation is critical now, I expect it to be completely out of control in January.<p>I am not the paragon of compliance, yet I feel like I&#x27;m crazy for staying at home and only seeing one or two people a week.')
