There are plenty of other possibilities. It is also possible that the company will suffer reduced profits. Indeed, if the marketplace truly is competitive, the employer takes the price the marketplace offers. The employer can’t simply arbitrarily set prices any more than a corn farmer can show up at the grain elevator and demand a price for his corn. Economists like to talk about the invisible hand of the free market setting prices, but somehow when the minimum wage is being debated many economists toss the invisible hand into the trash heap and start saying that businesses can set whatever price they want and for some reason the market will simply bear it.<p>I’m not saying minimum wage laws are a good idea, but economists have no credibility when they won’t even allow for the possibility that wage laws might reduce corporate profits rather than leading to increased prices.')
