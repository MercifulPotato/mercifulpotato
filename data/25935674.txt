Citron Research and Muddy Waters and these others post, places like CNBC re-tweet, Bloomberg mentions it, etc.  And that has a predictable effect, or an effect that&#x27;s a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the David and Goliath story that played out here (if it is even really that) is that of longs banding together against shorts with greater aggregate cash and causing the squeeze, but rather a social platform having more social influence of information transfer than the traditional short broadcast mediums, and causing the squeeze.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s the interesting story here of 2021 that makes it a unique twist.  A &#x27;democratized&#x27; medium of information exchange causing random people to organize in new ways.')
