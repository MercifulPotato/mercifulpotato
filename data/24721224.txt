I had been out of the PC Gaming world for a while, so I watched some youtubers to see what I should buy. Ryzen first gen had just come out, and Linus Tech Tips was pretty pro AMD. Seemed pretty optimistic.<p>I bought a Ryzen 1700, and checked the AMD stock price. It was ~$10.<p>I told all my friends to buy AMD stock.<p>I had never purchased stocks before, but I was pretty sure that AMD was going to go up. I bought $500 worth of AMD stock at $12. (it took a few months for me to get around to buying it)<p>As 2018 went on, financial market started to pay attention to AMD. People were calling it a buy at ~30$.<p>I was pretty sure that everyone else had missed the boat and that I was in the money solely because of Linus Tech Tips.<p>Now here we are, AMD at $85. Thanks Linus.')
