The only ones benefiting are the companies that sponsor H1B visas by suppressing wages for everyone.<p>I just hope the new administration don&#x27;t role back these changes. Typically when a new administration comes in they have a &quot;throwing the baby with the bath water&quot; mentality. I hope they realize the things that the previous administration did which makes sense and keeps them')
