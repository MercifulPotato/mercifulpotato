We ban accounts that do that, because it destroys the curious conversation that this site exists for.<p>When I looked back through your account history trying to find examples of using the site as intended, rather than political flamewar, I ran across <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25626137" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25626137</a> instead. That&#x27;s not a political flamewar comment, but it still breaks the site guidelines badly. I&#x27;ve banned this account until we get some indication that you want to use HN as intended. If you do, you&#x27;re welcome to email hn@ycombinator.com and give us some reason to believe it.')
