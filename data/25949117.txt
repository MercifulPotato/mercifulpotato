Nothing explicitly prevents these abuses. This is an intentional design. Does the right to E2E exist in this resolution? It doesn&#x27;t, so please don&#x27;t assume they won&#x27;t use a roundabout way to remove this human right.<p>Please don&#x27;t ignore abuses of governmental power, they weld their power with little recourse. Let&#x27;s not be quick to encourage their poor legislation.')
