Thank you. - I had some contact with Scheme twenty years ago, while working through SICP. As I recently made a deep dive into Emacs and Emacs Lisp, I started looking into Common Lisp as well. - I absolutely love programming in Lisp. And like you, Scheme‘s clean naming convention (`set!` for destructive operations, `foo-&gt;bar` for conversions and `string?`) were something I missed in other languages in the years to come (when I started learning Python was irritated that `data.sort()` was a destructive operation). Scheme‘s spec is so short, I could keep it all in my head.<p>Lambda calculus, list manipulation, list operations, closures, these are concepts I learned twenty years ago learning Scheme, and I‘ve seen these concepts slowly be adopted in other popular languages decades later.<p>Thank you for catching my interest in Scheme again! Will look into that in more detail. Was an old love of mine anyway. :)')
