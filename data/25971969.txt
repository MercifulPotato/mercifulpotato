Compare to “10x binoculars”.<p>But even to the point of the post, this seems to imply that some developers are not as productive as others because they eat, sleep, and play xbox. You just have to stop doing this and you’d be super productive!<p>This seems very silly and dangerous idea. A person can only spend a few hours a day doing “hard thinking”. Striving to always be maximally productive, day after day, will only lead to burnout.')
