I remember that a lot of people in the last 50 years or so have been trying to apply permaculture principles on forestry (like the Fukuoka food forest).<p>As for the carbon stability, the forest renews itself, so if you plant trees in an area where there were none before, the carbon captured the forest itself is pretty permanent. If you want to further capture carbon, you can always cut the trees and use them for timber, and eventually pyrolyse the wood to prevent decomposition and put it in the ground (which can increase soil quality).')
