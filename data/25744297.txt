I know this can all vary over time, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s any systematic tendencies here, especially pertaining to index options.<p>2) Do you think gamma hedging drives a significant percent of volume in index futures (say 5% or more), or is it just a trivial %?<p>3) What would be a good way to estimate&#x2F;approximate the gamma exposure of options market makers if we wanted to predict gamma squeezes, and we&#x27;ve only got public market data (e.g. trades and open interest)? SqueezeMetrics advocates using open interest but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a better way to do this.<p>4) Compared to delta &amp; gamma hedging, do any of the other greeks (e.g. vanna) drive a significant percentage of volume in in the underlying in certain contexts, or are they mostly a side show?')
