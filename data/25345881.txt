Since bugs will probably be caught in CentOS and don&#x27;t end up in RHEL. This front runner role was actually intended for Fedora however Fedora contains way too much experimental changes for anyone to seriously try to run it on servers.<p>I don&#x27;t want to sound too &quot;tin-foil headed&quot; but I guess now that RedHat has hired the main CentOS dev(s?) this change comes from RedHat. I can&#x27;t imagine the CentOS user base wants this direction for the CentOS project (or maybe thats just my lack of imagination...). People who use CentOS want a boring Linux distro like RHEL. They just don&#x27;t want to pay for RHEL subscriptions.')
