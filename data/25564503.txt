You have to round up, always.<p>The Android 9 countdown works intuitively, it takes a second to decrement from 5 to 4 and sounds the alarm exactly at 0.  You can&#x27;t pause it at zero...<p>&gt; Which is not to call apple&#x27;s timer nonsensical.<p>It pretty much is, since the last &#x27;second&#x27; takes more than a second to elapse.')
