One night I just decided to take the plunge.<p>It was &#x27;fine&#x27;. But nothing is really incentivizing me to have it regularly. I kind of want to be mislead -- don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s a plant-based burger. If the studies are consistent, I&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s fine.<p>McDonalds finally taking the plunge into this is big for markets as is anything they get into. I suspect that they finally see the numbers working as far as consumer-readiness and competitors all selling them now also. So that indicates it must be working somewhat at the other places like Burger King etc. Has anyone you know said they eat plant burgers regularly tho - other than veggie&#x2F;vegan friends??<p>Maybe McNatural would be a better name, less focused on the Plant aspect which I agree will turn ppl away.')
