Item(by='titzer', descendants=None, kids=[25193233], score=None, time=1606173057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25191871, text='&gt; Ten subjects were included in the final analysis.<p>...<i>in the final analysis</i><p>... And how many subjects were <i>not</i> included in the final analysis?<p>10 is tiny in any case. This is noise. Ignore.<p>edit: Thankfully the article does actually include enough information to figure this out. 69 subjects screened, 12 took part. Two dropped out, 1 because of scheduling conflicts, 1 because their migraines went away). I also disagree with their experimental methodology. All 10 were given the placebo on the same day, and then two weeks later all 10 were given the psilocybin on the same day. As this was a local study (all participants in the same town), something as simple as <i>the weather changed</i> could explain the difference.<p>I now will double-plus ignore this study.')
