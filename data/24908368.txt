It really depends on whether your current and near-future tax rate is less than your tax rate in retirement. Consider that politically, taxes may be lower now than they will be in 30 years. Your tax rate typically increases as you progress in an industry.<p>In my case, I max out a 401k that is split 2&#x2F;3 Roth, 1&#x2F;3 Traditional. I also max out a Roth IRA every year. Additionally, I&#x27;m stuffing all excess cash in a taxable brokerage account. The taxable account is growing faster than the Roth IRA because I&#x27;m limiting discretionary spending and buying equities whenever I have extra cash.<p>I expect my tax rate to be <i>higher</i> in retirement since I&#x27;m saving like crazy as a 25 year old (and have been for years already) and expect to continue to do so for decades.<p>(I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised if some politicians decide to bludgeon me for being a responsible saver by voiding the tax-free withdrawals of Roths in the future. But that&#x27;s a bit paranoid and hopefully won&#x27;t happen.)')
