Basically, it just compounds the existing problem of AB5 being totally capricious by making it hard to streamline and fix long-term now that there&#x27;s a Proposition-locked special exemption.<p>IOW, the only thing worse than the legislature making arbitrary carveouts, is carveouts being claimed by anyone who can fund a prop campaign. At least with the former, there can be a compromise later that rationalizes the whole system; but post-prop 22, everyone will also have to work around Uber&#x27;s carveout.<p>[0] Though I don&#x27;t live there anymore FWIW.')
