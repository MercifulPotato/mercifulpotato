Parler, like all right-wing sites before it, is already on the fast path to becoming a nazi shithole.  In a few months, when everyone who never really left FB and Twitter is back, I predict that we will add this site to the list of failed attempts by right-wing pseudo-intellectuals to try to thread the needle in the ever shrinking space between Republican talking points and National Socialist rhetoric.  The problem with building a site for angry ignorant polemicists is that after a short while they will get bored with talking to themselves and while Fox News personalities can make a living selling herbal ED treatments and scam gold schemes there is not a lot of commercial upside for a place like Parler.  Their userbase will peak within six months when the first Trump is indicted and will have dropped 75% by the time the first is convicted.')
