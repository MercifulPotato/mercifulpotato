A better comparison would be to dwm, bluewm, tinywm, lainwm or any of the smaller code-base projects.<p>From a philosophical standpoint, xwm is written using the XCB protocol while the other two are written using Xlib. The &quot;X New Developer&#x27;s Guide&quot; is a good reference to understand the difference: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.x.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;guide&#x2F;xlib-and-xcb&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.x.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;guide&#x2F;xlib-and-xcb&#x2F;</a><p>From a sheer dependency standpoint, xwm has fewer than the rest.  There are obvious drawbacks to this, but I intentionally left xwm as &quot;barebones&quot; as possible, to allow the community to expand, patch, tweak and modify. This is consistent with the Suckless Philosophy of programming (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;suckless.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;suckless.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;</a>), which is based on the Unix Philosophy of programming.<p>Additionally, I have opted not to have a run-time config file. Everyone seems to have a config file these days that is either placed in an obscure directory, &quot;hidden&quot; from plain site or cluttering my home directory.  I hate config files (and they hate me). Not doing so forces the user to glimpse into the source which, to me, is a habit that all existing and new Unix users should be doing.<p>Amongst other things, I provide no out-of-box multi-monitor support, no menu bar, no title bars, no tab focus or or any other feature that a regular user would find essential. Instead, these features will be offered as patches, which the user must learn how to apply themselves.<p>I hope that information helps answer your question a bit. =)')
