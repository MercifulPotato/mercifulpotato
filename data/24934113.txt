GitHub and GitLab both have good implementations as well as every other good code review system I have used. GitHub annoying tries its hardest to hide the &quot;outdated&quot; comments but GitLab has the option to keep them open (they are no longer visible in the code, but remain on the discussion tab)<p>So I appreciate your opinion that it is impossible, but as a reviewer I much prefer when the tool tries.')
