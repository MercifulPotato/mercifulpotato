It blocks third-party JavaScript by default, which is what&#x27;s used to power a lot of these elements.  I don&#x27;t see the big &quot;subscribe me&quot; bar at the bottom, so I assume uMatrix is preventing the JavaScript that creates it from loading.  This will also help with performance on your &quot;ancient workstation&quot;.<p>2)  Reader mode seems to eliminate all of this cruft and give you just the meat of the article to read.')
