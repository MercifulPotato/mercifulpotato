Some people solve problems by copying code and them modifying it, while others try to come up with general solutions to remove duplication. It&#x27;s two different styles, both with their advantages and disadvantages. I think duplicating gets you to an initial prototype more quickly, while general solutions are more maintainable as you only have to fix a bug at one position.')
