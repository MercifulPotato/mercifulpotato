Even two “you” separated by a nanosecond in time are not perfect replicas at all. Why not to allow some impreciseness and teleport “quantumly uncertain” bodies instead of perfect copies? You can’t even know what’s perfect or not by the same principle. Moreover, maybe our structure allows <i>very</i> imperfect copying while retaining the same functionality after few minutes of teleache.')
