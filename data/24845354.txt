It&#x27;s no longer considered &quot;cool&quot; to have servers so we now impose artificial limitations on ourselves to not run any server-side code what-so-ever even when the problem at hand (like managing comments) requires it.<p>It&#x27;s a major technical regression for the sake of hype and being &quot;cool&quot;, potentially fueled by misunderstandings about good old server-side code. &quot;Server&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean underpowered crap on AWS that will bankrupt you if your site is popular - dedicated servers or VPS with unmetered (or at the very least capped) bandwidth still exist and are affordable, and &quot;server-side-code&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean disgusting PHP code that constantly needs patching; use a proper framework and you most likely won&#x27;t have to worry about patching for years.<p>I wish more people would look beyond the hype and actually use the best technology to solve the problem at hand. In this particular case, JAMStack feels like over-engineering for the sake of it that doesn&#x27;t solve any <i>real</i> problems in the majority of cases.')
