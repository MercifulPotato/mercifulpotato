We might also want to keep that (I personally have been using Spotify for over a decade now, and I still think it&#x27;s amazing compared to what we had before).<p>Rather than trying to put the genie back in bottle (which I don&#x27;t see happening), perhaps musicians and songwriters can focus their attention on the practices of the major labels that enable them to extract a huge amount of the revenue the music industry generates, as well as experiment with new income streams (and you still have merch, donations, sponsorships and touring (admittedly difficult right now), avenues that aren&#x27;t all as available to artists working in different mediums).<p>It&#x27;s easier and cheaper, more accessible than ever before to record, mix and put out quality music. Is it harder to make a living off it? Maybe. Would that be solely due to streaming removing income from album sales? Maybe there&#x27;s also more competition over listeners&#x27; dollars these days. And at the end of the day, as a society is the goal to maximize the number of people who can live off their music, or do we have other competing objectives as well?')
