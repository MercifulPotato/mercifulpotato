The detached tone and third person narration canâ€™t hide the fury he felt for the corruption, the hypocrisy, the evil.<p>In a funny way, I always saw a parallel with Terry Pratchett on that front. Though different in nearly every conceivable way, both are capable of writing books that seem to be dripping with anger at the stupidity and evil of man.')
