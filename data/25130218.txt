It compares the levelized cost of electricity from wind and solar generation (using Lazard&#x27;s LCOE numbers) against <i>gas production cost</i> from a shale well. You have to pay for the power plant construction, operation, and maintenance in addition to the fuel in order to get electricity from gas. And the well owner has to charge more than bare costs for the fuel in order to stay in business.')
