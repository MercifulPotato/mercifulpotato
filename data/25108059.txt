A couple of open-source ventilators have been tested on human patients in France (where this project originates from), all during the same very short period, but none were approved by the health authorities.<p>I would have appreciated at the very least a description of the project and how it&#x27;s different from other open-source ventilator projects that can be found on GitHub. Maybe that&#x27;s included in the link you shared in the comments, but reddit&#x27;s not pinterest, personally posts that are basically a baitclick title and a link to &quot;more on this on my website&quot; annoy me because I feel they don&#x27;t enable discussion, they are empty self-promotion.<p>For those who would like to know more on the rush to develop open-source ventilators due to the current pandemic, this research paper could be a good starting point: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f1000research.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;9-218" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f1000research.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;9-218</a>\nI&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t have anything more recent because I&#x27;ve stopped doing a serious watch after May. I have no doubt some of the projects are still moving forward but they have been far less mediatised recently.')
