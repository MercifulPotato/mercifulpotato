The easy of setup and use lines are pure nonsense.  Many Linux distributions have been easier to setup and use since at least the introduction of Ubuntu, and perhaps earlier.  Just pop in the live installation media, try it out for a bit to ensure your hardware is compatible, then run an installation program that asks questions that make sense to people rather than marketers.  Getting the applications you need installed has involved using a store-like interface for longer than software stores have existed on commercial desktop operating systems.<p>So why is it perceived as harder?  One reason: users typically have to install their operating system, while end users rarely see the process on commercial operating systems.  Second reason: those who do install their own OS typically dedicate their system to commercial operating systems, yet use dual-boot for Linux (which will add technical steps).  Third reason: those making the transition may try to install commercial applications via a VM or WINE due to compatibility, familiarity, or (periodically) the lack of an open source alternative.  In other words, it is perceived as harder because people make it harder.<p>As someone who has been using Linux for decades, I find the setup and user friendliness of something like Windows far inferior to to Linux.  Yes, part of that is due to familiarity.  On the other hand, some of it is inherent due to there being fewer restrictions with open source software.')
