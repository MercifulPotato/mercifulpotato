Students may be paying for education, but often the government is also paying for it (consider the cliché that &quot;even full tuition only pays for half of your educational costs at our university.&quot;) This is particularly true at community colleges, where the students are more like the beneficiaries rather than the customers.<p>2. Teaching might sometimes be akin to coaching (or even therapy or parenting), where the instructor is trying to help students improve in ways that they presumably want in the long run but might occasionally vigorously resist in the short term due to the difficulty involved. Ideally a learning or training curve would be perfectly smooth, balanced, and self-motivated, but this isn&#x27;t always the case.<p>3. Possibly contradicting #2, it probably isn&#x27;t possible to teach someone unless that person is, at some level, willing to learn. Which is to say that teachers are like facilitators who help students to succeed at teaching themselves.<p>4. Most university students aren&#x27;t paying out of pocket, nor are their parents; often they are saddled with massive student loans. This means that the loan company may be the paying customer the university is actually catering to, and the student is more like a token that is being passed around.')
