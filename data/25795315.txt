I would like to subscribe to some payment aggregator where they charge me X dollars a month in one transaction, then pays it out to developers&#x2F;service providers. This way things could go down in price too, since the fees would be lower because of less transactions. This way cheaper services like messaging could be 1$ a month without being eaten up by fees.')
