They controlled for these factors in <i>assembling the cohorts</i>.<p>As far as I can tell, they didn&#x27;t control for these factors when slicing the cohorts by disease. They say the following:<p><i>&quot;For analysis of psychiatric sequelae, propensity score matching was directly applied to each cohort pair. For analysis of psychiatric antecedents, given their much larger sample sizes (which exceeded the maximum number of 1·5 million patients possible per matched cohort), cohorts were first stratified by sex and age (18–30 years, 31–45 years, 46–60 years, 61–75 years, and ≥76 years) and propensity score matching (including for age) was achieved within each stratum separately.&quot;</i><p>Propensity score matching is, essentially, regression followed by clustering. I don&#x27;t know if this method of matching will control for age properly in the analysis in question. You would need to see a plot of the age distributions of the data for the groups in question to be sure.')
