We agree. What&#x27;s the fix?<p>--<p>This censorship food fight is at least two problems.<p>#1 Which rule of law applies to international companies?<p>This is foreign policy. Just like trade agreements, treaties.<p>USA flagged corporations like Google, Apple, Facebook need a federal solution. Just like shipping, banking, and so forth. These corporations cannot act unilaterally, nor should they be expected to.<p>I have <i>no idea</i> what an international treaty covering speech and privacy would look like. Please share any and all ideas.<p>#2 Need for fair and impartial court system, legitimate enforcement.<p>FAANGs cannot be governments onto themselves. If my app gets rejected, there must be a separate fair and impartial court system to hear my appeal and adjudicate. If an impersonator takes my profile, I need legitimate enforcement to restore my property rights. If a FAANG closes my accounts, I must have the right to sue for damages.<p>--<p>Again: Enough complaining about unfair, arbitrary behavior. We get it.<p>Start proposing solutions.')
