Lightweight means I can easily craft SQL and quickly map it to types, and things like CRUD on simple entities is very straightforward.  But I generally agree with learning SQL, and avoid mapping it to types if you are just going to pipe into json for the front end.  SQL is good for query and projecting data into new forms, complete waste going through a type if not needed')
