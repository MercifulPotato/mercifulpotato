What finally solved it for me was switching to GNOME (ie. mutter on Wayland) with the PaperWM extension. Fundamentally, I’m running a conventional desktop with no tearing and standard, widely used solutions for keyboard shortcuts, the clipboard, screenshots, and floating windows, so graphical applications look and feel correct even if they are a bad fit for the tiling model. Tiling is then implemented by PaperWM at a higher level, in JavaScript, leaving the complexities of hardware accelerated, animated compositing to GNOME. It’s a good combination – I’d like to see more tiling window managers designed to take advantage of hardware-accelerated compositing.')
