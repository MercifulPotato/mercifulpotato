The bulk of US actions against the Native Americans in the West occurred around ~1870[1]. &quot;Might makes right&quot; is poor justification for those who ostensibly professed ideals from the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the Age of Reason. I think we are right to judge European colonials harshly <i>by their own moral standards</i>.<p>[1] See the book, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;')
