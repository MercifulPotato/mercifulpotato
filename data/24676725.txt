My issues happen with lighter shades.<p>For instance, 00AA00 and 00BB00 are very hard for me. 00CC00 is about when I start feeling confident I could recognize it as green, but it&#x27;s be harder if the surface area was fairly small (for example text). On the red side, the recognition issues also extend to about CC0000.')
