But even to the extent it’s true, if I put in 5k from my checkings into RH and buy stock, why does Rh need all this liquidity to get orders filled? I understand turning margin accounts off, but that’s it . Past that, at best robinhoods business model is highly flawed , at worst it’s fraudulent. Because ultimately, all the finance whiz bang talk doesn’t change common sense that only allowing trades in one direction is unfair, and is incredibly bad optics when that direct benefits a huge player filled with conflicts of interest. But honestly I think the “robinhood is committing fraud” is being underweighted amongst “serious “ discussion.')
