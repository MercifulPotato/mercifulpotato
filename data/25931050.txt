Retail investors are well within their rights to drive up a stock to what could be above fair market value....some may well lose money in doing so. The whole narrative around retail vs. hedge funds&#x2F;wall street is naive to say the least...people in financial services are worried that retail investors may lose a lot of money here which may dent confidence in the market.<p>The irony here is that you believe the market is a mockery which most of the time it isnt but at times it can be irrational. This is clearly one of those times....as an investment professional.....I look at this and see the irrationality of the price which is not underpinned by cash flow or a fair valuation close to the price...which is called fundamental investing and not trading like what is happening here.')
