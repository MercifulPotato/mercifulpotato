My point is that both humans and machines face the same issues. At least with a machine you get a consistent errors (that does not cost you time), which you can decrease with time.<p>With humans you must make sure that the same human with the same skill set who knows stats at Master Level, will always be there for your specific data and actually have the time to do the experiments.<p>Also, I think that 95% of the users&#x2F;consumers of machine learning are non consumers - I.e. they do not have ANY access to  any machine learning tech, and thus need to revert to guessing.<p>So the ethical thing to do is actually give them some tool even if it might not be optimal.')
