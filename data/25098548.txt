We could use a GPG like system with certificates and expiration. A creditor produces my ciphertext signed before a revocation, or they can&#x27;t even file it against my credit, which will take the same for verification to mark against my credit, and dismissing such claims by a creditor is trivial and automated. You dispute a transaction, and they produce your signature, or else it simply disappears. No court trials, nothing.<p>It could get complicated, like mandatory checking of centralized revocation lists, which the creditor would also need proof of, etc. But it could be worked out by smart people, and even run by the government <i>gasp</i>. If a hacker gets the information, wow, they&#x27;ve got your public keys, and then upon discovering the breach, all the certs get revoked.<p>But we&#x27;ll keep using dumb magic numbers forever.')
