Even though Tempur Pedic is all the rage with their insane ad spending, I was not all that impressed, and found a considerably cheaper mattress that felt much higher quality.<p>Now, this may all be sales mumbo-jumbo, but the sales rep noted that a lot of people come there only interested in Tempur Pedic mattresses, which he regards as &quot;literally a piece of foam, total crap mattresses.&quot; They sell at such a high price point because they advertise so much, while the mattress I found came from a no-name brand that doesn&#x27;t advertise at all, and was therefore cheaper.<p>So I guess in some markets, advertising does work. I&#x27;ve never heard of someone telling me how much they loved a mattress unless it&#x27;s a Sleep Number or a Tempur Pedic, and those advertise by far the most.')
