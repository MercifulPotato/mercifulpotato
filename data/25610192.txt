I was able to land my first two SWE contracts through people I met. I had a really good experience in a coliving space.

The environment was insanely inspirational.<p>Hacker News is great as a digital community, but finding startup and innovation minded peers in the real world is a lot harder.<p>Daniel Gross (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcgross.com&#x2F;the-environment-diet&#x2F;) and Paul Graham (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;cities.html) agree, even the most driven greatly benefit from the right environment.<p>I’m back in MD now with my family. As the end of covid creeps into sight, I’m thinking about where I’m going to move. I’d like to consider other cities to set up shop. Maybe DC or NYC or Miami.
