I&#x27;m not in favor of pinning people down and forcibly injecting them with something, but I am all for some kind of vaccination &quot;passport&quot;, where if you don&#x27;t have proof of vaccination you stop enjoying the benefits of society. No public schools or services, right for businesses to refuse service, etc. Or at the very least, a heavy tax fine or something a long those lines.<p>If people choose to not get a vaccine, that&#x27;s fine. But its time we align incentives to eliminate these externalities being born from societal free-loaders who believe in quack-science.')
