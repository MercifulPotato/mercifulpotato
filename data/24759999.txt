Item(by='ThatGeoGuy', descendants=None, kids=[24761669, 24761480, 24760796], score=None, time=1602540473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759800, text='I think your example isn&#x27;t completely off the mark, but I do think the article itself actually answers this: there is a shortage in trade labour in the non-commercial construction sector in (North) America.<p>We are also at a cross-roads with regards to having a housing crisis. There are many places now (Bay Area, Boulder) where housing is skyrocketing not because the value is naturally increasing, but is instead being artificially inflated due to a shortage in homes. One &quot;radical&quot; solution to this: build more homes.<p>However, given the amount of labour and time needed to do so, we may not be able to avoid the housing crisis. One way the market is responding is moving to pre-fab construction, and trying to reduce time &#x2F; costs that way. The article does seem to claim that the projects cost about the same, even if pre-fab is faster in terms of time. This _does_ identify a problem with pre-fab, namely, how come they can&#x27;t fulfill this promise of being cheaper &amp; faster. Seems strange that you save time but still cost the same when what you&#x27;re proposing is taking away a significant chunk of higher-skilled labour from the equation.<p>Some of this is regulatory capture (wasted time &#x2F; money trying to convince cities of the process), some of this is nascent technology sucking (see top parent comment, sometimes pre-fab doesn&#x27;t get it right), and some of this seems to just be a lack of experience on behalf of the companies trying to &quot;disrupt&quot; construction.')
