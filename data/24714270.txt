I&#x27;ve got my Dell E5500 about a decade ago and still totally enjoy it. Since then I&#x27;ve just replaced the HDD with an SSD, replaced the RAM once and clean the fan every now and then (super easy!). It really seems built for ease of maintenance&#x2F;upgrading as a top priority. Everything works perfectly. The only thing it can&#x27;t do is modern 3D gaming (which I don&#x27;t want).<p>I&#x27;d don&#x27;t mind buying a modern analogue which would last me the next 10+ years but I don&#x27;t know which modern model can be expected to be nearly as durable and pleasure to maintain.')
