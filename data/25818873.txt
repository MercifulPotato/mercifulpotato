My point exactly.<p>Do you think companies want to waste money on 401k matching or healthcare benefits? They don&#x27;t. They do it because it&#x27;s either required by law in some capacity and for when it isn&#x27;t it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s such a uniform standard for any nonfledling startup company who wants to hire someone full-time they would look like idiots for not only providing these benefits but providing them from respectable third parties. Over time these things became standardized and highly regulated and that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>You&#x27;re right, if we had to rely on the goodwill of a company this most certainly would not happen. I don&#x27;t think it would happen overnight but I do believe the best and brightest will go for places who offer competitive advantages and others will follow suit.<p>If it garners high quality employees then make the company profitable in the same way every startup wants to pretend they are like google with video games and playrooms and brightly colored walls and provided lunches, actually not treating your employees like crap if they have an issue with another employee is also a competitive benefit that could become a trend for any company who wants to be competitive.')
