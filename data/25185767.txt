Item(by='jschulenklopper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606132380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25183765, text='Did a similar thing over a decade ago - I don&#x27;t even own a television anymore.<p>What I spend most of my days, weeks and months on is largely unrelated to what&#x27;s happening in the world (and the news&#x27; bias towards the negative subset of that). Not following the news thus removes a lot of the sensationalist and negative stream, and saves a lot of time (including possibly worrying on what I just saw&#x2F;read). If it&#x27;s really important, I&#x27;ll hear it anyway.<p>Recently, I did start a subscription on a national newspaper though, but it allows me to a) select what I read, b) skip over things I&#x27;m not interested in (even throwing away the whole paper if I don&#x27;t want to read it that day). I happen to like some columnists and the variation of daily puzzles.')
