In recent years I had so many problems compiling things on Debian that needed newer libraries that I caved and went to Ubuntu. But I still run in to library conflicts and I have long felt like I am abusing my system when I try to force some slightly unsupported libraries on to my system to compile someones github code at 3am.<p>I suppose if I lean more on containers for development and flatpack etc for programs it would be easier to maintain a Debian stable system. Debian has been great for me aside from having older libraries!')
