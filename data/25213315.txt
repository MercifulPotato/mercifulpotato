Item(by='lovelyviking', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606332946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209279, text='&gt;That would make no sense.<p>Hiding such feature without option to turn it off would also make no sense to me but they did it.<p>&gt;If they wanted that information tied together, they would send it together.<p>sure, unless they wanted to hide the fact they wanted information tied together. In that case they can always provide the line of argument you provide once they caught and say &quot;Oh, if we wanted to spy we would do it openly and brutally. There is no sense for us to make it complicated.&quot; But something is telling me that one who wish to spy would do it in some sophisticated manner. The bottom line we do not know and we _can_not_ know since we did not see _all_ sources.<p>You also cannot know what they wanted, so your guess is as good as any other? Or somehow  you know something we don&#x27;t?<p>The bottom line here is the same: who knows.<p>But I think if they wanted to make it open and secure they would simply put option in GUI with clear text explaining what it does and how it does it with ability to turn this thing off. And they didn&#x27;t do it this way. For me it can mean &#x27;they are  hiding something&#x27; possibly. What else they hide and why we simply do not know.')
