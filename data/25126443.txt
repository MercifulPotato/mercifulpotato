Therefore, it is reasonable to determine with high probability what the final electoral results will be from the &quot;preliminary&quot; count of votes. Again, not only are the margins within each individual state large enough to make it improbable to overturn, the margins of the predicted electoral votes are large enough as well, even in the unlikely event that an individual state is somehow overturned. This is not even remotely close to Bush v. Gore in 2000.<p>Your objections seem overly pedantic, to be honest.')
