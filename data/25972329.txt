As far as I can tell they are based on a few people who died after consuming grey market THC cartridges and some studies where the scientists intentionally cranked up the wattage above spec to get metal release.<p>Glycophosphate (Round-Up) allegedly caused cancer in a few workers who, per label, grossly misused it. There have a been a few high profile lawsuits, at least one in CA, over those cancers, and corresponding calls to ban it. This is of course despite both an excellent safety record and lack of safer alternatives, asserted by many studies and meta studies from the FDA and the European equivalent. Glycophosphate though, is &#x27;factually&#x27;[0] listed by IARC as a class 2A carcinogen. I&#x27;m sure there are few HN threads digging into this one if you have lots of time to kill.<p>[0]IARC is basically a factory of &#x27;facts&#x27; that sound bad but aren&#x27;t when it comes to cancer: class 2A is the same class as eating red meat.')
