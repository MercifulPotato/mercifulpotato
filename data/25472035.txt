(is the space compressed, or the wave expanded, or both?).<p>In fact, maybe it would make sense to go back to Zeno&#x27;s paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Achilles_and_the_tortoise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Achilles_an...</a><p>That is, if you think about each, each EM wave that exists in space -- must first cross half of that space, but before that, it must cross half of that space, etc., ad infinitum.<p>So, what happens if an EM wave <i>is made of nothing but space</i>, but <i>space that is twisting, space that is vibrating</i>?<p><i>If</i> (and it&#x27;s a big <i>IF</i>!) that&#x27;s how EM waves work -- then you already have part of all of the above -- <i>BECAUSE AT THE SMALLEST SCALE IN AN EM WAVE -- SPACE ITSELF IS BEING COMPRESSED AND EXPANDED</i>...<p>You see, conventional Physics uses words like &quot;Electric Field&quot; and &quot;Magnetic Field&quot; -- rather than such words as &quot;Twist Vector Of Space&quot;, &quot;Compression Vector Of Space&quot;, &quot;Expansion Vector Of Space&quot;, and &quot;Oscillation&#x2F;Vibration Vector Of Space&quot; (and of course, those are relative to size&#x2F;wavelength&#x2F;frequency, etc.... &quot;relative to scale&quot;, as I like to say...)<p>But, I think todays Physics -- would get so much more out of itself -- if we stopped using words like &quot;Electricity&quot; and &quot;Magnetism&quot; -- and instead replaced those with &quot;Something is happening to SPACE here!&quot; (where the something was a more accurate description of what was actually going on!)<p>But anyway, we need to know&#x2F;understand&#x2F;grok the root of all phenomena -- in the simplest of terms -- otherwise Physics will keep inventing a plethora of words and phrases to describe what can be in essence, described by a few simple fundamental understandings in the tersest of ways...<p>Anyway, feel free to call me a crackpot &lt;g&gt;... I don&#x27;t claim to be right -- I only claim that researchers may wish to investigate these subjects further!<p>Phrased another way &quot;Here be dragons!&quot; -- in programmer parlance! &lt;g&gt;')
