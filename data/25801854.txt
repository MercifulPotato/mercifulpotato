How do you know what entry points you have in your &#x27;zettelkasten&#x27;? If you have no intention to recall information, why even bother taking notes? Instead of searching your notes, or following a zettelkasten ID trail, search the internet. We want to be able to _use_ information.<p>I&#x27;m all for the zettelkasten method, for good notetaking habits...however there&#x27;s also a tendency of many notetakers, or productivity porn on notetaking, to waste so much time &#x27;notetaking&#x27; and &#x27;organising&#x27; that they never _act_. (I&#x27;ve been very guilty of this in the past).<p>Recall isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s essential. It is, however, not the _only_ thing to use. You want to use spaced repetition for the most important, most used information. Stuff that&#x27;s a bit more niche, rarely used, yeah just search that.')
