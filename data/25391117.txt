In fact, the entire industry is being bombarded by one such methodology that includes those measures: Scrum. Must we really repeat the years of complaints, criticism and debates to show any measure can get warped and gamed to the point it only vaguely resembles a tool of productivity?<p>So we get young, naive engineers to focus on small changes. Cool, probably as it should be, you gotta start somewhere. And when these developers get hungry for bigger projects, when they get bored implementing the umpteenth small and by that point (for them) trivial change, how do you encourage them to tackle bigger technical problems? Those that lay the foundation for the new people to do their job more easily and on-board quicker? Or did you actually not tell us all, and you measure far more than just the number of changes?')
