Unlike on Dell and Lenovo who also has this problem it could not be remapped neither at boot nor in the OS.<p>- CMD - tab forced me to think ahead of time if I want to change to the last application or the last window of the same application. I.e. switching between two Safari instances takes a different key combination than switching between Safari and IntelliJ.<p>- modifier keys worked differently between applications, e.g. selecting to the end of a word was either ctrl-shift, alt-shift or CMD-shift depending on application.')
