If you rotate b around the axis a, then the derivative of the new vector is axb. So the cross product is the product in the Lie Algebra of rotations. (Thats why you have the Jacobi identity). I find this gives much more insight than labeling it a bivector.<p>Edit: also this view can generalize. You can ask what other reprensentation of the rotation Lie algebra exists and find e.g  su(2), this leads you to spin-bundles then.')
