(find your own things).<p>Gratitude is not just contemplative bullshit, it can be about action, like OK I&#x27;m acknowledge all these good things I have, and I need to fight thermodynamics, taking action or they might go away, like are you grateful you have two legs, take the action of walking and so on, it can be about honoring those things we take for granted but we can lose.<p>I hope is not too cheesse or sounded crazy.')
