You should have selected a title that&#x27;s more in line with the article.<p>Or what&#x27;s more interesting is to have an article about the current top use cases and companies that need protein folding, and how much money they can save on finding better drugs...now that would be really interesting to me... that would be the appropriate content for the title that you gave.')
