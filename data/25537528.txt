Item(by='theon144', descendants=None, kids=[25539640], score=None, time=1608915439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535326, text='&gt;The fact that all static languages are adding an Any type means the discussion is settled.<p>They really aren&#x27;t, though. No statically typed languages which started off as such, to my knowledge, have added an Any type (casting magic notwithstanding). You must be thinking of TypeScript and other &quot;gradually typed&quot; languages, where it&#x27;s a necessity for interop with existing code.<p>The rest of your comment, unfortunately, does not really put forth any coherent argument, so I would tend to weakly agree with the parent comment.')
