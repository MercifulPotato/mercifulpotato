A lot of things are deadly to old people, a tenth of that is a minor part and it is certainly debatable whether asking these people to live in isolation for a year is worth that 10% less chance of dying.<p>Compare also the 480000 US deaths yearly from tobacco, which could be prevented much easier than corona.<p>But anyway, it is impossible to debate weighing these statistics and measures in a civil manner so I’ll excuse myself and you can just echo around with your fellow lockdown fans.')
