Despite prevalent feelings of how it should be there needs to be an actual law broken to say they can&#x27;t do that. Being a jerk isn&#x27;t a crime.<p>Anything isn&#x27;t literally correct - if Apple decided and openly &quot;we don&#x27;t serve Jews&quot; they would rightfully get in big legal trouble from several fronts from Civil Rights to shareholder lawsuits angry about the needless illegal mess they just made. But if there is no law it really is against them.<p>Responsibility to society is a dangerously vague term and not backed by force of law for reason. Laws may fall under that as a label such as legally defined minimum of taxes but so do any number of potentially mutually exclusive opinions.<p>I have yet to see a coherent proposal for defining a remotely popular new law to restrict undesired behaviors - let alone one that would be constitutional as well.')
