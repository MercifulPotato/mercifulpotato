The built-in python-mode already has a good selection of possible selections to send and I&#x27;ve written two extra ones working with indent levels dependent on where the cursor currently is. [1]\nIt&#x27;s nice to be able to, for example, run the if statement you&#x27;re currently writing without running the while loop that if statement is in.<p>One important thing to keep in mind though is that it is not as dynamic as Lisp, so things like re-evaluating a class definition does not update existing objects. I end up restarting the python process and evaluating the buffers I&#x27;m working on often enough that I&#x27;ve bound it to its own key.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;ctz5erD4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;ctz5erD4</a>')
