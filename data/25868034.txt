Apparently if you have a blog about your field, that can make it harder to get or keep a job in academia. I&#x27;m not sure what we think we&#x27;re gaining by ensuring the smartest and best educated people around aren&#x27;t able to talk openly about the fields they&#x27;re experts in, but I hope it&#x27;s worth it.<p>This is very concerning, because it lends credence to the general public&#x27;s idea of an &quot;ivory tower,&quot; as well as academia&#x27;s own idea that it can somehow achieve perfect neutrality through apersonality.')
