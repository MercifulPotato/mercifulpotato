This pressure has now outpaced the legal framework (it’s not limited to obvious, already-illegal content like child-porn and pirated music).<p>I think we’re headed for some short-term pain, where frivolous rejections can occur across any of your critical services at any point in time.<p>I’m less worried about cases like Parler, where the block is specific and intentional. I am very worried about the more innocent sites that will, inevitably, get mysteriously flagged for violations, often with no opportunity to plead their case to a human.<p>This pain is familiar to anyone who has argued with the iPhone app review team, or logged into your scp from the middle-east, or had a contractor on your team do something sketchy with their personal linked Google account.<p>We’ll have more of this pain in the near-term, and (I’d guess) more decentralization in the long-term. I don’t know if companies will actually house more of their own infrastructure, or if they’ll try using censorship-resistant providers (cryptocurrency-esque business models). The “winner-take-all” nature of software might fragment, which changes the VC funding models, which changes what software is built. Of course, this is all speculation, and it’s much more likely that none of this actually changes for a long time.<p>Neal Stephenson’s “Burbclaves” are starting to look less ridiculous, though: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technovelgy.com&#x2F;ct&#x2F;content.asp?Bnum=240" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technovelgy.com&#x2F;ct&#x2F;content.asp?Bnum=240</a>')
