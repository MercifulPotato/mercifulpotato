MIT&#x27;s course is focusing more on general-purpose servers.<p>I expect MIT also teaches RT&#x2F;Embedded also but probably calls it something along those lines.<p>Both skillsets are necessary, and IMHO not enough programmers are exposed to real-time systems in school. It&#x27;s a very different style of coding and all modern desktop systems would work better if their designers had a better understanding of real-time principles.')
