In a few years I know that manufacturer will have zero interest in keeping the software updated to support new services and updated apps and I&#x27;ll wind up with a bloated, broken UI. I&#x27;d much rather that &quot;Smart&quot; TV&#x27;s just include their own proprietary stick that plugged into the HDMI input and could be replaced with a current generation streaming stick in a few years. I know there are good economic and business reasons for not doing this, but it&#x27;d be a real selling point for me.')
