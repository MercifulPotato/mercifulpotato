Military&#x2F;political&#x2F;financial power ( pax americana ). NZ is part of the vassal&#x2F;ally network we have all around the world.<p>The US has tons of soft power in china, russia, etc, but no real influence in either because we have no political&#x2F;military dominion over them. At least not yet.<p>Canada is a prime example. Canada has &quot;soft power&quot; in china but still their &quot;citizens&#x2F;spies&quot; are arrested and they have to beg the US&#x2F;EU to help free their &quot;citizens&#x2F;spies&quot; in china. And for all the mocking of Trump that canada loves to do, when trump cracks the whip and tells them to arrest a chinese executive, they do it. It wasn&#x27;t Trump&#x27;s &quot;soft power&quot; that made canada jump, that&#x27;s for sure. It isn&#x27;t trump&#x27;s &quot;soft power&quot; that make sweden, britain, etc side with him over china either.<p>Neither pax americana, pax romana, pax mongolica, etc were built around soft power. Actually the dependence on &quot;soft power&quot; probably signaled the end of pax romana, pax mongolica, etc.')
