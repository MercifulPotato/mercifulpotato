Higher levels of education and com-petence in a broader sense might help individuals detect and avoid  potential  deceit  in  the  first  place,  thus  reducing  the  probability  of  negative  social  experiences,  which  might  in  turn  contribute  to  a  more  positive  view  of  human  nature  (Yamagishi, Kikuchi, &amp; Kosugi, 1999). Indeed a number of studies  showed  general  cognitive  ability  to  be  negatively  related  to  cynical  hostility  (Barnes  et  al.,  2009;  Mortensen,  Barefoot,  &amp;  Avlund,  2012)  and  positively  related  to  trust  (Carl,  2014;  Carl  &amp;  Billari,  2014;  Hooghe,  Marien,  &amp;  de  Vroome,    2012;    Oskarsson,    Dawes,    Johannesson,    &amp;    Magnusson, 2012; Sturgis, Read, &amp; Allum, 2010).&quot;')
