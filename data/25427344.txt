I am worried ReScript may have killed the momentum ReasonML had been gaining.<p>This is how I understand this:<p><pre><code>  1996 - OCaml is born.\n  2016 - ReasonML, an alternative syntax that compiles to OCaml, is launched by Facebook.\n  2016 - A couple of months later, BuckleScript, an OCaml -&gt; JS compiler is launched.\n  201X - Collaboration happens, BuckleScript couples tightly to ReasonML.\n  2020 - BuckleScript forks the ReasonML syntax and rebrands the compiler and the new syntax together under ReScript.\n  2020 - ReasonML still exists?\n</code></pre>\nOk, fine. What is not clear to me is how the Facebook team behind ReasonML fits into ReScript. Are they aligned on the direction to take this community? What is the future of ReasonML?<p>What was the goal? If it was to ease adoption by newcomers, as a newcomer, it has made this more difficult. As someone VERY EAGER to enter this family of languages today, I ended up giving up on all of that and decided to just learn OCaml.<p>Now I&#x27;m dealing with Dune, Esy, OPAM, two competing async libraries and a community that is split between Jane Street libraries and the others.. but I really, really like OCaml!')
