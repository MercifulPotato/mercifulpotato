Second, outside of legislation, there are democratic-capitalistic feedback mechanisms as well: people can &#x27;vote with their feet&#x27;; decide what services to use, recommend, and criticize.<p>So I think you meant something else?<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not defending these companies, and I do support intelligent (as opposed to reactionary), targeted (as opposed to blunt), principled (as opposed to arbitrary), and simple (as opposed to byzantine, inscrutable) regulations.')
