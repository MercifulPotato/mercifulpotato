It&#x27;s just a fun project by a few people from several Russian VFX studios. Here&#x27;s an interview with the guy who led the project (sadly, only in Russian): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NuOUqIY0P2g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NuOUqIY0P2g</a>. They say they did not expect this to go viral, and there will be more along the same lines, for YouTube distribution. In their opinion this won&#x27;t look right in the traditional &quot;movie&quot; format.<p>It also pokes fun at Rogozin - there&#x27;s a portrait of him on one of the barns with a slogan &quot;Let&#x27;s turn the Red Planet green&quot;. For those who don&#x27;t know - Rogozin leads Roskosmos.<p>The &quot;robots&quot; are actual farm workers, on a real farm, BTW. CGI is added later. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re wearing long-sleeve clothing. Hands are difficult to replace after filming.')
