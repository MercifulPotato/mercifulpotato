They don’t heat up enough to dry water off of plastic, and the enzyme based detergents don’t seem to clean as well as the old phosphate detergents.<p>Also, the dishwasher in our current apartment (a cheap Whirlpool) often leaves a wet dog smell on the glasses, and we can’t figure out where it comes from or how to get rid of it. Apparently, this is a rather common problem, with hundreds of posts scattered across the internet where people with the same problem unsuccessfully try dozens of home remedies that fail to fix the issue. I never remember wet dog smell from the older units so I can only assume this results from some sort of energy saving feature that backfired.')
