Such unspecific language only furthers cynicism and is damaging for democracy. There certainly are lots of members of congress that are against this, from both parties. But they&#x27;ll get accused of this as well as any other real or imaginary ill.<p>As such, cynicism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: When people literally no longer care about the actual work you do, why bother trying? When they assume you are &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;deep-state&quot; or whatever, why shouldn&#x27;t you start selling your vote to the highest bidder?<p>At least the &quot;CARES Act&quot; also does no such thing as &quot;criminalising meme-sharing&quot;, as far as I can tell. It is a <i>civil law</i> establishing a small claims courts pathway for copyright infringement. <i>Both sides need to opt-in</i> to this process. If one side doesn&#x27;t, exactly nothing changes.<p>Because this is about reducing overhead costs of litigation, it doesn&#x27;t do much to help Disney. Its stated intend is to help smaller or one-off creators who see their works reused without their permission and do not have the means to pursue claims in federal courts. The merits here are debatable, and I believe some sort of collective rights managements system would be better. But imagine taking the single greatest photo of your life and seeing it used everywhere with people not even bothering to give you credit?<p>The criminalisation targets sites that knowingly and repeatedly stream copyrighted content.  Unless you reject copyright altogether, I can&#x27;t really find fault with that.<p>&gt; fascism 2.0<p>Congress gets a lot wrong, but at at least they tend to stay clear of Godwin&#x27;s law. Diminishing the industrial slaughter of millions of people by comparing it with some minor adjustments to copyright law is certainly not raising the level of debate.')
