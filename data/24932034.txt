I&#x27;ve read the piece several times, and couldn&#x27;t figure it out. The most negative thing that was done to him was that they found him to have violated the Code. If there was a punishment, he seems to have found it less doleful than the finding itself and the process by which it came about.<p>That&#x27;s understandable, but to me it also seems to illustrate the reason we&#x27;re having this. He felt persecuted by their words. They were unkind to him, and it left him &quot;shattered&quot;.<p>CoCs calling for &quot;kindness&quot; are put into place precisely because words have such power to harm. That vagueness makes them prone to abuse as well, but the sentiment on this thread seems to be, &quot;Because this has the potential to harm me it must be stopped, but the kinds of harms that I could inflict on other people the same way are unimportant and do not need to be addressed.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sorry he was treated this way; this doesn&#x27;t seem to have been handled well. It&#x27;s hard to deal with situations where multiple people are experiencing the &quot;low emotional resilience&quot; he cites (both himself and the apparent fragility of the person who reported him). But I think it&#x27;s important to recognize that there are many &quot;oppression tools&quot;, so it&#x27;s worth reconsidering who has them even without a CoC, and how they can be countered.')
