I think the answer to &quot;What can we learn from cats?&quot; can be to live more like a cat. But to force disinterest in an effort to emulate a cat&#x27;s apparent disinterest would be a mistake. To live more like a cat cannot mean to simply imitate the cat, that would be another ideology. Instead, it must mean that we have to follow our human nature, just as the cat follows its cat nature.<p>I agree with John Gray&#x27;s distrust of all ideology because ultimately ideology is what gives us the illusion that we can ignore our human nature. A cat must follow its cat nature, it has no choice. We as humans have a choice to follow our human nature or to try to bend nature to our will. The problem is that nature will always bend back, efforts to bend it will always be futile. So the ideal solution is to abandon ideology and choose to follow our human nature, to be the humans we are meant to be.')
