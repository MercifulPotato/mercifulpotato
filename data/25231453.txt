But what I find insulting is that beyond this simple nugget of an idea, most of what these startups do is very conventional.<p>AirBnB to me reeks of the same VC funded attitude to expand their moat and eviscerate all competition with less than reputable thinking: they rarely care about customers and very much focused on competition. This isn&#x27;t any spectacular independent thinking beyond that simple idea at the beginning. Similar to Twitter&#x27;s beginning from an idea bored down on a napkin.<p>I think these companies are filled with very conventional people with very conventional thinking. But the VC folks can claim superiority in thinking they are solving the world&#x27;s problems with independent thinking within some circlejerk.')
