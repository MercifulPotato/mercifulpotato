The amount of people that has to get sick to overwhelm hospitals is smaller than you might think. When hospitals get overwhelmed people die of <i>other preventable</i> cases due to reduced resources, tired physicians, lack of time to see patients at all and people being scared of even going to the hospital in the first place. Old people are not &quot;disposable&quot; and for younger people that happen to have the genetic (or other) predisposition to bad or fatal cases it will be hard to tell them &quot;sucks to be you&quot; when the preventive steps are well understood by now: interact with people as little as possible and when you do, do so outside while wearing masks.<p>Also, the death rate among poorer people is a multiple of that of the general population, among other reasons because they are working essential jobs to not starve. Those of us that <i>can</i> isolate and <i>don&#x27;t</i> are saying that these people&#x27;s lives (essential workers, including health care workers) have no value, they are just meat for the meat grinder.')
