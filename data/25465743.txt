I work on my side projects in the evening when my kid is sleeping, because it is the only time available. I don&#x27;t trade family time for side projects, it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>I am more productive than before I had kids because time is very limited I don&#x27;t lie to myself anymore. Either I&#x27;m going to sit down and work on a side project or not. No more sitting in front of a computer and clicking around while not doing anything.')
