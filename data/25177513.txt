Vs. Pradeep Poonia (1).pdf” suggests it may be lawsuit documents.<p>But I still see no mention of a lawsuit <i>in the article</i>; unless there is, the title here should not mention anything about filing suit (quite apart from the HN rule of not editorialising titles, but using the site’s provided title unless there’s a good reason not to).')
