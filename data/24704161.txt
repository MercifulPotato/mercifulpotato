The majority of university funding comes from research grants and that&#x27;s why the piece they take off the top is so outrageously high.<p>Note that I don&#x27;t question your point about the use of international student fees to subsidize domestic students.  I&#x27;m just saying reducing the cost for students can be done many, many other ways.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that the US tax paper should not pay for foreign students to take US jobs.   And if we tightened up that we might not need so many H-1B visas.')
