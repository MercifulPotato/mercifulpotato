The sentiment appearing here is correct; not a cent of the money invested by the EU in semiconductors will escape the clutches of establishment grandees and instead find its way to anyone that knows how to compete effectively with prevailing foundries, so don&#x27;t expect to find any European manufactured chips troubling TSMC et al. in this lifetime.')
