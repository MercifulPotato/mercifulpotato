As are plenty of others. Jack Welch famously called it the &quot;dumbest idea in the world&quot; and it has been widely panned: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=dumbest+idea+in+the+world+shareholder+value" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=dumbest+idea+in+the+world+sh...</a><p>If I squint at it from the right angle, it&#x27;s not terrible, in that in theory many of the other kinds of value should roll up to long-term company value. E.g., healthy employee relationships are a real asset. Being a good community member should pay off in the long term. Etc, etc.<p>But in reality, when you crossbreed this with the &quot;efficient markets hypothesis&quot; [1] and managerialism [2], it becomes dangerous. Mix in a live stock ticker plus ways for executives to cash out and a declining CEO tenure and you get an excuse for doing anything that boosts the share price long enough to unload the shares on a sucker. Or, at lower levels, anything that boosts a metric that drives stock price gains.<p>So instead of building long-term value, the &quot;maximize shareholder value&quot; mantra ends up doing the opposite. E.g., cutting long-term R&amp;D spending to fund stock buy-backs. Laying off long-term employees in favor of an outsourcing deal that cuts short-term costs while raising them down the road.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Efficient-market_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Efficient-market_hypothesis</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Managerialism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Managerialism</a>')
