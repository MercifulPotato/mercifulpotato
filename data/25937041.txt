Slowly the communities they loved moved to it until they were completely excluded and felt forced to adopt it as well. At this point I only have two friends left that still refuse to use it, everyone else gave in citing network effects. It reminds me precisely of how Facebook felt when I was in school, in that you were excluded from friend groups and events if you chose not to use it.<p>I know there are <i>many</i> alternatives, but getting your favorite communities to switch to them is completely intractable. Communication shouldn&#x27;t be like this and I think that we can do much better, even if it takes us awhile to get there.')
