Or I want to use git over sshfs but KDE uses kioslaves and not gvfs so it&#x27;s not a normal FS if you mount ssh in dolphin. Stuff like that.<p>Gnome usually make me miss some configuration options or they remove them. But as I grow older I get better at accepting defaults and I think Gnome will capture me once and for all soon. I do like how Ubuntu looks ootb (I only set dark theme, autohide the panel and keep 4 virtual desktop at all times (normally they are removed when empty)).<p>Sometimes I choose Mate (similar to XFCE I guess). I like it a lot but it just doesn&#x27;t look that good (ark-darker makes it better).<p>I do like change every now and then.')
