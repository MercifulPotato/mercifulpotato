If the people they reach are 60% seniors and 40% non-seniors, they know that seniors don&#x27;t make up 60% of the population, so they weight based on likely voter demographic numbers. After 2016 they also started weighting on education level, because they thought that was a factor in the polling miss of 2016.')
