Everything took weeks, worse if your circuit needed any kind of repairs or if the first pair the line tech tried had any issue at all.<p>A common “fix” was to order Internet service directly from Bell for a month then switch to your preferred ISP. Of course, only the diehards actually did this and Southwestern Bell would aggressively market at you for months after.<p>(Granted, it was not great but now we have virtually no such option in most of the States, so the UK has us beat.)')
