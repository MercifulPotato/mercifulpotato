I have collected over the years reports about dozens of underhanded tactics they use to manipulate users into sharing data, when they&#x27;re not downright forcing them to do it.<p>Currently Google is showing in the EU a modal pop-up asking users to accept to be tracked or fuck off to a labyrinth of &quot;See more&quot; and &quot;Other options&quot; which are obviously violating the GDPR. They got fined <i>five</i> times already for GDPR violations.<p>Microsoft have told their non-enterprise customers to bugger off and learn to live with telemetry. They&#x27;re actively working around people blocking telemetry and they&#x27;re being investigated for these practices.<p>How about a thank you that at least someone at Apple listens to their customers?')
