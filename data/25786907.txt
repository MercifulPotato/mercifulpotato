Perhaps more wrong than anyone saying any of the other things above. First off, there is no &quot;neutrality&quot; requirement at all in Section 230. Seriously. Read it. If anything, it says the opposite. It says that sites can moderate as they see fit and face no liability. This myth is out there and persists because some politicians keep repeating it, but it&#x27;s wrong and the opposite of truth. Indeed, any requirement of neutrality would likely raise significant 1st Amendment questions, as it would be involving the law in editorial decision making.<p>Debate all you want about whether what Twitter did was moral, it was unquestionably legal, and anyone claiming otherwise either doesn&#x27;t understand section 230 or is deliberately trying to mislead.<p>In this case I&#x27;m betting it&#x27;s the latter.')
