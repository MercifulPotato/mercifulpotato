When an object is moving through space, the fields have to move extra far to cover the distance through space, as well as to do the usual oscillations&#x2F;vibrations&#x2F;movements that give timing effects.  This is where time dilation comes from.  It&#x27;s best understood with the reflecting-mirror-as-clock thought experiment.')
