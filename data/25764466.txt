Not only because for decades now there are those whose job it has been to &quot;sell nudes online&quot;, but also because it outright communicates a moral equivocation between desperate circumstances and sex-work, with such implied debasement STILL not garnering a payout as some kind of &quot;I told you so&#x2F;what did we learn&quot; moment. It really takes the agency out of those sex-workers who do so for any myriad of reasons outside of desperation, and is the stupid rhetoric that seeks to rollback any strides -albeit in North America limited though they may be- we&#x27;ve made toward the field itself.')
