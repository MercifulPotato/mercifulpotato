Everybody can pay cash. If you can&#x27;t, you get government assistance in the form of a cash-like subsidy that can be spent anywhere food is sold.<p>It&#x27;s a fast, efficient way of ensuring universality of care while benefiting from the market discipline you get from having a (mostly) competitive, cash market. Not to mention, there is no insane &quot;food insurance&quot; bureaucracy. You swipe the card at the checkout line and you&#x27;re good.')
