I would not have that second phone always with me, but it would provide me access to the social network I need without feeling tracked or providing more data than needed.<p>This is what I&#x27;m doing currently: an old phone used exclusively for whatsapp  (with an empty contact list); it always stays at home.\nI only use it to coordinate kid&#x27;s stuff (school, social activities, etc), so there is no problem with me not having it with me the whole time.')
