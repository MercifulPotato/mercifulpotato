As you point out there&#x27;s no reduction from FHE to iO, but there is one going the other way. Worth noting though that when Boaz et al wrote that paper, even FHE wasn&#x27;t known to exist. As for the iO result, not sure whether you were saying you thought the result wasn&#x27;t solid because of the Boaz paper, but my understanding from people in the field is that it&#x27;s expected to hold up and of course Boaz is quoted in the article.')
