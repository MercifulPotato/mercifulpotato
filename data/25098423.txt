Item(by='robomartin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605416935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095431, text='&gt; The point isn&#x27;t that there are never any cases where armed police response is appropriate -- but rather that the vast majority of cases don&#x27;t require one.<p>The point is even simpler than that.<p>Let&#x27;s say a cop deals with 10 contacts with random people for equally random causes every day.  That&#x27;s 200 contacts per month or, roughly, 2,500 per year.<p>Let&#x27;s say only 1% of those encounters involve someone intent on doing harm to the officers, carrying a deadly weapon or willing to do anything at all not to get arrested.<p>That&#x27;s 25 potentially deadly encounters per year.  Imagine having a job where performing your job might get you killed 25 times per year.  That&#x27;s no joke.<p>And so that game, the gamble, the proposal, is to send out someone other than police officers to some cross section of calls.  Fine.  Good idea.  The question is:  How do we predict what side of that 1% each call will be on?  In the case of my father in law, the call was like hundreds, if not thousands, of calls they had handled during their career.  And yet, they came very close to being killed.<p>In other words, we are proposing to send ill-equipped people to a potential life or death situation nobody is able to predict.<p>That&#x27;s where I come out on the side of:  If you want to propose that (not you personally, a general &quot;you&quot;, a politician, activist, whoever) then you better be willing to go out and take those calls before you send someone else out to do it.  That, to me, is honorable.  Anything else is fake virtue signaling while playing with someone else&#x27;s life.<p>I think a leader must include this as one of his or her guiding principles:  I will never ask you to do something I am not willing to do myself (or have not done myself).  That goes from sweeping the floor to asking someone to walk into a potentially dangerous situation that could cost someone&#x27;s life.  It&#x27;s easy to ask someone to clean vomit off the floor when you don&#x27;t have to do it.')
