You can definitely earn more if you juggle cards, but the base discover card is really quite good as a one-card system, and I think would beat any &quot;2%-3% on everything&quot; card.<p>It does operate on 5% categories each quarter, but those categories tend to be really common and broad, and their systems aren&#x27;t exactly the best at determining when something shouldn&#x27;t be in a category. In 2021, their categories are (Grocery Stores, Walgreens, CVS), (Gas Stations, Wholesale Clubs, Streaming Services), (Restaurants, Paypal), and (Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target.com). That&#x27;s in addition to 1% on everything else.<p>Combine that with no annual fee (the BofA Premium Rewards card is $95&#x2F;year, Sapphire Reserve is $550&#x2F;year)... its very difficult to beat.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m a bigger fan of the Chase Freedom Unlimited or Flex, as I have everything else with Chase and I prefer keeping total &quot;accounts to log in to&quot; at a minium. The Flex has a rewards system similar to Discover, whereas the Unlimited is more static x% on Dining; they both get pretty close to Discover.')
