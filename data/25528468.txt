Item(by='blisterpeanuts', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608824774, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526998, text='From the article:<p><i>&quot;Once theyâ€™re in the database, they steal the data, send it to their own servers and then delete it from the local machines,&quot; Harpaz continued. &quot;The victim has to pay a ransom for the data to be returned.&quot;</i><p>Elsewhere in the article:<p><i>&quot;Once hackers manage to steal the data, it is posted on a website and sold to the highest bidder unless the victim agrees to pay a ransom of roughly $500.&quot;</i><p>I conclude that we&#x27;re both right :)<p>They delete &quot;from the local machines&quot; which I interpret to be the victim&#x27;s server. If the victims had had data backups, as simple as a daily cron task that calls mysqldump, presumably they would be unconcerned about <i>restoring</i> their data.  However, they would still worry about their data being sold.<p>Since there&#x27;s zero guarantee that the thieves will take down the data for the $500 fee, it seems pointless to pay them.  They could come back in a month and say &quot;you owe us another $500&quot;.  Or just go ahead and sell the data anyway.')
