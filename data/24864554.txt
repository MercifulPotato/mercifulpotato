Or where Linux is the dominant computing platform everyone serious uses, and at the same time in danger of being squished by Microsoft?<p>&gt; &quot;<i>As for Android, there is this thing called AOSP. Check it out.</i>&quot;<p>It&#x27;s what you get if you remove all the things people want, like Chrome and YouTube and drivers and Google store, and are left with just a kernel which nobody cares about. It&#x27;s what manufacturers take, and put something nice but proprietary on top before it becomes desirable. (btw, if Android counts as a huge successful use of Linux, how is Microsoft adding a Linux VM option to Windows going to extinguish Android?)<p>&gt; &quot;<i>MS executing its hallmark embrace-and-extend on it is _disastrous_ news</i>&quot;<p>It isn&#x27;t news, WSL has been around for years, and before that the Unix subsystem for more years. And why are you afraid that Microsoft doing literally anything with Linux might lead to you running Windows? How is that going to happen?<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Linux is anything but small; it is huge.</i>&quot;<p>Then how is Microsoft adding a Linux VM option to Windows a &quot;disaster&quot;? Is it huge and doing great, or tenuous and barely holding on?<p>&gt; &quot;<i>It is what allows me to keep the lights on and put food and drink on my family&#x27;s table.</i>&quot;<p>You just said you would use Windows if someone paid you. Linux being extinguished wouldn&#x27;t stop you from earning. Not to mention the doublethink involved in how Linux can both &quot;be extinguished&quot; and still exist in Windows, or how Linux being used in Android, extended in proprietary ways, is great, but being used in Windows is not great.<p>Because it&#x27;s just anti-Microsoft fearmongering, not anything which makes rational or reasonable sense.<p>EEE was about standard protocols; if Microsoft extend SMTP or HTML and everyone becomes dependent on their version, they could leverage that to kill Netscape. If Microsoft put a Linux VM in Windows, that doesn&#x27;t change what happens on your server, on your phone, on your laptop. If people start developing for &quot;Microsoft Linux&quot; because it&#x27;s &#x2F;better&#x2F; because Microsoft builds things people want, that&#x27;s called &quot;competition&quot;.')
