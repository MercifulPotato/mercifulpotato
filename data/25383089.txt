Pinker, regardless of who he fraternizes with or what moral causes he supports or not, is an acknowledged scientist.<p>&gt;<i>Let&#x27;s listen to them instead of the creep who hangs out with rapist pimps.</i><p>Who people hang with is irrelevant. We don&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t change who we listen to on technical&#x2F;scientific&#x2F;etc matters based on their personal morality (even less so based on someone&#x27;s idea about that). We change who we listen to on those matters based on the quality of their arguments and domain knowledge.<p>In any case, we should not bring moralizing and posturing into discussions and into who we listen to, except if the morals in question are related to the subject matter.<p>E.g. I would be suspect to economic arguments from an economist who has been found to take money from states to push some agenda. But I wouldn&#x27;t be suspect to economic arguments from someones who enjoys killing kittens. I just wouldn&#x27;t take environmental &#x2F; pet advice from that person...')
