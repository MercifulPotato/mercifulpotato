Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25503835], score=None, time=1608606298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502212, text='&gt;  I can assure you that only in the instrument cluster and the central console area you have the same amount of complexity as in a smartphone. Now add the rest of the car.<p>Not only that but the regulatory standards of EV in US&#x2F;EU&#x2F;Asia varies so widely that I don&#x27;t see how they can get a product to Market in less than 5-10 years unless they&#x27;re just making EV clones of what is already out here or partner with a Manufacturer. And burned factories in India are not going to cut it on the logistics and supply chain so they&#x27;d need to work that out, too.<p>I can honestly see them partnering up with Nissan-Mitsubishi Motors who are in dire financial straits and want get out of their alliance with Renault-French Government after all the Ghosn corruption and are taking their entire lineup to EV and want to improve on the in-cabin AR side of things, all of which Apple could help build and have the finance to support it.<p>Having worked at Nissan I think its focus is on tech and still makes cars to prove and refine it&#x27;s technology, they had an Aerospace division in Mountain View, and used the supposed &#x27;auto pilot&#x27; features Tesla has on some of its Infiniti chassis (lidar based cruise control and lane staying signals) in the early 2000s.<p>I hope it happens, to be honest I dislike anything Apple makes and I despise their business practices for obvious reasons (Foxxcon) but I&#x27;m forced into their ecosystem as of now. I&#x27;d like to be open to their products if they it did happen.')
