Item(by='mettamage', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608813355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526429, text='&gt; When it comes to buying things I find my satisfaction is much higher when I spend money to remove an irritant rather than get something completely new.<p>Really true for me as well. I recently bought a new guitar that is fairly similar compared to my old guitar. My old guitar is perfectly fine. The issue is that my old guitar is in a weird tuning since I&#x27;m practicing finger style guitar on it. And I hate retuning my guitar to a normal tuning all the time.<p>I told myself, if I&#x27;m still as irritated about this a year from now, I&#x27;m buying a new guitar. It&#x27;s 2 years later and I&#x27;m happy I did it.')
