My favorite feature that sold me is the ability to tab and instantly create an inline table (with each subsequent tab pressing creating additional columns). It&#x27;s quite powerful and flexible. You can also add multiple text blocks to a note page allow for extra context to be placed anywhere. This isn&#x27;t limited to just text, but adding a graphic to an existing text block, again anywhere on the note &#x27;space&#x27;<p>Honestly, it&#x27;s really quite an impressive note app and I&#x27;ve moved completely off of Bear in favor of it. The syncing is also free, which was something I was paying a yearly sub to Bear for. The cherry on-top is the also free iOS app which works really well too.<p>That said, I do think there is room for something like Dendron, which is pretty slick and I quite like that it&#x27;s a VS-Code add-on.  I&#x27;ll def give it a serious look, nice job!')
