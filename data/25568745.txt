The senior people will know each other and get things moving.<p>Medium sized businesses (up to $100m revenues) will find it very difficult even getting a response. Even getting their attention is a competitive advantage for large corporates.<p>So when you read a story and think things &#x27;worked quite well&#x27;. It&#x27;s just an example of selectively applying laws &amp; regulations, which were only introduced to keep out competition and protect entrenched interests. That&#x27;s why large corporates love regulations, it protects their entire business model and imposes significant costs on new entrants.')
