If the president would be harmed or in general the security at the white house unable to operate, this plane takes over. A precaution, it seems, in case somebody wants to attack the USA. But as I understood it, starting the plane is more of a signal for defense readiness conditions (DEFCON) and helps signaling other planes and stations to be aware. It&#x27;s pretty interesting IMHO that the plane started before the president announced it on twitter or anything, giving a solid hint that something is very off in DC.')
