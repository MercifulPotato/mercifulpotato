Even large cities in North America have no more than a few dozen gas stations (and the UK likely fewer still due to things like London&#x27;s congestion pricing reducing vehicle count).  Once-a-week-or-so fueling doesn&#x27;t really require a huge amount of infrastructure.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons we&#x27;re all addicted to driving in the first place, after all.<p>And charging stations are, of course, absolutely dirt cheap to build relative to fuel stations.  They&#x27;ll keep up with demand easily as the driving stock expands.  The limit, if there is one, is going to be the electrical distribution infrastructure.  High voltage lines into cities aren&#x27;t as cheap as we&#x27;d want.')
