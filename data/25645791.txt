As you increase load and response times start to increase, since it runs sequentially through the test plan the time between the requests also increases. But, when actual humans with browsers use apps there are loads of AJAX requests being fired which don&#x27;t necessarily go in order or wait for others to complete first.<p>What I found is to really bring things to the breaking point you actually need two tests at the same time, one to generate static load, and another to spank it. Of course, most people don&#x27;t need to do this - we had to bring our app to its knees to find a particularly elusive (possibly concurrency related) bug that only appeared with high load &amp; many active sessions.<p>At the end of the day, I think load testing will only get you to ~80% accuracy. I completely agree with the author about the conclusion.')
