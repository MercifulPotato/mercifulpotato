He makes the argument that it&#x27;s more complicated than just &quot;outsiders&quot; and &quot;china&quot;, but rather that there&#x27;s a whole range of overlapping, marginalized identities and strategic use of power-relations to evolve things according to various positions. His objection is basically that zomia homogenizes marginalized identities and doesn&#x27;t fully capture their relationships with each other or with the state. The convergence zone paper is probably the one to read for this.<p>Caroline Humphrey also gave a talk [1] that I&#x27;ve wanted to cite, but haven&#x27;t found an excuse for. She&#x27;s not <i>against</i> the idea, but she brings up a lot of issues with applying it to areas like like Tyva&#x2F;Khövsgöl, as these were clearly state-spaces despite fitting all the other characteristics. She runs into basically the same criticism as Tenzin in that zomia doesn&#x27;t encapsulate precisely what we intuitively understand as people about these marginal border spaces.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;297392497_IS_ZOMIA_A_USEFUL_IDEA_FOR_INNER_ASIA_The_Lattimore_Lecture_2014_Ulaanbaatar_Mongolia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;297392497_IS_ZOMIA_...</a>')
