I&#x27;s pretty good, but has issues with the French apostrophe, that&#x27;s often used to combine words.<p>It also has multiple keyboard layouts, of which &quot;terminal&quot; compares favorably to hacker&#x27;s keyboard. I like that it is configurable, and has a lot of text editing tools when swiping space up.<p>I admit I lost some typing speed when I switched from the alternatives, but I&#x27;m happier with it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anysoftkeyboard.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anysoftkeyboard.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
