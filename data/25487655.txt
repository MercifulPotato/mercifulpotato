I&#x27;m not sure that that, in the isolated pandemic situation we are in now, is the best thing for Mental Health or celebratory. It depends on the person. If you&#x27;ve been talking to people all day, an hour+ just thinking to yourself can obviously be excellent and useful and allow you to process stuff. But if you&#x27;re lonely, you&#x27;re not going to be wanting to do that: thoughts will often be unhelpful or negative and you would almost literally be better off not thinking them.<p>When I was happier pre-pandemic, thinking to myself would be great. When I was 17 doing my first philosophy classes my head would just be abuzz with questions, e.g I&#x27;d be in a corner store and be almost stuck there for 5m thinking about what Plato&#x2F;Aristotle would think about me buying a bar of chocolate that I didn&#x27;t necessarily need.<p>Not to digress, but I imagine further that it&#x27;s dependent on your occupation and life. If you&#x27;re doing menial 9-5 stuff, you&#x27;re obviously not going to be thinking heavily about job related stuff and will be too tired to consider questions. If you&#x27;ve just started a start-up however, your mind will continuously be abuzz (hopefully) thinking about what you&#x27;re gonna do etc etc.')
