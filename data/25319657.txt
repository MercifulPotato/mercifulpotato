I&#x27;m making the claim that the government <i>does not actually provide all the benefits you are assuming it does</i>, so the &quot;gap&quot; you speak of, if it exists at all, is much smaller than you think it is.<p>I think most people simply aren&#x27;t aware of how much inefficiency there is in government services or how much of their tax money does not actually go to benefit the people they think the government is helping.<p>If all we expected the government to do was to provide basic national defense (not aggressive foreign wars, just keep the US itself from being attacked), enforce basic common sense regulations (laws against obvious crimes like murder and regulations against obvious bad things like dumping toxic waste in rivers), and maintain basic public infrastructure (roads, bridges, public buildings, basic utilities, national parks), we would not have nearly as much inefficiency. The problem is that we expect the government to do much, much, much more than that, and the government does all those other things so inefficiently that, on net, it <i>would</i> be better if we left them to private entities.')
