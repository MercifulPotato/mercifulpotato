Maybe I&#x27;d have had better luck if I ran distilled water only.   I use a warm mist honeywell&#x2F;vicks one now and it&#x27;s great cost about $35.  But I&#x27;m pretty sure that I will add steam to my hvac though next season and be done with it.<p>The vicks giant bulb thing for $20 that they recommend gets pretty gross because you can&#x27;t get all the water out and the slag accumulates as it doesn&#x27;t work with distilled water.')
