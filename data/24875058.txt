Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603492607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873399, text='&gt; The biggest problem with it is that it&#x27;s unconstitutional.<p>There is considerable debate about that.<p>&gt; States are not allowed to make agreements with each other parallel to the system.<p>Yes, they are. In certain circumstances, such agreements require affirmative Congressional consent, though its questionable if the National Popular Vote &quot;Interstate Compact&quot; would meet the standards for requiring such consent, whether it would require only negative consent, or whether it would be outside of Congress&#x27; authority because of the assignment of the power of choosing electors.<p>&gt;  if you can get that many states to agree to it, then you could have just done a constitutional amendment<p>No, that&#x27;s not at all necessarily even approximately true. For it to be effective, you need jurisdictions with a bare majority of electoral votes to implement it. For a constitutional amendment, you need 3&#x2F;4 of states.<p>The minimum number of states to hit a majority of EVs is 16, as opposed to 38 for a constitutional amendment.<p>&gt; since all you need for that is for the states to agree, and the senate to agree.<p>You don&#x27;t need the Senate to agree to a Constitutional Amendment. You need 3&#x2F;4 of state legislatures to agree.\nYou <i>can</i> propose a constitutional amendment with 2&#x2F;3 of <i>both</i> houses of Congress, or call a Constitutional Convention on the application of 2&#x2F;3 of states.<p>Both proposal and ratification (presuming senators vote in line with their states, regardless of the House) have a higher minimum threshold than would be otherwise required for states representing a majority of EVs to assign electors in line with the national popular vote and determine Presidential elections that way.')
