High-res, colored PNG icons a) are heavyweight, b) require you to ship multiple sizes, c) if you don&#x27;t have a large enough version for a new display resolution it&#x27;ll look blurry. This adds both process complexity and implementation complexity.<p>Vectorized icons on the other hand take up much less memory and can auto-scale to different displays and use-cases. If you take it a step further and ship them as a font - which is the gold-standard these days - they can be stored even more compactly and worked with very easily on the web and otherwise, and can even be re-colored dynamically. But of course a font can only be rendered in one color at a time.')
