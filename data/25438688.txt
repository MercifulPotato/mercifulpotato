Can&#x27;t exactly &quot;recommend&quot; since I haven&#x27;t used mine (they&#x27;re single use only), but I researched this a bit before buying.<p>Just make sure you get one that uses 406Mhz rather than two-way LEO satellites.  The two-way stuff requires monthly payments and is far less reliable, won&#x27;t get through forest canopy.  The 406Mhz SARSAT beacons are single use only one-way transmitters (they receive GPS, not 406Mhz-SARSAT, although they still work without a GPS signal).  Anything that advertises using it to send SMS messages is junk for emergency use.<p>There&#x27;s an older, lower-frequency SARSAT band somewhere in the 150mhz-ish range, but it gets so many false positives (like some ATM in Kansas) that it&#x27;s basically retired.  The 406Mhz protocol has a lot more checksums in it.<p>Edit: you want this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;International_Cospas-Sarsat_Programme" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;International_Cospas-Sarsat_...</a>')
