After the revolution they became very united by their nationalism, in the original sense of the word - shared language, values, traditions, symbols, customs, as well as by the ideals of republican democratic governance.<p>Historically most nations were united in Monarchy and&#x2F;or Religion. Over time some switched over to either nationalism or an ideology like communism, and some even switched back to Monarchy later on.<p>A country that lost its uniting force can easily disappear into a fiery flash of a civil war or sink into a suffocating simmering of gradual societal disintegration. One might conclude that any attack on the Uniting Symbol is a heinous crime and needs to be stamped out as quickly as possible.<p>This is questionable from the modern western perspective, but I can see how one could make this argument in good faith from the other parts of the world. Especially from the countries where they do not (yet) have a different Uniting Symbol.')
