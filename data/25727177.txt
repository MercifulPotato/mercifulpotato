Two issues that I can think of that makes this harder to achieve:<p>1. You&#x27;ll have to fuck around with router settings to forward the incoming traffic to that piece of hardware.<p>2. You&#x27;ll have to have a domain, and fuck around with dynamically changing DNS settings because your IP is likely not static (this process depends on which DNS provider you choose to use).<p>To add to the complexity, you&#x27;ll probably have to have some sort of a VPN because otherwise anyone would be able to see your public IP by just pinging your domain.<p>Point being: you can run Pleroma right now on a Raspberry Pi no problem, but doing so securely is another issue altogether.')
