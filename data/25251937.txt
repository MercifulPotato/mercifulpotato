They&#x27;re just powershell scripts with a wizard-style interface.  I&#x27;ve had them fix many networking issues on certain computers reliably.  I haven&#x27;t ever had an audio problem on Windows that wasn&#x27;t caused by me, so I&#x27;ve never needed to run an audio troubleshooter for audio.<p>Windows has log files too, you just need to know where to look.  Usually event viewer will have what you need, but sometimes you&#x27;ll need to run a diagnostic that generates logs, or you&#x27;ll just need to know where the logs are.')
