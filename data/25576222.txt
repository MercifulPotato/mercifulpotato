Surely &quot;non-techies&quot; are able to extract some value from the video.<p>Movies and TV have stolen most of that value and wonder by showing fake robots moving like this for years.  My thought watching the video was &quot;this looks like CGI&quot;, not because I think it is CGI (or the lighting or background or anything), but because the only robots I have seen move that fluidly have been fake computer animated ones.  Because I believe it&#x27;s <i>not</i> CGI, I was amazed, but that takes a little domain knowledge.<p>I suspect a lot of people already think robots moving this well are fairly normal, and not impressive.')
