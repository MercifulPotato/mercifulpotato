The RDOF grants are not venture funding, and should not be used as such.<p>The FCC&#x27;s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund exists to bring high speed fixed broadband service to rural homes and small businesses that lack it.<p>I do not believe that Starlink would have excluded the areas it got subsidies for from service had it not gotten the subsidies.<p>Starlink must have ALL the money to launch and operate ALL the satellites it needs to become profitable. The subsidies do not even cover the cost of replacing deorbiting satellites.<p>&gt; It is true that plenty of companies operate that way. However after 20 years of running companies, it is extremely safe to say that Elon does not. In fact he tends to take every scrap of money that his company is generating, finds ways to borrow or raise more, and then reinvests it into even more ambitious projects.<p>This is not proper use of RDOF money either.')
