Also, philosophers who wrote thousands of years ago are relevant today.  It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;ve answered questions like &quot;what is knowledge?&quot; &quot;what is good?&quot; and so on.<p>I never said that &quot;only since Marx&quot; was the government an instrument of violence owned by the ruling class.  I said that idea is a Marxian idea.  And it is.  Also, I never meant to imply that it&#x27;s a wrong idea (I think it&#x27;s wrong, but you don&#x27;t have to).<p>The fact that you&#x27;re mouthing ideas from Marx without even realizing it while denying the concept of intellectual heritage is stunning.')
