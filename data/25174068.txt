We&#x27;ve already seen people imprisoned for using stimulus money[0] that was freely given out with no real checks. And that was from a completely right-wing administration and Department of Justice! People know they&#x27;ll take the money, they just don&#x27;t want the opportunity for the state to judge them for its &quot;generosity&quot;. It&#x27;s either no strings attached or not done at all.<p>- A diminishing set of options. People don&#x27;t like consolidation of control when the state nationalizes an area, distorts a market with its unlimited resources but is also not very competitive while retaining its ability to imprison and kill people. So people are afraid of that.<p>Underneath all the arguments about empathy, redistribution, how it is actually financed or expropriated, are those concerns.<p>[0] site search of doj.gov &quot;ppp indict&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?sxsrf=ALeKk009z-HSGv1tJet83_Rj3UGqW1xIvQ%3A1606010857252&amp;ei=6ce5X9PxDtHS-gT39bewDQ&amp;q=doj.gov+ppp+indictment&amp;oq=doj.gov+ppp+indictment&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIHCCEQChCgATIHCCEQChCgAToECCMQJzoLCC4QsQMQgwEQkQI6BQgAEJECOgsILhCxAxDHARCjAjoCCAA6BQgAELEDOgcIIxDqAhAnOgQIABBDOgIILjoFCC4QsQM6CggAELEDEMkDEEM6CwguELEDEMcBEK8BOggIABDJAxCRAjoFCAAQyQM6BAgAEAo6BwgAEMkDEAo6BAgAEB46CAgAEAgQChAeOgYIABAIEB46BAgAEA06BQghEKABOgUIIRCrAjoGCAAQFhAeUJg2WIZbYMhbaAdwAHgAgAF_iAHfFZIBBTE1LjEzmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdperABCsABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTipvViJXtAhVRqZ4KHff6DdYQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?sxsrf=ALeKk009z-HSGv1tJet83_Rj...</a>')
