Otherwise doctors will see ads about vaping and fishers will see ads about the latest JavaScript IDEs<p>Who the hell do you think you are to decide what is in my best interest? You are attempting to STEAL my attention. This is abusive behaviour. I don&#x27;t want this!<p>Also:<p>If I go on a page for fishing stuff, the shop is free to advertise certain fishing stuff products they want to push. ON THEIR PAGE. They do not need external content tracking people to the dog food page to show them the fishing ads there too. You don&#x27;t need any data for that and nobody would block ads like that because they&#x27;d be part of the content of the fishing stuff store.<p>You are telling a story which is based upon lies you hide behind this what you are not telling AND YOU KNOW IT! You are one of those shady players and you&#x27;ve shown it RIGHT HERE.')
