I also support efforts to reform and improve the prison system to focus on reform and improvement, rather than punishment.<p>Society decides that their crimes earns them X years of punishment.  After they&#x27;ve done their X years, there should be no need to punish them more.  I sympathize with the victims of the convict&#x27;s crimes which depending on the crime, no value of X would suffice.  But we are all human, and sometimes showing a shred of compassion is what motivates the real reform.')
