I haven&#x27;t noticed anyone else saying &quot;Tea. Earl Grey. Hot&quot;.<p>In any case I think this kind of speech is formulaic for the benefit of the audience, most of all, who are made aware through the formality that the speaker is addressing a machine. Additionally, we&#x27;re watching navy men and women in space, so we expect them to speak to each other and to their computers in a formulaic manner (&quot;Deck 5! Report!&quot; etc, I can&#x27;t think of good examples, brain&#x27;s too tired).<p>Or perhaps the idea is that Trek AI is not really as advanced as to be able to understand natural language and that makes Data such a unique specimen.<p>Then again, there&#x27;s the example of the Doctor in Voyager. I&#x27;m confused, I admit.')
