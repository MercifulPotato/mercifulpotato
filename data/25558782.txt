There&#x27;s no reason to assume that the lifetime of technological civilization is more than a few hundred years. By then they will have destroyed their own habitat and - despite some half-hearted (or even serious) attempts on colonizing different planets&#x2F;planetoids - will have come to an inglorious end.<p>Let&#x27;s be generous and say that the lifetime of a technological civilization is a thousand years. That&#x27;s the time that it can both send and receive signals from another technological civilization.<p>The chance that one technological civilization is able to receive the signals of another is so vanishingly small as to be zero for all practical purposes.')
