They just got forgotten about for awhile while the cycle between making updates to code and seeing the results was super fast. There&#x27;s no need for live components on a simple non-webpacked JS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS webpage. You just reload the page, or have the page reload automatically every second.<p>Now that Node and Webpack take absolutely forever (relatively speaking) to get your JS2020&#x2F;React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;Bootstrap&#x2F;SCSS app recompiled after a modification, being able to write the correct thing once and not have to wait a minute to have confidence in it is hugely valuable. Get the REPL time down to a second, and IDEs aren&#x27;t terribly valuable anymore.')
