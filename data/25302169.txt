They&#x27;re completely out of line with engineering and science jobs more broadly, including software engineering jobs in much of the US.<p>Which does suggest that someone going into software just for the money or, as GP or so commented, going through the motions and spending all their time prepping for Google interviews may be chasing a pretty transitory target.<p>Historically there&#x27;s very little to suggest that the segment of one profession that&#x27;s largely in one geographic area can sustainably capture super-premium compensation even though it doesn&#x27;t really require a higher level of skill than <i>many</i> others have throughout the country (and the world).<p>And the fact that a lot more flexibility in living location has come in essentially overnight means that a lot of companies are going to start looking more skeptically at some of the premiums they&#x27;re paying.')
