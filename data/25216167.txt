Maybe not go full on OEM, but a lot more than the CPU, because M1 is probably fundamentally winning with SoC design.<p>I would like to know if they are using fundamentally better batteries, and how much a 5nm process lead is behind this.<p>But I will hand it to Apple, if they finally did something to break the 4-8 hour battery life limit, a limit that always seemed to stay the same despite node shrink after node shrink after node shrink, and really about the same on-screen performance for usual browsing&#x2F;productivity application use.<p>I was pretty distrustful of the ARM move, but if they deliver this for the Macbook Pro, I&#x27;ll hop to ARM.<p>Associated with the CPU people &quot;getting serious&quot; is them pushing an OS, which would have to be Linux. Intel should have done this 20 years ago, at least as leverage to make Windows improve itself.')
