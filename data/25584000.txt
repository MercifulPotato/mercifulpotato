There might be the negative effect of reduced attention due to more &#x27;routine&#x27;.<p>But I seriously doubt that frequent drivers drive so much safer that they negate the effect of being exposed to the risk so much more. Is a person that drives 10x more than the average driver more than 10x safer? Why replace cars first, that don&#x27;t get on the street a lot? And how do you organize deploying SDCs to infrequent drivers first? Unless those people don&#x27;t own the cars anymore, but rent them, in which case I agree. That would increase utilizations of these cars.')
