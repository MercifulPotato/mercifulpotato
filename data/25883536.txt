Well deserved promotion.<p>The business made a business decision to evaluate the tech in order to save a critical service that had serious maintenance problems, and made another business decision to use the stack. I barely even advocated for it, I mentioned it one time, we decided to do a spike into feasibility, everyone was pleased with the outcome.<p>The libraries themselves were extensively documented from the start. I made a presentation introducing them before the service port was launched.<p>A greenfield service was under active development for several months before I resigned, and a grand total of two bugs were filed related to that (by me). The team using it had maybe five questions for me over that period. Other services were planned to be ported when feasible.<p>I did two weeks of knowledge transfer during my transition out of the business. I took great care to spend extra time on the most complex parts and had special sessions for what I was unashamed to call the “bad parts”.<p>Overall the reception was very good, and by the end of that there were very few questions. I’m reasonably sure I left my old team and adjacent teams on good footing to stay productive. And I offered to make myself available for free after the fact if anything needed further explanation (which hasn’t been needed).<p>Honestly I know “NIH syndrome” is a smell, but goodness I wish people had a little bit more inclination to take a charitable interpretation and ask questions before attacking.')
