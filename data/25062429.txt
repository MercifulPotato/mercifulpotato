I guess where I was coming from was that I would have expected some mechanism at the lower level of the OS to marshal this kind of behaviour, rather than it being trusted to the window manager. Maybe this stems from security being mainly thought of as a terminal &#x2F; ssh-level concern, rather than the GUI.<p>I will give KDE a go!')
