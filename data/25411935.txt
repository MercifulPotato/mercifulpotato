First of all, don&#x27;t end your sentence with a preposition. Second, nothing says the data was stolen. Here is a handy chart that will clarify between &quot;stealing&quot; data and accessing data without authorization:<p><pre><code>  Stealing Data vs Unauthorized Data Access:\n\n                    C - I - A\n\n  Stealing Data     Y   Y   Y\n\n  Unlawful Access   Y   !   N\n\n\n\n  C=Loss of Data Confidentiality\n  I=Loss of Data Integrity\n  A=Loss of Data Accessibility\n  !=Data may or may not have been altered depending on level of access.</code></pre>')
