Performance was Ok. Not any better than a  mid-tier home router for a third of the cost. But main issue was that all the configuration has to be done via the Home mobile app.  No web interface for configuration. Also things like port forwarding or setting isp static ip options are hidden away and only available after initial setup has completed. which again , is a wizard UI on a mobile app and provides very little control.')
