Motor accidents are not as strongly linked to economic despair either, and certainly not an effect of ideological choice.<p>Yes, in fact the upper, upper-middle, and largely the (prudish) middle class of society isn&#x27;t as impacted by drug overdose deaths as they are about the threat of genocide and war. The latter impacts everyone more or less equally. The former impacts a very narrow segment of society. It should then not come as a surprise that society assesses the risk (and devastation) of the two in different ways.<p>You need to remember that the median American is NOT an opioid addict. In fact the median American is fairly rich -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income#Median" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Disposable_household_and_per_c...</a>. While it is truly sad that there exists poor people that are addicted to opioids (and dying as a result), we have to remember that it&#x27;s a small minority of society as a whole, and the risk of becoming a drug addict isn&#x27;t uniform.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s hard to deny that the cause of this is not fundamentally caused by an over emphasis on free market ideology.<p>&quot;Free market ideology&quot; is entirely orthogonal to the issue, because the issue you pointed out is isolated in the US, but &quot;free market ideology&quot; is the predominant ideology of the liberal world where the issue you pointed out is notably absent.<p>In every single comparably wealthy country, the public sector makes up a (stark) minority of the workforce -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_public_sector_size" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_public_se...</a><p>The OECD average is 21%. There are countries that have <i>lower</i> public sector size than the US (Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, New Zealand, Japan, Austria) that have comparable (if not higher) human well-being. You cannot compare life in those countries to life in Syria&#x2F;Iraq&#x2F;Afghanistan, Kosovo, Central Africa, etc etc.<p>In the countries devoid of the kind of opioid deaths you speak of, economic freedom is among the highest, many even higher than the US -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_economic_freedom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_economic_...</a><p>Since you can&#x27;t reproduce that causation in other countries, you cannot conclude that there exists such a causation. It&#x27;s very much a &quot;US&quot; problem. Put simply, the safety net in the US has some holes in it.')
