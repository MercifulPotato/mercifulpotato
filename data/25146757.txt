This was not the standard behavior of commercials OS in the 1990&#x27;s. (not sure who pulled this first)<p>So the 100$ annual fee is more like a contribution to be recognized as a professional developer with extended support and services. Heck if you work in a team you don&#x27;t even need one account per developer.<p>This somehow guarantees that each account is linked to an identifiable real world entity and that bad actors won&#x27;t massively create fake account for free to muddy the water around illicit activities.<p>So by imposing a relatively modest fee they improve both traceability and avoid spamming behavior. This sound like a sensible design.<p>PS: I&#x27;m amazed by how on the same thread people can complain that the 1 million $ threshold for rebate is cruelly low AND that a 100$ entry fee is an unbearable tax. Internet trolling at it&#x27;s finest!')
