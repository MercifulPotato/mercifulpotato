For example, I bought worthless stock options, but let the ones that were eventually worth something (8 years later) expire!  It seemed like the right choices at the time. I panicked earlier this year and moved a bunch of 401k stuff into safer assets just in time to miss the biggest market boom in history!  And I moved and sold my house in Seattle (for a small profit, just before the crash, got lucky there -- the next owner defaulted) which is now worth 2x what I sold it for and I could have probably bought something in SF during the crash but wasn&#x27;t &quot;sure&quot; I was going to stay here so I missed.... the largest market boom in history!  Should have just kept the old one as a rental and bought a small condo. Once you can buy something, always buy the next one too if you can.  This is what my smarter friends have done and some of them own 4 houses now.  I could have.  I just didn&#x27;t.<p>If I bought something now I&#x27;d be in my 70&#x27;s before it was paid off and I can&#x27;t guarantee that I&#x27;d be able to pay it off by then.  And there&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s on one side of the family and strokes on the other, so I don&#x27;t expect to live that long, which I guess is the bank&#x27;s problem but... blah.<p>I also made all these choices when I didn&#x27;t have a partner or any peers in a similar situation to bounce these major decisions off of. I did have one smart friend who told me to keep the house in Seattle, I just didn&#x27;t listen. So guess this is all a long way of saying it does make sense to talk to someone if you can, and make some kind of long term plans that you don&#x27;t have to think about too much.<p>Thinking is really bad.  So is spending your entire career working for mid-tier startups that don&#x27;t go anywhere, but that&#x27;s a separate issue.')
