That isn&#x27;t counting. 42, 45, 47, 3, 4, 7, 37953, 37955, 37959, 11, 12, 15...<p>Actual counting on real hardware does happen. For example, x86 has the CX&#x2F;ECX&#x2F;RCX register for string operations. That has a far better justification for being called a program counter, but still that would be awful terminology. Another example is the CTR register of PowerPC, commonly used with an instruction that decrements it and then conditionally branches to do a loop. Even a cycle counter has better justification for being called a program counter.')
