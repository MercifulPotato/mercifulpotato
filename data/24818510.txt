And amusingly, they will actually nudge a cat out of the way to get the food.<p>They are incredibly noisy eaters, slurping and smacking so loud you can hear it through the walls if it&#x27;s quiet otherwise.<p>And this I would not have believed if my wife&#x27;s colleague hadn&#x27;t posted a video, but a hedgehog can and will drag a chicken of double it&#x27;s size out of the henhouse, kill it, and feast on it.')
