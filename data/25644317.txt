You cannot increase the font size at all in the desktop application<p>.... and so on.<p>Also, I tried to submit some bugs, but for that I&#x27;d need to have some information which only the admins have that run this instance, and in the end it was too much effort to get all that information together, so I didn&#x27;t even bother.')
