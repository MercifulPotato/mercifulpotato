It took around four and a half months to read it. I got the answers to some of the great mysteries related to human behavior.\nFor example,\n- Why don&#x27;t good people keep their promises?\n- Why do people don&#x27;t change their miserable life when their actions could change many things?\n- Why does charisma trump intelligence in most of the debates?\n- Why is it hard to change a habit?\n- Why do people judge so quickly.<p>It had a profound impact on me.
