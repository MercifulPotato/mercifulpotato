When you don&#x27;t need to press the pen you don&#x27;t need to have a tight grip on it and it allows for relaxed grip.<p>Once you learned to have a tight grip on your writing instrument you transfer it to other instruments. So if you&#x27;ve learned incorrectly with ballpoint pen, you will have hard time figuring out what the fuss about fountain pens is all about.<p>That&#x27;s why my kid who is currently actively learning writing is writing with fountain pen exclusively until he learns relaxed grip and good posture while writing. I assume then it won&#x27;t matter much what he is going to write with.')
