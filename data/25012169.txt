Or do your team just have a case of technical hubris? If your team isn&#x27;t capable of writing a better system then you don&#x27;t have technical debt, you just have an expensive system or a poor team.<p>Telling the difference between technical debt and technical hubris is hard, and giving in to technical hubris is much worse than living with technical debt since technical hubris is mostly just a every expensive way to create technical debt.')
