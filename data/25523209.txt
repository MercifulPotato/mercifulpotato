First time I hear that liquor&#x2F;spirit home delivery is <i>not</i> allowed. I regularly order spirits and other alcohol from shops online, to be delivered by regular mail, here in Germany. There is zero age verification that I am aware of, apart from some shops asking &quot;Are you over 18? (yes&#x2F;no)&quot; before you can place an order. I wouldn&#x27;t even be able to find the spirits I like in local shops. There is also home delivery by local delivery companies, where you can order all kinds of products like snacks and other things but mostly drinks of all kinds, including beer and wine and spirits, to be delivered within an hour or so, at higher prices.')
