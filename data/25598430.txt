Also likely unenforceable, but again, it sets the basis.<p>Since I sense that caller ID is completely spoofable for calls from international networks, now add some technical salt: Require domestic phone companies at the edges to add some kind of &quot;network of origin&quot; prefix to caller IDs from international origins. This is prepended to what is provided by the outside network, even if they provided &quot;no caller ID&quot; or &quot;unknown caller&quot;.<p>Make it that domestic calls don&#x27;t have this prefix and it is illegal to insert anything that resembles one.<p>This way I can see incoming calls from network Xyzabc for the junk they are. And networks will each get a reputation from consumers.<p>I can dream.')
