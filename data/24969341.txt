In complex systems like life, you should expect a lot of variance.<p>But one interesting observation I was reading about was the lack of navigable waterways. Waterways make travel and trade (especially in large quantities) much easier. That then leads to a lot of cultural mixing, learning, and shared prosperity. Africa lacks these navigable waterways compared with Northern and Western Europe or many parts of Asia.<p>The invention of air travel helps, but the second- and third-order effects will linger.<p>I should also point out that it&#x27;s not an unqualified bad thing. More separation leads to a different culture and, in some ways, more diversity. But it&#x27;s not great for prosperity.')
