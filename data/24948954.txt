It’s just gone. Evaporated,” he said.<p>I feel the same way. Except I never had COVID, at least as far as I know. But my life has been stopped just the same. I rarely get out, and we&#x27;ll probably be having another lockdown again here. Granted I&#x27;m living in one of the worst hotspots in Europe.<p>I know the measures are necessary and I follow them but they are incredibly tough especially on those of us living alone. We have to come up with some kind of some solution to get our lives back even if the vaccines don&#x27;t work. This can&#x27;t go on for years, it&#x27;s just too depressing. I&#x27;m suffering from many of the mentioned symptoms too, caused by depression. It&#x27;ll eventually cost lots of lives too.')
