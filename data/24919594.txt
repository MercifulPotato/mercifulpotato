A case without hospitalization is very different so a better number to evaluate health would be hospitalizations, especially extended hospitalizations and deaths. Fauci has said 20-40 percent of people who contract the virus may be asymptomatic. That means those people don’t even sniffle once and are not getting tested because they don’t ever get sick. This was shown early on in controlled groups on a military ship where they tested full populations even those not sick and found 40 percent of the people who had the virus were asymptomatic.')
