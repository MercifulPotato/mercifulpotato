I ended up in a tough situation in college (someone bailed on housing part way through the semester), and I cut out fast food entirely. Take for example, the ubiquitous Big Mac meal, A drink, a burger, and fries for $5.99 (plus tax). You can assemble that your self (sans fries, maybe a salad instead) for probably $3 even. You can save up to 40% buying ground beef in larger &quot;family packs&quot;, getting super cheap store-brand bread and buns helps stretch your money a bit more. Getting vegetables in bulk packs from places like Costco can save you money, that was pretty life changing to discover. When you really look at it, there&#x27;s probably $2.50 of labor built into every fast food meal that you can save by cooking for yourself.')
