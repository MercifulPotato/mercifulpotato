I get it; many scientific papers are to some extent bs, and many are just wrong. For PhDs, it&#x27;s a hassle to go through all of that bs to find something that is actually true. I feel like PhDs basically have to spend hundreds of hours reading papers that don&#x27;t really benefit them. Tools like this could probably help with that, but as long as scientific success is measured by how may papers you&#x27;ve published and&#x2F;or how long your papers are, I don&#x27;t see any hope of actually doing science in the coming years when the academia will be essentially &quot;saturated&quot; with papers.')
