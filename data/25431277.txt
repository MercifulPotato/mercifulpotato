Item(by='trident5000', descendants=None, kids=[25431356, 25431727], score=None, time=1608047070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25430689, text='YouTube has just as much of a monopoly in its category if not more than Facebook (with similar influence over society) yet we dont see the level of regular attacks (I&#x27;m not here to defend either, I&#x27;m a critic, but just pointing this out).  Facebook total users: about 2.7 billion (with probably 80% dominance in its category).  YouTube: about 2 billion but with a ~95% video stream dominance.  The difference seems to be in the politics.  I don&#x27;t see the Atlantic or peers coming down on YouTubes dominance and influence.<p>Edit: As others have pointed out in here the difference might also be financial.  Facebook publishes news articles and YouTube does not.  A broken up Facebook offers a fractured publishing market and better pricing for news distribution.')
