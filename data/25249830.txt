Strategies include: comparing multiple sources, checking on the background of the alleged experts, picking out a few interesting but verifiable statements from their argument and fact-checking those, finding an opposing argument and seeing which argument seems to make more sense or be better supported.<p>Having attended school through tenth grade... There were maybe a <i>couple</i> of assignments over the years in which we were told to choose a topic, do research on it while following some of the above (explicitly stated) strategies, and write it all up.<p>The rest of the time, though, it was a lot more like &quot;this stuff is fact&quot; and you&#x27;re not really encouraged to doubt it or look closely into the evidence chain.  Evidence or proof might be presented (textbooks often mention it), or might not.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that the whole &quot;skeptically evaluating your chosen experts&quot; thing was considered a core skill or habit to cultivate (probably a few teachers considered it such, but their curricula didn&#x27;t really emphasize it).')
