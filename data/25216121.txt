I&#x27;ve had coworkers that became better employees over time.  The &quot;problem&quot; with PIPs is by the time you&#x27;ve screwed up long enough to be put on a PIP everyone knows there&#x27;s no turning back.<p>For example, a friend I have that recently left Facebook knew for a good 6 months he needed to shape up.  But they hadn&#x27;t put him on a PIP in that time.  They eventually offered him a decent severance to quit, and he took that rather than continuing to try.  If he stayed, he probably would have been put on a PIP fairly shortly.  It was the best thing for everyone.  He wasn&#x27;t all that happy there anyways.')
