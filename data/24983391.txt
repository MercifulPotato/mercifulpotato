One hint for anyone who tries this:<p>The voltage is wrong.  The same board is used for ECP5 and ECP5-5G, but the analog VDD is set for the ECP5-5G chip, which is too high for ECP5 non-5G.  With too high analog VDD, the SERDES TX PLL does not lock at lower frequencies (and the TXPLL loss of lock indicator is set).<p>(Also this board has a 156.56 MHz oscillator, but you really need a 125 MHz clock for Ethernet.  I just replaced the oscillator with a 125 MHz one, but other solutions are probably acceptable).<p>Even with this fix, and after you connect it to the network, the SERDES comma detect indication is sometimes stable after power up, and sometimes not.  Resetting the SERDES does not help.  The register interface to the SERDES allows you to repower the TXPLL.  So right now, my RISC-V softcore repowers it every second until the first link up happens.  After the first successful link-up, it&#x27;s fine.  This hack does not work on every board, unfortunately.<p>Yes, I&#x27;ve contacted Lattice support, no response from them in a long time.  ECP5 is pretty dated at this point, so I&#x27;m wondering if any of the development team is left to support it.')
