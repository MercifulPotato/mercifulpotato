If and when Texas legalizes there will be immense amounts of private equity involved (lots of money here) and it will go ConAgra-ADM-Monsanto overnight.<p>People here do business, and Ag, really big. Fuck even one of the grocery chains is vertically integrated. They own everything from farms to shrimp boats.<p>My chances of doing anything are shot, except maybe high-end boutique low-yield stuff with lots of marketing.')
