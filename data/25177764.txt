This is part 5 of my Python behind the scenes series. The topic of this post is Python variables, which is not as simple as it may seem at first. Here&#x27;s some of the things we&#x27;ll cover:<p><pre><code>  - what an assignment statement like a = b really means in Python\n  - what a variable is\n  - how CPython maps names to values\n  - what namespaces and scopes are and how to determine the scope of a name\n  - which opcodes the CPython compiler produces to work with variables, and how the CPython VM executes these opcodes\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d like to hear your feedback. Thanks!')
