It felt like pulling teeth to try and even get meaning out of some sections. #3 in particular is so nebulous I struggle to find the lesson at all. To me, this seems like a case of bad writing organization. If done better, I bet this piece would be half the length of current.<p>As to the contentious content: taking time to understand how your company works, great! Needing 6 months before being considered useful? Huge red flag.<p>&gt; When youâ€™re in a company full of smart people, like Shopify, it can often be quite tricky to resolve disagreements and impasses<p>Here&#x27;s another huge red flag for me. The later explanation around having an idea of how the leadership&#x2F;company thinks? Great. But having that philosophy&#x2F;approach outlined should make resolution a lot easier. The &quot;full of smart people&quot; excuse could be rooted in a few things, but I struggle to think of a good one.')
