Installation information is things like keys to sign the code if the platform it is for only runs signed code.<p>The installation information requirement only applies when the object code was conveyed &quot;as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized)&quot;. A &quot;User Product&quot; is &quot;either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling&quot;.<p>GPLv3 object code that is not conveyed as part of a change of possession of a User Product is not subject to the installation information requirement. This requirement was added to GPLv3 specifically to stop what TiVo was doing--shipping GPL code on their boxes that could not be replaced by the user--and it was narrowly drafted to only cover that situation.')
