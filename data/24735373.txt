Item(by='ajxs', descendants=None, kids=[24735382], score=None, time=1602285337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735178, text='&gt; Its an issue of disinformation, not stupidity, that&#x27;s leading people down the wrong path...<p>You&#x27;re wrong. The difficulty has always been that the most pervasive so-called &#x27;misinformation&#x27; is usually fairly plausible, difficult to validate, or simply matters of opinion or interpretation. The notion that Obama is a Muslim strains credulity, and it&#x27;s not a widely held belief. What about more complex information, such as religious or political texts? These are even more difficult to validate and cause much more harm. Maybe we should just outright ban the communist manifesto? That seems to have caused a large amount of social harm and could be fairly readily classified as &#x27;disinformation&#x27;. What about the Christian bible? The Koran? They&#x27;re full of difficult to validate claims.<p>&gt; What is your plan to deal with the disinformation here?<p>What disinformation? The information <i>you</i> don&#x27;t like, or the information <i>I</i> don&#x27;t like?<p>&gt; We&#x27;re not in an Orwellian fantasy, we&#x27;re in an all-out information-war...\n&gt; Several groups have learned how to weaponize information for their own gain...<p>The fact that you seem to see that information has been weaponised, but can&#x27;t seem to see that big-tech&#x27;s censorship is pursuant to their own political aspirations is alarming. Are you legitimately this biased, or just being disingenuous?')
