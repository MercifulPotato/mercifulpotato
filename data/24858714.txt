The table is also super important. I‘ve recently switched to an Eliot (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eliotfurniture.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eliotfurniture.com&#x2F;</a>) that you can electrically move up and down to enable working in standing and sitting positioning. That made a much bigger difference to me than just a new chair. Switching multiple times a day from sitting to standing and back is such an improvement. I wouldn’t want to go back to all day sitting!')
