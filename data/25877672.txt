Everything is verbose (by today standards anyway). ObjC is a &quot;child&quot; of the 1980&#x27;s when verbosity was considered a merit and a norm in programming.<p>Two things that I used to like about it:<p>- Combination of static typing and at the same time pretty high level dynamic typing: it was practically possible to call any method on any object, right or wrong, just like in dynamic languages. For performance critical parts you could always resort to C. Later, as a little bonus it was also possible to resort to... C++. There was such a beast as Objective-C++.<p>- The method calling syntax. Quite unusual but neat. I liked it a lot.<p>However, Swift ruined it for me. Now that I&#x27;m a total Swift convert and I feel a 2x or even 3x boost in productivity I can&#x27;t even look at Objective-C code anymore.')
