Life expectancy at birth has increased significantly more because of reduced risk of death for newborns, infants and even teenagers. But once you are of a certain age, those risks are gone, and there not much has changed.<p>No, I don&#x27;t believe in scifi. Theses are all fantasies. Just as little as I believe in living on mars being a great alternative to earth. Nice scifi story, but in real life, things are different.<p>If you just look at the spread obesity in the U.S. and its effect on life expectancy, please tell me again with a straight face that you expect &quot;people live to be over 100&quot; in the future. And no, they don&#x27;t today. You are talking about a really really small minority, and that minority was already there 50 years ago. In 1970.<p>Edit: Life expectancy for a 50 yeah old in 1920 in Sweden was about 9 years shorter than today.')
