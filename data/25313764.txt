This means they can&#x27;t share data unless through parameters.<p>Polymorphism is possible, but not really encapsulation. One could argue that arrays&#x2F;objects would cause consistency problems, and therefore don&#x27;t belong in a data language.<p>Someone expecting python-like OO programming will go mad.<p>The performance argument depends on the whether the database is limited by CPU or bandwidth and what the load looks like. It&#x27;s shown in benchmarks that the round-trip between db&#x2F;network&#x2F;orm&#x2F;app takes many orders of magnitude longer than the procedures themselves.')
