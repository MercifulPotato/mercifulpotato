If it wasn’t for my wife’s help, we wouldn’t make it to the end of the fortnight. We have a teenage daughter. If this was my salary level indefinitely, it would not be sustainable in the long term because we wouldn’t be able to afford any extra spending e.g. buying a new car. We live in an expensive part of Sydney so moving to a different area would result in some savings and we would almost (but not quite) have as much as my pre-covid disposable income which was more than OK for us. Moving would not be painless though, e.g. my daughter would have to go to a new school and lose touch with her friends which isn’t easy for a teenager.<p>I guess what I’m trying to say is - coming back to the original comment that started this thread - in some expensive cities, 2M doesn’t really change your life much (at least, not to the extent that you can think “I’m rich now I don’t have to worry about money ever again”). Personally I’m thinking about moving to a less expensive area, now that remote work has become even more common.<p>Important note: all my reasoning is in AUD but probably OP meant USD 2M. That would be about AUD 2.6M. So, more than 2M but not by an order of magnitude.')
