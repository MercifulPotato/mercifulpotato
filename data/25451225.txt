When they saw us recording them while they were writing a ticket, they shined a bright flashlight at our camera so that it would ruin the exposure and not capture anything useful. They were very deliberate about this and it was quite effective.<p>Something does seem wrong about police in public not wanting to be recorded while doing their (taxpayer funded) job and holding extra power over the citizen (a police&#x27;s word in court generally comes with a special authority).')
