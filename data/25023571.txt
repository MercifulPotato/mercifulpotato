If you need a resume item, then just go React. A lot of what React offers on teams is that it makes it dead simple to make a reusable component. I’ll throw a rock at someone at work if they didn’t make the component sensibly reusable (takes obvious props, does one predictable thing, doesn’t take 50 props, etc - you know, the same kind of shit you’d expect of a good function, sane defaults, sane arity, sane output).<p>It’s hard to expect people to make a sane function, let alone a sane front end component. Before React, our expectations were zero in this space. If you care about these things, invest the time and learn React. If not, jquery is more than enough to build the most robust modern ui that will be performant. In other words, show me the most advanced&#x2F;performant user interface you see on the internet today and I’ll show you how to do it with jquery (you have my word on this).')
