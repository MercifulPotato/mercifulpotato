I wonder if any birds do something similar to distinguish, e.g. &quot;Predator!&quot; vs &quot;Predator?&quot;. Maybe someday an app on our phones will be able to translate as we walk through the woods, like &quot;A female Carolina chickadee in the sycamore at 10 o&#x27;clock says there&#x27;s a raven coming from the south&quot;.')
