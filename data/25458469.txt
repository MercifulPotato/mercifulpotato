I just think that, until we see the document in question, we can&#x27;t squarely say that it <i>is</i> their fault. Preview and Acrobat both have ways of dealing with junk&#x2F;bogus data and I feel like that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here. There must have been some kind of bit switched when the document was &quot;corrected&quot; and it&#x27;s possible that Acrobat and Preview just resolve that issue differently while both still outputting &quot;valid&quot; PDF files.')
