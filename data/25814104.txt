The entire source is open to examine and modify (registration required).<p>Resource management can be a really big chunk of the core game engine.  One reason there is less documentation is that there is generally not one right way to do it.  Different games have very different requirements and solutions that work for one game&#x2F;genre will hurt performance (or team productivity) for another.<p>One infamous example was the EA Superman game which was developed using the Madden NFL engine.  At a very top level that may have been a good idea (battle tested Multiplatform engine with great character rendering). The game requirements of long draw distances, scripted gameplay, and detailed city environments were (very sensibly) not something the engine had been designed for and so became enormous issues for the Superman team.')
