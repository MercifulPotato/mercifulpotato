I need a programming language!<p>Almost no problem is too trivial to not want a programming language attached to it which begs the question - why don&#x27;t we already have it? I hope the answer is quite simply that we&#x27;ve been so focused on new hardware, that software is lagging behind. There are more sinister possibilities but I&#x27;d err on the side of nobody having made it a priority because most people think small by default.')
