Reaching out and attempting to align with the party you are contacting is being vulnerable and has no guarantee of a favorable response - or one at all. However, that is something in itself that may either characterize the individual or could simply be a reflection of what they are currently going through. Some knowledge of this can be baked into the initial message to imply understanding of that person&#x27;s situation in life, mental state, interests, etc. It is more difficult to connect with someone whose point of view you are oblivious to.')
