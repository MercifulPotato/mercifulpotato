I feel as if netflix doesn&#x27;t press their writers and the creatives enough to develop a full arc for a story.<p>It seems like every shows&#x27; got an idea. And then once they get funding they start thinking through the details. I know it would be a lot of ask and probably expensive but people write novels all the time. Netflix could break the mold by looking for stories that fit something like 24 chapters &#x2F; episodes and having a complete &#x27;thing&#x27; at the end of it.
