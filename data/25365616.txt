You can&#x27;t go 10 minutes in many LGBT spaces without hearing someone using the f-slur in an affectionate way. Also banned is &quot;b!tch&quot;, which is not really considered that offensive in most of the US between female friends, as well as &quot;pu!sy&quot;, which is maybe vulgar but not an offensive term at all (I notice &quot;dick&quot; didn&#x27;t make cut). Maybe for a site like Hacker News those terms aren&#x27;t usually appropriate, but I see Lemmy \\more as a replacement for Reddit and I&#x27;d hoped it would be inclusive to everyone, not just to those in their bubble.<p>I don&#x27;t know how their system works, if using these words just means the comment won&#x27;t be shared or if it flags it for a moderator&#x27;s attention, but I don&#x27;t think so. Here&#x27;s a direct quote from a developer:<p>&gt; I&#x27;ll have to think about this. Hard-coding it means I don&#x27;t have to do a database migration every time someone comes up with a new slur. And putting it in a DB table means someone could very easily remove it by deleting every row of that table, which isn&#x27;t good. I want to make it <i>very</i> difficult for racist trolls to use the most updated version of Lemmy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LemmyNet&#x2F;lemmy&#x2F;issues&#x2F;622" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LemmyNet&#x2F;lemmy&#x2F;issues&#x2F;622</a><p>In my view this goes against the core point of the fediverse. The whole reason I like the fediverse is because it democratizes control by giving it to the users instead of a small-group of potentially self-interested owners.<p>(After googling I found out &quot;n!ps&quot; can be used as a racial slur but I associate it with a funny slang for &quot;nipples&quot;. I wondered how the AI conference dealt with this but apparently they changed their name a couple years back to avoid connotations with the slur so maybe it&#x27;s more widespread&#x2F;well known than I thought.)<p>(edit: censored slurs. asterisk didn&#x27;t work because it triggered the markdown so I used !)')
