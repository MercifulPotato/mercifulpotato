The inspiration faucet often doesn&#x27;t just turn on when you need it to.<p>By collecting fieldstones (little ideas) and polishing&#x2F;rewriting over time whenever one feels strongly about a particular subject, one is able to draw on an existing collection of partially-written drafts on diverse topics that can be deployed quickly. Or combine several similar ideas and deploy a more polished&#x2F;comprehensive treatment of a subject than would be possible with an on-the-spot piece.<p>It also accounts for the fact that our interests shift. I don&#x27;t know about others but I often get into phases where I become intensely interested in a subject, research it to heck until the interest peters out. I was once really interested in the topic of alleviating loneliness because I was profoundly affected by it. I&#x27;d written many fieldstones on the topic, and contemplated it a lot. If I were given a task to write about loneliness right now, I&#x27;d probably struggle because I&#x27;m no longer as intimate  with (nor as interested in) the subject as I once was, but with fieldstones I can draw on all the (partial) analyses I&#x27;d done when I was in that phase.<p>The fieldstone method is more than just about taking notes -- it&#x27;s about brewing them over time based on one&#x27;s feelings.')
