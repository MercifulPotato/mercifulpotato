If anything, it seems like a disadvantage if people are in different time zones. Are ordinary companies suffering from the lack of geographical diversity? And even if it has some advantages, is it really worth it? According to their compensation calculator[1] an intermediate backend engineer would earn $76,939 in Armenia and $142,085 in Hong Kong. That&#x27;s almost twice as much. Is an engineer living in Hong Kong really worth two engineers living in Armenia because he ads geographical diversity? And even if geographical diversity is important, couldn&#x27;t you get plenty of it from various low income countries on different continents?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;total-rewards&#x2F;compensation&#x2F;compensation-calculator&#x2F;calculator&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;total-rewards&#x2F;compensation...</a>')
