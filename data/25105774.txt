This is a big part of OP&#x27;s question, but I&#x27;ll entertain it.<p>You have to look at the 2000 election[0] where there was a switch to digital means. I don&#x27;t have exact numbers, but I am under the impression that these machines are easier to use and are less error prone than the previous punch card methods. Your digital machines can also print you a receipt. So &quot;why have a (digital) voting machine at all&quot; is because it is easier and less error prone. Having election results going to the Supreme Court is a pretty big deal and should be avoided.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2000_United_States_presidential_election#Voting_machines" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2000_United_States_presidentia...</a>')
