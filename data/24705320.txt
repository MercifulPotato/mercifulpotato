Item(by='barry-cotter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602045084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24704414, text='&gt; The combination of state, local, and federal school funding makes it so that the districts attended by poor students are funded 2.5% more than non-poor students. And even within districts, “schools with less advantaged students spend at least as much (and often significantly more).”<p>...<p>&gt; Property based funding of schools is not likely to be a very effective target for school reform since our current system does not actually have large differences in the funding of poor students. I think that it is more likely that the dysfunction in the schools is best explained by a lack of continuity and efficiency within the schools that serve poor students.\nThe property tax debate is mostly just an easy but misguided target for explaining the achievement gap. On top of the pure fact that property based taxes have actually still allowed for the progressive funding of schools, we already have examples of states that fund students without a total reliance on local property taxes.\nTake Michigan. Michigan has a centralized funding source for their students. The state takes an overall tax and then breaks it up evenly across students within the state (there are extra complexities to this that are addressed in this article). Even with these changes in school funding, it does not appear that the reformed funding strategy had any impact on student outcomes.\nIn general, funding is not a good proxy for educational quality.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@coreykeyser&#x2F;why-conventional-wisdom-on-education-reform-is-wrong-a-primer-f6c0361a48d1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@coreykeyser&#x2F;why-conventional-wisdom-on-e...</a>')
