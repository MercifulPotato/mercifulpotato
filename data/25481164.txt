According to a November 23rd letter to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), Foxconn does not think the factory specified in the contract, an enormous Generation 10.5 LCD fabrication facility, was actually a “material” part of the contract.<p>Come on, the contract specifies a large manufacturing plant. They build a tiny storage building instead. I&#x27;ll buy it doesn&#x27;t have to be an LCD factory, but it needs to be something with comparable jobs.<p>Good on Wisconsin for holding their feet to the fire. Too many of these corporate welfare packages end up being paid out even though the company keeps none of their promises.<p>HP got a bunch of corporate freebies to build a big facility in my city. The promise was that it would be a high salary corporate facility with highly paid sales and engineering.<p>They built their big subsidized building and it ended up being a glorified call center.')
