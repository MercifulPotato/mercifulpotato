I&#x27;m not honestly sure why there&#x27;s so much discussion about security clearances.<p>If someone gets your grindr account they can get your (a) address, (b) phone number, and (c) private photos, none of which would otherwise be public. So let&#x27;s just get that out there. A reasonable user would not expect that any of those three things are readily available to a stranger that they&#x27;ve never talked to who merely has their email address. Especially if they turn off distances specifically to avoid triangulation attacks on their location.<p>Those pieces of information can be used together to harrass, commit violence, or threaten to leak your photos or personal (albeit sure, not &quot;private&quot;) conversations. Those are the obvious ones, but other information in there can also hidden from public view, like HIV status.<p>With this bug a malicious person could knowingly target you based on <i>email address</i> instead of finding you and even putting the work into catfishing you into sending them embarrassing photos.<p>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a higher blackmail risk but only because of the hack, a little. Catfishes still existed but this makes doing it invisible and massive in scale while associating it with a public ID like your email address.')
