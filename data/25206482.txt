If you use C# and structs it just allocates a flat array of floats with zero overhead.<p>Not only do you pointlessly use memory, you have indirection lookup costs, potential cache misses, more objects for GC to traverse, etc. etc.<p>JVM really sucks at this kind of stuff and so much of GUI programming is passing around small structs like that for rendering.<p>FWIW I think they are working on some proposal to add value types to JVM but that probably won&#x27;t reach Android ever.')
