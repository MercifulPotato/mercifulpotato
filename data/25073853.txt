Had to wait a solid second or so before hitting return to have a decent chance of getting the correct page.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced something similar before Safari 14: when opening Safari for the first time and quickly pasting the URL to the address bar and hitting Enter, the URL would just disappear and I&#x27;d hear a bell sound. Had to wait a second to paste the URL and have it actually go to that page. These little things contribute to a general feeling that the browser is not polished enough for everyday use.')
