And most programmers&#x27; editors that I&#x27;ve use allow you to insert tab chars, and visualize them as well (often as some sort of arrow).  In my work (which has to do almost exclusively in language data, ASCII and otherwise), a tab should never appear in text; if it does, I replace it with a single (or multiple) space chars in a preprocessing step.<p>I suppose the other place that one might encounter tabs is in computer programs, most notoriously in makefiles.  (You can tell which side of the tabs vs. spaces delimiting argument I come down on.)  But then I&#x27;ve never had to send a makefile inside a TSV file...')
