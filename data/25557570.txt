I just follow their work.<p>This paper introduces their SDR concept by applying it to deep learning and demonstrating similar results with improved speed and power efficiency.<p>They are not trying to do deep learning at all. In fact, it&#x27;s the opposite. They are trying to say &quot;deep learning is not the right model&quot; but without explicitly saying it which would surely get everyone to just dismiss them right off the bat.')
