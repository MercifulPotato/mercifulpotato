But I also use the laptop a lot on the couch, not just for traveling - so I wondered if I would find it annoying to have a separate desktop machine.<p>So far it&#x27;s been well worth it. The desktop performance is much better (especially for gaming) and Dropbox, git, Chrome sync and VS Code sync make having multiple machines relatively painless.<p>Edit: I see in previous comments you were looking for a full sized bluetooth keyboard. I recently got a Logitech G915 [0] and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. Expensive though.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logitechg.com&#x2F;en-eu&#x2F;products&#x2F;gaming-keyboards&#x2F;g915-low-profile-wireless-mechanical-gaming-keyboard.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.logitechg.com&#x2F;en-eu&#x2F;products&#x2F;gaming-keyboards&#x2F;g9...</a>')
