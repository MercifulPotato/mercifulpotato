But it&#x27;s also never been categorically described as something with X properties, it&#x27;s always been accepted as &quot;something unaccounted for for which we need SOME OTHER model to explain&quot;, even after it became Noetherian (you still need to define the <i>field</i>).<p>Maybe I don&#x27;t understand your usage but it is rather confusing that you call MOND heavily backfitted and not dark matter.  The traditional complaint about dark matter is that it is highly parameterized, requiring an empirically fit factor for each galaxy observed.  Am I missing something?')
