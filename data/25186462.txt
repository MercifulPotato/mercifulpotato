I started working on it before I saw bvckup2 and then at some point came across it and then could not unsee it design wise so you&#x27;re right. Some things are very heavily inspired off their awesome design.<p>Outside of the main window though, lots of other things are quite different and completely independently arrived at. Bvckup2 doesn&#x27;t have third party storage support so everything else requires a fundamentally different UI to work in BlobBackup. Look at the settings windows and the menus for example.')
