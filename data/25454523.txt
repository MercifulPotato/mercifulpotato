There seems to be so little effort spent on the scripts of most shows these days, resulting in tiring copy-pasta plot element etc.<p>Most recently I tried to watch Cursed. From the very first episode me and my gf predicted every plot beat. I tried to force myself to watch the rest of the show, just to see if it improved, but it was the same lame stuff throughout.<p>Another big pain point for me it&#x27;s drama for the sake of drama. I almost categorically avoid 20-episodes-per-season shows because they almost always contains tons of filler drama that does nothing to advance the show or characters.<p>In sum it really narrows down what I deem watchable. Instead I find myself watching a lot of YouTube videos, with informative or creative content.<p>At least I avoid yet another rehash of a tired trope which was included solely for the rest of the plot to happen.')
