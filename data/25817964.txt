If you&#x27;re never shutting for the day any doses you have right now are for the next patients, if you&#x27;re vaccinating patients more quickly than anticipated you can bring forward some appointments but you never have this hard cut off.<p>After all, under total lockdown it&#x27;s not as though you&#x27;re likely to be anywhere except at home waiting to get an appointment.<p>An interesting contrast will be New Zealand. Since they have community elimination they didn&#x27;t seek emergency use authorisation, why not wait and study what happens to the millions of people from other developed countries who needed urgent vaccination? They will do mass population vaccination during 2021 but this month or next doesn&#x27;t mean thousands or even handfuls of deaths, so there is no hurry.<p>This might reduce take up. If you live in New York you probably at least know somebody who got badly sick, maybe died - but if you live in Wellington you likely have stopped even thinking about the pandemic most days unless you work in quarantine or the tourist industry.')
