Objects are absent in most of what I write.  But the 10% or so of the time I use objects, it is because objects are the best way I can think of to structure the program.<p>So I don&#x27;t think objects in Python are useless at all.  I think Python is designed in a way that allows them to be used effectively if desired, or avoided all together when there&#x27;s no apparent benefit.')
