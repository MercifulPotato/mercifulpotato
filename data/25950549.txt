Say an auction house auctions off a picture. But right during the auction they announce, point to their TOS, that out of all the present bidders, only 1 person is allowed to bid. This one person then buys the picture at a fraction of the price that would have been expected if all people were allowed to bid.<p>On top of that it turns out that the one person bidding is part of a museum that has a significant stake in the auction house.<p>Of course comparisons like that break quickly. But it is very obvious that market-makers (or other players behind the scenes) were extremly worried about the coming squeeze and did that to stop the stock from going higher.')
