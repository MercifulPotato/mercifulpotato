C++ mostly, a lot of Python, some Xojo.<p>&gt; <i>With that many users, you are going to break something for someone. Probably for tens of millions of someones, at the minimum.</i><p>Maybe. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a given though.<p>&gt; <i>At some point you will have to break something. Some of the new stuff will be incompatible with the old stuff. No one has a crystal ball.</i><p>Why? At no point does making something modular <i>have</i> to break something. Usually when something breaks during modularization it&#x27;s because it was <i>already</i> broken and modularization simply made it need to get fixed.')
