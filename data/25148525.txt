I&#x27;m currently on a Nexus 6P that has had two battery replacements and currently requires a vice to crush the centre of the screen every time I wish to charge it (doesn&#x27;t recognise charging until you do - something to do with temperature sensor on battery). Screen-on time is ~45 minutes.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to getting a new device.')
