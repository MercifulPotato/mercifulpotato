They don&#x27;t care. You raised this issue probably because you work in the &quot;start-up industry&quot; :)<p>Long version, from the beginning:<p>When we started two years ago, the lifetime option cost $60. Why? Because we created an online editor for Bootstrap only, and Bootstrap Studio (similar software then) had a lifetime option, and it cost... $60 (I just checked, and it still costs $60 for a lifetime license).<p>For proof, you can check the link in my first comment. It&#x27;s about Bootstrap Shuffle (and that&#x27;s why today our editor is called Shuffle :)).<p>Please note that their software (Bootstrap Studio) is a desktop application; they don&#x27;t have infrastructure cost, etc. But back then, I chose price by comparison.<p>In the meantime, we added support for Tailwind CSS, Bulma CSS, and Material-UI.<p>Today, the lifetime option price is related to our LTV and our funding (no VC funding). And that&#x27;s why we prefer real revenue to imagined&#x2F;estimated future revenue in excel. ;)<p>And lifetime option converts a lot better than annual (a mean 2x better). I tested it a few times.<p>We may remove this option in the future (for new customers only!), but today lifetime subscription is not something that worries us :)')
