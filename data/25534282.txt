This clearly has not happened. (Or the request was not forceful enough.)<p>If YC does make the request, and TripleByte disagrees, then YC should publicly distance itself from TripleByte.<p>It’s like a milder version of what YC must do if a YC startup, say, starts making murder drones. YC doesn’t control what YC-affiliated startups do, but they have a <i>lot</i> of influence. In certain cases, YC is morally obligated to exert that influence. If they don’t, then they are complicit, and they hurt their own brand.')
