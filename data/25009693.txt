I am curious to learn more.\nWhy do you feel that this will make your life more miserable<p>This tool isn&#x27;t meant solely for managers.

They can choose to share the feedback with their managers if they want.<p>We hope that this will make the feedback process more objective rather than be subjective on the manager&#x27;s whim who may not know what you are doing and be impacted by recency bias.')
