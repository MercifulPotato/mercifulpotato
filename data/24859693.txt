Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24862831], score=None, time=1603383544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24859042, text='&gt; This memo[1] seems to assert that they would not be friends to free speech against encroachment by the government if the speech were speech they didn&#x27;t like.<p>It <i>explicitly</i> says the opposite, but does indicate that they would not be able to legally represent people making such speech if the terms of such representation would restrict the ACLU from criticizing the viewpoint being advanced while defending the right to advance it: &quot;While the ACLU vigorously defends the right to free speech of those who espouse views\nantithetical to our own, we also reserve our right to condemn those views. Our defense of free speech rests squarely on the proposition that speech deserves defending even if we, or others in the community, find it reprehensible. Accordingly, as a general matter we should be\nable to simultaneously defend a speakerâ€™s right to speak and condemn their views, and we should seek to preserve that right through ethically appropriate representation agreements.  [...] But we generally should not agree to represent people who will not agree to sign an ethically appropriate advance waiver of potential conflicts\narising from our condemnation of their views.&quot;')
