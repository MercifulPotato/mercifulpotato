You would EXPECT this pattern to arise. Note also how OP does not show a graph of trade volume&#x2F;buy-sell volume which would potentially show that it is used as claimed.<p>I still think Tether is extremely shady for refusing audits and dubious backing. I avoid it like the plague and hope others are as smart.')
