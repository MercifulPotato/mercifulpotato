Otherwise they just get used by privileged individuals for their own purposes, adding a veneer of legitimacy. And creating bureaucracy is just not compatible with software communities - developers want to focus on software, and continue to do software outside of work to get <i>away from</i> heavyweight management and HR. The rise of COCs have more to do with the corporate colonization of software communities than the desire for social justice.<p>If OP had just been informally ostracized for whatever they <i>actually</i> did that made them not liked, they likely wouldn&#x27;t be writing this blog post. They might find a different community, they might learn the unwritten social rules, or they might never learn. But they wouldn&#x27;t need to write a blog post attempting to exonerate themselves from the black mark of a &quot;COC violation&quot; and rationalizing how the system attacked them.')
