Children cannot legally consent to sexual activity because they cannot meaningfully consent to it in the moral sense, either. ... Therefore, all sexual activity between an adult and a child is rape.<p>That is very jurisdiction-specific &#x2F; cultural-specific position. In my home country, there is clear legal disctinction between child rape (non-consensual sex with child) and child sex abuse (consensual sex with child).<p>I would be surprised if the &#x27;age-of-consent&#x27; laws (the age limit name is also cultural specific, here it is &#x27;age-of-legal-competence&#x27;) were generally motivated by legal fiction about children unable to give consent. That seems to me more like ex-post rationalization of such laws. IMHO these laws just codify social mores without need of specific rationalization (like incest laws).')
