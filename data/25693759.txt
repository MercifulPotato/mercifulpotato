Actual censorship, which was seen in Eastern and Central Europe and some other places during communism meant that you&#x27;re literally not allowed to say certain things. You&#x27;d be prosecuted by the government if someone reported you or the government found out in any way that you were spreading certain kind of &quot;forbidden&quot; ideas. It didn&#x27;t matter where you said it, when you said it, to how many people you said it, and if you used your own platform to say it or someone else&#x27;s. It was simply not allowed.<p>What Americans call censorship is not that. Anyone who is banned from a particular platform still has freedom of speech. They can say whatever they want to whoever they want without the fear of government prosecution. If Twitter bans someone, it doesn&#x27;t mean that the banned person can&#x27;t speak somewhere else. Everyone has a right to moderate their private property which includes digital space. Although banned from Twitter and some other platforms, Trump didn&#x27;t lose his freedom of speech. He can say whatever he wants. It&#x27;s just that he will need an alternative way to reach a big audience because major companies specializing in providing big audiences don&#x27;t want to provide him their services.')
