Recording copyrighted material and murder.<p>In my analogy the RIAA is saying a specialized tool for recording copyrighted material (youtube-dl) is illegal but since they didn&#x27;t file a DMCA request for non-specialized tools that record copyrighted material (OBS and the like) then they must be ok with allowing copyrighted recordings from those tools.<p>Thus the RIAA thinks specialized tools for murder (hunting knife) are illegal but generic tools not designed for murder (pizza cutter) are fine to kill someone.')
