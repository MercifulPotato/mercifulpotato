Just have a database of dtb&#x27;s on the boot medium that the kernel can look for. But often the mainline kernel simply lacks drivers for the hardware the arm vendors ship. Instead the arm vendors use a forked kernel that&#x27;s way outdated by the time the device enters the market. In fact, as much as I love FLOSS, that&#x27;s a negative consequence of FLOSS because had Linux been proprietary, they would have had to work with the entity that develops Linux instead of just forking it.')
