Every technique we have has these conditions baked in as assumptions; we exploit them all the time, without even thinking about it. Like, e.g. if you put some mortar on a brick, and then a brick on top of that, you&#x27;re relying on gravity to supply the pressure that makes the two bricks strongly bound.<p>Meanwhile - AFAIK - we have <i>zero</i> experience in constructing anything in 0G, beyond assembling some large prefabs. The closest we come to microgravity construction is whatever it is that underwater welders do, but that&#x27;s still not the same.<p>With this in mind, it may be that for now, building installations on Moon&#x27;s surface will be easier than constructing them in space.')
