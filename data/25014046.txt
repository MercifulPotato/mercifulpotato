So either you design food that looks, smells and tastes like normal food but had only 10% of the calories. But that&#x27;s what the diet industry is trying already and they are not really succeeding. Or you make everybody think they are fasting but give the control group all the nuitrition via IV while the treatment group only gets water with a bit of salt. Or a mix of these two. But then this will only give you actual calorie intake as parameter you are investigating. That&#x27;s quite different from actual fasting though, i.e., empty intestines could play a role, no matter calorie intake. Or the type of food you are ingesting, i.e., when fasting you don&#x27;t ingest &quot;bad&quot; food, but maybe you&#x27;d get the same effet by just avoiding the &quot;bad&quot; food. In other words, this is really hard.<p>But then, why does it matter? If it works, why do you care if it&#x27;s placebo effect or not? As long as you can&#x27;t (believably) fake it, you could not exploit just the placebo effect anyway.<p>In other words, the harder a double blind study is, the less useful is the knowledge about whether something is placebo effect or not. Those two effects are different consequences of the same phenomenon.')
