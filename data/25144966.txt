They&#x27;re only upset when someone else makes money without giving them a cut.</i><p>This is exactly where most of the cost of operating the app store comes from. I&#x27;m not going to comment on how much of Apple&#x27;s fees go to paying this, but testing software to release standards is expensive.<p>I remember 20 years ago, just to get started on a PS2 title, you had to pay sony a crazy dev fee just to get your SLUS code (I remember someone telling me it was about USD$50k). Then all of the devkits cost about USD$20k, and then sony still took a big chunk of your sales price.<p>How exactly would you like Apple to handle free apps, which still need to be tested and vetted? What if there was a $10k dev charge for each round of testing? How many free apps do you think there would be in the app store? Its true - all of the paid apps are subsidizing the free apps in the app store. If Apple didn&#x27;t squeeze out other payment processors, every paid app would turn free, they&#x27;d use Square or something to sell people in-app purchases instead, and then the whole ecosystem would fall apart.<p>I guess another question we can ask is what are they testing for? Sony was exacting - there were strict rules about stability and content that had to be met. Your title couldn&#x27;t stall on a waiting screen for longer than a period of time (I remember having to optimize our start-up on one title to meet this requirement). Even the terminology you used had to be correct - there was a list of acceptable names you could use to refer to the console parts like the controller - like you could call it &quot;PlayStation 2 Dualshock Controller&quot; but not &quot;PS2 Dualshock&quot; and stuff like that.<p>On the one hand, Apple isn&#x27;t as exacting, but on the other hand presumably they&#x27;re testing for other things you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about on a PS2 like calling dlopen on forbidden dylibs or sending the addressbook contents to a server. I&#x27;m sure that a lot of this is automated, but some of it will require a human to interact with.')
