As we can see across the border as well.<p>In fact, a lot of illegal immigrants come to the US due to the level of violence from these groups.<p>Then a lot of illegal aliens are deported instead of jailed.<p>Lastly taking the study as reported in the Linked to Article as fact, I don&#x27;t think the point it makes sense.<p>If 100 native-born men commit five rape, each and 109 illegal alien men only commit two rapes each that still means 200 rapes extra in addition to those that would happen if the illegal aliens were not in the US. \nTo tell the victim that illegal immigrants commit far less crime will probably not help much.<p>I am a legal immigrant myself. \nI came from the US. I think the US should make immigration in some form more straightforward to obtain legally.<p>I also think it is the responsibility of the US to accept their for share of desperate refugees that is a direct result of our military interventions as well as our occupations.')
