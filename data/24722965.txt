Let&#x27;s imagine there are two worlds, A and B.<p>In A, Monty Hall behaves like you think: always opens a goat door, always gives the option to switch.<p>In B, he behaves like I described: opens a goat door and gives the option to switch, but only when the player has chosen the car door. Otherwise he does not let you switch.<p>And then we find ourselves in this situation:<p>&gt; Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?<p>At this point, how do you know you are in world A and not B (or some other world)? What in this problem as given here allows you to determine that?')
