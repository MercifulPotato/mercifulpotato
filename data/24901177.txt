Being cagey and asking &quot;well what is it worth to you&quot; seems to be working less and less these days. I&#x27;ve had companies flat out refuse to continue without a concrete answer to the current salary question. So, I add ~20% (adjusted based on the job) to my actual salary and tell them that number.<p>If they like me so much they&#x27;ll give me more? Awesome, big raise.<p>If my &quot;expectations are too high&quot; and they offer me less? Cool, still getting a decent raise (assuming I take the job, because that&#x27;s a pretty big red flag).<p>They&#x27;re clearly going to play some BS mindgames with me, so I&#x27;ll preemptively mess with their anchor number.')
