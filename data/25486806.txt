Item(by='salawat', descendants=None, kids=[25486924, 25487472], score=None, time=1608477697, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486341, text='&gt;There is no biological analogue to backprop, any supervised learning step, etc.<p>Excuse me? How do you figure? Have you tried to do any physical task before, and not gotten it right the first time, tried again, and got closer? Hello, backprop.<p>Has someone trained you, telling you you&#x27;re doing it wrong? Hello, supervised learning. There is an entire portion of your brain tasked with measuring the difference between what you intended and what you did. If you damage it, you actually end up in a state where other people&#x27;s feedback is what you have to rely on.<p>The equations behind NN&#x27;s are &quot;non-biological&quot; only in the sense that you&#x27;re taking a general math function (the sigmoid) and burning it into silicon gates that are not part of a living organism that also has to deal with the excess baggage of remaining alive, or operating as a chemically based computer.<p>However, the dynamics and fundamental capabilities of a biological neural network and a silicon based one are fundamentally the same. You can just scale input domains and speed of the Silicon based one a lot easier than you can the bio-based one due to the difference in computing media. You can also wipe out and retrain a silicon net without being considered to have &quot;killed&quot; anything. The Silicon nets, interestingly, have no analog of running and training simultaneously, or are just starting to get it from the lit I&#x27;ve kept up with, nor an analog for forgetting typically applied to them, making the biological net the far more interesting information processing construct. To be frank, NN&#x27;s not resembling the biological models says more about the inefficiencies of our media of computing, our woeful lack of understanding around the nature of human&#x2F;biological perception, and the arrogance of human beings who lack the capacity to recognize in the math something fundamental to their own existence.<p>This post written by a multiple decade uptime GA&#x2F;C&#x2F;R&#x2F;D pick your letter, constantly training internetworked lattice of sigmoid encoded control networks whose morning your lack of perspective just tainted, and whose training is thusfar unsuccessful in attempts to extinguish the need to point out mis- or incomplete understandings of those sharing the same messaging medium as it generally does. Your overfitting to textual and numerical symbolic representation recognition will not serve you well if you can&#x27;t extend that capacity to discern the pattern into the overaching context of human existence. That&#x27;s where you <i>really</i> start gaining an appreciation for the power of NN&#x27;s. It&#x27;s the building block of the information processing construct that can eventually recognize and reproduce itself.<p>Now if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I need to get back to some obligatory biological maintnance. This bag of organs doesn&#x27;t maintain itself, you know.')
