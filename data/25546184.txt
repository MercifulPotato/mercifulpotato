But I have a tangential question of my own: what is the motivation driving the creation of &quot;no code&quot; tools?<p>I don&#x27;t mean simple graphical editors for workflows with a very defined scope. I refer more to things like Amazon Honeycomb.<p>As I see it, the sort of apps you could reasonably create with no code solutions can be purchased off the shelf and offer way more features. And you don&#x27;t need to do your own bug squashing.<p>And if you really _do_ need custom functionality, a no code solution is painting you into a corner. At some point your app will grow beyond what can be accomplished with these basic tools. Now you need to scrap the whole thing and rebuild from zero in a real programming language.<p>That&#x27;s how it roughly plays out in my mind, anyway. Anybody see one of these &quot;no code&quot; apps deployed in a sensible context before?')
