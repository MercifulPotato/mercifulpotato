If you sell $10 notes for $1, in theory you can have infinite revenue.<p>Sure, but revenue multiples are specific to a business or product type. A consulting company&#x27;s revenue multiple might be 2x or 3x. A cloud-based SaaS with no hands-on setup might be 10x. A HelloFresh&#x2F;BlueApron business might be, say, 7x. For some types of businesses, I wouldn&#x27;t even pay 1x. If an investor is applying the wrong multiple to a business, they wont be around for long.')
