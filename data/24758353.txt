They aren&#x27;t any better and instead of being a &quot;lob of clay&quot;, they are &quot;molded steel&quot; and all the bad habits will never go away.<p>True senior engineers from reputable companies are of course different than newcomers and they are interviewed quite differently at big companies. But the problem is that what candidates understand as &quot;senior&quot; and what FANNG companies understand as &quot;senior&quot;, often have little to do with each other. And the reason is simply that most people who apply for a senior role, wouldn&#x27;t even pass the entry level interview at a FANNG company. It&#x27;s just the sad reality. And this does not mean the entry level interview is wrong. It just means that these &quot;senior&quot; candidates were instead just junior developers who never developed beyond that from a skill perspective (except in their own heads).<p>And at FANNG companies, to even be considered for a senior position interview, you MUST have the credentials on your CV to prove it. However, a lot of candidates will never be interviewed for a senior position, even if their CV is &quot;ten pages&quot; long, because its apparent that this experience will be unlikely to have prepared you for a senior position at a FANNG company.<p>Being a senior engineer at a FANNG company is demanding and difficult on many more levels than just raw coding. You could be the best coder in the world, but that won&#x27;t make you a senior engineer. It will make you a top mid-level engineer and you will never get beyond that without acquiring non-technical skills. Most people simply won&#x27;t be able to do this job, no matter how long they stay in the industry. And I can assure you that there is little similarity in how interviews are conducted for these positions vs. college grads.<p>A senior engineer is essentially a developer who wants to still code, while also being a manager and a leader.')
