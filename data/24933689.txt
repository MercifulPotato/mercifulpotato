Consider for a less controversial example the iPhone 12. It seems obvious that:<p>* Much of the discussion about the iPhone 12 is part of Apple&#x27;s deliberate strategy to sell phones.<p>* The media is in some sense being exploited; Apple wouldn&#x27;t sell so many iPhone 12s if not for media discussion of it.<p>* An outlet that refused as a blanket policy to discuss the iPhone 12 would present its readers with an inaccurate view of the world.')
