What you&#x27;ve written is deranged and comes across like a programmed response similar (I would say functionally identical) to that of a devoted cult member. You&#x27;ve just rattled off what come across as very hackneyed almost childlike talking points.<p>However, based on your profile you&#x27;re obviously an extremely intelligent and productive person.<p>It really shows the importance of having a well ordered society with a ruling class that has the general welfare of the citizenry in mind. The world is too complicated and complex a place for every person, even the most intelligent and productive among us, to have to concern themselves with these sorts of things.<p>We have a right to live in a society where we can trust our institutions.
