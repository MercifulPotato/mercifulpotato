Also embedded devices who have a GPU + LCD, I have personally shipped Linux firmware where I used NanoVG on top of DRM&#x2F;KMS to render touch screen GUI. Also for kiosks, cars, smart watches and many other applications.<p>It’s great everywhere you have a high-resolution screen. And it’s mission-critical for ARM devices who don’t have CPU power to render that screen on CPU, at least not at 60Hz.<p>&gt; headless servers<p>Why would you want a GUI there? Even Microsoft has console-only “core” editions of their Windows Server, since 2008. They made it because competition from Linux, who had that from the very beginning and was thus way more suitable for cloud use cases. It still is due to other reasons, but that’s another story.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s that that solution is being pushed as the only one that should be maintained—and thus, exist—going forward.<p>I get why some people would want the X to be maintained, but the thing is, it’s very expensive, and not fun.<p>Developing game console emulators is expensive, but fun and people do that in their free time with great results. Moving forward GPU-targeted Linux GUI is expensive, not too fun, but there’re commercial applications with healthy profit margins (automotive, embedded, etc) so people from these areas are working on that tech. Patching x.org for repurposed old hardware, on the other hand…')
