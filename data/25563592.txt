The buzzing of their rotors is noise pollution that ruins the peace of a park&#x2F;natural area, and while I recognize the right to record in public spaces, there’s something especially creepy about a drone flying along a jogging path near you armed with the latest 4K cameras. I think drone enthusiasts don’t understand how that can impact women especially. I also think it would be incredibly annoying to have drones constantly in the sky above you if our current volume of deliveries is moved from ground to air. I hope both are heavily regulated and curbed.')
