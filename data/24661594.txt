But I think expecting all the casual Linux to be able to do that is unrealistic. So I think it is necessary to have things like Flatpak, Snap, AppImages to exist.<p>BTW, I used to think that we can just provide a prebuilt binary to let user download from a website, but finding that isn&#x27;t easy to achieve unless you use a language like Go, Rust... because I found that many C program are hard to compile with full static linking.')
