Most people do poorly in them, a very small number are very successful.  It&#x27;s like being a band, a few are stars, the rest can&#x27;t afford to do it as their main job.  The amount of money that the most successful can make is not a good indicator of likely income.<p>They&#x27;re not what is generally meant by &quot;gig economy&quot; by the way.  What is generally meant are precarious jobs with variable shifts, often low paid.  Things like Uber driving, minimum-wage jobs delivering food when there&#x27;s demand, and zero-hour contracts working in shops.')
