Fire up Fiddler today, and spend a few minutes or more observing Brave&#x27;s network activity. You will find no instance where Brave (the company and developers) are watching or tracking users; it&#x27;s against our very core.<p>You keep linking to the affiliate suggestion as though it were something alarming; it isn&#x27;t. And that&#x27;s the response from those in the InfoSec community. To pair this mistake with the ominous warning that Brave &quot;can potentially watch and track your every move&quot; is silly.')
