Item(by='mschaef', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604585682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998070, text='&gt; Owing debt with property as collateral will be financially ruining for most of the middle class.<p>What&#x27;s the mechanism you&#x27;re thinking will cause this? Based on what you&#x27;ve said, I can imagine you&#x27;re thinking either a crash in property values that leaves people underwater on their debt or widespread property damage by people that have &#x27;stopped respecting property law&#x27;.<p>Regarding theft&#x2F;violence&#x2F;vandalism, it can happen just as easily to a home you rent as to a home you &quot;own&quot;. Regarding property value declines, any decline that&#x27;s financially ruinous is going to ruin _someone_, and the debate then becomes who&#x27;s left holding the bag when it happens and how that negative impact propagates outward through the broader economy.<p>(But I&#x27;d be interested to hear more of your point of view.)')
