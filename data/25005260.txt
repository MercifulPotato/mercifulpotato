If you&#x27;re managing dev and production in different ways, then you&#x27;re going to have to spend significant time &quot;productionising&quot; your dev code (listing dependencies in the right formats etc.). And the bigger the gap between the machine you develop on and the machine you deploy to, the higher the risk of production-only bugs. So keeping your dev workstaion as similar as possible to a production server - and installing dependencies etc. in a way that&#x27;s compatible with production from day 1 - makes a lot of sense to me.')
