Someone is bound to be willing to put in the time, or the threat of it will keep people from exploring (demanding) progressive things like 25-35 hr workweeks.<p>On the edges, where people are forced to work 60+ hrs a week there&#x27;s enough leverage of people simply being unwilling to do the job (though even this isn&#x27;t as true for some elite jobs). On the other hand, if they&#x27;re just being asked to clock in from 9-5? There would need to be some outrage and push, but this makes you look lazy. There seems to be some progress made on vacations in corporate America, though.<p>Also, some roles would legitimately suffer or not work at all at 20-30 hrs. I think the ideal is to normally work 40-60 hrs &quot;busy weeks&quot;, but not try to load people down when things naturally get slower and let them dip into the time for personal, so it&#x27;s usually 30-35, or occasionally a bit less.')
