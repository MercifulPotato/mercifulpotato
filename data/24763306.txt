That&#x27;s a distraction and leads nowhere good.<p>I think the problem is that FB forces everyone into gigantic mosh pits of conversations that span whole regions of millions of people, and elevates uneducated but &quot;engaging&quot; hot takes for thousands or millions of people to see at a time. And most importantly, FB builds positive feedback loops into this environment.<p>That&#x27;s why I stopped using FB quite a while ago: not because I thought some moderator somewhere wasn&#x27;t doing a good job, but because friends of friends (I can only assume) spewing bullshit comments on sketchy &quot;news&quot; articles in comment sections with thousands of people would show up too often.')
