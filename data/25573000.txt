Considering the option of S&#x2F;MIME, how would one get started using this signing and encryption method to exchange secure e-mail with associates? Is there any value in being the first to show an S&#x2F;MIME signature and encourage others to jump on board? And what is the preferred vendor for getting an official S&#x2F;MIME certificate at low cost or free? (Comodo&#x27;s offering from past years seems to be gone.)')
