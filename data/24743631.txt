He&#x27;s doing the opposite of what you say: just give all input files to one compiler invocation without headers or incremental compilation, in order to let it handle concurrency properly. He still ends up compiling at 1mil&#x2F;s. The added benefit is that his program can get access to the entire AST and modify it during the build.')
