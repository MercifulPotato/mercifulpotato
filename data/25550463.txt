It all comes down to consequences.<p>If a distro messes up the trustworthiness of an application, they, the big and important company loses clout.<p>If the application developer messes up, they also lose clout - people may stop using their software.<p>Chances are, if you&#x27;re using a third party for a third party piece of software that isn&#x27;t officially dockerized by the company that developed it, nor a major distro, there&#x27;s no real backlash if it doesn&#x27;t work or if they get hacked, etc: &quot;it was a third party trick, so _of course_ it wasn&#x27;t trustworthy&quot; would be the statement everyone makes.<p>Debian messing up, or Cisco or Oracle, etc, is a much bigger deal.')
