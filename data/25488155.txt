The ability might not be too far outside our standard biological envelope.<p>There are many long, slow, but low energy orbital trajectories between bodies in the solar system that take advantage of multiple gravity assists, etc. We currently use those for probes but plans to send humans places always aim for high energy fast trajectories for obvious reasons. This limits their payload and increases the cost. Hibernation would make these slow efficient paths viable.<p>There are down to earth uses too, like sleeping while waiting for a critical donor organ to become available or for the time it takes to culture one from your stem cells.')
