They cannot simply omit Australian news and include international news. Therefore, the Australian google would not contain links to Washington Post or NYT.<p>This is probably to the advantage of the existing large players, since a new smaller player would find it much harder to get traction. We all know the domain name to Mr Murdoch&#x27;s news websites, but we do not necessarily know the domain name to new media news websites. And we probably won&#x27;t head off to NYT expecting to get decent coverage of Australian news for natural reasons.<p>The result is probably going to be a disaster, with fake news spreading as images on Facebook, which will be somewhat trusted since everyone knows you can&#x27;t find the source in Google and you can&#x27;t link to it on Facebook, so the fact that you can&#x27;t confirm it doesn&#x27;t mean you can call it refuted.')
