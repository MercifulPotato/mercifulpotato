It&#x27;s a leaderboard for imaginary races that can be trivially cheated, be it via GPS idiosyncracies or by using an electric bike.<p>I reckon the features oriented towards navigation&#x2F;discovery are ok, but it&#x27;s a crowded space with a relatively low barrier to entry.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if one only can make marginal gains with those 110M, but with a high pressure for ROIng which will inevitably backfire.<p>A case like Medium comes to mind.')
