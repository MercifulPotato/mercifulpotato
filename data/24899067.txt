[1] The Washington Post notes that Hunter Biden did arrange for a different business partner to shake hands with Joe Biden at an existing public event, and speculates that he could have done something similar for Pozharskyi. [2] While it&#x27;s only speculation, that does amount to another possible scenario where the email is accurate.  But I wouldn&#x27;t call such an interaction a &quot;meeting&quot; exactly, and it would scarcely be evidence of corruption.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;biden-campaign-lashes-out-new-york-post-429486" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;biden-campaign-lash...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;hunter-bidens-alleged-laptop-an-explainer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;hunter-bi...</a>')
