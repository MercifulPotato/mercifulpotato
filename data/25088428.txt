Having no other insight  other than what you are providing me, it seems like you tend to make yourself the center of discussion and honestly, you come across as high-ego. People like that are often polarizing in communities and tend the shift the conversation from &quot;what&quot; to &quot;who&quot;. Perhaps the best practice would be to learn to make your point without personalizing it so much.')
