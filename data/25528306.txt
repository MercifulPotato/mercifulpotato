The tenancy is freely transferable, so there is a market for leaseholds that resembles the property market for freeholds. (A freehold is where the property is owned outright.)<p>In practice, leaseholds are mainly used to apportion &quot;ownership&quot; within buildings such as apartment blocks, where simple ownership of the land does not sufficiently capture the complexity of the situation.<p>Problems arise in a number of areas:<p>First and foremost, leaseholds resemble property ownership, and so many people naively treat them as such. But the value of a lease decreases as time goes by. When only a few years remain, the value drops very quickly. People who are unprepared for this can get a nasty shock, and feel hard done by.<p>Secondly, and more subtly, the leasehold creates a complex relationship between the landlord and the tenant - just like any rental agreement. The terms are set out in a contract which is specific to <i>that particular</i> leasehold - so they may vary greatly one from another. There are a myriad ways that they can contain unfair clauses, or unexpected terms.<p>One recent scam is for landlords to create leases that have a small, annual &quot;service charge&quot; (payable to the landlord) whose cost doubles every few years. After a while, the payments become extortionate!<p>In this case, the landlord is allowed to charge tenants for the cost of some kinds of works to the building. In the lease, that probably looks like a small item, but a clever landlord can specify the works in such a way that the tenants shoulder most, or all of the cost.')
