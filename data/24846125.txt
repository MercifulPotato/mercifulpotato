A half decent design will do as you say; it will allow the use of an ORM or hand written sql. ORMs make magic easier, and pulling that magic apart is a real pain, but so is working with triggers and stored procs. The problem exists on both sides. The solution isn&#x27;t to get rid of ORMs, but to train developers in better system design.')
