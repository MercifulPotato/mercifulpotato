The SD of daily returns as a volatility measure for Bitcoin has decreased from &gt;10% in 2011 to &lt;4% in 2020 and the 3-month realised volatility is mostly comparable to and sometimes even lower than &quot;traditional&quot; tech stocks like AAPL and AMZN.<p>Dominant risk in Bitcoin is not volatility or 0-day anymore but key management (e.g. exchange hacks, wallet loss, scams&#x2F;phishing attacks). GBTC for example is an ETF-like trust which allows you to invest in Bitcoin without holding any.<p>Interesting side note: ~9% of currently available Bitcoins are held by companies on their balance sheets (~7% by companies which are publicly tradable btw).<p>HN might still be cautious about Bitcoin, but the market thinks it has matured.')
