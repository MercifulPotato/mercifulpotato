But, at least I like that startups are saying &quot;it&#x27;s too expensive&quot; rather than &quot;there&#x27;s a talent shortage!&quot;  There&#x27;s never been a &quot;talent shortage.&quot;  There&#x27;s been a lack of incentive for said talent to join tech companies.  Money is an easy way to make up for said lack of incentive, but companies don&#x27;t want to open their wallets enough to get rid of the &quot;talent shortage.&quot;')
