Additionally display technology was significantly higher and slower to decrease cost than most signal generators such as VCRs&#x2F;DVRs&#x2F;game consoles&#x2F;etc. Thus beyond minor commodity signal generation such as a TV receiver it makes sense to separate the two at a component level.<p>This user behavior has been guided by two past trends: A. in the transition from analog to digital TV signals many display makers separated the TV receiver function; B. by the time makers integrated VCRs the world had moved on to DVD which made the integrated VCR a waste product that could not be disposed of without refreshing the display.<p>Are the signal generation components of &quot;Smart TVs&quot; similar to the analog TV tuner, slow to change and nearly always needed, or are they like the VCR which was integrated right at a signal generator change?<p>On the other hand, I suspect that displays are adding more general computing for the purpose of scaling, color representations, decryption, etc even without the components that provide &quot;smart&quot; functions. As a result scaling them to include smart functions as software functions is low hanging fruit. I wonder if display computation architecture is common enough to support a user&#x2F;hobbyist controlled OS.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxgizmos.com&#x2F;linux-continues-advance-in-smart-tv-market&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxgizmos.com&#x2F;linux-continues-advance-in-smart-tv-m...</a>')
