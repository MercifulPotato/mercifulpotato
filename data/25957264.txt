The moment it was &gt;100% shorted, the hedged fund exposed themselves to financial risk.<p>No matter how much people buy, they can&#x27;t buy &gt;100% of the shares on the market unless GameStop issues new shares.  The people buying are betting that when these hedge funds need to cover, they will be covering ~120% of the number of shares (the amount of shorted stock) on the market.  That covers everyone that has shares right now.<p>So right now, its a tug of war.  Its a zero sum game where one side will definitely lose.  You can argue that the company isn&#x27;t worth anything and that buyers will get hurt, but only when &lt;100% of the stock is shorted.')
