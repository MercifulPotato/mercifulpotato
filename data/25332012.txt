Can the chip makers (AMD&#x2F;Intel), the PC manufacturers (Lenovo&#x2F;Dell&#x2F;HP&#x2F;etc) and Microsoft cooperate enough to compete.<p>I&#x27;m not sure Microsoft is that committed to Windows anymore (mobile first&#x2F;cloud first). The PC manufacturers have been complacent for a long time, happy to suckle on the WinTel teat. Intel have been struggling to deliver (this is probably what drove Apple to switch).<p>Perhaps Microsoft could step up but my gut feeling is their heart isn&#x27;t in it. What little moat Win32 still has disappears with a switch to ARM.')
