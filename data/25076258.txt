Tech is more and more about personal branding and following the hype train. DDG is in. Bing is not.<p>Also, for the older crowd who came from slashdot (and still says &#x27;Micro$oft&#x27;) it&#x27;d be morally unacceptable to use Bing directly. They prefer either a rebrand, or to directly give all their data to Google (maybe because they still see it as fresh and new?)<p>So close, but no cigar.')
