Item(by='throwaway2245', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610715303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25786638, text='&gt;To deny the positive aspects of testosterone...<p>I think this comment illustrates a significant problem of people&#x27;s (including some scientists) thinking around testosterone.<p>I&#x27;m identifying that people are only suggesting positive aspects of high testosterone and ignoring the negative. And, you are again reiterating the positive aspects in a biased, almost spiritualised way.<p>Clearly, as you suggest, 100% testosterone is absurd and not desirable, so there must be some limit to the amazing wonder-drug testosterone. Excessive testosterone is harmful to health apart from in behavioural changes (it&#x27;s linked at least to heart failure).')
