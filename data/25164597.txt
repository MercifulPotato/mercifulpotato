In the 2000s it was worth buying inferior PowerPC hardware because Mac OS X was so forward-looking and friendly to develop on. It was exciting.<p>Nowadays, there’s no question that the M1 hardware is fast and the Rosetta 2 translation works really well, but the platform isn’t fun any more. You can’t extend the OS with novel concepts or write technically interesting applications. You have to submit your programs through several levels of bureaucracy so they don’t do anything “not allowed.” Innovation isn’t possible, it’s just boring.<p>The new CPUs are just the same experience but faster. I’ll just wait until other hardware gets access to the smaller fabrication processes. I’m not going back to Mac.')
