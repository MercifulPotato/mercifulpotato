These decisions were likely made on far more more factors than one of purely material.<p>Geopolitically Germany had the the advantage of singular national focus, it had no allies to coordinate with either strategically or tactically (at this stage). The UK and France were two very separate and independent states, who were not necessarily strongly aligned, there would have been a deep rooted sense of mistrust (which has existed for centuries).<p>Another aspect is military doctrine; France had a decidedly defensive doctrine at the time, based of the perceived success of WW1 (the victor always fighting the previous war and all that). The UK military was also very much geared for holding onto an empire and not necessarily fighting large scale military operations across Europe. A decisive military strike was just not in the nature of the nations at the time, they lacked the necessary aggressiveness and sense of purpose to carry it out.<p>All up the French and British were a little too risk adverse, rightly so I suppose because they had a lot to lose. Unfortunately taking no action was a decision as well and one that would cost them in the long run far more dearly than they might have imagined at the time.')
