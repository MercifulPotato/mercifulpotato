People who argue against squashing have not worked on 10+ years old actively developed repositories, or in big enough teams.<p>A commit is a change. A change has a ticket. A ticket is a small piece of work that does not result in 3k changed lines.<p>This ensures that the change rationale is fully documented and easily identifiable.<p>Nobody needs those &quot;fixed typo&quot; commits. Nor the &quot;implemented function A&quot; commits. What <i>IS</i> the change that you&#x27;re doing? What functionality? That&#x27;s the most comfortable commit granularity to debug imho.')
