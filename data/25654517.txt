The older two weren&#x27;t interested, but my youngest is really interested.  We first tried to use Scratch and some of the online learning sites, but they all drove me crazy because things would break or wouldn&#x27;t work like the videos.  We switched to Python using Pygame Zero which is going MUCH better.  Definitely recommend Python: using whitespace for blocks is very understandable and easier than balancing {}. \nAt 10 my child is able to exclusively drive the keyboard and make many of the changes he wants.  We&#x27;ve been doing this for about 6 weeks spending 1-2 hours on Sat and Sun.<p>My older son is much more interested in mechanical engineering so I&#x27;m mentoring his robotics team for programming.')
