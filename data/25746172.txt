I messaged them on whatsapp when I left my house and then again when I arrived at theirs.<p>A month or so after my trip I was sent a fine for not displaying my car license while my car was parked on a public road.  I had driven down the road where the fine was recorded  during the trip.  Using the timestamps of the whatsapp messages I was able to show that there was not enough time during my trip for me to have stopped to park.')
