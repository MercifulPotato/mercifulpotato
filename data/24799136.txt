They actively search for new services that they might be able to use to pipe their traffic through. Awareness amongst the wider population will grow more slowly, as they aren&#x27;t for the most part actively looking for it, so as that awareness spreads the ratio of good-to-bad will likely improve.<p>Though the absolute number of bad actors I expect is enough for me to dismiss ever knowingly installing something like this on any device I own (or allowing it on any network I have some responsibility for), no matter what the good&#x2F;bad ratio is like.')
