To say it more poignantly: Microsoft is a direct driver of perverse wealth inequality, endless wars and centralisation of power which effectively destroys any resemblance of democracy everywhere. Behind the clean corporate facade, they are just another mafia. If you support this system - by hosting your code on Github and buying MS products - you are de-facto supporting this techno-dictatorship.')
