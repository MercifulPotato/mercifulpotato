I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s still a perfectly viable alternative to Slack. Fast, simple, works. (At least this is my perception&#x2F;impression. I wanted to evaluate Slack alternatives for some time, but haven&#x27;t got the time for it yet. So I was surprised when I got an invite to one of our client&#x27;s rocket.chat instance and things worked pretty well.)<p>I&#x27;m in a slack workspace that is constantly notifying me of a thread, but I can&#x27;t make it read. Maybe it has something to do with the free messages limit. So the message is there, but cannot be accessed. Annoying as hell. I thought about submitting the bug to Slack, but then just let it go, and probably we&#x27;ll just move to Signal or something.')
