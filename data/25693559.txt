She can&#x27;t convince Bob she didn&#x27;t write the message: it&#x27;s written right there on Bob&#x27;s phone, and he&#x27;d remember if he&#x27;d tamper with it.<p>2. If Bob starts showing Alice&#x27;s message around, she can&#x27;t pretend he misremembered, as would be possible with an oral conversation. She&#x27;d have to flat out call him a liar.<p>---<p>&gt; <i>using a system that is deliberately designed to allow you to say something then deny having said it might also cause extra suspicion.</i><p>Not if everyone used such a system. There&#x27;s a difference between building &amp; using your own obscure deniable chat application, and WhatsApp and Signal themselves enabling this.<p>&gt; <i>In practice [repudiability] has very little value. It is unlikely that the feature is worth the extra risk of the complexity it would take to implement it.</i><p>Deniable schemes are not more complex.<p>There&#x27;s just one simple condition: use Diffie-Hellman key exchanges instead of signatures. The result will likely be <i>simpler</i> than a scheme that relies on signatures. I&#x27;ve implemented both key exchanges and signatures with elliptic curves (X25519 and Ed25519 specifically), and I&#x27;m telling you, key exchange is significantly simpler and harder to get wrong. (For the anecdote, I screwed-up <i>once</i> in my cryptographic work, and it was the signatures).<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noiseprotocol.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noiseprotocol.org</a> for fairly simple key exchange based protocols, with various properties one might care about (key compromise impersonation, resistance against replay-attacks, anonymity to third partiesâ€¦).')
