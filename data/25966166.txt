Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[25966950], score=None, time=1611981830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965984, text='&gt; Sure you can, by petitioning your government to draft laws and so on.<p>Ask the government to do something about it? They&#x27;re allies, they&#x27;re in it together.<p>There is no scenario where they don&#x27;t take out encryption this decade. It&#x27;s a top priority and big tech is going to very happily assist them. Big tech will give them what they want, they will act as an arm of tyranny assisting the government in smashing human rights, and in return they&#x27;ll get to continue to expand (they&#x27;ll get a light touch regulatory treatment). It now has a lot in common with how China handles their giant corporations (so long as you do what we tell you to, you get to exist and thrive), and big tech in the US looks more like a CCP apparatus by the passing day.<p>All forms of expression and speech will continue to be restricted more by the passing year. The government won&#x27;t need to do it themselves, big tech will do the dirty work with a wink and nod. That includes all app stores, all online content and forums, all software.<p>So, when you can&#x27;t petition your government any longer because it&#x27;s hell bent on taking your liberty away, what does that leave? The War on Domestic Terrorism of course. They&#x27;ll create it, spur it, and then have an excuse to crack down on their own invention (not terribly different from how they ran the war on drugs). The US will be a horrible place to live in the near future. The foreign war on terrorism, in which the US did such unbelievable vicious things to other nations, will now turn inward, and the monster will come home, rolling over human rights as it goes.')
