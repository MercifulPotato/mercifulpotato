I interpreted it as meaning Google spied on people and then fired them. However, what the article itself seems to be saying is that Google fired people for spying on others. The spying was, &quot;for reviewing other employeesâ€™ calendars.&quot; The NLRB then found that illegal.<p>At least, that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m interpreting this article. Otherwise there&#x27;s no actual explanation of what spying actually occurred.')
