It feels pretty diverse to me, I follow multiple types of communist and anarchists, some climate and privacy advocates, general progressives and even some more centrist EU people and a ton of people whose politics I know nothing about.<p>When I follow people I mostly just check if they don&#x27;t have any posts that are homophobic, transphobic or racist, because that is shit I do not want on my timeline. For the rest I don&#x27;t really care, I just follow the people whose posts I enjoy reading.')
