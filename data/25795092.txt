Mind you, the power source still needs to have a certain output to charge your Macbook, but it&#x27;s allowed me to use the same USB-C charger that comes with newer Macbooks with my 2015 Macbook.<p>EDIT: I hope that was what you were picturing.  I suppose someone reading my comment could have interpreted it as a magsafe-to-usb-c connector.')
