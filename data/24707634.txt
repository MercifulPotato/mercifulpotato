It is indeed incredibly unfair to claim that anyone can do it in 2 minutes if I could, especially considering that I did it this fast after mentally preparing to do it fast to demonstrate that it can be done fast.<p>But also remember that I really do believe that we should all participate in the development of the software that we get to use for free. Fixing a bug in some piece of software should, in my opinion, be the most normal thing you do every once in a while. Just like everyone can use a screwdriver at home, every programmer should be able to modify, build and run the software they use. If we did live in such a world, this wouldn&#x27;t be specialized knowledge, this would really be something most people could do under 10 minutes.<p>Yeah, I realize that we don&#x27;t live in a such a world. But please don&#x27;t take away my hope that if we all try hard enough, one day we just might. :-)')
