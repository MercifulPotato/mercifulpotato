Item(by='centimeter', descendants=None, kids=[24819378, 24818044], score=None, time=1603001358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24815735, text='Japanese designed and manufactured tools are always a delight to use. Whenever I go to Japan I always find myself picking up some new beautifully designed and made object. The last time I was in Tokyo it was lighters. I bought probably $300 of various lighters from Tokyo Pipe Co. I don&#x27;t even smoke!<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find products actually <i>made</i> in Japan, and despite what many people want to believe, Japanese obsession with perfection makes a big difference in the quality of manufactured goods. Makita doesn&#x27;t manufacture in Japan anymore, and quality has suffered. Fujifilm stopped making several of their lines in Japan, and quality suffered. Very sad.')
