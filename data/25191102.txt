I&#x27;m from Texas, where it&#x27;s generally understood that there is a very good chance that any given person is carrying.  Not just Joe Tough Guy either, there are plenty of old ladies with .25 ACPs in their handbags.  People don&#x27;t see it as scary or abnormal the same way other places do; it&#x27;s just a tool that many people carry.  I&#x27;ve only ever seen one incident where someone got stupid with a concealed handgun, and that guy was clearly a moron and had been drinking quite a bit.  &quot;Random people&quot; carrying isn&#x27;t really an issue.  And because they&#x27;re not seen as an exceptional or evil scary thing, most people are less-likely to abuse them, at least from what I&#x27;ve seen.')
