Ask for anything you’d like to receive for free or borrow. Keep it legal. No hate speech. No buying or selling, no trades or bartering, we’re strictly a gift economy. </i><p>I don&#x27;t know if this is actually a novel idea in the US, but in my country every city has multiple &quot;trade X&quot;, &quot;buy&#x2F;sell X&quot;, &quot;free X&quot; groups. Where X is the city name and people give away free stuff or sell it for a small price.<p>And this is on top of sites like our local eBay and thrift shops where you can give away or get stuff for (almost) free, too.<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time thinking what this &#x27;project&#x27; actually does.')
