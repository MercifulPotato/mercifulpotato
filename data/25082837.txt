We really enjoyed the shared photo album feature of Google Photos. Apple has this too, but Google Photos is platform-agnostic. It works on Android, iOS, and the plain old web. We were able to set up a shared photo album, text a link to friends, and they could add all their photos to the album pretty easily.<p>Trying to organize that using other apps would be difficult. Apple requires everyone to have an iCloud &#x2F; iOS device. Other services require someone to sign up &#x2F; download an app. Since most people have a google account already Google Photos was very easy for this use case.')
