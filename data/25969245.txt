Or is this also an instance of the slippery slope fallacy - asserting that A necessarily leads to NOT(B) instead of B?<p>Also I believe my other point stands with respect to how this fallacy is abused in common discourse to score debate points, at least according to my experience. In practice, not many commit this fallacy, since everyone except the most dishonest will admit there&#x27;s a tiny probability that their causal chain won&#x27;t play out.')
