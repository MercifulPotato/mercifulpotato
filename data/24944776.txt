A use-case that helped propel it forward from the early days. It&#x27;s not easy to find a service&#x2F;set a service to check something regularly etc....without spinning up a server and stuff yourself.<p>Yes, I get that doing other things more advanced like IoT integration and whatever else IFTTT has moved into bring up challenges etc, but that basic thing at the heart of what the If This Then That concept is rooted in is still useful and them asking for a few bucks isn&#x27;t that bad.\nI&#x27;ve still got some things running out there to send an email, post a tweet etc on updates. But doing some things more regularly than their tweet&#x2F;check limits has forced me to move elsewhere on my own recently. All depends on the use.<p>And yeah, totally miss Yahoo Pipes but from the time when I used that, IFTTT actually improved slightly just enough to cover what I was using Pipes for haha. (and yeah there&#x27;s pipes.digital)<p>ActionsFlow recently shared around here using github actions is interesting but I didn&#x27;t feel like migrating a bunch of stuff over to it just to test')
