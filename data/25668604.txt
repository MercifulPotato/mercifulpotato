Same for me. I just put a message like this in the family whatsapp groups and then deleted the app&#x2F;account: &#x27;Hey everyone, I&#x27;m not going to be on WhatsApp anymore - you can call, text, signal, telegram or email me. Talk to you later!&#x27;. It was that simple. It took a little while but now my family is on Telegram. I know they still use WhatsApp but it&#x27;s honestly not my problem or issue that they use the app - I just don&#x27;t want to.')
