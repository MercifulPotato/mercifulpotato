You can look up articles on your own to corroborate these claims. For example, Brazil&#x27;s Bolsonaro&#x27;s stance was pretty much a mirror of the US response (down to the president downplaying the seriousness of the problem and subsequently getting infected and all)<p>Canada provides another interesting data point. They have very strict quarantine policies for incoming travelers, but now that domestic flights are at full capacity again, schools are reopening and the general public is getting more lax, they&#x27;re seeing an uptick in cases again.')
