The Wall St vs the masses narrative is entirely fake (a lot of market makers and funds already long on GME are <i>delighted</i> at the influx of money from novices, and some of the shorts will be little guys too), the claims of shenanigans don&#x27;t really add up (Robinhood suspends trading today to benefit a partner who unwound their position... yesterday) and we&#x27;re certainly not seeing middle ground arguments on shorting, or funds, or anything really. And people aren&#x27;t going to get more open minded after they lose money in their first significant interaction with financial markets.<p>I doubt reforms that might happen as a result are going to be what people piling on meme stocks want either.')
