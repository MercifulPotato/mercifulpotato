Some are partly true, or based on fact, some have people actively working to develop them, and some evolve over the years.<p>To take the most popular current example: Trump&#x27;s claim that the election was stolen.<p>There are two conspiracy theories going on in tandem: The Left claims that the Republicans are creating a false narrative that their friends in the supreme court will accept against the people, and the Right claims that Democrat controlled voting accepted illegal and duplicate votes to create a false narrative that he lost the popular vote.<p>There are elements of truth to each claim. I personally (anecdotally) know of at least one duplicate vote for Biden that would not have been accepted had they voted in person.\nBut I don&#x27;t pretend that all mail-in votes were false or that the courts are unbiased.<p>Another example is FreeMasonry, which has changed so much and is so widespread that no matter what you say it may have been true in at least one lodge somewhere, and is kooky when appplied to the group as a whole.<p>And what Snowden proved would probably have been treated as a conspiracy theory based on what was known before he leaked his data. That doesn&#x27;t mean it was less of a conspiracy, and such a tool would have &quot;proven&quot; those investigating the NSA to be wrong or insane, and would repel further queries.<p>Extra terrestrial life is treated very differently by government bodies than by spook hunters and the delusional. Is it a conspiracy? Or does it contain some conspiracies, some theories, some nonsense and some fact?<p>So where does conspiracy begin?')
