I have an RTX 3080 (prior to that I had a 1080Ti) and games crash more often than I would like. Waking from sleep is hit or miss, random driver crashes where the monitor goes blank, driver reinitializes itself, screen comes back on, etc.  This is all with the latest and greatest drivers, 4K 160hz monitor (and an older 4k&#x2F;60hz monitor), etc.')
