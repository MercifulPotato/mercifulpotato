The current amount of charity is not enough, and there&#x27;s a growing population of underserved people in these areas. There wasn&#x27;t enough before COVID exacerbated it, so the demand increased by multiples and supply did not.<p>2. Many companies receive tax incentives to be where they are (which are often projected to be rosier than reality - see SF Mid-Market), so people expect the companies to &quot;pay it back&quot; in some way. This is ambiguous, doesn&#x27;t really happen, or it&#x27;s paltry sums relative to the lost tax revenue.<p>3. Several well-funded initiatives were stopped by NIMBYs (e.g. homeless shelters for SF should always be in someone else&#x27;s neighborhood - so liberals will sue to protect their property value, more housing should be anywhere away from them and not block their bay views, more than 3 stories is offensive, or preventing meals for the homeless at a church in a nice neighborhood because people the same people who donated would prefer it doesn&#x27;t happen near them). Turns out people can be altruistic and selfish simultaneously, which is how you end up with SF. Liberal when it&#x27;s an idea, conservative once it might affect you.<p>Most would argue it&#x27;s not the corporations&#x27; responsibility, and communities shouldn&#x27;t be at the whims of a profit maximizing corporation&#x27;s generosity (nor their employees). However, people are trying to find help anywhere. The federal government decided it&#x27;s not their problem, so people are looking to the corporate world to help. Seeing Apple&#x27;s $57B in profits while food banks are empty a few miles away is Hunger Games-esque, and makes them an easy scapegoat.<p>Some would say a lesson is that you shouldn&#x27;t depend on individual or corporate generosity in a crisis, but GoFundMe is the preferred way to pay for medical bills for at least 70m people in the US, so who the fuck knows.')
