I wouldn&#x27;t call Windows software particularly optimized, and it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to do these optimizations for Windows, because there are countless permutations of hardware that can run Windows 10 off the shelf, so optimizing for all of those would be a Sisyphean task. Combine that with the fact that even console games these days are generally targeting cross-platform on multiple consoles and PC, and this type of optimization is largely out of the realm of the possible.')
