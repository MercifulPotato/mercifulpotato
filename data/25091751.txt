However, one of the things you learn as a modern history undergrad is this: be skeptical and critical of the historical record.<p>The historical record isn&#x27;t a perfect reflection of the past. It&#x27;s always coloured. Why is so much emphasis put on the French Revolution? Or the American Revolution?
