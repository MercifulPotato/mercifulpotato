If it were, priority would be given based on social sphere sizes, eg priests and postmen before old people.<p>It&#x27;s also about giving people a vaccine they can believe in, which allows them to return to some of their normal activities. If everyone is 50% safe, no one has any real expectation that they can take any risks without being infected. If half the people are 95% safe, that half can do more things (travel long distances, go to school) while the unvacccinated half can continue to avoid risks until more vaccine is available.')
