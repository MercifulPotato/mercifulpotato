(Have they mounted the engines?)  My guess is that if they have a current surplus of engines, they&#x27;ll try a fix and attempt to get data out of sn9, even if success chance is low.  If they have more pressure vessels than engines for those pressure vessels, then I doubt sn9 will fly.<p>Either way, one of the larger goals of these early prototypes is to iterate on how to make the starship quickly and inexpensively, so I doubt it&#x27;s a total waste even if it doesn&#x27;t fly.')
