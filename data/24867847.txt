There&#x27;s stuff that happened, and there are consequences - just because the consequences may not be fully computable in the amount of time and effort anyone is willing to expend on it, doesn&#x27;t mean truth suddenly becomes fuzzy. The territory is sharp, it&#x27;s just the map that&#x27;s uncertain. But for that, the proper words are &quot;I&#x27;m not sure&quot;, not &quot;I have my truth, you have yours&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>So for example, do I forgive nuclear power and GM food companies from trying to influence public discourse on the safety of their work? Of course, it&#x27;s essential in a world where they are competing against lots of unwarranted negative attention, much of it baseless as far as the science goes.</i><p>And because of what I wrote above, I <i>despise both</i>. Yes, I understand the practical necessity - one side lies because the other side lies too, both stuck in a feedback loop. But I&#x27;d still say both are behaving unethically. Two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right.<p>I subscribe to the viewpoint I&#x27;ve best seen phrased in an old blog post[0]: &quot;promoting less than maximally accurate beliefs is an act of sabotage.
