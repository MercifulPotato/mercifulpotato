Releasing the build process and the surrounding code which is not related to the first guy&#x27;s product is a huge problem. You don&#x27;t have to be evil to see that.<p>The idea is that first guy is irrelevant, your user is the person that has the right to demand the code so he can change the software. If you want to sell me some software without giving me the sources  then don&#x27;t use GPL. If the GPL code is some trivial small thing that is not related with your product then find a BSD version or pay for a proprietary version of that library (and have fun not having the freedom to check it&#x27;s code and fix&#x2F;improve it)')
