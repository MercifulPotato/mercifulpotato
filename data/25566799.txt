I&#x27;m the creator of an app named CraZe, which allows you to make psychedelic, colorful, and relaxing drawings.<p>The basic premise is the usual mandala app, in which you have rotations, symmetries, colors, etc. But the twist is that there&#x27;s a lot of parameters and effects and shapes that can be combined to create special results!<p>The combinatorial explosion of parameters makes it so the possibilities are near infinite.<p>There&#x27;s color palettes that change dynamically, geometric shapes that can change in size and orientation and alignment, fading that can be enabled so that you can draw endlessly without the screen filling up, undo, redo, etc.<p>You can see images and videos from the app here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;crazeapp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;crazeapp</a><p>And you can use it for iOS, Android, and web browsers.<p>I&#x27;ve also created a portal for app information and store links:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craze.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craze.app</a><p>Any feedback you have from the apps is very much welcome,<p>Thank you very much for reading this!')
