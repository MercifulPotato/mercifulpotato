I&#x27;m sorry if I didn&#x27;t explain myself well enough for everyone to understand.<p>My point is that &quot;readability&quot; is composed by many factors, not just one. What is &quot;readable&quot; to some will not be &quot;readable&quot; by others. It depends.<p>For someone who knows Fortran, learning a Fortran-like language is easy (like C or JS). For someone who knows Common Lisp, Clojure is easy. But for someone who knows Fortran, Clojure is less familiar, hence the code will, on a glance, look less &quot;readable&quot;.<p>The other factor is if something is &quot;simple&quot; by itself.<p>Most of this view comes from Rich Hickey, who wrote Clojure. He discusses &quot;readability&quot; or &quot;simplicity&quot; rather, in his talk &quot;Simple Made Easy&quot;. If you haven&#x27;t seen it before, do yourself a favor and watch it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;Simple-Made-Easy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;Simple-Made-Easy&#x2F;</a><p>He&#x27;ll explain it much better, and with further points, much better than I ever can.')
