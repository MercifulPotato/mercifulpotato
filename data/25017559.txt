There were only two bad calls this cycle and every other outcome was within the margin of error.  It was pretty much the same case in 2016 where people who had no idea what they were talking about suddenly decided they were certain polling failed because they are unable to grasp the concept of margin of error and sample size.<p>Polls can only guess about turnout and the try to work backwards from there.  The turnout estimates were wrong but not shockingly so, and as a consequence a lot of polls ended up having the result be at the far end of their margin of error.  Nothing went wrong.  Polling is hard.  Get over this idea that you can have some sort of certainty regarding an election until we actually hold the election.')
