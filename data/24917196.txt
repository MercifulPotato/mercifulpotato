And started off my career by specialising in networks and security. And all my life I exhibited as much confidence as you are in your comment.<p>The moral of the story, is that if you are in tech, a security professional, or work in crypto - <i>don&#x27;t take for granted your security</i>. No matter where you are in your career, what&#x27;s your salary, or how many people report to you. Take time annually, bi-annually, or quarterly to review your online security. Especially if you&#x27;ve been on the internet since 90s. You might not even remember the websites you&#x27;ve sign up and emails you have.<p>&gt; So, what does this say about Apple security?<p>If you can explain how Apple 2FA call was bypassed that you be helpful. What wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the article is that I spoke with two Senior Advisors from Apple and they&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t been taking this very seriously, to say the least. &quot;Consider reinstalling the OS&quot; and suggestions alike. It&#x27;s an obvious next step to take, but it doesn&#x27;t answer the question of how 2FA was breached. Reinstalling the OS or taking any other common measures in such sophisticated incidents don&#x27;t prevent future incidents alike.')
