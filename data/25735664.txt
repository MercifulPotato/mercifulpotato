Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610395584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733835, text='&gt;&gt; Do you know how many of the people arrested in connection with the Capitol invasion were active users of Parler? Zero. The planning was largely done on Facebook. This is all a bullshit pretext for silencing competitors on ideological grounds: just the start.<p>&gt;  This is almost certainly false. For example, see the arrest of the leader of the Proud Boys (for events prior to Capitol, but played active role on Parler encouraging proud boys violence that day):<p>And this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;technology&#x2F;capitol-twitter-facebook-trump.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;06&#x2F;technology&#x2F;capitol-twitte...</a>:<p>&gt; Those alternative social media sites were rife with Trump supporters organizing and communicating on Wednesday. On Parler, one trending hashtag was #stormthecapitol. Many Trump supporters on the sites also appeared to believe a false rumor that Antifa, a left-wing movement, was responsible for committing violence at the protests.<p>&gt; “WAKE UP AMERICA, IT’S ANTIFA and BLM operatives who are committing the violence, NOT TRUMP SUPPORTERS!,” said one Parler account member called @Trumpfans100, offering no evidence for the claims.<p>Even though Greenwald is wrong, he&#x27;s not <i>totally</i> wrong.  I think he&#x27;s correct that the &quot;majority&quot; of the planning happened on Facebook, but that was kind of a funnel to Parler.  My understanding is that was mostly for seemingly legit stuff, event for protests, was done on Facebook.  Those pages then linked to Parler, where more extreme planning took place, out-of-reach from Facebook&#x27;s policies.')
