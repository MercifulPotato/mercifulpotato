It&#x27;s about productivity.<p>I can, and have, written high performance systems in assembly (long ago). I&#x27;ve written many high performance systems in C. Rarely, but sometimes, still do.<p>But doing it in assembly takes a long time. No way to justify time to market on that one today. In C, sometimes it&#x27;s worth it.<p>But Java productivity is so much higher and (if written properly) leaves very little performance on the table. It&#x27;s the sweet spot of performance vs. productivity still today and has been for about 15 years (~Java 1.4).')
