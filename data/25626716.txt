In order to use it the container must be permitted to allow its processes to elevate their privileges.<p>If the container is running as root permitting it is redundant, since the kernel doesn’t filter root for kernel capabilities anyways.<p>If a privileged user sets CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE on an executable binary using setpcap to allow a non-root user the ability in a container to bind to a privileged port, elevated privileges are still required for execve to create a process that is permitted to use the kernel capability. Think sudo but for processes.<p>The argument with containers is that binding to a privileged port isn’t necessary, so you shouldn’t do it. And by not doing it you improve your security posture.')
