Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25868451, 25868688], score=None, time=1611289355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25867954, text='&gt; People dont like to think they are being tricked, and will actively reject truth if it contradicts what they already believe.<p>I never liked that study because people always read it like that.<p>When people receive new information, they try to make it consistent with what they already believe by making the smallest possible change to the existing belief system to make them consistent.<p>That could be as simple as just not believing you.<p>This can strengthen their belief in the existing thing because they just evaluated it against some potentially conflicting new information without rejecting it.<p>Just not believing you doesn&#x27;t work for an article like that because it&#x27;s reasoning rather than facts. They have to find a hole in the logic if they want to keep their existing beliefs. So they&#x27;ll come up with something like, maybe that&#x27;s how it works for other conspiracy theories, but this one is real so it doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>But now the logic is in their head, so the next time the conspiracy theory has to be reframed to match a changing reality, they notice that what&#x27;s happening is consistent with the logic. It makes them doubt.<p>And the more information and reasoning they&#x27;re exposed to which is inconsistent with the conspiracy theory, the more they doubt. It just like how the Big Lie works, but in reverse. You expose them to truth and logic over and over until they can no longer make the conspiracy theory consistent with it.<p>&gt; Doing something like this can be great, but it takes time and effort, meanwhile acts of terrorism are being committed now.<p>&quot;Acts of terrorism&quot; aren&#x27;t speech so as soon as they go there they go to jail. I mean they were planning it openly on Facebook, it was kind of a discredit to law enforcement that they weren&#x27;t arrested for the conspiracy to begin with.<p>&gt; Most qanoners dont really believe it, and if separated from their echo chambers, will deradicalize themselves<p>But that&#x27;s why we need free speech, right? To avoid echo chambers.<p>Even if private censorship is <i>allowed</i>, that doesn&#x27;t make it a <i>good idea</i> if it causes people to leave for some Voat-like cesspool where they won&#x27;t encounter ordinary people anymore.')
