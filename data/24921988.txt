I hadn&#x27;t seen this spam vector before, but suddenly I&#x27;m seeing my account get @mentioned on docs that are clearly spam. I&#x27;ve tried to report through official channels but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help, either the spammers are rotating accounts, or else the &quot;report&quot; button is not monitored.<p>(Also, it&#x27;s just awful that they make you click through to the spam document before you can report it. Why don&#x27;t I have an option to report spam in the notification email?)<p>I don&#x27;t want to turn off my notifications outright but I&#x27;m not sure what else to do at this point.')
