Lots of UI&#x2F;UX bugs can simply be attributed to the programmer taking the most simple possible design.<p>In this case, the async logic is not advanced. In fact, I&#x27;m willing to bet that this is what happened: at first, the file-opening was synchronous in the GUI. People complained that opening certain files locked up the file picker, so a developer sticks the file-opening code in a background thread. This produces the above bug, without complicating the input design - in fact, preventing the bug requires making additional changes to the code in some way.')
