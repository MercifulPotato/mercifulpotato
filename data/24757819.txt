E.g., imagine an airplane.<p>If the goal is maximum range, we should get rid of first-class seats, life vests, and all sort of useless amenities.  (Do we really need four lavatories?)<p>If the goal is maximum comfort, we should get rid of all economy seats.  No more affordable plane tickets.<p>If the goal is maximum speed, we should retire our fleet and re-introduce supersonic flights.  Those suckers living under a frequent flight path can use earplugs.<p>If the goal is maximum safety...<p>What I&#x27;m saying is: every time we say &quot;our goal is X&quot;, it implies an additional condition &quot;assuming other things stay reasonable.&quot;  Of course, something like COVID is not within anyone&#x27;s living memory, so it&#x27;s hard to build a consensus on what&#x27;s reasonable - but we can&#x27;t just short-circuit it by saying &quot;Just say what you want and stick to it!&quot;')
