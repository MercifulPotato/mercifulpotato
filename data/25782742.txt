They own a platform, they are determining who can and cannot speak on that platform. That&#x27;s the same thing every news paper, internet forum, email server, BBS, public bulletin board, or really any publishing of any kind has done since the invention of publishing.<p>Twitter is not part of the government, and it does not have a monopoly on internet communication. Hell, it doesn&#x27;t even charge for its services. You are not entitled to use their platform.<p>If you are disgusted and disappointed in social media for their behavior, that&#x27;s perfectly reasonable! There are things you can do about it! you can refuse to use their service, refuse to recommend it to friends, promote competitors, etc.<p>What you cannot do is pretend that just because they are a large wealthy organization you have some kind of right to use their platform to say whatever you want.')
