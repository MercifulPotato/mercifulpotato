Item(by='socrates1998', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612194239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989199, text='&gt; This practice meant that trades placed on Robinhood werenâ€™t executed at the best price, costing customer tens of millions of dollars, even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission<p>This is why I stopped using them last summer. They messed up a few of my trades. Either by giving me a worse price than was quoted or my reversing the trade after it had already gone through.<p>After it happened a second time in a short time frame, I knew something was up. I closed all my trades and took all my money out.<p>What&#x27;s really weird is that these &quot;errors&quot; started happening only after I started making good trades. When I lost money on a trade (which happened a lot for the first few years of casual trading), I NEVER had an execution error. Then, when I had my first good run of trading in years, all of the sudden I had TWO trades messed up within a week of each other???<p>It was all too conincidental for me. Either they were messing up my trades because of incompetence or they were letting someone take the other end of my trades.<p>Whichever it was, I left.<p>Robinhood had an insane run of good press and was able to within years of crap product. Now they are finally getting what&#x27;s coming to them.')
