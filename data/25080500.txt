If they are causing you frustration then you can turn them off under system preferences &gt; trackpad in the “scroll and zoom” and “more gestures” sections. I’d recommend keeping most of the scroll ones and disabling most of the others, then one by one turning on any of the ones you think would be most useful as you get more used to them.<p>As for the Safari issue, I have no idea off the top of my head.')
