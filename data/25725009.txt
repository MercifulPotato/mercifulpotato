For that matter, similar measures were temporarily taken and then rescinded in the past; proof of non-totalitarianism. Further proof is minority governments and recent changes in governing parties. Totalitarian governments don&#x27;t have these.<p>I think further burden of proof on wether Canada is a totalitarian state reasonably falls on those who believe it is. It seems reasonable to accept that Canada isn&#x27;t totalitarian as a premise, when I say that some restrictions on freedom of speech don&#x27;t inevitably lead to totalitarianism.')
