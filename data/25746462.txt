Item(by='hosa_father', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1610457854, title='Ask HN: How do you achieve work life balance with parenthood?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Using a throwaway account. I have been a developer for almost 15 years now and a parent of 2.5 yo. Increasingly I am finding it difficult to balance work and life. I enjoy the work I do but as my teams are spread across time zones am finding it hard to spend time with my kid (meetings morning and evening). The Covid situation has made it even more difficult. Now there is a nice career ahead of me if I continue to work as hard as do but I have a doubt if this is coming at the cost of opportunity to spend quality time with my kid. Others in my company work as hard as I do and are also available for calls and meetings at odd hours. Not sure how they are able to balance this. I am also considering taking a break for 6 months but not sure if that would just postpone the issue.')
