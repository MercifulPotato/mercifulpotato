Anybody posing a challenge to this basic low common denominator will become a target of the State which declares itself as the sole monopoly over violence.<p>This is why I believe countries fight all the time, it is simply not enough to hold monopoly over your own borders, to maintain its &quot;large security apparatus&quot; it needs new threats otherwise it stops growing, losing momentum and many groups declaring their own autonomous zones will find it easy to challenge the government as we saw in Syria and Arab Spring countries.')
