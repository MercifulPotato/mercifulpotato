Sometimes it seems like revealing how cache misses or prefetchers work is some sort of magic trick that academia skips over.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen where software engineers will stop at the boundaries of &quot;CS&quot; when it comes to problem solving(ex: not consider the hardware because it&#x27;s a &quot;hardware&quot; problem rather than rolling up their sleeves and digging in). With the pace of development in software you need to continue to learn outside of a school setting and cultivate that curiosity that helps you come at problems from new and interesting ways.')
