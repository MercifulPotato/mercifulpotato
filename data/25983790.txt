There are some uses I can think of - e.g. Spotify registers a custom protocol handler, as does Steam.\nBut in general I would expect enabling websites to be receivers of shared data will enable some interesting new use cases.<p>As an example, I wanted to create a web extension to automatically add something to Anki via AnkiWeb. The share API seemed to be the natural way to do this, but with it unsupported on desktop, that approach was dead in the water.')
