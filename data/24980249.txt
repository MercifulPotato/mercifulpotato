I never ask for a cover letter, but if someone sends one I&#x27;ll pretty much always look at it.  I will say that I don&#x27;t place much weight on the cover letter content unless it specifically highlights something relevant to the position not sufficiently covered by the resume.  Usually I just look at the cover letter as a secondary confirmation that the person can write reasonably well and knows what the position is about.<p>However, I pretty much never read thank you&#x2F;follow-up emails after an interview and don&#x27;t care if candidates send them or not.')
