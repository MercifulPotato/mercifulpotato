Apple works around 3 - 4 years ahead of the competition. By the time the &#x27;rivals&#x27; catch up with getting M1 performance on an ARM processor, Apple would already have released an M3 or M4 Mac Mini or Mac Pro.<p>Microsoft is probably the closest with the SQ processor in the Surface line-up but is certainly not as performant as the M1. As for everyone else, this plan to &#x27;catch up&#x27; might as well call it a day.<p>The M1 chip seems to have dismantled the whole competition for another 3 years, however the development ecosystem is still unoptimised and very early. I&#x27;m waiting for an M3 or M4 Mac and when the software is fully optimised for Apple Silicon.')
