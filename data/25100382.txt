I&#x27;ve seen some angry sentiment from other maintainers about people demanding they implement features without contributing back. There was a piece on hn recently where a maintainer went ballistic on GitHub about big corporations not paying him for his work.<p>It&#x27;s pretty funny to me. I had a bunch of people ask me to implement features or fix bugs, and I just told them I don&#x27;t want to spend time doing that. Very few had gotten entitled, and even those went silent when I told them I&#x27;m a volunteer.<p>I think it&#x27;s still important to let people speak and ask for things, even if you&#x27;re not going to give it to them. Also I have zero expectation of anyone ever paying me for my open-source contributions.<p>One nice thing about rude people is that at least they tell you what they want.')
