Item(by='majewsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603977964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24925738, text='QObject is not a base class for everything like in those codebases GP probably thinks about. It&#x27;s a base class for a very specific set of functionality that can be very roughly summarized as &quot;the thing wants to participate in the signal-slot communication scheme&quot;. For example, QFile is a QObject because it has ready-to-read signals etc.<p>But there are also tons of classes in Qt that are not QObject, esp. all the value classes like QList or QPoint or QString.<p>If anything, the biggest sin of QObject might be its name. If it had been named QActor or something like that, people wouldn&#x27;t mind that much.')
