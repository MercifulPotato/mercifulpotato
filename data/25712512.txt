Too many times got scammed&#x2F;never delivered to <i>me</i>.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t call it theft per se, but incompetence, yes, but fool me too many times, my fault for being trusting.<p>Now as a seller, you are pretty much immune from chargebacks and having to delivery a quality product, it&#x27;s super interesting, low trust dynamic.')
