Or is it the &quot;newness&quot; you are paying for? Have you7 watched all other movies worth watching already?<p>I would guess that people are (or were) paying extra to go to a theater because of the spectacular large screen and the experience in general. One feature of going to a theater is that you have to watch the movie in one sitting and there are no ad-breaks. That can add to the totality of the experience. And it&#x27;s fun to get out of your house and to do that you need a reason .')
