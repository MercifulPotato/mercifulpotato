A large brokerage that has been through crashes before has systems in place, and can spread the remaining risk around.  If a large portion of your customers are invested in a handful of stocks, their risk becomes your risk.  Also, other customers of Robinhood who have cash that is in an uninsured account are also at risk even if they are not invested in GME.')
