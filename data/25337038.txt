The other places fell short on one or more of them.<p>I don&#x27;t remember all of the factors they found, but I remember a few.<p>One was nearby top tier research universities.<p>Another was ready access to investors willing to invest in new kinds of businesses. This one was a problem in several older places. The investors there just wanted to invest in companies doing old things or in doing things related to the main existing industry of the region.<p>Tolerance of failure was important. In some places, failure forever taints you. Start a company and it fails? The investment bankers no longer want to talk to you, and you don&#x27;t get invited anymore to the parties and events where the behind the scenes networking goes on. In SV having a failed startup isn&#x27;t a big deal.')
