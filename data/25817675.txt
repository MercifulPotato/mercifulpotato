Apple used its monopoly power to make its users buy an inferior product so that others would have no choice but to adapt. How many of those users, given the option, would <i>choose</i> to buy a machine with no Flash support or with only one type of port?<p>It is, by the way, absolutely <i>not</i> a clear advantage to get rid of old ports. USB C is about five years old. It is absolutely ludicrous to claim that any peripheral older than USB C is obsolete. That goes double for audio equipment. I have decades-old equipment that is still excellent by modern standards, but Apple has decided it&#x27;s got to go because the 3.5mm headphone jack is unfashionable. If I were an Apple customer I would have no choice but to throw out all my electronics every few years or carry around a suitcase of adapters.')
