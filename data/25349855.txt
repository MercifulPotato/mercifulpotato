There are cheaper FPGAs with PCIe support coming onto the market, but they tend to be low on fabric since they are designed for low end applications (Lattice Crosslink NX).<p>I think there are a few fundamental problems with FPGA compute offload. First is that, as niche products, FPGAs are always a node or two behind the leading edge, so their logic gates run slower than CPUs and GPUs; even their &quot;hard&quot; compute blocks are not as fast. Second, the fundamental nature of FPGAs as a &quot;sea of logic&quot; mean that routing delays reduce your max frequency, or make pipelining necessary thereby incurring latency. Third is memory; historically, FPGAs have not supported high-bandwidth GDDRx, and if you&#x27;re crunching on something you generally want bandwidth. The latest high-end FPGAs do have HBM but they are quite expensive.<p>So why would anyone want something that&#x27;s slower and more expensive? Well, you have to be doing something special, like a lot of custom parallel processing pipelines, or with hard realtime requirements. Basically, a niche, and that doesn&#x27;t lend itself to economies of scale.')
