I think this is in general a real shame because it leads to all the cargo culting madness that&#x27;s so prevalent in the industry.<p>In PG&#x27;s case, I find that most of his blog posts read like post hoc rationalisations based on sweeping generalisations (e.g. that you can be either &quot;earnest&quot; or jovial and funny and not both strikes me as a particularly false dichotomy). Which wouldn&#x27;t nearly bother me as much if they weren&#x27;t also often full of thinly veiled contempt for different kinds of people (e.g. people who are actually good at bringing people together). It sometimes reads to me as a sort of &quot;I was bullied&#x2F;excluded as a nerdy teenager and now I&#x27;m gonna show them how much better nerds are and why they will (or at least should) rule the world&quot;. In a world where we increasingly realise the dangers of big tech companies making decisions that impact all of us, including people completely outside of the original tech bubble, I don&#x27;t think this is a very good position to take.')
