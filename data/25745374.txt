Item(by='72deluxe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610450447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25726414, text='Yes I have a 1972 VW Beetle, and a 2016 VW Beetle. I can safely say that the former is far simpler and also doesn&#x27;t require a computer to diagnose or repair. It also doesn&#x27;t have any firmwares that I can&#x27;t update, eg. the bluetooth controller in the modern Bug, or the stereo. I can&#x27;t enable the telephone button on my steering wheel without paying VW. I can&#x27;t enable Android Auto without paying VW Â£200 here in the UK. (They couldn&#x27;t even get it to work when I asked them to).<p>As for the mechanical components of the car - the modern Bug is a diesel (non-PD) so has a common rail fuel system. I can read fault codes with the OBD2 mechanism but not everything is accessible.<p>Both tremendous fun but the modern one is 100 times more complex and I would struggle to maintain it single-handedly. But I don&#x27;t feel the need to reduce the modern car or &quot;fix&quot; the issue of its complexity simply because it is more complex.<p>My wife has a Mini that has developed a fault but who knows what sensor has failed according to the OBD2 codes?! I don&#x27;t feel the need to &quot;fix&quot; that and reduce it to the old 1991 Mini Cooper I had (which had its own set of baffling problems, like in-line fuses for important things like the injector but a fuse box for non-essential things like the interior light..... but that&#x27;s another story).')
