While this capability existed in 802.11ac, multi-user \nMIMO will now add communication in the upstream direction. With 8x8 support, which was added \nduring the 802.11n amendment, new APs can now support four simultaneous 2x2 MU-MIMO clients \nin both the upstream and downstream directions. MU-MIMO will work together with OFDMA to allow \nmultiple clients to communicate simultaneously across multiple frequency ranges as well as multiple \nspatial streams.<p>This along with ofdm helping with the simplex problem, will likely mean a wireless ap can come close to a 4 or maybe 8 port switch - but will still be far away from a 24 port switch in terms of full duplex throughput.<p>This is likely to make a difference if streaming film from a NAS and on to a display, using miracast over infrastructure[1] or similar bw heavy applications - consider for example two displays and two devices doing this via one ap.<p>For (much) more see:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duckware.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;wifi-in-the-us.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duckware.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;wifi-in-the-us.html</a><p>And maybe:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisco.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;td&#x2F;docs&#x2F;wireless&#x2F;controller&#x2F;technotes&#x2F;8-7&#x2F;b_wireless_high_client_density_design_guide.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisco.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;td&#x2F;docs&#x2F;wireless&#x2F;controller&#x2F;te...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;surface-hub&#x2F;miracast-over-infrastructure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;surface-hub&#x2F;miracast-over-i...</a><p>Ps I just discovered this was a thing :)')
