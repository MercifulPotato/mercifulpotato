The marketing is dead, but the legend lives on years later.<p>IBM&#x27;s CPU-advancements of pipelining, out-of-order execution, etc. etc. were all implemented into Intel&#x27;s chips throughout the 90s. Whatever a RISC-machine did, Intel proved that the &quot;CISC&quot; architecture could follow suite.<p>------<p>From a technical perspective: all modern chips follow the same strategy. They are superscalar, deeply-pipelined, deeply branch predicted, micro-op &#x2F; macro-op fused &quot;emulated&quot; machines using Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm across a far larger &quot;reorder buffer register&quot; set which is completely independent of the architectural specification. (aka: out-of-order execution).<p>Ex: Intel Skylake has 180 64-bit reorder buffer registers (despite having 16 architectural registers). ARM A72 has 128-ROB registers (depsite having 32-architectural registers). The &quot;true number&quot; of registers of any CPU is independent of the instruction set.')
