The fact is that them doing so is a net positive for humanity. There are billions (BILLIONS) of people who can now access knowledge that&#x27;s been locked away. That&#x27;s a net positive.<p>There&#x27;s only a tiny fraction of that that is self-funded, and those folk can just stop publishing, or find another business model.')
