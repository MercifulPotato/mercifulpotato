Content creators draw the attention they sell to advertisers.<p>They made the mistake that they did comply and now get overwhelmed with further demands. They could have just had a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; strategy and I am very sure advertisers would just have continued to pay, because it benefits them too.<p>Youtube set the precedent for advertisers demanding editorial control on content, it is purely on their misbehavior we have this problem.<p>Because now advertisers can be made responsible where their ads are shown and what is seen next to them.')
