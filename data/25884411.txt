(&quot;Hey dkarl, can you reach out to so-and-so; he needs some help with the plagtron events tables.&quot;)  If you&#x27;re there right now, we can chat for a few seconds so I can clarify your question and give you exactly the information you need.  If you&#x27;re not there, I&#x27;m going to spend twenty minutes writing something comprehensive, especially if we&#x27;re in different time zones and your day tomorrow will start six hours before mine.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s good to default to a comprehensive write-up if it will be useful for a long time to multiple people, but it can be a bit wasteful if you write up a thorough description of a relational schema and it turns out they just wanted to know why there was a particular index on a particular table.')
