I want them to be transparent about it, and if I don&#x27;t like the way they do it <i>I&#x27;ll go elsewhere.</i> To me, that is the free market -- not forcing Twitter to amplify all voices indiscriminately. If Twitter was the only game in town I&#x27;d feel differently, but that is far from the case.<p>I think most really do want some level of curation. Do you want child porn on your feed? Endless ads for fake Viagra? Animal abuse?<p>I cannot imagine a platform like Twitter being useful without some kind of curation. I realize that blocking the NYPost is an opinionated move in some ways.<p>They were transparent about the reason, and I agreed with their move. That&#x27;s all I ask. There are plenty of other places with more relaxed standards, and they&#x27;re still available to me when I really want to drink from the firehose.<p><pre><code>    They can do it, but it&#x27;s a silly, foolish way to run \n    a social network.\n</code></pre>\nShould HN stop being &quot;silly&quot; and moderating submissions?')
