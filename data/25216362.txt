It is whether or not you can use standard (octet-focused) parsing functions to deal with those strings.  This is what makes utf-8 &quot;special&quot;.  No byte of a utf-8 multibyte sequence will ever have a value &lt; 127.  So for most &quot;syntactic&quot; parsing problems, you can use standard C functions to deal with utf-8 strings - something that is not true with most other multibyte character encodings.')
