The GP comment claimed &quot;It is likely that the vast majority of invitations to people&#x27;s homes were not sincere, and by taking locals up on their not-actually-intended offers, those foreign travelers are probably causing great inconvenience&quot;. Furthermore, the concept of being invited into homes is not something foreign to me, I have Couchsurfed in many countries and hosted many Couchsurfers. I have a decent feel for that sort of thing. There is a very large portion of people who actually do want foreigners to come stay at their home, myself included. Is that so difficult to believe?<p>As for the sandwiches: well, he also did it for a fellow Iranian, and I am pretty confident that I wasn&#x27;t misunderstanding the situation: the guy just has a massive heart, and I&#x27;ve seen him do everything he can to help other people.<p>And as to your opinion about taarof, well, I&#x27;ll just say that I have met many Iranians that simply regard it harmless, amusing, or an important part of their own culture. Iran is a big country, and just like you can find Americans that hate their own culture&#x27;s habit of asking &quot;how are you&quot; with no sincerity, there are others that find it important.')
