Perl5, as you might not know is not developed anymore, it&#x27;s only maintained into oblivion, getting worse and worse over time. 20 years no new features, only design mistakes over mistakes piling up. perl11 provided the continuation of Perl development, but the maintainers in their tunnel vision do not agree (yet). Almost everything they did in the last 6 years came from cperl, but it&#x27;s still only 10%.<p>Now it&#x27;s on perl11.github.io<p>When the squatters give up, fine, but GitHub served us well over the years. Better than everyone else, esp. Google.')
