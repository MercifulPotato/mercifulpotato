It is seen as a necessity because of the way the educational system requires you to conjure up a certain set of knowledge at a particular time (a test). With zettelkasten and digital gardening (or any other method with similar goals) the process and habits that you acquire over time become more important. The goal is not to optimize for the (short-term) memorization of some knowledge only to shove it aside and move on to the next set of knowledge to memorize for the next test. Rather these methods are trying to design a process by which you can build on ideas iteratively. In order to really embrace these methods we&#x27;ll have to see changes in the educational system as well or we&#x27;ll end up with methodologies optimized for the educational system that is currently in place (which is what spaced repetition is in my view).')
