I reached out to my immigration attorney and below is the response she sent →<p>&quot;<i>Per my last email to you back in November, nothing needs to be done at this time.  Nothing will change the processing times, and we will just need to notify the NVC once the I-130 is approved, to update the category at that time, because USCIS requires these requests to be made in writing via letter, and they never actually act on the case anyways.<p>You will be fine, and once we get the I-130 approval is when we’ll take action on this.</i>&quot;<p>I am unsure how should I take her advise. Is there something my attorney is missing? Is there something you can think of I should request her to do?<p>Also, last time we had speculated that I may get my GC in 2022&#x2F;23. \nDo you think the current pandemic may prolong my GC? \nMy father said my file must be in <i>cold storage</i> now, albeit I am not entirely sure what it means.<p>I am 31, unmarried, born and raised in India, bachelors degree holder with 4.5 years of workex in IT.')
