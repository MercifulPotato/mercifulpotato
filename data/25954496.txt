I&#x27;m not talking about grading on effort, I&#x27;m talking about grading on achievement. Nobody was talking about how much effort went into the app. While I would guess it might&#x27;ve been a lot, I have no clue and I don&#x27;t care. The question was, do you grade them on what <i>they achieved</i>, or on what <i>someone else achieved on something else</i> that they had no influence over, but which they clearly had no choice but to depend on... regardless of how much effort did or didn&#x27;t go into their work.')
