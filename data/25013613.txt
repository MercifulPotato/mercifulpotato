It’s not my absolute priority job wise but it’s the reason I keep working whenever I get discouraged.<p>And I have a good family, and while I might get a chance to make some other legacy someday, I am pretty happy with my legacy being my family.<p>But I do try to keep some sight of the good of the wider world, and so I try to be generous as much as I can.<p>This doesn’t necessarily maximize my impact, I think the swirling tides of history make any long term impact calculations a bit arbitrary, but it gives me a life that most of the time I can be proud of, and that is more than enough')
