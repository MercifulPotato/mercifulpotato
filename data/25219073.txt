Even if they left all the other sometimes-problematic security aspects in place (like enforced sandboxing), it would be enough. People would find a way to do what they need to. I don&#x27;t need it to be a full replacement for my Mac, but it sucks that I can&#x27;t use this amazing, capable device to a bit of work on my sofa or on the train.<p>Of course, they&#x27;ll never do it, because money. Even if 99% of apps stayed on the App Store, the highest earning 1% would be sure to leave.')
