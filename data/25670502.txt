After years of horrific abuse of protesters by police, and denouncement of such, I get to sit here and watch those same people turn around and denounce non-escalation just because of who the protesters are this time. Like most protests, I feel sure that the majority of the violence was committed by a relative few extremists and a lot of people were content to express their anger with perfectly legitimate shouting and standing around. Had this event been escalated it is likely a lot of those people would be dead or injured, making this whole thing a lot worse.<p>Sadly, I am becoming quite used to being disappointed in my countrymen.')
