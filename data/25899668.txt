My grandfather died early in the pandemic (May). He tested positive for a period of three weeks and then tested negative a few times. He started feeling better and we were hopeful, but the damage was too great and his heart failed a few weeks later.<p>I really just can&#x27;t put my feelings into words.<p>He was in a physical rehab facility after surgery. When the pandemic hit, visitation was forbidden. Turns out most of the staff were scared and basically abandoned the patients. The specific facility specialized in elderly patients who had severe mobility issues.<p>He told us on the phone once at the beginning that he was scared because all he heard at night were people screaming for help as they stopped being able breathe as COVID was destroying their lungs. He figured it wasn&#x27;t long before he caught it. However, no one would sign off on discharging him, and by the time we got the bare minimum to care for him at home and the legal crap sorted out, he caught it.<p>He lived practically opposite the country to me (I&#x27;m in LA, he was in Boston), so I didn&#x27;t see him very often. He also wasn&#x27;t the kindest person to me growing up, so I didn&#x27;t really talk to him all that often either.<p>With that, it just doesn&#x27;t feel real that he&#x27;s gone. There was no funeral, no memorial service, as everything is tabled until after the pandemic. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll really set in until I visit my grandmother and he&#x27;s not there.<p>And you see the assholes who want to say taking precautions should be a personal choice or are an invasion of their personal freedoms. I wish every single one of them could experience the fear my grandfather did. Stuck in a bed, unable to walk, waiting for a plague to take them as their fellow patients succumb one by one. It&#x27;s just disgusting.<p>My grandmother, wearing a full hazmat suit with an oxygen tank, was able to be there with him when he passed.')
