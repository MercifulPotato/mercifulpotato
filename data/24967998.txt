The firmware for the RCX brick was stored in battery-backed RAM, so you had to re-upload it via infrared whenever you changed the batteries. But the ROM bootloader would only accept a firmware image if it contained the string:<p>&gt; &quot;Do you byte, when I knock?&quot;<p>After uploading, the host computer would send an &quot;unlock request&quot; with the string &quot;LEGOÂ®&quot;, at which point the RCX would return the other half of the rhyme:<p>&gt; &quot;Just a bit off the block!&quot;<p>I assume the only reason for jumping through these hoops was to have a legal excuse to discourage other companies from making interoperable products. I have no idea whether this strategy would have actually held up in court; in any case, there were plenty of homebrew tools that just embedded the magic strings anyway.')
