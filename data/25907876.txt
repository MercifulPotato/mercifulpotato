I did this for a while starting in 2001, and then for a bit from 2005-2010.<p>Essentially what happened a lot was that the domain providers seemed to realize that email hosting was a pain (it is, but it also isn&#x27;t, depending on your time and resources), and so there were relatively frequent plan changes and service quality changes. It wasn&#x27;t their core business, and this &quot;core&quot; thing always comes up in internal discussions when people are annoyed by something they&#x27;re doing which they don&#x27;t like doing.<p>Running my own mail server has been easier. G Suite and Fastmail have also been easier.<p>However I wouldn&#x27;t call the domain registrar experience a bad experience. So if the numbers add up for you, why not try it?<p>I&#x27;d also treat the business v. personal as a separate problem. For example maybe you could get a personal email at a lower-cost domain name and own two domains, never a bad idea.')
