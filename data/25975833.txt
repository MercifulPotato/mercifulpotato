That’s really great feedback.<p>I was planning on adding scrollwheel zoom support soon for computers, and pinch to zoom on mobile is a must have.<p>Regarding snapping pieces inadvertently and cheating, I might try to reduce the snap distance if someone is dragging a piece above a certain speed. That should help a bit.<p>For auto rotation, I’ve heard from a few people that they want rotation completely disabled, while others want it to be more challenging and not automatic. I might need to offer users an option around this.<p>EDIT: just noticed your point about preventing snapping to hidden pieces on a stack. Great idea too! I’ll likely give that a try :)')
