Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[25460652], score=None, time=1608237813, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459754, text='Assuming they don&#x27;t change their practices, it&#x27;s always better to use a different broker. Robinhood was the first to eliminate comissions, but now most brokerages have also eliminated comissions, so say thanks to Robinhood and then use an established broker.<p>I would expect market and limit orders to have been handled similarly. Market makers would like to trade with retail investors, and they&#x27;re willing to pay X for that; if Robinhood takes 80% of X, and passes on 20% to clients as price improvement, and other brokerages pass on 80%, your limit orders may execute sooner at other brokerages (as your limit is effectively 0.6X higher&#x2F;lower), or may end up executing with bigger  price improvement.')
