That gives business owners far too much power over elections (and Citizens United already gives them too much, IMO). I want democracy, not plutocracy.<p>&gt; Which candidate do you hate the most? If what you were saying was reasonable, then you could be forced to provide material support for that candidate. How would you feel about that?<p>Absolutely fine, if that &quot;material support&quot; was merely providing the same business I provide everyone else, at the usual cost. To me, paid services are not &quot;material support&quot;, a phrase I would only use to describe in-kind contributions (that is, services provided for free).<p>And 99% of businesses already act that way. The local office supply store doesn&#x27;t discriminate based on politics. What&#x27;s backwards about expecting big tech to act like other businesses?<p>&gt; Stripe is not a utility like electricity or the phone company. Nor are they anywhere close to a monopoly... [candidates] have other options for online payment processing<p>That&#x27;s an important point, and here&#x27;s the rule I would propose to account for it: treat refusing to do business with a candidate while doing business with their opponent as an in-kind contribution to their opponent. If the cost of finding an alternative is small, denying services will be allowed as a small in-kind contribution.<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer and I&#x27;m talking about how I think things should work, not what the current law is, but I believe that&#x27;s the legal principle behind the Equal-Time Rule, so it&#x27;s not entirely legally unprecedented.')
