Searching for &quot;10900k vs i7-1165G7&quot; showed the 10900k as mostly faster with a few exceptions.<p>I&#x27;m curious about next week&#x27;s launch and benchmarks, Apple&#x27;s claims compare it to a 1.2GHz i7, which I expect to quickly throttle. That&#x27;s why I also expect the parent comment to be right, current desktop CPUs will still be faster.')
