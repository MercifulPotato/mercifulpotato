I&#x27;ll have to read the study to find out, but three axes I&#x27;m immediately curious about:<p>1) Are we seeing a side-effect of bothering to look for mental illness in a generally-underdiagnosed population? Maybe most people have a bit, and scrutinizing people that ended up in the hospital is finding things that most mental health research participants aren&#x27;t screened for.<p>2) I don&#x27;t have a mechanism in mind, but it&#x27;s always important to filter for correlation without causation, or even for reverse-causation; is there something about predisposition for mental illness that makes one more susceptible to COVID?<p>3) COVID hits an elderly population harder, and age is already correlated with mental illness. How did they control for age?')
