Kind of implying that logically functional structures arise from randomness given enough time. The rules in Conway&#x27;s game of life are simpler than real world physics, but it is enough to convince me that in a reasonable time frame (Earth&#x27;s timeline), given enough building blocks and iterations, there&#x27;s not really any reason to not assume the chemical building blocks of life happened to create all sorts of complicated structures that constantly failed to replicate or survive.<p>On Earth, there was a lot of primordial soup, and there were a lot of chemical reactions. On a span of millions of years, complex data structures (such as RNA) may have occurred constantly somewhere on the planet. Every now and then, a cell randomly formed. Sometimes prokaryotes with RNA formed, like weird things in Conway&#x27;s game of life. And then maybe once upon a time, a cell with just the right RNA to make it be able to reproduce in the ooze formed.<p>That or life on Earth is panspermic and we have skipped the pre-prokaryotic evolution altogether')
