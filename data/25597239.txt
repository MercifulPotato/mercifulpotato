The only criticism I have about the writing is that it is a little repetitive – the book could probably be 75% as long and still get 99% of the point across. However, the length of the book primarily reflects the depth of the research, rather than editing.  And for those who are afraid of reading a long but important book, I don’t know what to tell you.  I suspect this will be a pivotal book for our time.')
