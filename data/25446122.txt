It was an incredible amount of capital that was all intended to help evolve the network. Losing all this capital and momentum would have been detrimental to that goal.<p>- The DAO was arguably an unlicensed security and losing the funds of that many investors would have been a problem for many who had a hand in building it. By returning investments, they basically made this a non-issue.<p>So again, do I agree with the choice? Absolutely not, you should not proclaim &quot;code is law!&quot; until it&#x27;s inconvenient for you. Did they have a choice? No, the roll-back was inevitable as soon as the DAO contract was deployed.')
