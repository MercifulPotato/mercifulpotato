The problems here are categories like &quot;inciting violence&quot; which are just not clear-cut. It&#x27;s not like a copyright protection case, where it&#x27;s usually very clear that someone uploaded a copy of Pulp Fiction, and you can set strict rules for the edge cases by saying &quot;fifteen second clips of videos are fine, sixteen second clips are banned, yeah it&#x27;s arbitrary but it has to be and now we&#x27;ll apply that fairly.&quot;<p>For &quot;inciting violence&quot; the problems will be like, someone says &quot;Hey everyone get ready to take action on X date. Be prepared! Be at location X! You know what to do! Tell all your friends! Remember your second amendment rights!&quot; And none of those statements are inherently violent themselves, they are all compatible with the sort of peaceful protest that we want to encourage. But the emergent behavior of a whole lot of communication like this can be, well someone is using messages that are individually innocent to organize violent activity, and in many cases they just totally know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>In a court this ends up getting decided by a jury, &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;, there are rights for the accused, and so on. But nobody has the resources to start a court case over every tweet that says &quot;Bring your guns to the protest tomorrow, I&#x27;m bringing mine!&quot;<p>Hate speech is like inciting violence but even more subjective.<p>Personally I think we will have an &quot;archipelago&quot; where there are many different online communities with different censorship rules, each somewhat arbitrary. I think the current situation with Trump is a pretty extreme one, and I doubt we will see a similar situation to Parler for quite some time.')
