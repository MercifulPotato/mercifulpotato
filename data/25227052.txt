Too bad it&#x27;s often not very compatible with other\npeople&#x27;s and organisation&#x27;s workflows. And the attitudes are\nsometimes a bit strange because people vastly underestimate the\ncapabilities of certain programs, especially if they run in the\nterminal. Yes, Vim looks weird at first. But it also doesn&#x27;t\nneed to spin up a web browser first and starts instantly on\npretty much every hardware that you didn&#x27;t dig out of a museum.<p>Although to be fair I once tinkered a bit with Electron and was\nsurprised at how lightning fast it can be if it&#x27;s not\noverburdened. Your comparison with gas is great - it seems\noptimisation is always done just enough that acceptance from the\ntarget audience doesn&#x27;t suffer too much, and the rest of the\nperformance gain is sunk somewhere in the vast network of\ndependencies that nobody cared to clean up.')
