Because there is already an electricity connection, the company reduces the installation cost and time.<p>It&#x27;s quite interesting also from EV drivers&#x27; perspective (especially if they don&#x27;t have their own parking space), as there are now streets in London where every lamppost has been retrofitted with an ubitricity charging point.</i>')
