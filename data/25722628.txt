Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610326358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721014, text='&gt; And now you switch subjects again to Trump&#x27;s comments when we were discussing Lynn&#x27;s.<p>&quot;Let alone&quot; circling back is too difficult to understand?<p>&gt; Whether Lynn Wood&#x27;s January 7th statement &quot;Get the firing squads ready. Pence goes FIRST.&quot; meets the test for imminent lawless action.<p>And you don&#x27;t think surrounding circumstances matter?  E.g. would it be different to say this:<p>A) When there&#x27;s an actual firing squad there, and Pence is 200&#x27; away?\nB) When you&#x27;re at the front of a riled-up crowd, some of whom you know to be armed?\nC) When there had been violence and people hell-bent on killing Pence the day before, and others you&#x27;re corresponding with are talking about mounting violent effort against the government in the next week?\nD) As part of the baseline political discourse when there is no armed crowd and no recent political violence and no conversation about a specific date?\nE) As part of a middle-school debate, when few tempers are inflamed?<p>The courts get to decide where &quot;imminent&quot; is, and we don&#x27;t have a clear standard.  This is why legal experts disagree.  I think we can probably agree A is not OK and D-E is OK.<p>If we don&#x27;t include &#x27;C&#x27;, it&#x27;s becomes questionable whether Hitler&#x27;s speech at the Beer Hall Putsch would be &#x27;incitement&#x27;, and it seems pretty clear to me that we should include it as such-- if not that, what is?  Slightly veiling your coordination and inflammatory language gives you a blank check?  I don&#x27;t think so, and I would hope courts would agree.<p>I&#x27;m not likely to respond to you any further because I do not believe you are discussing in good faith.')
