They&#x27;re hardware manufacturers, not an OS vendor.<p>At least the spec is open enough that anyone has the ability to do things like Armbian without having to do reverse-engineering or extracting data from binary blobs (which is the case with a lot of other vendors).<p>The Odroid C2 was released in 2016 and is now EoL.')
