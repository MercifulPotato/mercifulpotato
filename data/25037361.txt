If it&#x27;s been more than 2 months since we&#x27;ve printed a page, it only takes two minutes for the printer to run the &quot;ink &gt; clean&quot; cycle, and then it prints just fine. We&#x27;ve had the same black cartridge for three years, no problems, and we&#x27;re still using the color cartridges that came with the printer when we got it secondhand.')
