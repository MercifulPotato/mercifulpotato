If you don’t care about wobbly doors, it’s still not a good idea to buy a fridge with wobbly doors - Fridges with wobbly doors tend to be more likely to have other issues than just a wobbly door. If you buy a new fridge from a company that is known to have wobbly doors because of low manufacturing precision, don’t be as surprised when your fridges glass shelves spontaneously shatter - you bought something that had high variation and was manufactured with low accuracy and a poor quality system.')
