Up to now there are around 50 million confirmed cases in the world but probably less than 100 thousand sequencings performed, and only a few sequencings by those who had strong enough symptoms twice and had the chance to have sequencing twice.<p>Without sequencing one just can’t prove that some case is an actual reinfection. All other cases are just “possible” (i.e. unprovable) reinfections and nobody can claim anything worthy of a scientific paper about them.')
