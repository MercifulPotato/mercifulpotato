Just back of the envelope, you&#x27;re looking at $52K in federal taxes.  To get that kind of starting salary you&#x27;re almost certainly in CA, NY, or another high COL area with state income tax, so let&#x27;s take another $15K.  If you live in a car in the parking lot and eat work-provided meals every day and save every penny, you&#x27;re at $133K * 8 or just <i>barely</i> over a million.<p>But rent&#x27;s not free, nor is it even cheap.  Even if you split with roommates the whole time, you&#x27;re probably looking at $12K a year in rent or more.
