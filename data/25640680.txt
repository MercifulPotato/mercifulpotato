The. Fuck. Is. This. So. Difficult”ing your way around actual discussion isn’t going to change anyone’s minds.<p>&gt; By your logic, the FDA and the CDC shouldn&#x27;t have been approving the vaccines. It should be left up to each state, no? Because what if the FDA got it wrong. Better let 50x2 smaller, less well funded agencies decide individually than one well funded agency, right?<p>This isn’t even a “what if”, the FDA was disastrously slow in granting EUA’s for rapid testing. The fact that 50 states were hamstrung by the federal FDA exacerbated the pandemic. You can visualize what the FDA&#x2F;CDC bottleneck looked like early in the pandemic here -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;balajis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1238981855812055041" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;balajis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1238981855812055041</a><p>By <i>your</i> logic, why should 200+ countries have drug agencies? Why have sovereignty at all? The argument is that while central coordination is well and good, you don’t want a system that’s overly reliant on it.<p>And if the problem is that mobilization will be difficult for some States due to underfunded health agencies, now is the perfect time for their legislatures to increase funding via taxes and bonds. A once-in-a-century pandemic is the perfect use for State bonds, since it won’t be a recurring expense.')
