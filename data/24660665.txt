Considering the 2D geometry of real circuits, there are models with more detail, in particular VLSI models. [1]<p>I suspect due to routing and path lengths even the delay would turn out to be O(n) in VLSI, or at least a power of n (with a small constant).<p>[1] Seems like a good introduction: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.brown.edu&#x2F;people&#x2F;jsavage&#x2F;book&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;ModelsOfComputation_Chapter12.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.brown.edu&#x2F;people&#x2F;jsavage&#x2F;book&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;ModelsOfComputa...</a>')
