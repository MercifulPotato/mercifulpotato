Our circles (I hope they will be circles) around Big Attractor and Shapley Cluster are just started, so we are at year one.<p>If we scale up infinitely, then we will see that our Universe is &quot;forever young&quot;, frozen in time.<p>If we scale down, we will see more and more exceptionally stable &quot;dead&quot; objects, completely missing short living ones, so our Universe will look &quot;forever dead&quot; for us again. Anything interesting will happen at our own scale only.')
