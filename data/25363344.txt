The proponent of the Russia collusion wanted it investigated, and there was very little talk about it after (the honestly poorly handled) Mueller report.<p>And while there was no clear evidence of Trump himself colluding, many were indicted and even admitted guilt. How many people have gone to jail for fraud in the 2020 election? Is there the equivalent to the Jr. email and the Trump Tower meeting when it comes to election fraud? Has there been a single real evidence of fraud shown in courts (not on News or social media where there are no consequences for lying)?')
