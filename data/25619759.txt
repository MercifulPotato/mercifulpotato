Remove one or more and it’s no longer science regardless of how much you want to believe it’s providing useful results.<p>The history of science is littered with many such approaches. It could be the big five could eventually find better theoretical footing. My observation of the social sciences is less keen on this outcome. They perennially fail to accomplish it and thus move to “greener” pastures in terms of their financial incentives.<p>For an example, consider the case where the study authors had a hypothesis that three of the five traits would predict something, only 2 did and they decided this was a success. Meanwhile astrophysics is arguing about potential sources of errors when results are off by 0.001%. Obviously different fields but the social sciences lack of establishing a solid quantifiable footing is non-ironically dismissed as “humans are difficult” rather than acknowledging that the basic science that’s attempted to be done is flawed and will never yield scientific results with the course it’s on.')
