Or, put another way, created laws and regulations whose content and loopholes enable people to sue under those terms.<p>If the laws were absolutely clear and drew bright lines for many things, there would not be the ambiguity to sue.<p>I think it is generally a product of our own creation.  Yes there are more diverse commercial interests and entities now than 40 years ago, but Congress has equally generated the complexity you see.<p>The courts are absolutely drowning under this load.   Effectively, the likelihood of your case being heard is now low enough that settlement is likely how the matter is going to be resolved.')
