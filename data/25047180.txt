But I think that, again, remains to be positively demonstrated,” said Harrison.<p>&gt; A particularly concerning finding was the doubling of the diagnosis of dementia – which is typically irreversible – three months after testing positive for Covid-19, versus the other health conditions.<p>COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease but the number of gastrointestinal infections is still significant. There appears to be a causal link between various dementias and the Gut-Brain Axis [1] so it is plausible that some of the long-hauler symptoms are specific to gastrointestinal changes&#x2F;damage. It might be useful to compare the incidence of dementia in people suffering from chronic gastritis in addition to injuries and other respiratory infections.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gut–brain_axis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gut–brain_axis</a>')
