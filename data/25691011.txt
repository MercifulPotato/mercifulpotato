(My favorite satire on this dilemma: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eg3_kUaYFJA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;eg3_kUaYFJA</a>) Regardless, the emotional energy and goals of that community on Jan 6th was extremely clear: to alter the due process of law by threat of force.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m quasi-absolutist on free speech issues, for the slippery-slope reasons you describe. Free speech doesn&#x27;t end at 1A: it&#x27;s a cultural value as well. Yet, it&#x27;s also a tall order to enforce that value proactively: if a newspaper is not obligated to print every letter, should Twitter be obligated to let everyone have an account? There&#x27;s a good argument for a &quot;digital commons&quot;, and regulating tech giants as utilities; but the balance between an individual&#x27;s freedom to share offensive views, and the freedom of service providers to choose to whom they offer service, is extremely murky.')
