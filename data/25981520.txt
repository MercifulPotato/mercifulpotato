It might seem like a ton of money has been poured into it, but space tech and especially monitoring is so underfunded that it could be a joke when compared against anything else.<p>Any entertainment industry on its own has more funding than all of humanity&#x27;s space pursuits. All the apps for tracking time, buying clothes, losing weight, scanning tomatoes, properly wiping, get more money than the ESA or JAXA (at least NASA has more than them heh).<p>All the speculation and dreams of a great space colonization are nice, but the reality is that most of us will die on this planet, and likely take half of the life on it with us.')
