The two things that drive me crazy when applying for a job<p>1) keyword matching metrics, UGH!!  It&#x27;s not an effective filter. If you really want to filter candidates have a job specific requirements questionnaire.  As a hiring manager I&#x27;d much rather create <i>my</i> filter questionnaire.<p>2)Using the resume submission process to complete the employment application form &lt;DUMBEST IDEA EVER&gt;, it can be a two step process, REALLY IT CAN BE A TWO STEP PROCESS!<p>NOBODY READS THE EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION FORM, it has nothing to do with screening candidates.  If you want to interview a candidate THEN have them complete the employment form.')
