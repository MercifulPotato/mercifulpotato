Firstly, it appears the Democrats are contradicting themselves about what happened. That article links to another article on CBS that directly contradicts their own. Their article says:<p><i>&quot;Joe Biden’s presidential campaign canceled a Friday event in Austin, Texas, after harassment from a pro-Trump contingent.&quot;</i><p>and quotes:<p><i>&quot;The Biden campaign’s Texas communications director, Tariq Thowfeek, said holding the event would have placed Biden staffers and supporters at risk.&quot;</i><p>But the CBS affiliate article says:<p><i>&quot;The Biden bus has also been closely followed by Trump supporters while on the road, though Texas Democrats insist their presence didn&#x27;t affect their decision to call off the downtown Austin rally ... Texas Democrats told us they canceled the event so not to take away attention from vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris&quot;</i><p>Then the videos. The Twitter vids don&#x27;t seem to show intimidation. They&#x27;re all in vehicles, the trucks are just driving alongside the bus. There&#x27;s a video of what looks like a failed merge on an overly busy highway, which is described like this:<p><i>“These Trump supporters, many of whom were armed, surrounded the bus on the interstate and attempted to drive it off the road,” he alleged. “They outnumbered police 50-1, and they ended up hitting a staffer’s car.”</i><p>Even the Daily Beast has to report this as &quot;alleged&quot; because he provides no evidence they tried to drive it off the road. If they&#x27;d wanted to do that they certainly could have done, given the number of trucks, but the bus was unharmed.<p>The only activity described in the article that could possibly rise to &#x27;intimidation&#x27; is turning up and making some noise at rallies, but that&#x27;s not normally called intimidation, is it? It&#x27;s not exactly unheard of for anti-Trump people to turn up and make a lot of noise at his rallies, and the right don&#x27;t accuse the left of intimidation or cancel events in those situations.')
