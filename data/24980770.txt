If you don&#x27;t think this is surprising you should. There&#x27;s nothing inherent to men and women that would lead you to predict this. And, in fact, looking at the data you might actually expect that women as as class would make more than men because women have higher college graduation rates, and &quot;go further&quot; in higher education on average.<p>All of the things that &quot;explain&quot; the gap <i>are literally the problems</i>. Just because we have strong evidence that we know what some of the factors that lead to the gap are doesn&#x27;t mean you throw up your hands and say, &quot;that&#x27;s just how men and women are I guess.&quot;')
