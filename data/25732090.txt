And the second is going to be far more common. That will influence the culture, and help to drive other &quot;good&quot; people away from the service, amplifying the effect.<p>Even if you have user-selectable moderators (Which I had, similar to the request the author makes), without a huge war-chest to hire a large team of default moderators, you&#x27;ll never be able to keep up. The default experience for the average user will be terrible.<p>Over and over, I ran into issues like that - It&#x27;s relatively easy to built the technological network, but managing the social network aspect is an unsolved problem.')
