The economist (and prob some other weekly’s) do a good job for general news, and I’m sure some newsletters do the job for other domains.<p>The key is finding slow news for the niche you care about.<p>Personally I think that a big gap is local news. Would love a site like wickedlocal but where I get things weekly and have no ads or superfluous stories. I’d pay for it.<p>I’m experimenting with some automated scraping of news sources (Twitter, Reddit, town  websites, stores, restaurants, etc) for my town. Hoping to be able to get it do a point where I can produce something of value on 1hr a week.')
