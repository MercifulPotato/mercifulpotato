So if Widevine is packaged for some other browser that is available on your distro, you can pass in the QT arg<p>&quot;widevine-path=&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;google&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;WidevineCdm&#x2F;_platform_specific&#x2F;linux_x64&#x2F;libwidevinecdm.so&quot;<p>and it should work. This even works on NixOS, although you have to pull the relevant path out of the Nix store, and I don&#x27;t know a good way to do that automatically that can fit inside a qutebrowser config.')
