People with good jobs that have good pay tend to get pretty good company insurance.  People in jobs that don&#x27;t pay very well tend to have bad insurance, if they have it at all.  Bad insurance typically means you pay a lot of out of pocket costs, meaning lower earning people often pay more out of pocket for the same medical treatment.  It&#x27;s more poignant in reverse though; high earners should expect to pay less than low earners for the same medical care.  If it didn&#x27;t work that way, why would any of us pay for more expensive health insurance?<p>If you have bad insurance, your options are usually to do the walkin option and pay whatever your insurance won&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s probably more than you can afford unless you&#x27;re sick enough to get a doctor to order it (which often means you&#x27;ve missed a critical window in treatment options).  Or you can try one of the clinics, and wait for forever trying to get it looked at.  Or you can do what many Americans do and ignore it, hoping that it goes away on its own.<p>We do have better options than other countries, but whether those doors are open often depends on your income level.  Socialized healthcare does equalize that, even if it means dragging down the standard of care for the wealthy in exchange for bringing up the average.')
