Those whose preference vector is very different won&#x27;t see it. After all, the thing you see in Newton is outcome and you don&#x27;t care for the attempt. But that&#x27;s not the entirety of it (though it is a significant part) for the craftsman. These craftsmen are driven by the craft itself.<p>So, for instance, while you&#x27;d (taking a leap here and guessing) rate it useless for a Theravada monk to master his chanting, there is a portion of it that to him is sufficient to just be good at. A portion apart from the outcome that is just dedicated to the craft itself.<p>If you&#x27;re not driven by the craft, you likely won&#x27;t get it. That&#x27;s okay. The path to living a fulfilling life is to find your preference vector and optimize for it.')
