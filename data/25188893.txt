After careful consideration, we have come to the decision to sunset our Places feature. Although we will no longer actively invest in the feature, you will be able to continue to use Places without disruption for the next 18 months as we want to make sure you have adequate time to find an alternative before we discontinue it entirely.</code></pre>')
