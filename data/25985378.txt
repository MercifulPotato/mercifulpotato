Item(by='handedness', descendants=None, kids=[25985643, 25985463], score=None, time=1612151907, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25982441, text='&gt; I would recommend a SPOT or inReach as a your primary safety device with this as a (neat) backup. All they need is a line of sight to the sky which is much easier to do than either LoRA, VHF or HF.<p>I have quite a bit of experience with both, and wouldn&#x27;t recommend either as a primary safety device. PLBs are far better.<p>SPOT is based on Globalstar, which leaves one without coverage in many areas. I also found it to be incredibly flaky even in areas of allegedly great coverage with a totally open sky.<p>inReach is vastly more reliable, and with global coverage, so if I was buying one for a (secondary) safety that would be the easy winner of the two. It also has the added benefit of bringing a convenience that PLBs don&#x27;t, as one can grab weather updates and easily text others for information.<p>That said, it&#x27;s not difficult to get into a situation where terrain makes quick satellite acquisition very difficult, and one could wait hours for a message to get out. PLBs are much more reliable in adverse situations (N-S slot canyons), have higher power output than satellite messengers, and are generally built to higher standards. They also don&#x27;t require a monthly fee.<p>A legitimate PLB would give one more paths to a swift rescue, especially if SAR aircraft are already up and looking for you.<p>More info: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backcountrychronicles.com&#x2F;delorme-satellite-gps-messenger&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backcountrychronicles.com&#x2F;delorme-satellite-gps-...</a>')
