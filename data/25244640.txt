Do you have to repeat the experiment if his phone number changes? Indeed, we assume that this is not an &quot;experimental condition&quot; to take into account. There is no way to determine this a-priori, and one could conceive of a universe with an arbitrary amount of such strange influences. But we do not appear to live in such a universe, which is why we get to apply Occam&#x27;s Razor.<p>I think this is not true for every experiment. For example if you measure the polarization of a photon it will have the same polarization in any subsequent experiment, no matter how hard you try to reduce complexity.<p>Also, my comment was rather directed at the fact that any experiment has a unique outcome. In that sense we we canâ€™t have perfect control over an experiment, since at least time must have passed between subsequent measurements, such that the experimental conditions are different.')
