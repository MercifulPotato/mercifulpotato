The vast majority of exits now are purchases by private equity firms, and they will do a thorough technical due diligence and look at those decisions and what it will take to run the company the way they want to. (I do those diligences for a living) If you&#x27;re doing a tiny lifestyle company with no exit plan, you wouldn&#x27;t. Which ironically, is exactly what I&#x27;m doing on my own time, so I use Scheme for that. :-)')
