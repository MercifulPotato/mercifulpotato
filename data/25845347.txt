Quora&#x27;s business model is very different from mine. We&#x27;re not looking at advertising as a primary means of revenue generation. The idea for us will be to generate revenue from brokerage fees connecting the &#x27;brains&#x2F;knowledge&#x27; to the seekers of the knowledge.<p>The types of knowledge people are willing to pay for are different from the ones they&#x27;ll ask for free on a site like Quora.<p>StackOverflow is a slightly different beast as they have a lot of overlap with what we&#x27;re doing. Their moderation policies are offputting to many and don&#x27;t encourage people to ask questions. Rather, they deter them from asking questions because you&#x27;re constantly wondering if your question is &#x27;worthy&#x27; of asking there. They also don&#x27;t have a paid option to ask questions.<p>Another good comparison are the gig economy freelance-type sites like Fiverr and Upwork where those engagements are typically more in the consultative style. We&#x27;re not looking to get in the way of that, but more to offer lead generation through transactional experiences. If someone is able to take business offsite after answering a particularly difficult question in mobile development, or artificial intelligence, or university research, then that&#x27;s a win for both us and them.')
