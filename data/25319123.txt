Your comments are basically dead on, but I would add a slight caveat regarding pre-contemporary philosophy.<p>I do think there is some pedagogical value in reading some canonical works of modern philosophy, just for context about what Frege and later analytical philosophers are reacting to. I wouldn&#x27;t completely write off Kant and Hume, for instance. Hegel, yes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s completely not worth reading.')
