At some point, a guy reported seeing a coyote on Lafayette park while walking his dog at 2am. You know, just being nice to the neighbors and letting them know to be careful about their dogs. Next thing you know, a bunch of people started questioning what he was doing &#x27;so late&#x27; on the park, then other people started accusing him of being a drug dealer or some shit, one threatened to contact the authorities... WTF? It&#x27;s like Facebook boomer threads on steroids, but in real life.')
