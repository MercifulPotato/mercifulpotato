If the water is being used by the industrial facilities then the water pressure&#x2F;flow rate would drop.<p>Unless the facilities are adding dirty water to the pipe to push pressure back up after they remove it? But even then, unless they routed the pipe from the water treatment facility to the industry first, only the areas downstream from the industry would be affected.<p>More likely is that the water is not being adequately treated and&#x2F;or that the infrastructure is not built&#x2F;maintained and the pipes are leaky.<p>My guess would be that the treatment is to minimum spec and that there are leaky pipes which allow for contamination. It is hard to maintain pumped water pressure if there are brownouts.')
