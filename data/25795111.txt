LeGuin.  If you are interested in Fantasy as a genre, that writer in particular, and &quot;sexual politics and identity&quot; this essay is for you. I wonder why it is on HNews, but heck, here it is. I clicked because I am an amateur Jung scholar, too.<p>I read Left Hand in Darkness and most of those Earthsea books as a schoolkid when they were new. I like Dungeons and Dragons. I am wide-eyed and run away from the seemingly endless amount of personal effort people put into &#x27;alternate sexual identities&#x27; .. similar to a cancer, to me.. an endless and unsolveable and ultimately unresolvable morass, foisted into almost every Wikipedia article and FOSS post these days. Why cant we keep Pandora&#x27;s Box closed?  an intelligent reader might ask.<p>If this is an interesting essay, then there is one more interesting essay in this world. Super. Why does this website track my mouse movements while I read then?  To present an ad at just the right moment, apparently.<p>As many commentors here have pointed out, &#x27;rage inducing headlines&#x27; get more quick views.
