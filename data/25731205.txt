Dell doesn&#x27;t determine how long my XPS 13 gets updated; they provided the hardware, and I can put any software I want on it. It can keep running a secure, up-to-date OS as long as I want it to, until the hardware truly can&#x27;t keep up (which, based on computer lifetimes these days, is a long time).<p>Conceptually, I dislike that mobile development hasn&#x27;t followed a similar path. Samsung should not dictate how many updates my phone gets and for how many years. Practically, I realize that this is a consequence of how we&#x27;ve built SOCs and mobile hardware and there&#x27;s no incentive for companies to change. That doesn&#x27;t make it less problematic.')
