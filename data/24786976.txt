I run this on my phone since CWM doesn&#x27;t work without a keyboard (or at least a meta key.)<p>Don&#x27;t forget all the tiling window managers.<p>KDE&#x2F;GNOME have some neat ideas but are slow etc.<p>Most mobile stuff is IMO a regression to some compromises made for extremely limited handhelds in the 90s and not innovation.')
