The intro lays out the case for clearer, more compatible categories:<p>&quot;the lack of clear definitions of key categories is a critical issue. The authors argue that\nresearchers use different, sometimes theoretically ambiguous or misleading terms for equivalent categories.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclweb.org&#x2F;anthology&#x2F;2020.lrec-1.838&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclweb.org&#x2F;anthology&#x2F;2020.lrec-1.838&#x2F;</a><p>Which brings us to the problem of secrecy in tech firms.<p>------<p>What we know about how the firms work, is based on leaks and people who break NDAs. Reasons range from:<p>1) It&#x27;s a trade secret\n2) An open list means attackers will use new words\n3) It exposes their approach to criticism.<p>To whatever. Researchers are likely recreating the wheel. The question is whether the information on the &quot;public square&quot; needs to be released and made open.<p>This punts the question on regulating algos, to after we figure out what algos are working on in the first place.<p>After that, maybe you can start talking about algorithms which curate, ban, promote, profile anything that humans do.<p>---------------------------<p>(1) FB harms: Adult Nudity and Sexual Activity, Bullying and Harassment, Child Nudity and Sexual Exploitation of Children, Dangerous Organizations: Terrorism and Organized Hate, Fake Accounts, Hate Speech, Regulated Goods: Drugs and Firearms, Spam, Suicide and Self-Injury, Violent and Graphic Con<p>(2) Twitter harms: Hateful conduct, Abuse&#x2F;harassment, Sensitive media, Promoting suicide or self-harm, Violence, Illegal or certain regulated goods or services, Non-consensual nudity, Private information, Impersonation, Child sexual exploitation, Civic integrity, Terrorism&#x2F;violent extremism<p>(3) Harassment, Minor Sexualization, Violent Content, Involuntary Porn, Controlled Goods, Private Information, Impersonation, Ban Evasion')
