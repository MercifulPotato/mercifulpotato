For me, it turns into a gross “pinging you” and overall is insanely annoying to be in channels and check back on information. Or, finding files or using search is Hell. Not to mention their insanely painful login experience. I am looking forward to its death at CRM.<p>Front is the real deal. Hands down the greatest productivity software I’ve used in YEARS. If you haven’t used it check it out. If you collaborate with a small team it will change your life.<p>It’s nothing like Slack...<p>Edit: To clarify some more. Slack and Front are for different mindsets.<p>Front is best when you are a project&#x2F;assignment driven person. Slack is best when you are just a drone on a project&#x2F;channel (if that makes sense...).<p>Slack also is great when the conversation is heavily one sided. Boss bugging employee. Or, someone who doesn’t know what they are doing has lots of questions for someone who knows what they are doing during a task. Which is fine and has a use.<p>Thinking about it, CRM should have bought Front instead. Their CRM&#x2F;people integration is getting incredibly good especially as a support desk suite beyond “email”. The Slack sale is one of the greatest heist I’ve ever seen.<p>Looking forward to Front eating Outlook and Team’s lunch next')
