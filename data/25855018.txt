That’s about an arm rate of ~25% (not to mention that you need a permit for gun ownership &amp; that’s tracked (with the Swiss voting in stricter gun tracking laws recently in 2019).<p>By comparison, America has an estimated 353 million civilian guns, netting to just over each man, woman, &amp; baby having a gun. Additionally, the laws are extremely lax meaning the government has poor records, enforcement, &amp; a hodge-podge of laws across state lines around gun ownership.<p>The type of superficial comparison that’s always trotted out in this kind of discussion is always so frustratingly predictable and superficial. Studies have repeatedly shown that in <i>American</i> society, increased gun availability directly tracks with homicides &amp; mass casualty events. You can either regulate guns more akin to the nations you hold up as “exemplars” or make gun ownership less common. All attempts to regulate this situation in any way, shape, or form is regularly fought by Republicans, even for “common sense” legislation that has broad bipartisan appeal across party lines. Heck, often times people thing the government already does background checks for gun ownership without realizing the huge loopholes &amp; intentional castrating of the background check process render the entire process a joke.')
