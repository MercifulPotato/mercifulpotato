You can certainly get by with just a debit card (and enjoy the access to e.g. the chargeback scheme) but I find credit cards a useful tool to build credit (and my credit history built up by never missing a CC payment undoubtedly helped me out when I applied for a mortgage).<p>There&#x27;s also the benefit of rewards which, although are smaller than in the states (because the interchange fees are better regulated), you may as well take advantage of.<p>I&#x27;d add a footnote to this to say: I use my CCs purely as charge cards and have a direct debit set up to this effect.')
