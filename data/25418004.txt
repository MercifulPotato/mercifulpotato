Item(by='feralimal', descendants=None, kids=[25420192], score=None, time=1607956635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415270, text='I agree that technology requires philosophy.<p>But &#x27;the world&#x27; requires philosophy - technology is just an extension of the world.  Discomfitingly, &#x27;the world&#x27; or &#x27;society&#x27; is really just an idea in an individual&#x27;s mind - these are just ideas that don&#x27;t exist independently of individuals.  What is really required is for individual&#x27;s to consider their positions, and to extend whatever they reason into action in the real world.<p>The unfortunate reality is that 99% of people do not consider their positions at all, they simply accept what they are taught as true.  However, whether they have considered their worldview deeply or not, they do have one.  The default one is what was embedded in their education.  Unfortunately again, the nature of education is to make one think in a communitarian way - ie to think &#x27;we&#x27;, &#x27;society&#x27;, &#x27;the world&#x27;, etc.  Education does not care for the individual - its aim is to produce individuals that are malleable to the needs of &#x27;society&#x27;.  So communitarian (not individualistic) thinking is the order of the day.<p>So, sadly, most people, don&#x27;t really think at all, they are just running their &#x27;educational programming&#x27;.  Those who are most educated are often the most inactive thinkers.  Their position is that they &#x27;believe they know&#x27; without having verified anything personally.<p>Nevertheless, everyone has strongly felt opinions, such that they are able to say: &#x27;we need to do such-and-such a worthy cause&#x27;.  Well, who is &#x27;we&#x27;?  Why is &#x27;such-and-such&#x27; a worthy cause?  Do we really need to do it?  Do I have the right to force another to do anything?  The means to analyse these quite simple questions are beyond the means of most.<p>Anyway, for my sins, I do try to provide my philosophical perspective on things around here.  I&#x27;m skeptical (most would say ultra-skeptical) and given my understanding of the world, I&#x27;m not convinced that technology is helping us.  This is not a popular opinion around here!  But I will persevere.')
