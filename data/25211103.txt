Just go to any seed store or seed bank and you will find hundreds if not thousands (or tens of thousands) of varieties of everyday fruits and vegetables that you will not be able to find on store shelves. It&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re too old, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re not economically viable at industrial scale. Their aesthetics are unappealing to consumers, they spoil too fast off the vine, they bruise too easily in transport, their shapes and textures are harder to machines to work with, and so on.<p>The age of the variety is a red herring, it&#x27;s the industrialization of farming that&#x27;s important. Our access to food has improved significantly, but anyone with a small garden and some seeds from an online shop knows that the &quot;quality&quot; of everything from modern tomatoes to berries is suspect.')
