Use Google Analytics or whatever makes you happy and nobody will ever say anything to you unless you’re an extremely famous person and even then the chances of someone ever bothering you regarding a GA cookie is very unlikely. Especially if you’re a tech blog your readers know how cookies work and how to protect themselves from “tracking” so you’re not even doing anyone a favour. It’s pure annoyance with zero benefit. Obviously if you’re a big corp you’ll have to comply, but I’d even question then what the EU is really going to do. Just write a page of how you use data and be honest, transparent and ethical about it and spare yourself to bastardise your beautiful website with EU shenanigans. And I’m from the EU and even dislike it.')
