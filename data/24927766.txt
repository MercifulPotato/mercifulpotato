Item(by='semi-extrinsic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603951847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24926138, text='My gripe with Julia etc. as replacements, is that Python is duct tape. I don&#x27;t need fast duct tape, I need duct tape that is understood and used by essentially everyone I work with, and that has native, fast handling of large amounts of data (NumPy, Pandas). Good user experience as duct tape.<p>From my perspective Julia is sacrifising some amount of &quot;duct tape UX&quot; to gain speed, and that&#x27;s the wrong direction.<p>Whenever we need more speed, we just pull the slow bits down into compiled languages, and scale them out to many cores with solutions like MPI.<p>R is another language that is mainly duct tape for stringing pieces of compiled code together. If it had a better UX for developers than Python, I think we would see it dominating much more today, without having any speed advantage.')
