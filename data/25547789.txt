He was one of the early NA players that really helped hook me on competitive gaming.  I remember how he could even make the boring things interesting - I have a distinct memory of him drawing a heart in the queued up movements of his scouting probe, which Day9, I believe, was able to show off on stream.  Those early days of WoL remain the high bar food watching competitive gaming for me.')
