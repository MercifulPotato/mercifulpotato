It&#x27;s not arrogant to say this, it&#x27;s just basic truth. Throughout history, work hasn&#x27;t been a social club, because everybody has a different preferred social environment and if you add in a social club then the thing people are getting paid for (work) is much harder to focus on. Your comment itself shows how passionate you are about political or social issues, which is fine for you if that is how you wish to proceed in life, but work is not the place for the emotionalism that is paired with passion for 99% of people. Left wing, right wing, authoritarian, libertarian, liberal, communist, fascist, etc doesn&#x27;t matter, work is best done separated by those can put aside those motivations while working and focus on whatever it is they&#x27;re being paid to work on.')
