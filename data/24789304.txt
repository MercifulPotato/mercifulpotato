The prices are not set by competition, or the market,  they are set by the seller. They decide that something&#x27;s baseline price is $10 per X, not the market. The market has no choice but adjust their ROI based not on actual market conditions, but on the whim of the seller.<p>And to top it off, almost all digital ads are money losers for the buyer. Its the few that work that get backed into their ROI calculations. Which are essentially a tax added to the purchase price of anything marketed and sold via these channels.<p>The  business is a fraud.')
