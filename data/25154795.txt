For example, would newspapers or accounts of things&#x2F;people, in various media, of objectively public information be required to be retroactively removed from any mention? Does it make sense to force and dictate what entities&#x2F;individuals can do with basic information at the discretion of anyone who doesn&#x27;t like it? Just a few thoughts. The records exist in the database because they are public information. If a record is removed from public view, that&#x27;s done when requested because it&#x27;s the right thing to do, although there is no strict legal obligation to do so.')
