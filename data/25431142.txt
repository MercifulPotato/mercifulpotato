Fabric.js and konva (that is used inside Polotno) are &quot;low-level&quot; libraries. They are providing a DOM-like API to the canvas. That is it. In order to make a full canvas editor, you have to write a lot of code on top of fabric, or konva, or any other library, or SVG.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polotno.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polotno.dev&#x2F;</a> - is designed to solve a very narrow business need. So you can build a full editor with much less code (almost no code at all). It may be less flexible, but it is the tradeoff for solving one problem in a good way.')
