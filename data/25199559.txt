I post my own stuff and have links to my website in my sidebar. It works pretty well and I don&#x27;t get complaints. Its a fashion sub so I cross-post pictures, but otherwise just post my own stuff and answer people&#x27;s questions. It helps that I promote other businesses as well, not just my own links.<p>Overall, I found it a good marketing tool for my side project and a way to not get into trouble with other mods.
