It&#x27;s very true, and not the least bit surprising. The only reason for free-speech focused social media to be a thing is because it is a pushback against bans and restrictions from Facebook and Twitter. But look who these platforms ban:  for all the (in my opinion, laughable) talk of how these platforms are &quot;biased against conservatives&quot;, last time I checked Twitter wasn&#x27;t banning anyone for saying the minimum wage reduces overall employment, or that we should return to the gold standard, or that marriage should be reserved for unions of 1 man and 1 woman. They ban people for inciting violence, for repeating provable falsehoods over and over which can lead to violence, for targeted harassment. So your &quot;free speech social media&quot; is primarily for people who want incite violence, or lie over and over to convince people of provable falsehoods, or to harass others.')
