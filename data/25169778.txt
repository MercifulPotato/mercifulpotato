Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=[25170226], score=None, time=1605967480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169367, text='&gt;&gt; Is the problem inequality or that the income is below...<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is a valid (in a Popperian sense) QUESTION.<p>Income is interrelated to a motherload of other population factors that interact in complex ways. Things can be both cause and effect. You live in a cheap neighborhood because you&#x27;re broke. Maybe this low income neighborhood or has worse jobs or worse schools. Maybe crime is high. Stress. Mental health. Relationship consequences. Financial consequences Etc.<p>These things are complex in practice and can span communities&#x2F;societies.<p>I don&#x27;t think we can understand these things fully or mechanically. There&#x27;s plenty of evidence, theory, and common sense that such problems stack. No theory or measurement is definitive, IMO.  Weather you theorize about the world or deal in data, you&#x27;re probably not distinguishing between income and income inequality well. They&#x27;re too tightly interlinked in practice.<p>That said, I doubt that middle-quintile income groups in much poorer countries than Denmark exhibit the same mental health patterns as bottom quintile groups in Denmark. So... &quot;income threshold, not income inequality&quot; probably isn&#x27;t true in that sense.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t jump to the opposite conclusion either, that absolute income thresholds don&#x27;t matter either. I just don&#x27;t think we can reach conclusions about social issues in perfect isolation from each other. Society doesn&#x27;t work that way, so it&#x27;s hard to reach conclusions about it that way.<p>In practice, income and income inequality within societies exist in an interlinked way. We don&#x27;t generally affect one without the other. We can&#x27;t easily study&#x2F;measure it either.<p>Parsed as a strict-sih Popperian question, it just ends up being a moot question. Maybe in a human petri dish it&#x27;s possible that mental health is totally unrelated to income. Does that even mean anything?')
