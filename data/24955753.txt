Do you have a reference to it?<p>If you&#x27;re referring to memory-hard hashing algorithms, I believe those are just resilient to ASICs&#x2F;GPUs, but still require significant CPU energy. I&#x27;m not convinced those would be better for the environment, so if you&#x27;re referring to those, do you also have an explanation for why they&#x27;d draw relatively less power?')
