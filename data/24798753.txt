Have you ever looked at TCP code and noticed a couple of calls to setsockopt() and one of them is TCP_NODELAY? That&#x27;s why. When that algorithm is enabled on Linux, TCP tries to collapse a bunch of tiny sends into fewer bigger ones to not blow a lot of network bandwidth with the overhead. Unfortunately, in order to actually gather this up, it involves a certain amount of delay and a timeout before flushing smaller quantities of data to the network.<p>IT&#x27;S CALLED BUFFERING.')
