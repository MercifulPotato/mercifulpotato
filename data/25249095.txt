The reason for that is that modern cryptosystems are purpose-built for applications. Messaging cryptography (and email is a messaging system!) is different from backup cryptography, which is in turn different from disk cryptography.<p>Probably single most common application of general-purpose cryptography is for cryptographic tokens (most common subset: cookies). But even there, your cryptography tends to be specialized, in terms of what it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have --- in particular, metadata, which tends to be an antifeature for tokens.<p>(I like Age a lot and you should use it if it makes sense for your application, though plain-ol&#x27;-secretbox is probably the right call for your encrypted cookie).')
