For the record yes we&#x27;ve been working hard, but also yes, we&#x27;ve been doing well from it.<p>I will say that people are using spaCy for free because that is what we asked them to do. I chose to make the library free and open-source when I first released it because I had the idea that I would be able to make that work out for me, if I could make this thing that would be useful to people and if they could be convinced to adopt it. And in order to convince people to adopt it, we&#x27;ve been telling people that spaCy will stay free and that we&#x27;ll continue to work on it. So everything&#x27;s going to plan here. Even if things weren&#x27;t working out well for us (and they are), the fault would be entirely ours. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d have any right to suddenly say, &quot;Oh none of you jerks are paying, how unfair&quot;.<p>(For the record, we make money from sales of our annotation tool, Prodigy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prodi.gy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prodi.gy</a> . If you&#x27;re reading this and you like spaCy, check it out ;)')
