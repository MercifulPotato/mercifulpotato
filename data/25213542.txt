She&#x27;s part and parcel a corporate democrat, interested in incremental changes that fundamentally support the capital class.<p>She&#x27;s against universal healthcare, she&#x27;s committed to austerity, she supports the surveillance state, she fights against progressive reforms.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see the grandstanding that people like Pelosi do as somehow leftist or progressive, but fundamentally she&#x27;s playing a much more conservative game. She&#x27;s a democrat who will put on Kente cloth and say black lives matter, while doing nothing to actually improve black lives.<p>For instance, she mandates pay-go, meaning any new programs must come with new taxes. Seems reasonable, but she&#x27;s not proposing new programs. She&#x27;s letting the progressive wing propose them, then letting the right wing attack the progressive wing, and then saying &quot;there was nothing that could be done, maybe we should be taking my compromise, which is predominantly a market driven compromise.&quot;<p>Pelosi is not someone who is out there calling for labor strikes and strong union protections. Compare her to, say, Martin Luther King Jr and his Poor People&#x27;s Campaign.<p>I&#x27;ll leave you with a quote from her:<p>&quot;I have to say we’re capitalists. And that’s just the way it is.&quot;')
