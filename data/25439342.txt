Why have card or board games not usurped music as a dominant hobby in the millennia that they&#x27;ve been around?<p>I won&#x27;t debate that video games don&#x27;t have merit as artistic media; some of my favorites from my adolescence have had positive effects on my world view and self in the same way works in television and film have, and I cut my teeth on advanced piano arrangements from video game music (specifically Kyle Landry&#x27;s). I think that the problem lies in video games being a demanding medium that often rewards mindless grinding and non-transferrable skills. In McLuhan&#x27;s terms, it&#x27;s a hot (demanding) medium that only has the benefits of a cool (passively consumed) medium [1].<p>To say that music will somehow cede to video games eventually, when music has been around for literal eons, is flippant.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Understanding_Media#%22Hot%22_and_%22cool%22_media" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Understanding_Media#%22Hot%22_...</a>')
