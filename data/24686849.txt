I can&#x27;t find anything describing that common name; I get back results about tarsiers and results about ravens, but nothing that combines the two. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily expect it to be in any of my bird books, which mostly only cover North America, but it&#x27;s a surprise for Google to likewise come up empty.')
