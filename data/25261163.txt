I am definitely a fan of universal healthcare, and it works well in many rich countries, but this is a global pandemic, not just something affecting Europe and America.<p>&gt; This is pretty vague, what do you mean?<p>People in general - and the scientific community is no exception - have the tendency to engage in groupthink and maintain incorrect assumptions, and this pandemic has shown that very clearly. For one simple example, look at the messaging around masks: the WHO was very slow to change their response. I think it&#x27;s very possible that one or more major assumptions are incorrect, for example around transmission mechanisms, the best ways to stop the spread of the virus etc, and that we should encourage a diversity of approaches.<p>For one example, I am shocked that the countries that are incredible coronavirus &quot;success stories&quot; such as Vietnam only occasionally appear in the news. They just went three entire months with zero locally transmitted cases - what can we learn from them?')
