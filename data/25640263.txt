I mostly stick to github and rarely I&#x27;ll go to sourceforge and gitlab but I haven&#x27;t noticed patterns of specialties in their users.\nIn the past I knew some semi-private German communities for reverse engineering but recently (2010+) it seems everything is getting more and more centralized and you can&#x27;t find those kind of places anymore.
