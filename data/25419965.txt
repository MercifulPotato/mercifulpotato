As long as the information is reported honestly, it serves as a public record of your positive reputation. This allows all the participants of the job ecosystem to make better decisions about hiring&#x2F;accepting job offers, because it reduces the risk of the unknown. It&#x27;s to be embraced, not avoided.')
