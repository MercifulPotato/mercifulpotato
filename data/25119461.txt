They’re dispersed through various companies nowadays - Stripe, Twitch, Google, FB, Discord, etc etc. But it was interesting and beneficial for me to work alongside them if only because I had decent role models to follow.<p>This article first puts up a straw man and then switches gears halfway into a different subject. See if you can spot it.<p>There is no exaggeration. Some people are just far more in tune with the mental models required to do good software work at both a micro and macro level, that any time I see someone trying to play it down I have to ask if these individuals have worked with one of these precocious talented folks.<p>I also sometimes struggle to understand why anyone would write an article like this. You obviously want to hire the best you can for the best price you can.
