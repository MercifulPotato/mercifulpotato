You can convert it back and forth. Problem: if you know the encryption key (it was sitting right there in the code for all devs to see, easy to steal) you could enumerate all the YT videos, <i>including all unlisted videos</i>. At least until a few years ago - they&#x27;ve since switched to random database keys instead of autoincrement to fix this exact hole.<p>Source: worked there.')
