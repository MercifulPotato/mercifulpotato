Thanks for the mention!<p>From a quick glance I&#x27;m guessing that Planet eBook is just repackaging Project Gutenberg or PG Australia&#x2F;Canada titles, or possibly even Internet Archive OCRs. A commenter below mentioned that italics in a book are in all caps, which is a common transcription affordance in PG texts. It seems they aren&#x27;t proofread either, since on page 1 of Huck Finn there&#x27;s a glaring OCR error that doesn&#x27;t occur in the PG edition (&quot;narra- tive&quot;). And it looks like the PDFs have a Planet eBook watermark on every other page.<p>One of the goals of Standard Ebooks is to create ebooks that are commercial-level in quality, which after a glance I would say these are not. Our volunteers spend many hours making sure each ebook we release is a high-quality specimen in every way. And you don&#x27;t get a watermark either.<p>We&#x27;re always looking for contributors to make new ebooks. It&#x27;s a satisfying effort because it takes a lot of different skills: HTML&#x2F;CSS, command line&#x2F;UNIX philosopy fluency, attention to detail, an eye for spotting typos, an interest in literature and fine art (for our covers), and more.
