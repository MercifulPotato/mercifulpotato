It&#x27;s a coordination problem.<p>Drivers only need to be made for those components that Apple choose for their system vs the multitude combinations of GPU boards, drive systems, motherboard chips, wifi etc etc. that exist for a modern PC.<p>There&#x27;s no steering committee for PCs (at least none that could be incorruptible by Intel) that could cause this change to happen industry wide.  And there&#x27;s been little appetite (yet) for Windows&#x2F;Linux + ARM for consumer PCs to help this happen from the bottom-up.')
