The vast majority of break-ins are actually climb-ins through an open window (forced or not), or by smashing a door window. Once you have a decent lock installed thieves will find another way to enter your house.<p>Some of these smart locks however turn out to have MASSIVE exploits (sending out unencrypted bluetooth addresses for instance). Sure, you could research and pick a lock from a wellknown brand with proven security. The downside to software security is that there is a possibility that a hack can be developed in the future. With an old-fashioned key, the risks are pretty well known.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of home automation (Home Assistant user here). I&#x27;m rather proud of my setup where I can measure, control and secure my entire house. But I&#x27;m not using smart locks. Their use cases are, in my case, very limited (I&#x27;ve never encountered a situation where I thought &#x27;darnit, I wish I could open that door without a key&#x27;) and therefore not worth the extra risk.')
