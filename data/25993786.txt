Other customers are easier to sell to if you sprinkle some “you’ll get your own closed network” on top of the offer, if security is something they’ve been burned by in the past.<p>I agree with you the mTLS is the future. It exists within many companies internally (as a VPC alternative!) and works great. There’s some problems around the certificate issuer being a central point of failure, but these are known problems with well-understood solutions.<p>I think there’s mostly a non-technical barrier to be overcome here, where the non-technical executives need to understand that closed network != better security. mTLS’s time in the sun will only come when the aforementioned sales pitch is less effective (or even counterproductive!) for Enterprise Inc., I think.')
