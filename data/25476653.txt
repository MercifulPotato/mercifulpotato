Boeing put out an Emergency Airworthiness Directive after the first crash with explicit instructions on how to deal with it, but the EA pilots did not follow those instructions.<p>If the planes are still crashing after the &quot;problem&quot; was fixed, then that wasn&#x27;t the problem.<p>(Specifically - the &quot;emergency procedures&quot; in question are &quot;what to do if your plane randomly decides to fly you into the ground&quot;. The only way to save your skin is to take a specific emergency action within a time window of a few seconds. This is not a reasonable design.)')
