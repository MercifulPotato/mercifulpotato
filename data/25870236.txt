Not that there was anything wrong with it, but all i really need is a file synchronization &quot;platform&quot;, and there are others that don&#x27;t open quite as large an attack surface as a complete nextcloud instance does.<p>Not saying Nextcloud is insecure, and i&#x27;ve never had any problems with it.<p>Currently trying to decide if Seafile is the way for me, though i dislike it&#x27;s on disk fileformat (IIRC it&#x27;s some adaptation of Git).<p>For now i use Resilio Sync.')
