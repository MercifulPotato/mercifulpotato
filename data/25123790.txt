That would let you remove, for instance, an entire subdirectory. The downside here being that you are rewriting history on something you&#x27;ve shared with the world and that has larger potentials for causing issues with contributors.<p>I guess my point is really this, git is simply one of the many tools you likely have to use on a daily basis. If you have to use a tool in your daily job it&#x27;s in your interest to really grok the various ways your tool can be used. You&#x27;ll want to really understand the primary use cases in detail and the less used ones you&#x27;ll want to know in passing at least. That allows you to realize that something is possible with the tool, even if you don&#x27;t recall the exact specifics. A machinist would have the Machinery&#x27;s Handbook, a programmer will have multiple internet references. Maybe the real point is that it&#x27;s _ok_ to not know the exact syntax and need to reference it for more esoteric operations.')
