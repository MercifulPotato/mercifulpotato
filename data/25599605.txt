As with onion routing, you can only “look back” one step of the signature chain unless you collude.<p>It’s anonymous and supports offline spending.  Anonymity can be broken via collusion by an unbroken chain of downstream recipients of the money, but that’s a necessary feature to catch double spenders.<p>It also integrates in well with modern day to day transactions, in that “atm”’s can issue and retire currency at will.  There is not blockchain, so it trivially scales linearly, and is not energy intensive.<p>It could be a reserve currency, but it’s not optimized for that.  Instead, think of it as allowing any bank to issue its own digital fiat currency.<p>In short, it solves most of the problems everyday people wish bitcoin solved, but isn’t very interesting to speculators.')
