A large street will always get right of way. If there is a grid of smaller streets running through a suburb of similar size, it alternates so every second street is a stop sign.<p>4 way stops sound like bad design to me, it seems like it would leave room for an aggressive driver to take off when they&#x27;re not first in to an intersection, bullying their way through.<p>Roundabouts and standard intersections in Australia do not suffer from this, as in both cases there is a clear right of way. If an accident happens, it&#x27;s generally obvious who is at fault without the need for dash cam footage.')
