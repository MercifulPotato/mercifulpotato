At first, Kubernetes only supported Docker. This was considered a negative monopoly, so they defined the CRI (Container Runtime Interface) and started shifting towards that. Now they&#x27;re just taking the sensible step of deprecating the old specific support for Docker. Docker is still free to implement CRI (and IIRC there have been motions towards this). Containerd (Docker&#x27;s underlying runtime) already supports it today.<p>Your Docker images will also keep working. Even <i>if</i> Docker doesn&#x27;t end up implementing CRI, both containerd and CRI-O use the same container format, and are compatible with your existing images.')
