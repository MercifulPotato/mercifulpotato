We&#x27;re seeing people investing $10^4 to $10^5 in GME.<p>If they are gambling their entire life savings away, then I guess they got lucky this time but I do hope they see this as the anomalous event that it is. I have invested a small amount into the WSB &quot;portfolio&quot; and have similar great returns. But given that I only do this with the &quot;play&quot; money in my portfolio, I&#x27;m not retiring because of it.')
