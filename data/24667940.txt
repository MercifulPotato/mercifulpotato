There will always be a gap between what has been rigorously demonstrated, and the potential future you want to sell!<p>At the moment we&#x27;re up to the stage of having a theoretical framework for how to manipulate a given property through a driving field, along with some computational demonstrations that the method works. The major point is that the equations one derives from this method are quite broadly applicable, and generally speaking if you can show they work in silico, then a real-world implementation shouldn&#x27;t be too far behind.')
