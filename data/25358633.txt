We met a few times at MicroConfs and I’ve been periodically keeping an eye on your app.<p>Location sharing not particularly useful for me on a day-to-day basis, but I love it for family&#x2F;group travel and outings.<p>As a consumer, I would pay for it but my sporadic usage probably has me looking at a low price point. And our company is so small we don’t have a use-case for it there. However I can think of a slew of businesses that would find it worthwhile.<p>Keep up the great work! Love your vision as a company and looking forward to seeing what else you have in store.<p>- Matt (from UserKit)')
