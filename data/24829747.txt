One of the fun aspects of Barrett&#x27;s is that, in order to develop it, the issue has to have been present and untreated for quite a while. And the erosive effects by that point are too severe and act as a contraindication for most surgical procedures, including LINX it appears[1]. I also have a hiatal hernia which acts as another contraindication to most surgical therapies.<p>I hadn&#x27;t heard of the LINX procedure yet and will definitely bring it up at my next GI visit. But the general consensus I&#x27;ve gotten from all of my GIs over the years is that surgical interventions for Barrett&#x27;s is a door that can&#x27;t be shut, and once you start you&#x27;ll likely require progressively more invasive procedures over time rather than a one-and-done surgery. And that it&#x27;s best to manage it with PPIs for as long as possible before opening that door (and the potential complications that come along with the surgeries).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sages.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;linx-reflux-management-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sages.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;linx-reflux-management-system&#x2F;</a>')
