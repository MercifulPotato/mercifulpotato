Proving actual instances of harm suffered from the dissemination of unfavourable statistics is also going to be tricky (even though there are undoubtedly players that have lost out). It&#x27;s plausible the <i>net</i> effect of increased statistics on player salaries is positive; certainly they haven&#x27;t gone down on average.<p>Since most player contracts are frequently renegotiated and most clubs use third party databases and generate revenue from betting companies (so if necessary they&#x27;d all end up with clauses permitting this data use), the long term effects of a favourable stretch of the definition of &#x27;personal data&#x27; are more likely to have chilling implications for people collating activity&#x2F;performance metrics or compiling biographies of <i>other</i> types of public figure anyway...')
