Can a heavy mass object moving more slowly entangle a faster object to reduce velocity.<p>Can solar sails be used to reduce or change orbits?<p>Magnetic fields?<p>Physical characteristics and profile of sat vs orbit?<p>Put in a decaying orbit that is only maintained by a thrusters?<p>Very interesting to hear that the only way to slow something down is with rockets.
