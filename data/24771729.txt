There was a bit of a thread about this the other day: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24561551" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24561551</a><p>What&#x27;s weird is that before moving to MA I had never even heard of ballot options. As far as I can tell they just don&#x27;t exist in PA, so social studies curricula just don&#x27;t teach them.
