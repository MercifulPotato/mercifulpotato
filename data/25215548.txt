If someone locally sells flowers and is an indie-hacker, it wouldn&#x27;t make any sense for him to also try to promote his business on IH. That being said, I still saw a lot of original ideas (cookie delivery, services, products, etc.).<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;usertrack.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;usertrack.net&#x2F;</a>')
