I&#x27;m not an expert, but in general, solid tumors are <i>much</i> more easily treated if caught early.  Still, &quot;watchful waiting&quot; is a totally valid option for early-staged prostate tumors.<p>That said, the doctor might be trying to benevolently prevent unnecessary tests, stress, and treatment.  Some people hear &quot;cancer&quot; and rush into risky treatments.  This is part of the reason the United States Preventative Services Task Force &quot;demoted&quot; asymptomatic PSA screening from &quot;recommended&quot; to &quot;have a talk with your doctor.&quot;  Their review of the studies didn&#x27;t show that screening asymptomatic men resulted in a large reduction in mortality.  Mostly because prostate cancer is so common and often develops slowly.  Somewhat because treatment can bring its own dangers.<p>At first, in 2012, they recommended against it.  Then doctors and patients&#x27; groups protested, so now it&#x27;s &quot;have a talk.&quot;  We are now starting to see the result of that first decision in the increasing incidence of late-staged prostate cancer.<p>All this is to say: PSA screening&#x27;s not a bad idea as long as you can keep perspective if it comes back positive.  Out of the major cancer types, prostate cancer has one of the highest 5-year net survival rates [0].  It&#x27;s over 95% in my state[1].<p>[0] Net survival tries to exclude the risk of death from other causes.  So 100% net survival for a cancer diagnosis means there&#x27;s no difference from a similar person who didn&#x27;t have cancer.<p>[1] The official statistic from the CDC may be lower, but I disagree with some adjustments they make.  I believe they force the data to fit their mental model.')
