Most are actually not problems at all the way I see it.<p>1. I can live with NaN. When the source of something becomes difficult to track, use a debugger.<p>2. Map vs map? Just another homograph, like there are hundreds in all spoken languages, yet most people manage to communicate.<p>3. The overhead of negative indices might be acceptable in JavaScript, but most languages probably don&#x27;t benefit from having them. I think negative indices are actually hurtful, they tend to hide bugs which would otherwise be caught very early at runtime.<p>4. This is actually a serious issue. I don&#x27;t get why so many people are in awe with TypeScript type system. Anything based on duck typing is a red flag to me. But still, better than no typing at all...')
