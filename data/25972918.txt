I don&#x27;t have an account there, and never had, and probably won&#x27;t ever.<p>But, regardless of RH&#x27;s health or lack thereof, most companies don&#x27;t have a sudden change in collateral requirements.<p>If what I understand from forum posts and twitter threads and youtube interviews or CEOs on speakerphone is accurate,<p>On thursday morning, DTCC changed requirements so that net buy orders for GME pending settlement would need to have 100% of the value of the shares posted as collateral (marked to market at end of day). I don&#x27;t know what the requirement was on Wednesday, apparently 1-2% is common, but I&#x27;d hope it was already elevated earlier in the week.<p>And that colateral has to be owned by the clearing firm (which is RH for RH), and apparently can&#x27;t be formed from clients&#x27; money, possibly including settled cash from the clients who made the buy?<p>This isn&#x27;t a long term cash need, it&#x27;s only while there&#x27;s a large amount of net buys in volatile stocks awaiting settlement. Assuming either clients stop buying so much (because some are selling, or it gets borint) after a while or the price stops moving so quickly, collateral requirements should go back down and RH can return the money. As long as their clients don&#x27;t stiff them on the buys anyway.<p>That they were able to quickly get a billion dollars hints toward fine enough health (or crazy lenders).<p>More worrisome is that they apparently didn&#x27;t have a plan for managing trading in stocks with high collateral requirements (some established brokerages had enough collateral to do nothing, others limited trading to settled cash and similar trades with reduced credit risk for the brokerage). I don&#x27;t necessarily expect an upstart brokerage to have unlimited collateral, but planning and managing around insufficient collateral should have been done; and more transparency would be nice. Maybe they had done some planning though, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a $1 B loan in a single day, although who knows what it cost them.')
