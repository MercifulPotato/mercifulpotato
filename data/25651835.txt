Given how easy it is to deadlock yourself this way, for instance by naively making batch reads in random order. I doubt many libraries would make transactions the default.<p>For instance in rails and django you need to explicitly specify a transaction. Can you give an example of a framework that turns off auto commit by default and instead runs it at the end of http requests?')
