We have no idea how effective it is without those measures. If we&#x27;re all going to dance parties, the vaccine might not be adequate.<p>I think the question is the point at which we can send kids back to schools and reopen our businesses with precautions in place -- in other words, stem the pain and bleeding.<p>It makes sense to keep masks on and 6-foot distance until the virus is gone, though. Vaccine+masking&#x2F;distancing should be enough to get rid of it. It&#x27;s not clear vaccine alone will do that.<p>If not, we&#x27;ll be on a dance for decades with new mutations, vaccines, and whatnot. We want this thing dead and gone for good.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re on a path to get there, though. People are fed up. If we can&#x27;t get this under control, I suspect the new normal will be outbreaks for the rest of our lives. Perhaps the vaccine will be 95% without distancing. Or perhaps not.')
