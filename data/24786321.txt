Have a set of trusted high level people and reward loyalty above all else.<p>2. Have an army of collective, group-minded people who will buy into and follow your creed. (From the article: “We only have people in the group who share our vision. But if you don’t share the vision, please go somewhere else.”, which is similar to The Sony Way and Toyota&#x27;s approach in the 70s, all the way back to the daimyo in the middle ages).<p>3. Give your army the feeling that you&#x27;ll take care of them for life.<p>4. Find out what the competition is doing and copy them, only better. (From the article: For example, rivals must be monitored daily, and when one differentiates itself in the market, a GMO company must match it within a day or two).<p>5. Have mantras, rituals, etc to keep an air of mysticism to the leadership and their cause.<p>This has been Japan&#x27;s MO since medieval times, and it works in Japan because that&#x27;s part of the personality of their country. Every other country has its own personality, and thus its own optimal way of doing things. Sometimes it gives them an international edge, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.')
