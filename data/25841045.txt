There are lots of factors but I think still having masks indoors in public areas and on public transport helped.<p>That said, I probably agree with you that Victoria&#x27;s lockdown was a bit too harsh. I live in Melbourne and had to sit through it too, and I broke the curfew, 5km radius and 1 hour exercise rules frequently.<p>I do wish that the response was consistent across all states. I also am pretty grateful that we&#x27;ve come out of the whole thing as well as we did.')
