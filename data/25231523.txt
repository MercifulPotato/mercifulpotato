I am currently working remotely in Canada (where I am a citizen) but they would like to bring me to the US in 2021 on a TN visa. I can choose to relocate any time from January to July.<p>I would like for my wife to be able to work in the United States. My understanding is that if I get on an H1B visa she would be able to get an H4 visa that allows her to work.<p>My question: Since the H1B is a lottery, is there any advantage to me moving to the USA ASAP (Jan&#x2F;Feb) so I can try to get in the lottery for 2021? Or would that be too late and I would probably end up waiting for 2022&#x27;s lottery anyway?')
