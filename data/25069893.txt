So anytime you edit, you&#x27;re editing in text, as you mention. But you don&#x27;t need a second &quot;display&quot; panel to do that.<p>Both tools do it differently. Typora shows it when your cursor is there, but otherwise hides the Markdown. Bear always shows the Markdown but applies the corresponding style to it.')
