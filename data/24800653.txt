For some reason, open source developers are choosing not to use these licenses, and complaining about it later.<p>If it were the case that AWS broke some unspoken social convention that is hard to legally enforce, I&#x27;d be more sympathetic. But it feels more like the author made a choice to license their software using Apache 2 over other licenses.')
