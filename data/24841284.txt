It&#x27;s Ruby-based, but I used it for years even though I can&#x27;t read Ruby at all, and it was rarely an issue.<p>Hugo - This is what I currently use to generate my blog because it&#x27;s incredibly fast. There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but you probably wouldn&#x27;t have to learn a ton about Hugo to make a simple site that lists video clips.<p>Gridsome - This is a good solution if you already know Vue, because it&#x27;s all Vue-based. Documentation is a bit spotty because it&#x27;s kind of a niche tool, and development slowed down a lot in 2020.<p>Gatsby - I briefly used it, but I found it very confusing as someone not familiar with React. Friends who like React seem to love it though.<p>I unfortunately don&#x27;t know of any templates for this type of project, though. Next time I get really frustrated with MediaGoblin, I might publish one. : )')
