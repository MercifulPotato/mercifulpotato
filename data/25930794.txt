This is an excellent thesis if you believe central planning is the best way to allocate society&#x27;s resources and is definitely never a vehicle for official corruption, and taxpayer funds are never ever misused for bailouts and other political favors. If not, such a move will only exacerbate the common complaints of today.<p>As it turns out, government is already entitled to N% of a company&#x27;s profit, through corporate taxes. If you are greedy on behalf of the politicians and want N to be a bigger cut of that, that&#x27;s one thing.<p>But if politicians want to boss companies around, they already have the option to go on record and pass neutral and generally-applicable laws to do that â€” and such laws are a fair sight better than the shady backroom deals that will go in when politicians start filling board seats with political apparatchiks. Do you want Donald Trump filling a board seat at Disney with someone like Jared Kushner? If you do, do you want Biden appointing his son Hunter to a board seat at Tesla? Can you imagine the insane conflicts of interest multiplied by the entire economy? It&#x27;s bad enough already. We really, really don&#x27;t need to glue together everything shady about big business with everything shadowy about government.<p>P.S. Oh, and the other thing is that people start raising capital and incorporating in ways that these confiscatory taxes and seizures of control that you propose just <i>don&#x27;t apply.</i> More private equity, or just incorporating overseas.<p>P.P.S. Oh, it also favors the companies who don&#x27;t need to raise capital on the markets: Apple can just take its cash hoarde and invest like crazy, while the next hot Silicon Valley player that would challenge them has to pay 20%.')
