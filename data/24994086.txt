And the threat of doing so increases trust in the system (even if no one does it), because if worst comes to worst, I can just find the slip.<p>In a digital system, I&#x27;m not finding jack shit. It doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere except as a counter, I can&#x27;t check whether it&#x27;s <i>my</i> vote or randomly created after the fact (after suspicion was announced), and I can&#x27;t trust the system itself, because it&#x27;s defined by, developed by, and operated by some random group of people who managed to slap the thing together and make a sale. I can&#x27;t get in there and check out any of it myself (even as just a vague threat), and the conspiracy group is sufficiently small as to be viable (I only have to &quot;convince&quot;, what, 40 people, to cheat the votes?).<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why not use something like the SAT exams -- trivially hardware-counted, but also physically transparent and available -- and solve like 90% of the problem that way?')
