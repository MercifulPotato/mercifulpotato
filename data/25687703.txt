I couldn&#x27;t care less if someone 2 years from now can read a chat log between me and my mom if it means that I can actually read them 2 years and multiple devices away from now as well.<p>What I don&#x27;t want is to be forced to message with one app for secure chat and something completely different for daily driving.  It&#x27;s a pain, and nobody in my circle is willing to do it (and I don&#x27;t blame them).')
