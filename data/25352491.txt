Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607467320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351962, text='&gt; At least in the U.S., with for-profit medicine, you cannot and should not trust doctors. There is a financial motivation that is misaligned with trying to help you; they (and their employers) have very twisted incentives to try to get you to do procedures that are at best unnecessary and expensive, but at worst potentially damaging to your health.<p>This is an insanely over-cynical take.  While there definitely are doctors who run their practices like a crudely-capitalist business [1], that&#x27;s not what typically gets people into medicine.  You mainly just need to be engaged in your own care and seek second opinions for anything major or if you&#x27;re having doubts.  IMHO, it&#x27;s more likely you&#x27;ll have find yourself with an incompetent doctor than one who&#x27;s trying to screw you.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;upshot&#x2F;covid-testing-doctor-fees.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;upshot&#x2F;covid-testing-doct...</a>')
