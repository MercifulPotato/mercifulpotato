Not involved in scandalous behavior <i>that you knew of</i>, perhaps. Fast&amp;Furious [0] would have been a major scandal in a Republican administration (despite the fact that it was started by a previous president), and the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki [1] was a massive step in the erosion of civil liberties in the US. These are just off the top of my head, I&#x27;m sure that there are others.<p>Not to say that Obama was a bad president, but &quot;no scandals I&#x27;ve heard of&quot; and &quot;no scandals&quot; aren&#x27;t quite the same thing.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ATF_gunwalking_scandal#2009%E2%80%932011:_Operation_Fast_and_Furious" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ATF_gunwalking_scandal#2009%E2...</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anwar_al-Awlaki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anwar_al-Awlaki</a>')
