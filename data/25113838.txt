Huge bowls of pasta I made myself, for myself, are undoubtedly the problem, as is my delusion that a large pizza is a personal sized pizza.  Would you have me blame Barilla for making perfectly ordinary pasta, which <i>I choose</i> to over-consume?  If barilla didn&#x27;t make it, I&#x27;d make it for myself.  An egg and 100 grams of flour, or in my case, more like 4 eggs and 400 grams of flour.<p>You might think you&#x27;re doing me a favor by trying to offer me scape goats, but you&#x27;re not.  If there is any chance of me ever losing the weight, it will be through my acknowledgement of my behavior, not blaming others for my personal problems.')
