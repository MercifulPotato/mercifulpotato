It&#x27;s fun to switch on the local TV station in a new city and see what ads are being shown to people there. It&#x27;s like a form of social calibration that shows what &#x27;is available.&#x27; Same thing with reading the ads in the back of Popular Science or The Economist. I don&#x27;t get that online unless I VPN+incognito, and I absolutely cannot get it on my phone, which is locked down much tighter.')
