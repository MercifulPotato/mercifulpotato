If a function calls fire-arc* , then that function should also have the * suffix; otherwise, the suffix would be meaningless.<p>You&#x27;re asking for the ability to refactor a synchronous function into an asynchronous function without needing to review the function&#x27;s callsites. By definition, this would come with a high price: when writing a step handler, you&#x27;d need to assume that any function call could be refactored so that it doesn&#x27;t return until several frames in the future. Even for a Lisp, that seems chaotic!')
