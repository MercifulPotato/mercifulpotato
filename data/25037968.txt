If it were by myself, I might push my luck. But I want to do those things with friends, or family. .9^n is pretty shitty odds once n gets to around 5.<p>There&#x27;s a sort of rhetoric that&#x27;s pointed out by &#x27;Thinking, Fast and Slow&#x27; as a warning sign for agendas, and I&#x27;ve seen a bunch of them used by both sides this election cycle. But at the same time one of the defenses against these rhetorical devices is reframing: rephrase the bargain from another context and see if you&#x27;d still accept it. They don&#x27;t seem to reconcile that in public discourse this reframing happens in public.<p>&quot;If I go out for steak, I&#x27;m probably okay at 90%,&quot; versus, &quot;If we have our family reunion at Disney World, there&#x27;s a 50% chance we&#x27;re all going to be attending a funeral in a month, even if everybody got the vaccine.&quot; You could call the latter shrill, sure, but &quot;there&#x27;s a 50% chance everything will work out fine,&quot; is self-deception. You&#x27;re trying really hard not to look at all of the potential, statistically significant outcomes.')
