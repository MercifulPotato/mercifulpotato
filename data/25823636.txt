If we look past the paragraphs of emotional appeals, the actual results for &quot;technosolutionism&quot; during the pandemic are this:<p>China created a technosolutionist fix. They implemented it widely with government backing. It was invasive but worked.<p>South Korea created a technosolutionist fix, which was less invasive than China&#x27;s. It was implemented widely with government backing. It also worked.<p>Apple&#x2F;Google created a technosolutionist fix. It was not implemented in the US and did not receive government backing. It did not work. The article claims this disparity is really because South Korea is &quot;homogenous&quot; and &quot;trusting&quot;.<p>The US instead attempted to implement &quot;proven measures&quot; that &quot;relied on the public . . . to adhere to them.&quot; This also did not work, for the reason technosolutionists said it wouldn&#x27;t: the public didn&#x27;t adhere to them.<p>What part of this is supposed to show that &quot;technosolutionism isn&#x27;t the fix?&quot;')
