The hallucinations were of an uncomfortable sort and not at all like what I&#x27;d get off of LSD or shrooms. None of these things are quite like the alters of MDMA. Similarly, none of the things I mentioned are like psychiatric drugs. Heck, some psychiatric drugs are for the same thing, but work better for one person than the other.<p>Heck, Tylenol (Paracet) has been shown to ease emotional pain.<p>Just because one thing is uncomfortable doesn&#x27;t mean these others are worthless, nor does already having mind altering pills mean that there isn&#x27;t room for the other ones.')
