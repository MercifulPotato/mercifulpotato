Constantly context switching does wear on a person.<p>With that said, there are some caveats...<p>1)  Businesses need to find that language useful and important.  In other words, there must be opportunities to make money using that language.<p>2)  The language must support great depth of work.  For instance, learning Objective-C or Swift could become dry over the years as you master the iOS SDK.  There&#x27;s a lot there to cover, for sure, but I imagine after 10 years you might arrive at the same endpoint:  Somewhat deflated, certainly less passionate.<p>3)  The language must resonate with you.  Everybody has a language or a programming style they enjoy.  Personally, I love classic, imperative, low level stuff.  C, C++, even Java.  Not really a big fan - despite years of professional work - of declarative UI, or functional programming.<p>I&#x27;m curious since you have 20 years - what language &#x2F; domain have you been focussed on?  How did it work for you?')
