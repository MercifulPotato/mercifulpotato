If you watch any of the live streams on youtube from the protests, its the most retarded thing ever. Literal convicts, just let out of jail, at the forefront of a civil rights movement, screaming how Black Lives matter, and how they are privileged white males. Tell me some of them were not being paid to be there. Because generally convicts are the least empathetic people.<p>And some of the &quot;Journalist&quot; running around with iphones livestreaming. Its not really an organic thing. Where they just happen to be there, to record something. Often, that some act is done, just for them so they can record it and  livestream it.<p>I even watched one of these livestreamers, help direct a guy away from the police after he shot someone.<p>I only bring this up because its not so clear cut, where the &quot;journalists&quot; are the good guys. When any guy with an iphone can call himself a journalist. You get all kinds of people.')
