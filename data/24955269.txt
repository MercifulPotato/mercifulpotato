Item(by='mlthoughts2018', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604179100, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24954764, text='&gt; “ Now that you&#x27;ve made up your mind, anything to the contrary is a conspiracy.”<p>This is an absurd response. Just look at the article - it is emphatically not a retraction or apology. You can’t just claim I’ve become close-minded and therefore dismiss anything else that’s said. That’s just <i>your own</i> close-mindedness.<p>&gt; “ He starts by saying it&#x27;s wrong to hit women. He knows it&#x27;s wrong. What he&#x27;s saying is if a woman doesn&#x27;t know when to shut up, they could get themselves slapped and it wasn&#x27;t beneath him either. He&#x27;s justifying physical retaliation to verbal abuse.“<p>This is <i>not</i> what he said <i>at all</i>. This is an attempt by you to whitewash it and cover it with things that are exposing your own misogyny. Framing any behavior Connery ascribed to these hypothetical women that could “cause” him to slap them as “abuse” perpetrated by the women is directly misogynistic <i>by you</i>!<p>I shudder that I even have to point this out to you - that your own comments here are pretty morally contemptible but you very blindly and very wrongly appear to think you’re representing some sort of higher plane of discourse where you don’t reduce people to binary good or bad characterizations.<p>&gt; “ Today it&#x27;s still okay by most for a woman to hit a man. Tomorrow will men get the justice they deserve? Also my 2yo hits me and I have video evidence. Should I hold on to it?”<p>What point do you think you’re making here? This is borderline incoherent? Are you claiming a two year old hitting you is somehow the same as a world famous movie star going on national TV and saying he thinks it’s ok to slap women? Because there’s no other rhetorical flair to your comment that could make any sense.<p>&gt; “ If someone needs help, let&#x27;s help them. Public shaming helps no one.”<p>This sounds like a true defender of abusers. You sincerely ought to be ashamed of yourself for the position you’re describing.')
