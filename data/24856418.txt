This meme of doing a &quot;water fast&quot; is bullshit, IMO, and people need to stop talking about it because chugging water doesn&#x27;t help when fasting unless you&#x27;re actually dehydrated.  Drinking water just causes the body to urinate out more electrolytes, which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want on a fast.  Most people on HN could easily not drink any water for a couple of fasting days, and they&#x27;ll realize just how overrated water is as a necessity for daily health.  Your fat cells, your muscle cells, your glycogen stores, all have metabolic water in them.  There&#x27;s no reason to take in excess water unless you are running low on metabolic water, in which case your body will actually scream for water.')
