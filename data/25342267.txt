When I was taught to clear corners it was always done by the first person to go around the corner. There isn&#x27;t much point in clearing a corner when you have someone friendly who has already gone around it.<p>The LEO who is clearing the corner has also gone to a higher escalation of force than the other LEOs. Other LEOs have weapons drawn but he&#x27;s the only one pointing his gun at things. The fact that only one person is behaving differently, and more aggressively, suggests to me that their behavior isn&#x27;t appropriate here.')
