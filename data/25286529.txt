I get your point though, you can reduce the chance-of-happening for these cases, but this orthogonal for the CAP. The CAP says you have to balance between availability and consistency (assuming partitioning is required here). You cannot have both at 100%, no matter how efficient you get.<p>And if the efficiency stays the same (which we should assume when comparing S3 with and without strong consistency) then giving better consistency guarantees inevitably must reduce availability - that&#x27;s what my point is.')
