Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605715286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134145, text='&gt;Baez didn&#x27;t explain how one would go about searching for this proof, he just happened to know that repeatedly using the differential operator on a seemingly random differential equation would create a pattern that resembles the original equation after using substitution repeatedly.<p>If you&#x27;re not used to working with continued fractions, the techniques are very counterintuitive. None of the usual calculus tricks for infinite sequences work normally. It&#x27;s probably not best to read that part as an introduction to the theory of continued fractions. As Baez himself admitted, even he had a hard time understanding Laplace&#x27;s proof.<p>The rest of the development, I assume, was not so confounding. It&#x27;s a little of both: here&#x27;s something you might understand, there&#x27;s some  black magic.')
