For instance, in this system, it sound like they added a complicated health check mechanism at some point to bounce faulty nodes.<p>Now, they don’t know how it behaves, so they’re afraid to take corrective actions in production.<p>They built that before ensuring that they logged the result of each failed system call.  The prioritization seems odd, but most places look at logging as a cost center, and the work of improving it as drudgery, even though it’s far more important than shiny things like automatic response to failures, and also takes a person with more experience to do properly.')
