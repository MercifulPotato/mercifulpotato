Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609177895, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560030, text='This particular comment feels more like a rant that&#x27;s not aimed at anything in particular. But with the previous comment you tried making a clearer point:<p>&gt; So in the end men who never father children are being taxed for other men&#x27;s children. Is that moral?<p>Don&#x27;t those kids grow up, enter the working force and contribute with taxes? Rough math would suggest a father with 2 kids will contribute together via taxes over their lifetimes more than a single person (no kids) would. I&#x27;m sure most governments already made the same calculation.<p>If at 50 or 60, when some parents have their offsprings already contributing, they got 2-3 times more than you get from the state (pension, welfare, subsidies, whatever else you can imagine) you&#x27;d probably not be happy with the explanation &quot;you contributed alone, they contribute together&quot;. If you don&#x27;t care for contributing for someone else&#x27;s kid, why would someone else&#x27;s kid contribute anything for you?<p>This can be taken further with anything that works based on pools of contributions like insurance, pension, schools, public transport, internet, etc. They&#x27;re all working <i>exclusively</i> because not all contributors actually need to benefit equally from all services. Some need more education, some need more health services, some need more transportation. Trust me, you get plenty of things you didn&#x27;t pay for.')
