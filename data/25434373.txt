Same as those medics with a red cross out of tape.  There have also been many examples of those 2 groups of people engaging in the violence that seem to think of themselves as immune to police orders because of it.<p>Unfortunately the videos and pictures of these examples of people hiding behind a designation are ignored by the MSM and are only found by being at the protests, looking at raw video or following ultra-conservative people like Andy Ngo.<p>This report also doesn&#x27;t say why journalists were arrested.  Many reports show that they were not following police orders to clear an area that has been designated a riot...and simply being part of the press doesn&#x27;t give you the right to ignore police orders and if the police have to resort to non-lethal force in response to being attacked then being in the area leaves you vulnerable to the same non-lethal force.<p>Police don&#x27;t have the time to check everyone&#x27;s credentials at 1AM while having lasers and fireworks thrown at them when trying to clear out an area.<p>I dislike the police...but I also feel like they were not treated fairly in 2020, especially in places like Portland.')
