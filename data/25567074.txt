Item(by='andreareina', descendants=None, kids=[25569571], score=None, time=1609220363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566124, text='I really dislike the &quot;more (welcoming|inclusive)&quot; argument as it tends to shut down discussion. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s why you&#x27;ve chosen the phrasing you have, it&#x27;s just the verbiage that&#x27;s common now in these discussions. And it works! Can&#x27;t be against more inclusive language, oh no. Nevermind that it&#x27;s hardly ever defined, nor the costs discussed.<p>Is the phrase &quot;quantum supremacy&quot; actually unwelcoming? Is it causing harm to people affected by white supremacy? Just because some people imagine a path from &quot;quantum supremacy&quot; to &quot;white supremacy&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s actually taken in any significant amount.<p>Now, what&#x27;s the cost? Political capital has to be spent, drawing down what&#x27;s available for other initiatives. People who are otherwise sympathetic to the cause are being attacked, or wary of being attacked (c.f. Scott Aaronson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Right is destroying the world, and the Far Left is blaming me!&quot;). Reputational damage [ed: from pushing through the walrus operator] is reportedly the reason that Guido stepped down as BDFL; it&#x27;s not a minor concern.<p>Personally in this case I don&#x27;t really care one way or the other. Absent evidence I don&#x27;t think there was any actual harm from the old term, but it not being an established term and being made fun of for being overly grandiose, the cost also seems very low, so meh.')
