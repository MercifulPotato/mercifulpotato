I was a pretty rabid atheist in my 20s(not proud) and over the years, I have constantly recalibrated my atheism and have swung between ignosticism and agnosticism to exploring faith.<p>there was no rational basis for atheism either. agnosticism seemed to be a comfortable nook to hide under but as one gets older, one starts questioning that too.<p>i have considered cults. holding a human guru to a higher esteem seemed an easier pill to swallow than an invisible omniscient&#x2F;omnipotent being. but that duck didnt even waddle, never mind fly.<p>i went back to my own faith of origin which was easier to navigate. perhaps it was easier for me as it wasnt an monotheistic faith, but it still required &#x27;faith&#x27;. i have since started studying astrology because it had a deistic component alongside solid mathematics&#x2F;astronomy concepts. it&#x27;s still muddled, but it a &#x27;language&#x27; i can understand without too much baggage.<p>i do want to &#x27;believe&#x27; in something ultimately. i feel lucky enough to be in a place&#x2F;time where i can define it on my terms. the question tho&#x27; is:<p>1. why does the populace have Faith? \n2, what are it&#x27;s benefits? vs downsides?\n3. why did it evolve and thrive? religion and the notion of a God has staying power. this shouldnt be dismissed.\n4.i am not dismissive of Faith as I was when I was younger.(how we change!!) clearly it has its upside. or it wouldnt have survived over the centuries.\n5. what is that comfortable &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; where i can have a intersection of the benefits of Faith and Rationalism? I do feel like I want to subscribe to a &quot;supernatural&quot; Faith rather than A God.\n6. My escape is Sci-Fi. Will AI play a role in shaping future Faith?<p>I envy those who have Faith. I really do. A decade ago, I might have been facetious, but no longer. I am weathered and mellow. I dont want to fight anymore. I want to understand but also want the freedom to observe it as an outsider to most organised religion.')
