Everything you just said could be equally said about worker&#x27;s unions, so why do we have worker&#x27;s unions either instead of just using the government?<p>I like OP&#x27;s suggestion of having a consumer&#x27;s union. In an analogy to a software stack, having the government responsible for this is analogous to building a monolith, while making unions is analogous to a microservices solution. Integrating this role into the government could become bureaucratic and comlicated, maybe ineffective because of it, but a consumer&#x27;s union might work but with it&#x27;s own set of particularities.')
