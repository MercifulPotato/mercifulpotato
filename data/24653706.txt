STM32 boards have 1.8 to 3.6V tolerance. (Yes, STM32 boards can have 5V I&#x2F;O tolerances, but you need the power line to be ~3.3Vs)<p>This means that you can run an AVR system from 3xAA batteries or Li-Ion without much more thought involved.<p>STM32 is more complex: 2xAA works, but that&#x27;s much less energy than 3xAA. Lithium Ion is nominally 3.6Vs, but when charging Li-Ion can be 4.2Vs IIRC, so you&#x27;re going to need to protect the STM32 from the higher charge voltages, because 4.2Vs is out-of-spec.<p>This means that STM32 needs an external voltage-regulator module, while the AVR can just happily accept the 4.2V voltage-under-charge under a Li-Ion setup.<p>-------<p>The 5V that ATTiny or ATMega supports can also deliver more power from its I&#x2F;O pins. STM32 is pretty impressive with 15mA source&#x2F;sink from 3.3Vs, but ATTiny and ATMegas are specified with up to 20mA at 5Vs, both source and sink. That&#x27;s a lot more potential wattage you can source (and sink) from a raw I&#x2F;O pin.<p>----------<p>So consider what you need to do if you have a 5V line (3x AA batteries): you&#x27;ll need to create a safe 3.3V line for your STM32, you&#x27;ll need to have a reference 5V voltage that your ADCs are based off of, and you&#x27;ll need a voltage-converter to handle all of your 5V electronics.<p>Or, you can just throw an ATMega or ATTiny at the problem, and just run your entire system off of 5V (ADC, I&#x2F;O pins, everything).<p>In my experience, the higher voltage (5V instead of 3V) has a lot better op-amps, and other such devices, that you can work with. Having more voltage is an advantage in electronics design: it really makes things a bit easier to design electrically. (Less noise, less hysteresis issues, etc. etc).<p>A rail-to-rail OpAmp still only has +&#x2F;- 2.5Vs at the 5V level, but that&#x27;s a lot more voltage to work with than +&#x2F;- 1.65Vs at 3.3Vs, especially if the rail is losing 0.2Vs as is typical. (+&#x2F;-2.3V once you lose 0.2Vs, but only +&#x2F;-1.45V on the 3.3V system). Traditionally, OpAmps operated at +&#x2F;- 12Vs for a reason, the larger voltage just gives you more room to play with. Throw down 100mV to noise<p>5V also opens up the possibility of running off of a USB line without any voltage-regulation. An important-trick for sure.')
