(As you said, who&#x27;s supposed to front those 5000% returns?) If that happens, would it not lead to a cascading failure of both clearinghouses and brokers going under? The end result being a major market crash?<p>The IB CEO seemed to be hinting at something like this on TV yesterday. It seems like there actually may be a lot at stake here, but I imagine that the clearinghouses and brokers will just shut it down again before any of that happens.<p>These means that the WSB narrative is sort of correct. It isn&#x27;t direct collusion, but all these Wall St. firms are so reliant on each other that they&#x27;ll always get each others back - if they don&#x27;t they themselves are likely to go down.<p>EDIT: I just started watching the first video you linked and the CEO of WeBull is basically saying exactly what my comment does, so I guess I should&#x27;ve just watched that first.')
