The place that was founded on  open  access  had  too  much  open  access,  too  much  openness.  They couldn’t defend themselves against their own users. The place that was founded on free speech had too much freedom. They had no way of saying, “No, that’s not the kind of free speech we meant.”  But  that  was  a  requirement.  In  order  to  defend  themselves  against being  overrun,  that  was  something  that  they  needed  to  have  that  they didn’t have, and in the end, they simply shut the site down.&quot;')
