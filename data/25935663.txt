I like that public insurance companies still need to compete with each other on customer service etc. America is probably beyond help but I could see a system where 5% of your income HAS to go to an insurance company that you can choose gaining acceptance.<p>The Australian private insurance system also works like that. Private insurers have to offer pre-defined tiers with pre-defined coverage.')
