Some thoughts:<p>If there&#x27;s a way to always have the search term centered in the block of text, ala that speed reading program.<p>Less aggressive highlighting. Maybe just change the font color, instead of highlighting and spacing.<p>Maybe change the text color of the sentence that it&#x27;s in (as well), to help me quickly find the start and end of the most-relevant sentence?')
