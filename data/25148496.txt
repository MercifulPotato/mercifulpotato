(This applies for all children, not only for adolescent boys)<p>The curriculum has too much influence from adults whose goals (sometimes openly stated!) are for a compliant labour force with a reduced training cost on particular work-focussed skills.<p>That&#x27;s at the expense of (for example:) relationship and mental health education, creative arts, critical thinking skills, financial education, talent development, practical entrepreneurship, and the idea that children can have and create value in their own right.<p>As such, this is regularly a complete mismatch to what&#x27;s going to be useful to kids when and as they grow up, and kids often know it: even while they don&#x27;t have the political power to make change.')
