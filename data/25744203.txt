You can probably name two, and Oracle deeply wishes that you’d name three. Even if we just restrict ourselves to “the cloud”, you already have at least three or four options; more options than you have purchasing a cell phone in the US, both in terms of contract or ecosystem.</i><p>Yeah, so? This is still disingenuous weasely argument if I ever read one.<p>Between those 3 (or 4) Cloud infrastructure providers they have a huge chunk of the market.<p>Even if they did, AWS alone kicking a webpage&#x2F;app out for non-technical censorship reasons, is enough to cause huge migration and other costs to the app. Enough to obliterate a  webpage&#x2F;app without much runway.<p>(And if those other big cloud providers would wish to get into the same game, they could successively ban websites&#x2F;apps they decide, one after another).<p>AWS shouldn&#x27;t be involved in such decisions, the same way we ask telcos for net neutrality.')
