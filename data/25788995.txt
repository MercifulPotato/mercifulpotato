Using this technique will lead to more cyclomatic complexity. I aim to write small methods and readable code. In small methods, there is no problem using early returns. Early returns will also help in the readability, because you can stop reading as soon as you realise, that the method returns here, whereas you have to read the whole method in order to know if some other code is executed.')
