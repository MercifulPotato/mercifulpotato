This led to the development of air to  air combat which led to faster planes and eventually jet engines.<p>The German development of the V2 rockets for bombing London from a great distance led to a lot of work on rocketry which was then able to built on for the space race.<p>The space race was two super powers pouring enormous resources into research and development to ensure there would be no military gap from lack of capability in near earth orbit.<p>From a military perspective, colonising Mars is unlikely to have any major military benefit on Earth.  I&#x27;d guess there are many other hot topics for the military to focus on (autonomous&#x2F;semi-autonomous warfare, cyber warfare, biological warfare etc).<p>Colonisation of Mars is (currently) more likely to be pursued by commercial or non-military scientific purposes.  Perhaps some of the commercial entities now rival small countries in terms of economic might.  I doubt though that a commercial entity (Space-X) will be able to get very large groups of people to unite (and sacrifice other interests) in pursuit of a common goal in the same way that they do during times of conflict.')
