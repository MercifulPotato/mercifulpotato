However, people are generally fine with DMARC or other crowdsourced spam signals, so it&#x27;s not clearly bad.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at the source, but it should be easy to turn the crowdfiltering off or self-host if you have your own larger enterprise, no ?<p>It also depends on what exactly is transmitted. Transmitting all IP addresses in the clear might be bad, sending out hashes might be better ?<p>I think it&#x27;s actually a good idea to try to detect those IP at scale. On your own individual server, you just see a million login attempts from a million different nodes on a botnet. But if you have millions of servers report the bad IPs and aggregate, you can see patterns and hopefully catch whole botnets.')
