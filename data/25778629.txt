I&#x27;ve had something similar happen to me. I participate in ex-evangelical groups because of my childhood. And other groups highly critical of American conservative Christianity. Facebook floods my ads with appeals from conservative churches, conservative religious organizations, and for some reason thinks I&#x27;m deeply interested in Calvinism.<p>It&#x27;s oddly reassuring. This shows FB doesn&#x27;t know anything about what I want. At least, their ad algorithms don&#x27;t. Feels like a very primitive response on their part.<p>Had something similar happen with journals of all things. Around 6 months ago, a friend of mine shared her new physical journal that she was proud of. Said she wanted to get back to writing her novel. I hit like or love to show support. Ever since then, there&#x27;s been a massive deluge of ads for journals and various writer creativity tools. Even though I&#x27;ve never once sought out anything related to journals or creative writing.')
