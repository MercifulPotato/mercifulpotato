This is especially true for rural areas. A Government sponsored Cooperative that handles cultivation of Coca would make earnings of Coca farmers legitimate, de facto improving their life conditions and the ones of their families. These resources would help bringing basic education to rural areas, while reducing the amount of conflict sponsored by armed illegals.')
