He also had varying interests so there was some personality there such as what game you playing, what shows you watching. We even shared a bit of &quot;how things at the homefront&quot;.<p>We were both in our late 20s&#x2F;early 30s and he was relatively new. He didn&#x27;t want &quot;that manager&quot; because lord know that company had a lot of managers that existed to attend meetings and divy work up with nothing of benefit to the team.<p>But, I can echo what you are saying. I have had manager that hold meetings just to dodge work and claim they did some managering that day. Yea, daily 2 hour &quot;team lunches and planning sessions&quot; doesn&#x27;t do anything for the fact we need to get work done boss.')
