For example Garmin just got the G3X Touch approved for certified aircraft: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buy.garmin.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;US&#x2F;p&#x2F;682215&#x2F;pn&#x2F;G3X-TCERT-13" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buy.garmin.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;US&#x2F;p&#x2F;682215&#x2F;pn&#x2F;G3X-TCERT-13</a><p>The G3000 integrated flight deck is pretty much the default in new business jets too.<p>In my opinion the touch screens are a lot easier to use than the old G1000 screens except for when you are getting tossed around in turbulence. Fortunately, there are still physical buttons for all of the &quot;safety critical&quot; or &quot;time critical&quot; inputs such as configuring the autopilot, changing radio frequencies, or adjusting the barometric pressure for the altimeter.<p>Source: I am a private pilot and have used the G1000, G300, and G3X touch.')
