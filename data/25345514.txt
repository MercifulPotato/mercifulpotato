The Apple Watch and iPad continue to be basically uncontested in their markets as well.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to have an iPod or iPhone moment these days. Some of those products I mentioned sell more than the iPod did in its day, they just seem small in the face of Apple&#x27;s $2T business, and the much larger selection of products in the consumer electronics space.<p>I guess my point is that it&#x27;s not binary. Apple can do exciting things and also release overpriced niche headphones. The latter doesn&#x27;t mean nothing they do can be interesting or have a big market impact.')
