Once it was discovered, Zoom&#x27;s installation process became a little bit slower.<p>Next, calls were being &quot;broken into&quot; because there was no security so they changed the default behaviour to generate a password randomly. As a user, this meant having to go through the normal install process and then enter all this stuff in so it seemingly went from near-instant (10 seconds top from no install to in a call) through to perhaps like 5 minutes once you fiddle with macOS&#x27;s permission model (that was bypassed I presume) and all that.<p>Personally, I hate it nowadays and it&#x27;s banned on our company devices anyway but I think for plenty of users, they bought into it when it was frictionless and have no reason to change.<p>I think there was an element of shadow IT going on like marketing people for example using it for calls without necessarily getting sign off or oversight from IT teams, given it was &quot;free&quot;. That&#x27;s purely anecdotal mind you.')
