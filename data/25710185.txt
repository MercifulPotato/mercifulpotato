The protections provided by Section 230 are from <i>everyone</i> who might not like something about you, your site, or your users. It&#x27;s the difference between the <i>government</i> having tanks and <i>all your neighbors</i> having tanks.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;m not saying online discourse won&#x27;t survive, I&#x27;m saying that repealing Section 230 could lead to things being <i>sorted out afterwards</i> with the closure of the few remaining independent platforms and the cementing of the current centralized players who can afford to operate without the protections of Section 230. Arguably the complexity of inter-state sales tax has contributed (to a much smaller degree) to the centralization of online sales in the same way that a repeal of Section 230 would contribute to the centralization of online discourse. When was the last time you purchased anything from a truly independent store (meaning someone with their own independent site, not using Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Shopify, etc)?')
