I don&#x27;t know a lot about the labor markets of Canada or France, but I have very much wondered whether that plays a part in what offers LunaNode can make. Also not sure what energy costs are in eastern Canada!<p>On a technical note, seems like ping times from LunaNode to LA are expected to be a bit over 70 ms.')
