Desktop Linux is not secure and you only have privacy if you trust all of your applications.<p>No operating system is secure when it comes to installing untrusted applications. The strength of desktop Linux is the vast amounts of available free and open-source software, ergo software that you can actually trust. To my knowledge, no other OS beats that - usually you can&#x27;t even trust your OS itself these days.<p>Plus we already have a universally supported sandboxing technology, it&#x27;s our web browser. I can use Microsoft&#x27;s software inside a Firefox container when I&#x27;m forced to, without giving them access to my home folder, keystrokes&#x2F;mouse events, etc. Even better, half of the requests those things would make are blocked by uBO.')
