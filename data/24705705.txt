One of the things I note is many of these people undervalue themselves and their training doing that kind of work for ad companies. They could be writing code for the robotic arm that could mine asteroids, but they write code to show ads to people.<p>Well people have their own priorities. But the lesson I learn is just because they work with us it doesn&#x27;t mean the definition of smart gets blurred. It just means they downgraded their aim and are likely hitting it more easily compared to us.<p>The question one must ask is. How can we learn from these smart people?')
