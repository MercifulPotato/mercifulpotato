With facebook they only collect &quot;limited&quot; information. Its what they do with it afterwards that matter.<p>How is it stored, is it secure, how do they anonymise it, who has access to the raw data, what happens when there is a break, is there monitoring, etc etc etc.<p>They are making a massive honey pot, and we just have to trust them that they are doing good job.
