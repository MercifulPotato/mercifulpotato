Or Excel?), I think that Github Codespaces [1] is an interesting foray into a much-simplified dev setup experience that will help beginners start writing code without learning the more arcane utilities of professional programming like terminal emulators, shells, and the *nix userspace tools. And it&#x27;s (optionally) browser-based, so you can get started without installing any dependencies, even though it doesn&#x27;t ship as part of the Chrome binary.<p>I agree with a lot of the commenters here that eventually you&#x27;ll need to learn the arcane things! But I think there&#x27;s something to be said for being able to just get started writing code and having it run. I did a lot of my early programming on a TI-83 in math class in high school while pretending to pay attention to my teacher. I didn&#x27;t have to configure it, or do much other than learn the programming language I was writing code in. Later, in college, my intro-level classes were in purpose-built educational IDEs like DrScheme, where I once again just typed my code into the textbox and then ran it from the same UI. I probably would&#x27;ve grit my teeth and pushed through learning all the extra stuff anyway if confronted with an emulator, a shell, and figuring out what `$PATH` refers to, because I was pretty into computers and had high mental pain tolerance. But I can&#x27;t say it would&#x27;ve been a better onboarding experience, and eventually, I learned all of that stuff anyway -- so why put people off with it at the beginning? Let them do the fun stuff first, then teach them how to do it &quot;for real.&quot; In a lot of cases, the not-&quot;for real&quot; version might even be enough to suit their needs.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;codespaces" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;codespaces</a>')
