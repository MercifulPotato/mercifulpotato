The process can be nerve-wracking. The interviews need to happen clandestinely because if your current employer finds out and fires you, you have to leave the country in 60 days. After weeks&#x2F;months of interviewing, your new employer applies for a visa transfer. This process could take 3-4 weeks for application (again nerve-wracking if you are desperate to move), another 15 business days for the application to get adjudicated if you apply through premium processing. Under this administration, denials and Request For Evidence are being issued willy-nilly. So this 15 business days can end up being 30 or more. Again, the mental anguish can be hard if you really want to quit your current employer. Then 2 weeks after resigning. By the time you join your new employer, it could be 2-3 months. By law, one cannot take a break between jobs so you&#x27;ll have to negotiate with your new employer if you need a break in between. H1B for people from India and China is indentured labor. Even as someone whose compensation is in top 0.5% in the US, it&#x27;s extremely restrictive. I can&#x27;t even imagine what the average H1B employee goes through.')
