When you have an HR-type meeting with employee you&#x27;re having problem with, you chose a place that is private so the employee is not embarrassed to be seen. The senior director or HR person is not on the meeting invite in order to not stress you in advance. It&#x27;s standard practice for a firing&#x2F;layoff or major HR problem needing dealing with. The employee then usually goes straight home.  A perp walk from the main conference room to your desk would be awful.')
