NIF needs to put up a pretty face so the press releases might be part of a combined effort to spin a positive picture of their progress, plus it serves as a recruitment tool since the lab is going through its largest demographic shift: the boomers are retiring.<p>Additionally, with the new administration it&#x27;s expected that nuclear may not be viewed favorably as wind and solar continue dropping in price. So there&#x27;s a lot of threats going on and all these press pieces may be attempts at buttering up the people in power and also the general population to get them excited about fusion and hopefully etch bits off of the general fear regarding nuclear power.<p>Personally, NIF is stuck, it&#x27;s not gonna work under its current design, and convincing Congress to fork out some 60 billion dollars for a modest increase in laser energy when we probably need 10x laser energy does not seem like a good idea. Especially when the food lines are getting longer and we&#x27;re approaching an insolvency event. It&#x27;s hard to justify.')
