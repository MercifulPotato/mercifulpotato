If Uber&#x27;s new stake is worth $2.5B, then the equity is worth only ~$2B. Last year Toyota+Denso+SoftBank paid $1BN for 13% of ATG, so by the new valuation their stake is now worth only about about $280M, or an over 70% loss in value in just one year.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;computing&#x2F;192430-ibm-dumps-chip-unit-pays-globalfoundries-1-5-billion-to-take-the-business-off-its-hands#:~:text=IBM%20is%20paying%20GlobalFoundries%20around,making%20unit%20off%20its%20hands" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;computing&#x2F;192430-ibm-dumps-chip-...</a>.')
