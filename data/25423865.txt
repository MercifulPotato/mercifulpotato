So, in addition to all the usual reasons why letting the virus spread freely until most of the population develops immunity (for some unknown length of time) is a bad idea, it seems like the spread of the virus is also setting up optimal conditions for the virus to evolve into something different or worse.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert though, and I imagine there are probably other factors I&#x27;m not aware of besides number and severity of infections in determining whether a virus evolves or not.')
