If the goal were merely to get everybody speaking the same language to achieve world peace, then the efforts of pragmatists would go towards teaching more people English, since that language is the closest to the finish line.  Of course that would be contentious in some political philosophies, it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that some people drawn to the <i>&#x27;universal language for world peace&#x27;</i> idea find the promotion of English unacceptable.  However it seems to me these people are relinquishing any hope for success in order to remain principled.')
