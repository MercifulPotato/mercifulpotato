Broken video games motivate a lot of learning.<p>When I was a teenager, we had three game-capable PCs, but only two had LAN cards.  I also had an underpowered LAN-connected Linux machine.  I connected the non-LAN PC to the Linux box with a parallel cable.  Linux could route packets between the LAN and parallel-cable network.  But DOS games find each other with local broadcasts which don&#x27;t forward.  No game had a function to specify a network address to connect to.  I needed to bridge the networks.  Linux could bridge ethernet, but the parallel network wasn&#x27;t ethernet.  So I copied the source of a kernel module and modified it to bridge IPX packets between the LAN network and the parallel-cable network.<p>It worked!  My friends and I could play THREE-PLAYER games! DN3D, C&amp;C Red Alert, Quake, Descent, Terminal Velocity, etc.  Network drive sharing even worked.  It was glorious.<p>Nobody around me understood what I had done.')
