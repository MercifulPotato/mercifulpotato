It&#x27;s probably only an issue on higher sea states (e.g. &gt; Sea State 5 or so). Another mitigation is fin-stabilizers (e.g. often found on cruise ships) to reduce ship motion. The goal seems to be to eject air from as far forward and then keep those same bubbles under the hull as long as possible to gain the maximum benefit from the energy you expended to compress the air.<p>If folks are interested in air lubrication, they&#x27;d probably be interested in surface effect ships (SES)[1]. Different principle, but still about rreducing friction drag. Air cushion vessels (hovercrafts also).<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marineinsight.com&#x2F;types-of-ships&#x2F;what-are-surface-effect-ships&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marineinsight.com&#x2F;types-of-ships&#x2F;what-are-surfac...</a>')
