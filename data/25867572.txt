At that point, Google <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> necessarily be within Australia&#x27;s jurisdiction any more, and all Australia could really do would be either attempt to block access to Google services that was desired by its citizens (and look like China Lite) or attempt to exert some form of leverage on the host nation(s) from which Google was then offering its services (and since that list would presumably start with the US and possibly be followed by lots of places that want to do business with the US, good luck with that one).')
