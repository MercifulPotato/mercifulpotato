This can reinforce the power of the individual ads, or attenuate it. In this case, it&#x27;s pretty clearly creating a &quot;caravan&quot; of ads because that&#x27;s more effective than letting each stand alone.<p>Oh, totally agreed on this one. FB fully controls the layout and where ads are displayed. When I said that FB doesn&#x27;t control things, I meant that they don&#x27;t control and decide which ads get shown to you, it is all down to what advertisers advertise, and whether you fall under those specific target audiences.')
