Item(by='outworlder', descendants=None, kids=[24901062], score=None, time=1603734299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897851, text='&gt; &quot;OK Google, what percentage of people can you detect to be wearing masks on recent Instagram photos tagged at a location within a 10 mile radius of Mt. Shasta?&quot;<p>Ok, so you need the assistant to:<p>* Already have a trained dataset of people wearing masks<p>* Fetch ALL instagram pictures it can find<p>* Not only detect if there&#x27;s a mask in the picture, but <i>count</i> them<p>* Fetch the location of Mount Shasta<p>* Calculate a 10 mile radius around it<p>* Apply that calculation to the people counted in the first step<p>* Calculate a percentage of people wearing masks which needs:<p>* Count people not wearing masks.<p>Those steps are sub-optimal. So you need not only understand that, but to run some sort of &#x27;query planner&#x27; in order to get the results you are looking for.<p>You are thinking of Jarvis from Iron Man. Forget assistants. Allow someone to construct a query like this in a couple of minutes and you have a great product you can sell. Existing ones require quite a bit of domain knowledge and setup. Not even things like Wolfram Alpha would be able to parse this query.<p>This reminds me of: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1425&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1425&#x2F;</a>')
