The creators of ethereum created 72 million ether.<p>Once again: a distribution established by a process with open access, with all parties on equal footing, can be reasonably considered to not be a premine.<p>Calling it a lie, and spouting other inflammatory accusations, doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>&gt;&gt;100% percent of the funds in the pre-sale were eventually paid back to the founders and their employees starting with a million dollar payment to their CEO the literal day the presale closed (and a few days before he left the org).<p>I don&#x27;t believe word you say. If you&#x27;re claiming a massive embezzlement of the BTC funds, go ahead and prove it. The BTC address is known so you should be able to track every transaction.<p>Thus far you&#x27;ve exposed yourself as engaged in little more than a disinfo campaign.<p>&gt;&gt;Even if the presale had been an equal playing field that wouldn&#x27;t have changed the fact that the issuers of ethereum conducted a security sale<p>The SEC has already said that since the pre-sale happened before the 2017 ICO bulletin they issued, it was exempt from enforcement action.<p>Maybe you could start helping crypto adoption instead trying to lord over people by claiming you know better than them what market options they should utilize, and that it&#x27;s for their own good for those market options to be shut down and disrupted by government agencies.')
