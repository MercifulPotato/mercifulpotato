Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608140588, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444458, text='Ah hah, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc5321#section-4.1.3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc5321#section-4.1.3</a> defines this. I had tried briefly to find something, but not very hard, and so incorrectly guessed it was like HTTP URLs. Thanks for the correction, this is good to know. With that, I <i>also</i> note that exotic IPv4 address formats (such as the 32-bit integer representation) are excluded in that grammar.')
