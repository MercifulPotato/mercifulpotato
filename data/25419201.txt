Since then the show received 135,000 downloads and was featured by Apple Podcasts in 6 countries.<p>The community here was nothing but supportive (bberenberg just sponsored an episode by paying for audio equipment, and many other HN users are show patrons) so I am now trying to give back by posting transparent updates regarding the project every 6 months or so. I write these reports the way I&#x27;d like to read them, which is to say I divulge concrete numbers and share not only the wins, but fails as well. I believe a lot of lessons (and mistakes) contained within can be applied to creative projects beyond podcasts, so hopefully it comes in useful.<p>For those who havenâ€™t heard (of) The Program audio series before, imagine Black Mirror as a podcast. Every episode is a standalone story set in a future in which Money, State, and God have been fused into a single entity called the Program. The world of the Program is neither a utopia nor a dystopia, as the new system produced both winners and losers - ordinary men and women who are sometimes heroes and sometimes the villains of their own lives. And to them, it is not this future they find terrifying - but our present.<p>Comments&#x2F;questions welcome!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17425278" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17425278</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21704417" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21704417</a>')
