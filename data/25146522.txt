If they had told customers &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re slowing down your phone because your battery needs replacement&quot;, most would pay $100 for a battery replacement and happily continue using their phone for another 2-3 years. Apple phones last a long time. By hiding it, a non-zero number of customers chose to upgrade their phone which netted \nApple &gt; $100&#x2F; customer. It&#x27;s obvious why Apple chose to hide it.')
