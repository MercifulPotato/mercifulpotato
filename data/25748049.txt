This was a collective effort. You could call it a polyoploy but click-bait gonna click-bait.<p>They didn&#x27;t kill Parker though, we did. We made if clear that we wouldn&#x27;t do business with companies that supported the worst of us. They complied with our demands to force them out of the public sphere and I applaud them for it. As an ex Googler and generally anti FAANG, I don&#x27;t have many fond words for them but I support this action.  For the most part, I even approve of the timeline: let garbage peddling monsters be garbage peddling monsters until they do real damage and then cut them off.')
