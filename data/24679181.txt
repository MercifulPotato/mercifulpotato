The differences:<p>* Smaller screens<p>* Comfier seats<p>* Higher quality snacks<p>* Plus beers, cocktails, small appertiser type meals (e.g. sliders or similar)<p>* Films known to have cinematic&#x2F;spectacular appeal from any time rather than just the latest releases.<p>* &#x27;The Room&#x27; playing once a month<p>I would absolutely pay current cinema prices, plus food + drink for an afternoon of comfort and films that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t see, in the atmosphere they were meant for. I guess it brings it closer to theatre in that sense as you tend to have a better idea of what you&#x27;re seeing, whether people like it, whether you already like it and whether it&#x27;s going to be worth your time&#x2F;money.')
