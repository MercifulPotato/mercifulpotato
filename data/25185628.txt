For example, #ff0000 is not perceived as equally bright as #00ff00 by a human being, yet  looking at it represented like this you&#x27;d assume this to be the case.<p>I think it is possible to build a mathematical model that creates pleasing color palettes, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re often built on approximations that aren&#x27;t really accurate.')
