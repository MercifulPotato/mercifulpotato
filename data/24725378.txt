However as an open source radical, I would lean in the opposite direction and argue that code shouldn&#x27;t be copyrightable in the first place.<p>And actually I think a ruling that APIs are copyrightable would be very good for copy left licenses and languages described in open standards, because they would not leave on at the mercy of a single monopolist.')
