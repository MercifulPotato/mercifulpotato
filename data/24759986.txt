I wish Cloudflare could host that right here in the same city. That&#x27;s where most people are watching from anyway.<p>Or what about social networking? I&#x27;ll continue to use Facebook to keep in touch with friends in other places, but the majority of my social life is with people nearby. I don&#x27;t see why the messages sent from me to a friend in the same city should leave the country.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Cloudflare would be willing to do this themselves, but perhaps there&#x27;s a space for new startups in edge hosting, not just edge caching. Cloudflare&#x27;s expansion could be good for privacy, so I support them - for now.')
