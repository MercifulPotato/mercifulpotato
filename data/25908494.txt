Those are people who do spinning classes, which has only a very small overlap with spinning classes.<p>In particular they don&#x27;t really look for the same things that someone who buys a smartbike is looking for. Also I would add that in terms of build quality, spinning bikes are much better IMO than tacx or wahoo.<p>A bit of a tangent, but it&#x27;s a shame that Kettler bikes never became popular, their hardware is top-notch (proper cycling bar, campagnolo ergopower grips), but they never implemented ANT or bluetoothsmart so were not compatible with Zwift and instead tried to push their own platform.')
