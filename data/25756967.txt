A strong case could be made that could inspire urban people to be in favor of uplifting these segments also. For example, I would gladly pay more for food or goods made in the US if the case was made to me that it was helping more rural population of my country, just like how I gladly accept paying higher taxes that benefit the unemployed and poor.\nYou don&#x27;t have to give an artificial amplification of power to make sure good things happen for everyone. Sadly, that is where my argument falls apart, people are selfish.')
