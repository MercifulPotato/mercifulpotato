Otherwise, the moment you have an arbitrary code vulnerability, you&#x27;d get full access to everything.<p>The way effective sandboxing works is by giving a process a set of capabilities&#x2F;permissions, what have you, that is enforced <i>by the kernel</i>. Those permissions can be &quot;can I open files&quot;, &quot;can I talk to the camera subsystem&quot;, etc. Then, even if you somehow manage to generate the right function call at runtime, the call will fail. And to be clear, this <i>is</i> how apple&#x27;s own security works.')
