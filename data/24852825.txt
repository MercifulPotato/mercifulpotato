An algorithm that can learn any program that can be computed by a Universal Turing Machine must, in the worst case, search an infinite program space. So, even if a Neural Turing Machine can learn arbitrary programs (I haven&#x27;t read the paper so I can&#x27;t say) it might need to consume infinite resources before learning any particular progarm.<p>In short- Turing completeness is no guaranteed path to AGI. Assuming an &quot;AGI program&quot; exists, it is hidden away in an infinity of almost identical, but not quite, programs.')
