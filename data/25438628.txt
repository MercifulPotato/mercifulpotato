After sending at least one threatening letter, of course.<p>Another solution is to spam your manager (and legal) with every trivial &#x27;invention&#x27; that pops into your head until they relent[0][1], but that can burn though political capital you may prefer to use for other purposes, and will probably only narrow the scope rather than remove the unenforceable clause.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;patents&#x2F;tarzian.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;patents&#x2F;tarzian.html</a> (my favorite is invention #12)<p>[1] As examples I was seriously tempted to use: &quot;Python, but with 1-based indexing&quot;, &quot;LinkExchange, but for Wingmen&quot;, and &quot;ROT-13 Markdown&quot;.')
