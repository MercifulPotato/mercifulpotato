And, that sort of discovery would be a plausible outcome of a review of all autopsies back to December that California ordered in April – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkingpointsmemo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;newsom-orders-all-ca-counties-to-review-autopsies-dating-to-december" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkingpointsmemo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;newsom-orders-all-ca-coun...</a> – on which I&#x27;ve seen little followup reporting. But, I&#x27;ve seen no other confirmation of these UCSF rumors in official statements.<p>So: still wondering what hard evidence, if any dates COVID-in-the-US to December 2019 or earlier. (There&#x27;s a survey of December blood donors which found 2% immune reactivity - but the imprecision of that test, especially given known cross-reactivities with other &#x27;common cold&#x27; coronaviruses has caused some experts to discount it as definitive proof that COVID was circulating then.)')
