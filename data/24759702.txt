I&#x27;m also a terrible painter.  However, I&#x27;ve given up on ever hiring painters.  Every professional painter I&#x27;ve used has either prepped the surface improperly, or put the coats on too thick, to the point where I rub paint off if I brush up against the wall.<p>I&#x27;m willing to pay more for better work, but I can&#x27;t easily tell who will do a better job.')
