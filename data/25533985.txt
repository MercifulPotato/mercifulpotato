Hit me across the head to emphasize the point; friends would distract from studying hard, and you don&#x27;t study hard then you can&#x27;t get into a good university. So until I was 24 I had no friends whatsoever, not even through university and not even through the time since then.<p>As you might imagine I&#x27;m quite okay being alone for the most part having grown up friendless. I have no idea what having a friend is like, or how you&#x27;re supposed to be a fiend, and for the most part that&#x27;s okay with me. Ironically, my parents are actually now concerned about why I haven&#x27;t dated anyone in my 30&#x27;s; they&#x27;ve actually asked their family friends if they knew anyone that might be interested.<p>And there in lies the rub. If you&#x27;re really okay with being alone, why bother having anyone else in your life? It&#x27;s hugely uncomfortable for someone that&#x27;s used to it, for little benefit.')
