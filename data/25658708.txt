Existing customers absolutely love it and keep recommending but I am still struggling with finding a pricing structure that makes sense for everyone.<p>I do hope that one day I will find a way to make userTrack free for everyone, but looking at Matomo, making it open-source seems to drastically slow the development of a project as there are so many people involved and so much more decisions to be taken. Apart from that I would still have to earn a living somehow, but if I get a job and keep userTrack open-source I won&#x27;t be able to spend too much energy on maintaining it and I hate not being able to make a product as good as it can be.')
