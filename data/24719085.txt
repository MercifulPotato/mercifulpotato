Nobody is asking you to find exploits in the systems of a company you don&#x27;t work for. If you want to use your time that way, then fine, but understand that is your own time-management decision. Don&#x27;t go complaining about how you feel &quot;undervalued&quot;.\n2. Companies are under no obligation to pay bounties and companies are certainly under no obligation to pay headline grabbing bounties.<p>1+2 = Stop whining and be greatful for someone paying you a five-figure (or greater) sum for something you didn&#x27;t have to do.<p>Frankly, I also think this whole bug-bounty thing is a little bit dangerous. Sooner or later its going to end with various attempts at blackmail.  It strikes me as a very thin line.<p>(For the avoidance of doubt, I&#x27;m speaking in general here. Not about Apple and not about this particular person.)')
