I distinctly remember this because Google mailedthe papers to my old address from my first application rather than my 2010 address so I had to drive to my family member&#x27;s house to get papers on a Friday and send them back by Monday.<p>I still have email copies of the contracts which they sent in parallel. This includes General Hiring Contract &amp; Salary and a standard NDA with California Section 2870 modification.')
