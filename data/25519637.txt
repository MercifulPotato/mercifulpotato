The vast majority of what it recommends and plays is tolerable but not great.<p>Every now and then (maybe one out of every 20-30 songs) I will discover a shiny new gem of a song that really resonates with me. So I drag that song up and add it to my slowly growing playlist.<p>This has the effect of subtly changing the recommendation algorithm for that playlist over time.<p>Eventually I end up with a playlist with about 100 songs on it, and recommendations that at least roughly align with the mood.<p>I tend to get bored of songs pretty quickly though, so when a playlist gets too stale, I will prune the old and tired songs from it.<p>This approach has worked pretty well for me so far, but I really wish that there was a way to explicitly tell Spotify that I &quot;dislike&quot; a song and to never recommend it to me again.')
