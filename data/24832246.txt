I see that part as less likely each year.<p>Things centralize, then when the central node gets corrupted, everything is perturbed for a while and somewhat decentralized, until the next centralization begins. Same as disruption theory.<p>Network effects apply to centralized networks moreso than to decentralized effects. Cost to add a new node to a decentralized network generally remains higher than onboarding a new customer to a centralized network. And that kills it over time.<p>(Consider for example that the &quot;new node&quot; may be malicious... a decentralized network needs a lot of duplication of effort to fight malicious actors, a central network can do this cheaper over time.)<p>Even git, built on the very idea of decentralization, centralizes onto github and gets a lot of value out of that.')
