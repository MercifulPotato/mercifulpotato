Reducing dynamic ad content and user targeting reduces advertising &quot;supply.&quot;  Instead  of showing 10 ads at once, you show 1 ad per timeslot.<p>Small businesses wouldn&#x27;t have the in-house capacity to search for lower-cost ad options directly.  They&#x27;d have to use brokers, eg some SaaS ad marketplace, or automated tooling to just submit to price-appropriate options.  This does increase burden on small  businesses. But most of all it increases burden on the companies that show ads.  Now they have to hire (a team?) of people to  manually review something  that used to be automated.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with OPs point.  Manual curation would lead to higher quality  of ads, and probably benefit society as a whole. Just a lot of barriers.<p>As a counterpoint, most podcasts use this manual curation model with the hosts themsevles reading out the ads.')
