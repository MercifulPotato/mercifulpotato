They just say &quot;we don&#x27;t know if or when this will be in stock.&quot;<p>I think that’s a difference between a seller “owning” the listing for an FBA SKU such that Amazon can see in their intake logistics that more of that item is coming to their warehouse; vs. a non-FBA SKU where they don’t have that visibility; or vs. an item that has gone defunct where no seller is claiming responsibility for restocking the SKU any more.')
