I thought the point was surfacing critical projects <i></i>that are under supported<i></i>.<p>So a highly dependent project that has plenty of support for its needs should not need to be brought to anyone&#x27;s attention. I&#x27;m guessing python, llvm, clang, chromium, webkit, C#, visual studio code, off the top of my head are all well funded and supported open source projects.<p>I don&#x27;t know what good examples of under supported but critical open source projects are. I guess I&#x27;ve read that OpenSSL was massively under supported but apparently the solution chosen was to throw it under the bus and promote libssl or boringssl or something like that (completely out of my expertise)')
