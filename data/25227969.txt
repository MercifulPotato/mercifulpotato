I don&#x27;t understand why so many of these things need to connect to cloud services just to <i>work</i>.<p>I mean, surely computing power is cheap enough these days that you can build all the intelligence you need into the device for day to day operation and simply use internet connectivity to get updates, such as security patches, and the like?<p>Maybe the compute side of things could be a pluggable module that could be upgraded independent of the rest of the device if you ever do need more processing power. This would work particularly well for larger devices such as robot vacuum cleaners.<p>I find it indefensible that some data centre going down in Australia (or wherever) could render something as basic as a doorbell, or even a vacuum cleaner, inoperative.')
