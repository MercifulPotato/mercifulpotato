Bear in mind that the younger generations have a <i>very</i> different political ideology than that of their parents. We are currently witnessing the death-throes of the political dominance of my parent&#x27;s generation. They will slowly fade away and be replaced with a more forward-thinking and fresh approach to the same tired old problems. Glass half-full.')
