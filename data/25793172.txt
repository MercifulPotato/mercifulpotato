Whereas the nuclear plant goes from 50% efficiency to 100% efficiently, only a 2x gain for using the nuclear reactor for heat rather than for electricity.<p>So excluding the extra cost of the heat pump, and the cost savings of nuclear not needing a turbine and waste heat rejection system, renewables are starting out ahead. We would really need to see some real world systems to fully evaluate costs.')
