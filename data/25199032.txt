Item(by='Loughla', descendants=None, kids=[25200736], score=None, time=1606230088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198745, text='I have and do play vinyl, just for the nostalgia of sitting in my attic bedroom with the liner notes out in front of me and my shitty old headphones on when I was a teenager. I have done reading up and shopping around.<p>I also understand that I am not a good evaluator of audio items. I don&#x27;t know, nor do I care about the lingo. I just want a good turntable, so I can get some of the old vinyl out for my small children. I think Thick as a Brick and Locomotive Breath are two things that absolutely need to be experienced in your youth.<p>And I can&#x27;t break up my pot and roll a joint on the back of an mp3 player. (jokes)<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve asked here for advice.')
