I clean it with water, and scrubbing a metal spatula. I don&#x27;t do any black magic to season it. I use it for cooking almost everything... And I&#x27;ll never touch teflon, because of health concerns with it.<p>The only stuff that sticks to my pan is food that I burned into it, because I had the heat too high.
