Loved that game. I like the new Dooms too.    I think they&#x27;re fun.  Way more &quot;doom like&quot; than anything else I&#x27;ve played since.<p>The &quot;New Doom&quot; music&#x2F;sound producer gave a pretty good GDC one hour talk about the music came about. Some fun stories there ( the sound easter egg story was fun).  Its more than about just the sound, its about process and change.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U4FNBMZsqrY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U4FNBMZsqrY</a>')
