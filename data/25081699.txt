They consider you giving them all your data to be a perfectly private thing to do. In fact, in a way, they consider themselves to be sort of guardians of your privacy, since they only look at it themselves and don&#x27;t let anybody else take advantage of it. To anyone outside Google this not what &quot;privacy&quot; means, of course, but that&#x27;s the internal mantra.<p>I don&#x27;t think they thought this through actually. If I have to pay, I&#x27;ll pay for Apple iCloud instead, since it has better integration with my devices.')
