The cloud is a complete scam in costs, especially if you&#x27;re using it for very high compute tasks, deep learning, source control management or CI&#x2F;CD.<p>Another example of this scam is Firebase (aka Google Cloud). Popular with mobile devs who not only risk getting locked in, but are offered limited functionality (Firestore) that charges for reads which that optimises for a huge bill if one is not careful.<p>For servers, as soon as you add Kubernetes, just remember to not show the &#x27;operating costs&#x27; section of the balance sheet  to the investors, unless you have a healthy recurring revenue stream.')
