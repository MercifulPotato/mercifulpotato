Trump&#x27;s posts to Twitter are mostly lies. Have a look:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realdonaldtrump" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;realdonaldtrump</a><p>He&#x27;s still lying about the results of the election. He claims repeatedly that it was a &quot;rigged election&quot;, that the election was &quot;the biggest SCAM in our nationâ€™s history&quot;, and that really he &quot;won big&quot; &quot;in a landslide&quot;. All of these claims are false.<p>Trump has demonstrated that he simply doesn&#x27;t care what&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s banana republic stuff.')
