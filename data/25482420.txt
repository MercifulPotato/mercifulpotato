The US pilot unions are pissed about this.<p>- the flight manuals were not accurate. This is a big deal from a regulatory standpoint, and means the planes were never airworthy. The EU could have a field day with this.<p>- the certification paperwork was wrong. The FAA could do basically anything it wants to Boeing at this point, including asking for criminal charges.<p>- pilot training is an on-going expense, forever. It actually would affect Southwest&#x27;s business model, which depends on commonality.<p>- Boeing is the US&#x27; biggest exporter, so this incompetence actually affected us at a national and international level financially.')
