Every platform has (or: develops) it&#x27;s target audience and we also can&#x27;t blame the companies behind, that they are &quot;for profit&quot;. Ads are lucrative and relatively fair (even beneficial - e.g. small businesses can make aware of their offerings... others have pointed this out before). Over time things consolidate by themselves: &quot;We&quot; hang out on hacker news and other likely more proper offerings. It&#x27;s sad to see people &quot;logging into facebook&quot; and dragging down the discussion or just being offensive because of stupidity. But you can&#x27;t fix that. The discussion itself and about it (discussions about discussions - meta discussions) is important to make sure &quot;things get exposed&quot;. Things consolidate with time, e.g. you might look back on your last 10 years, and there are countless communities, where I left a last angry comment and then left. I am sure those communities are just small and irrelevant echo chambers, shrinking, because even their loudest advocates get tired and realize over time, that something is wrong, subconsciously. While others stay, though I have the feeling that there are a lot of big and relevant communities, that I still follow, and which are growing, which gives me hope, that we are heading in the right direction.')
