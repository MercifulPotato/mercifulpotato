But at the time, what other comedy, drama would you find about the history of the personal computer? There was literally nothing else like it out there and very little else like it since.<p>I was a teen who knew little about the history about personal computers when I first saw it. I had just gotten my Windows 95 machine, my first computer and was stoked cause I paid for a third of it with my own money from working odd jobs. My mom paid the rest.<p>Anyways, I found the subject matter engaging so I have a fond place for that movie.')
