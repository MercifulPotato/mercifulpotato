The number 1 app in the store is &quot;Facebook&quot; so you download it, sign up, and are suddenly spending all your time in their garden rekindling connections with everyone you ever knew. Seems like the perfect low-impact game to play with one finger on a smooth piece of glass, flipping back and forth between it and your FB Messages &#x2F; comment-thread flamewars &#x2F; etc.')
