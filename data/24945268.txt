Even their bad actions make a lot more sense if you delve into some developmental psychology along with just engaging your intuition about what their inner 4 year old <i>wants</i> out of life.<p>On a negative note, I think most people convince themselves of being much more grown up than they actually are. Really it&#x27;s far easier to just get meaner and more calloused to survive while suffocating the core self. Maturity is more like a deliberate and careful edifice built with a lot of work, self-reflection, and self-forgiveness. It&#x27;s not a given that just getting older does that, other than the inhibitory part of the brain getting better at restraining the emotional part after adolescence. (Usually, unless trauma happens that&#x27;s sufficient to get stuck in a particular development stage.)')
