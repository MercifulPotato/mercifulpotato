And lo and behold I do in storage infrastructure now. :) (Alas, I am not at liberty to speak for the company or share any numbers.)<p>I appreciate that working for Google isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s cup of tea for a myriad of reasons, and would never pretend otherwise. And yes, the interview process can be onerous. But we <i>are</i> hiring! Certainly the &#x27;technical scale&#x27; bit didn&#x27;t disappoint me.<p>As with any other big company, if you&#x27;re wondering how it is to work there, I would strongly recommend looking up acquaintances in the company and getting an inside view of the workplace dynamics to get a sense of what would await you and whether you&#x27;d enjoy it, even if experiences across this large an organization will vary greatly. If they&#x27;re not close personal friends chances are if you just know them casually, they would still be happy enough to give you an unfiltered and honest summary of their experience.')
