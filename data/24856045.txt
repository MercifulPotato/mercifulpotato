We focus on allowing you to create multi page apps that are performant and don&#x27;t force this by making you create a folder or use nested tabs<p>- Focused on building a pro-developer experience.  Our goal is to make Appsmith closer to an IDE, which is reflected in our UI today. Soon you&#x27;ll find a debugger and a code editor that will allow you to write code in a comfortable environment instead of small boxes spread out around the application.<p>- Complex workflows. For example instead of triggering what happens after API1 in an API, in appsmith you can configure this when the API is called in the widget. So when you click a button you can say {{ Input1.value === &quot;&quot; ? API1.run() ; API2.run() }}<p>We are actively building more integrations and features. Our current roadmap is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appsmithorg&#x2F;appsmith&#x2F;projects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;appsmithorg&#x2F;appsmith&#x2F;projects</a>')
