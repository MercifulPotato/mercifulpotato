Ideally, you&#x27;d buy new pots (terracotta or ceramic) and re-pot your plant with additional soil.&#x27;<p>Instead of repotting into a new pot, keep the plants in the &quot;potter&#x27;s pot&quot; and sit that in a nice decorative pot. As house plants grow they will need to be moved to larger pots or even require root maintenance. Getting plants out of a fancy ceramic pot is a lot hard than the thin plastic &quot;potter&#x27;s pots&quot;, and appearance wise they look just as good.')
