They have no obligation to do anything, so anytime they do, it&#x27;s their choice. Just as much their choice as you or me busting into a home with guns drawn.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t be sitting here sympathizing with how a random burglar is totally justified in entering a home with a weapon drawn because the homeowner could be armed.<p>Why do you do the same with cops?<p>Edit: to summarize my point: cops have no obligation to be there, so if their solution is to enter with guns drawn and barking orders, we shouldn&#x27;t try to sympathize with that behavior. We should tell them to stay at home and cuddle a teddy bear instead. A lot more people would be alive today if we quit making excuses for why cops are so eager to kill people.')
