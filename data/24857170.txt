Youtubers get compensated, why not ordinary users. Search, shopping and social media is work... It&#x27;s the current year and billions are stuck home , many without even jobs.<p>&gt; How would this work?<p>First you need a legal framework that allows users to sell their metadata. GDPR makes it illegal, but that&#x27;s wrong. If this data has value (apparently it has a lot of value) , it should be tradeable for services.<p>Incidentally, i think one of the benefits of the DoJ action is that it gets people talking about solutions that people called &#x27;crazy&#x27; until yesterday.')
