As I stated above, I believe there is a militant faction of gun owners who are doing the community and the nation a disservice. I do not agree with their views, do not support them, and believe they should be monitored.<p>2. As an owner, I believe we need to make the following changes to gun regulation:<p>* We need a universal regulatory floor consisting of background checks, licensing, and training for ownership of any class of firearm.<p>* We should probably have some sort of red flag rule set to allow seizure of firearms if there is strong evidence that you are conspiring to commit a crime or are unstable.<p>* We need to standardize on what constitutes reasonable concealed carry as right now the state reciprocity rules are ridiculous. I shouldn&#x27;t need 4-5 licenses to be able to possess firearms across the US, let alone concealed carry.<p>* We need to shift to computerized record keeping at the ATF, and all transactions need to be reported to the ATF. This would allow ATF to perform data mining to go after people making large straw purchases for resale here or transport to Mexico. This is where most guns being used illegally are coming from. If guns supposedly owned by you start showing up at crime scenes, someone should be able to flag that trivially and start asking questions about it. If you are buying 10 new firearms every few weeks, that should be investigated. There are ways we could implement this which protect individual privacy.<p>* It should be illegal to bring guns to a protest, and open carry in most situations should be banned as it makes people less safe, including the owners.<p>Those are the changes that I believe would have a meaningful impact on gun related violence. I do not believe assault weapons bans, magazine size limits, removal of &quot;assault features&quot;, or other such regulations are necessary or particularly helpful as they largely only inhibit individuals who are trying to use their gun in legal self defense. These types of weapons are also relatively rarely used in gun violence, with pistols and shotguns contributing overwhelming to gun related homicides in the US.<p>As for how you deal with the cultural issues among some owners, I have no idea how to tackle that other than to  open reasonable dialog and expose them to additional moderate owners.')
