If not, then it&#x27;s not even remotely the same thing and you know it.<p><i>I imagine bin laden was still protected by Pakistani laws, same as people inside the US are protected by US laws, even if they&#x27;ve pissed off some other country</i><p>You imagine incorrectly. As a non-state actor, bin Laden was not subject to the protection of any nation&#x27;s laws. This has been international law for over a century, and this view was upheld by the U.N. Moreover, Pakistan&#x27;s government itself said it had no issues with the legality of the operation, and indeed <i>elements of Pakistan&#x27;s government and military</i> participated in aspects of the operation.')
