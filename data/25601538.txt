In the parole example, should parolees have access to the knowledge that the model predicts different recidivism rates for different races and by how much?<p>In the business world, the answer is reached by answering the question &quot;How would our reputation change if the public had access to this information?&quot; The end result is that AI ethicists are hired for optics and subsequently have no real capacity to publish this information.<p>Is this similar to how we interact with food? Is the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act a good or bad analogy to use? How similar is this to a food company hiring a food inspector and then firing them when they discover that peanut might have contaminated some other products? I guess if people don&#x27;t know they won&#x27;t complain too much.')
