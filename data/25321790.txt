I&#x27;m personally aware of only one that might come close, and that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s an image-based species detection module, and it&#x27;s whole purpose is actively trying to be able to recognize a large number of very specific subgroups. But most of the other I can think of get maybe a couple dozen, and sometimes even as few as 4 or 5 classes where they&#x27;re useful, and the accuracy within those cases is much more important than the sheer number of possibilities themselves.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just asking if COCO or ImageNet-trained networks are actually noticeably superior for most real-world tasks, or if it&#x27;s just a metric that&#x27;s used because the performance  differences only show up in the long tail of the distribution.')
