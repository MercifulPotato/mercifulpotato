I think that it would take a certain level of self-sufficiency in order to reach a point of not being controllable by earth.<p>Being far away is one thing, but when I look at how powers on Earth exert influence and control over others, it seems you also need to be self-sufficient (protection from blockades, trade embargoes, or other modern &quot;seiges&quot;), and also sufficiently defended&#x2F;defensible to avoid military threats.  Sure, your Martian buildings may be underground, but would they be safe from heavy objects flung at them at high velocity?  Seems like it would be easy enough for Earth to &quot;put down&quot; any Martian activities that rubbed people the wrong way for the foreseeable future.')
