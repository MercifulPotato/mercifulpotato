You have to get burned by buggy data a few times (or maybe a bunch of times) in the real world to learn to look for bad data smells -- I don&#x27;t think schools effectively teach this kind of intuition, regardless of whether the students are training as data engineers or data scientists.<p>If data scientists are spending more time in school getting advanced degrees, they&#x27;re not getting as much exposure to buggy data, whereas data engineers with a BS and a few years of industry experience would already have built up this skill.')
