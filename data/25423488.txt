Item(by='zentiggr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607980850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25421880, text='But the overall history of Google UX reads like:<p>- new idea rolls out with a kickass set of options, settings, features<p>- after some arbitrary time of collecting initial users (and one presumes feedback in some form) an aribtrary set of very useful features gets written out as part of a revamping &#x2F; streamlining &#x2F; brainfart of global proportions.<p>- everyone that hasn&#x27;t signed on to that flavor of UX koolaid is left out in the cold because whatever got cut is NEVER EVER coming back no matter how many people want it back.<p>- everyone convinced to jump on the Google platform is condemned to use only what they are given, never anything better.<p>My feelings about this are strongly colored by the fiasco of the GMail interface losing the simple, basic, core option of looking at emails oldest first or newest first.  All these years later I still can&#x27;t understand why some cabal decided that we ALL only needed newest first regardless of any preferences stated everywhere else in the entire internet.<p>But I long ago lost all confidence that anyone at Google listens to outside feedback about anything.  I have a hard time believing that anyone actually dogfoods honestly.<p>I assume the engineering teams do circlejerks of &quot;what do we want this to do&quot; - &quot;ok give the world whatever we decided and screw anyone&#x27;s ideas how else it could work&quot;.<p>&gt; the challenges of bringing all of the existing users over to the new experience are very real<p>I can&#x27;t remember any time that a new feature rollout didn&#x27;t subtract as much usefulness as it may have added.  It&#x27;s never &quot;we want this to do this for you as well&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;we&#x27;ve decided that this is how it should work, and you&#x27;ll just have to get used to our own way of doing it if you want to keep using it. Sorry not sorry.&quot;')
