The apps you&#x27;re looking at don&#x27;t WANT you to be informed because you might choose not to use them. These notes are just a formality standing in for forced automatic updates. Spotify on Google Play is particularly insulting. They basically tell&#x2F;shame you that you should just always update without caring about the changes.')
