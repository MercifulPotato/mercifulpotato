I mean that, you probably received improvements and patches from external contributors, and those contribution&#x27;s copyrights belong to their creators so you wouldn&#x27;t be able to relicense them without their express consent. This is problematic, but on the other hand by virtue of being GPL in theory a project might receive many more contributions due to the libre spirit that the license infuses to the project, so the project might have benefited to a greater degree from being (A)GPL.<p>One usual mechanism for this is to require a CLA on all contributions, with a copyright assignment so you become the owner of the contribution (and probably cope with a lower amount of people willing to contribute, as some consider CLAs as harmful to Open Source). But of course this had to be put in place from the beginning, which I don&#x27;t know if it was.<p>Other solutions are to reimplement all parts of which you don&#x27;t own the copyright, or to ask one by one for copyright assignment from all previous contributors. In this HN thread they talk precisely about this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24954772" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24954772</a><p>In your case the relicense is to Apache 2 instead of proprietary, but I think the same set of issues apply. I think we&#x27;d learn a lot if you could tell us about your case, so there are more examples about the fine detail of relicensing Open Source projects.')
