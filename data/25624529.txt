This is going to be greatly detrimental both to throughput and software complexity.<p>I guess you could implement the quorum at the CPU level... e.g. have redundant cores each with their own memory. But unless there was a need to protect against CPU cores themselves being unreliable, I don&#x27;t see this making sense either.<p>At the end of the day, <i>at some level</i>, it will always come down to probabilities. &quot;Software engineering principles&quot; will never eliminate that.')
