(How many language extensions does Haskell have now? A hundred?)<p>C++ is easy to understand when you understand the mental model its abstractions target.<p>(In some sense you&#x27;re right: the mental model of Haskell is mathematical, while the mental model of C++ is some sort of multi-core &quot;Harvard architecture&quot; machine. While it&#x27;s true that math is a lot easier for the human brain to grasp, this isn&#x27;t really related to language complexity per se.)')
