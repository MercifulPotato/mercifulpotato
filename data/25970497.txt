You should work from home unless you are providing an essential service and need to be physically present.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citizensinformation.ie&#x2F;en&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;living_with_covid19_plan.html#l05988" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citizensinformation.ie&#x2F;en&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;living_with_co...</a><p>Facebook content moderation is unlikely to fall under &quot;essential work&quot; which is more concerned about healthcare, retail necessities (food&#x2F;drink&#x2F;medicine&#x2F;cleaning supplies), and infrastructure. Given that they&#x27;ve pointed out moderators elsewhere can work from home, it&#x27;s likely facebook cannot demonstrate that they need to be physically present to perform the work.<p>So yes, it is a matter for the government to get involved in if Facebook or its subcontractors are not complying.<p>As for Varadkar, getting involved is likely due to the fact this falls under his department&#x27;s remit (as minister of enterprise), not his position as Tanaiste.  But getting _personally_ involved is likely Leo looking for a good PR opportunity rather than the facebook employees insisting on the Tanaiste&#x27;s personal attention. Or maybe he&#x27;s just also their local TD, since his constituency is Dublin West where many people in Facebook offices in Dublin likely live.')
