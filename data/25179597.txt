Science is much more cautious about &quot;generating belief&quot; than religion is, so it generates fewer beliefs; but it also has a much better track record of generating <i>true</i> beliefs.<p><i>&gt; that&#x27;s because it was a science of generating belief.</i><p>You must be joking. Religion&#x27;s way of &quot;generating belief&quot; is not informed by any kind of scientific study of how to &quot;generate beliefs&quot;.')
