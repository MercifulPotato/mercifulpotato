At the risk of referencing the big short, there was a scene in that film where a stripper has levered herself up so much she owns five home. The reason the GFC happened was in reality because average people were levered up on real estate and couldn&#x27;t afford their repayments.<p>I fully understand that the financial system also took on too much risk and many understood those risks, but the narrative that hedgefunds are entirely to blame for the GFC, and that they were the only ones being irresponsible with leverage, is surely wrong?<p>If the blame was with anyone it should be the regulators... Why were individuals and hedgefunds able to take so much risk? In the absent of regulation individuals and hedgefunds should be expected to take maximum risk for their own gain. Just like how WSBs did when they were all exploiting the infinite leverage glitch.<p>Another thing that I don&#x27;t think is true here is that the government is only there for the hedgefunds... If this last year has proven anything it&#x27;s that the government is perfectly wiling to bail out individuals if they feel it&#x27;s necessary to save the economy. And if the financial system is so rigged against individuals then isn&#x27;t it odd how those individuals seem to be so able to destroy the hedgefunds with relative ease from a free smart phone app?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be edgy, I genuinely don&#x27;t understand why people seem to blame hedgefunds for every inequality problem in society.')
