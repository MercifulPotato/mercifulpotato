A lot of doctors blame patients for bringing utter bullshit that they scraped from Facebook or YouTube as the next Gen therapy.<p>For instance, I have a background in biochemical engineering, my fianc√©e is a cancer surgeon, 4 cousins are doctors, and another 3 cousins married doctors. Yet the entire family collectively believes in homeopathy, unani medicine (Greek medicine) and other hogwash like cupping therapy, save for a select few. The last time I visited one of my relatives, they were ingesting some ayurvedic (Indian medicine) concoction that was later found to contain arsenic. One of my friends is daughter to two doctors, yet her Dad (a former Indian Army doctor, so not the run-of-the-mill kind) still spouted nonsense on Facebook like &quot;burning Turmeric powder and inhaling it would prevent COVID&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s easy to understand, after all this, why doctors tend to be generally skeptical of laymen bringing them some new &quot;breakthrough&quot;. Not much to do with personality than with what they see as a daily occurrence. Of course, one way to sift the chaff away from the grain would be to demand that patients bring in scientifically published papers, at which point most patients would scoff at you for not supporting their viewpoint.')
