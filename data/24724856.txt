It&#x27;s not a valid argument in this context. The OP was talking about needing a better CPU because his large C++ project takes a lot of time to compile. That&#x27;s something inherent to C++ programming. You then make the argument that js devs also require better CPUs because your js project use 10 docker instances. That&#x27;s not valid logic since docker and js have nothing to do with eachother.<p>There are many alternatives to docker which don&#x27;t cripple your computer. Nix is the best one.')
