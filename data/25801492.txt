Item(by='ownagefool', descendants=None, kids=[25801950, 25801985, 25801591], score=None, time=1610794778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25801134, text='The article specifically suggests there&#x27;s a dedicated support developer, which means you&#x27;re sacrficing one member of your squad (per week) for the productivity of the rest of them.  We can debate whether the idea is good or bad, but it&#x27;s not pretending that its magic.<p>On the wider article, I think the litrature is a poor subsitutde for reality.  And honestly I question whether a lot of these agile consultancies actually have the required experience to teach us how to be highly effective as opposed to what we can learn directly from orginsations that are highly effective, but I do believe they have enough experience to tell us that effective development teams invest in development tooling, dev focused user experience, and a dev focused culture.<p>Who and how you&#x27;ll build this is left as an excercise for the reader, which is unfortunte because we now have a legion of consultants who&#x27;ve never produced a line of code making a career telling us &quot;culture is hard&quot; and then forcing us into scaled agile frameworks and tooling that are contradictory to the ethos.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean the underlying point is bad though.  Engineering teams need some time to work on developer experience instead of just being feature factories; bigger org can hire teams dedicated to helping with this.  This is a good thing, but many orgs fail at understanding and allowing the investment.')
