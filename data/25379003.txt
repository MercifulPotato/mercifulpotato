They just allow transactions between customers and sellers.<p>Especially in this case I think it&#x27;s more appropriate if:<p>- the payment provider reports to the police<p>- the police is properly founded and equipped to handle such cases (hint it isn&#x27;t in most countries I&#x27;m aware of).<p>- If after a initial short &quot;check&quot; the police believes a deeper investigation is adequate the payment provider might have to suspend service (temporary with time limited and telling the porn company why).<p>I thing this would be much more appropriate.<p>Furthermore: Requiring manual review of pron material and reasonable proof of consent&#x2F;age if it&#x27;s not obvious from the video.')
