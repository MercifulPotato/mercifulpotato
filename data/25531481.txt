Item(by='mdasen', descendants=None, kids=[25532051, 25532052], score=None, time=1608844430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25528901, text='I&#x27;m curious why you think RISC-V is the future and not ARM. I guess part of it depends on how far into the future we&#x27;re looking, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like ARM license fees are so high that they&#x27;re prohibitive.<p>ARM generates less than $2B in revenue. Apple posts $275B in revenue. Are ARM&#x27;s fees just a rounding error to anyone with scale? And ARM knows that it needs to remain competitive on its licensing fees to make sure that people don&#x27;t move to RISC-V.<p>I&#x27;d guess that a lot of ARM&#x27;s revenue actually comes from the processor design, not the ISA. ARM will license you cores. RISC-V won&#x27;t license you cores since they&#x27;re not designing them.<p>It&#x27;s possible that RISC-V will see great things, but I&#x27;m kinda thinking that ARM&#x27;s license fees probably aren&#x27;t much. Apple especially wouldn&#x27;t be paying much since they&#x27;re not licensing cores. Anyone that is licensing cores would need to replace that R&amp;D with their own - which might be more expensive than it&#x27;s worth. Qualcomm seems to still lean on ARM&#x27;s designs.<p>And I think there&#x27;s certainly a big head start in optimizing things for ARM that will be tough to overcome.<p>I just think it seems unlikely that current customers will drop ARM to save 0.1% of their revenue - especially if they need to start taking on the costs of designing the chips themselves, contributing to compilers, etc.<p>The exception I can see is China. China might want a free-and-clear route to their own processors without worrying about other nations denying them access to IP.')
