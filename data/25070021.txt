They BOTH do that with my LG 5K Ultrafine display, whether they&#x27;re closed or open, without doing anything particularly heavy. Sent them both to Apple, they passed all checks with flying colours.  And that&#x27;s the end of more than a decade of giving Apple tons of money. I built a Ryzen desktop this year and, despite missing macOS terribly, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the speed and ergonomics.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve tried both sides of the laptop, I have iStat Menus and keep an eye on temps, etc.<p>edit2: they &quot;only&quot; spin to 3.5k-4k at idle, but go up as soon as I do anything with Chrome or am on a video call, which is most of my job')
