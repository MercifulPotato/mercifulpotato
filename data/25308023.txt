Whatever they  are doing, in particular publishing, is part of the business&#x2F;PR. So if the management sees something not good for business it is a reasonable that they decided to not do it. If i were  a shareholder i can see how i may have questioned why a person being paid $1M+&#x2F;year (my understanding this is minimum what a manager in AI at Google would be making) for publicly disparaging Google.<p>Even more, it sounds like Google didn&#x27;t ask originally for retraction, they just asked to take into account the newer research contradicting the paper - the thing that  any researcher valuing integrity over agenda wouldn&#x27;t refuse.<p>If somebody wants to do that research and publishing they just have to find another source of funding, i guess.<p>Anyway, the firing wasn&#x27;t over the paper, the firing was over the unacceptably unprofessional reaction to it.')
