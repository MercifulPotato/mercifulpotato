It&#x27;s weird that everyone is freaking out about people travelling when the airports remain open and the guidance is totally about what ppl do inside the country. If you must keep the airport open(IMO should close them), let people leave and don&#x27;t let them come back. If they leave, it&#x27;s their problem (and unfortunately, some other country&#x27;s). Stay at home.')
