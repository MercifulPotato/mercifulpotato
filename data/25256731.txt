While year-over-year they don&#x27;t necessarily add something big and shiny (a bump in specs, occasional co-processor), if you compare an A14 to an A9 from 5 years ago the differences are huge.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take a &quot;shiny new thing&quot; every year to keep the M series chips looking better than Intel. Perhaps you&#x27;re right and in another 10-15 years it&#x27;ll come back to commodity parts, but it would take something Very Shiny to push that at this point. And afaict Intel is in no position to deliver anything shiny enough to do that.')
