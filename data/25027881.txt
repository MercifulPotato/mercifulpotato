Item(by='koolba', descendants=None, kids=[25027956], score=None, time=1604861309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25027570, text='&gt; The first statement said both sides, the second statement 2 days later tried to clarify the statement with an excuse that he was saying other people that walked amongst nazi were the good people.<p>The first statement is in regards to people protesting to bring down monuments. There’s clearly two sides to that argument and there are many fine people, myself included, that do not want to see statues of Lincoln torn now.<p>&gt; As a constant pattern of trumps presidency, he throws out a dog whistle and then walks it back 2 days later sayig he was taken out of context, misspoke, or was joking. You can claim he&#x27;s fighting against antisemitism and racism, but I just straight up don&#x27;t trust his good faith.<p>If your own biases interpret everything in some perverted negative light, then it’s an impossible standard to meet.<p>&gt; My jewish eyes see him as supporting nazis and a supporter of those who walk with nazis.<p>And yet his grandchildren are Jewish and he’s had more success negotiating Middle East peace deals that benefit Israel than any other president.<p>If he’s Nazi supporter he’s doing a pretty crappy job at it.<p>&gt; Him being a poor communicator is a lackluster excuse why I should trust him.<p>If you refuse to ever give the benefit of the doubt then why even argue about it?<p>&gt; All those other good people walked under those nazi flags. Why would I trust them either?<p>Nobody says to trust them. But they’re not the only ones that wanted to preserve historic statues.<p>That’s like reducing all of recent racial &#x2F; police protests to a bunch of looters robbing a Best Buy.')
