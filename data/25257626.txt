Were you born there?  If not, how old were you when you &quot;invaded&quot; it?  Because somebody lived there before you, right?  How cruel of you to take their house from them.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware of the fact that if I own a piece of land adjacent to my house, and then choose to legally sell it to another party, who then pays taxes to the local government to fund the externalities of their presence (traffic, water, electricity, schools), that it&#x27;s an &quot;invasion&quot;.<p>Cities either grow or die.  There is nobody in Detroit complaining about gentrifiers &quot;invading&quot; their neighborhood.  Instead, they are desperately trying to maintain the infrastructure and find money for schools as their city has lost population over the years. I grew up in a rural county with a declining population.  The elementary and middle schools I attended have been shuttered.  The only hospital in the county has closed, forcing the locals to drive an hour to get to one in a neighboring county.  The young all leave and never return, because there&#x27;s no jobs, leaving their parents to never see grandkids except on holidays.  That&#x27;s the alternative to growth.  If you can find a city in the US with absolutely no growth or decline in the population, and a strong economy, please let me know.<p>A city that fights development and growth will just push the poor out quicker, as older houses that they could have afforded are snapped up and remodeled by rich folks who otherwise would have built a brand new home.')
