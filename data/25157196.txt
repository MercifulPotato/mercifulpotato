PE-COFF binaries<p>PE-COFF comes from UNIX originally – COFF was the executable format introduced by AT&amp;T in Unix System V, up to and including SVR3 – in SVR4, it was replaced with ELF. PE-COFF is simply Microsoft&#x27;s variant of COFF. There are other variants, such as IBM&#x27;s XCOFF (used on AIX). Given that COFF originated on UNIX and has a long history of use there, should we really call a UNIX(-like) &quot;weird&quot; for using it?<p>The UNIX standard doesn&#x27;t mandate any particular executable file format. macOS uses Mach-O. z&#x2F;OS uses GOFF. Both are certified UNIX. (Interix&#x2F;SFU&#x2F;SUA never was, but there was nothing stopping Microsoft pursuing UNIX certification for it if that had been a priority for them.)')
