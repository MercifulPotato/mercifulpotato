The idea that freedom of speech means &#x27;requiring neutrality&#x27; is just painfully misinformed.  You can talk about literally anything you want on the internet.  But you&#x27;re conflating a few social media platforms with vastly different moderation policies, user bases, and business models into one mass of &#x27;public communication&#x27;.<p>&gt;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with requiring neutrality from social media companies.<p>I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.  Who will be the decider in what &#x27;neutrality&#x27; means?  Because that&#x27;s about as loaded of a political term as you can get in this day and age.  I don&#x27;t understand what an even remotely reasonable interpretation of this policy would be where individual private companies were forced to publish or barred from removing content that goes against their content moderation policy.')
