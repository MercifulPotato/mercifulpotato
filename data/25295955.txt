(This hopefully won&#x27;t happen again very soon.)<p>I work for Facebook in the US on an L-1 visa. I&#x27;m currently in the process of applying for permanent residence (green card) through the PERM process targeted here.<p>The Justice Dept seems upset that Facebook doesn&#x27;t advertise my job on the careers website. The reason is very simple: FB doesn&#x27;t want to hire someone else for this job. They&#x27;re doing the PERM process because they want to keep me.<p>I know I&#x27;m not underpaid compared to my peers. I&#x27;m fairly high level and came to FB through an acquisition. I have deep knowledge and ownership of a very specific piece of the tech stack.<p>It seems bizarre for the Justice Dept to argue that FB should just throw away their investment in me and hire an American instead. How would that help the USA?')
