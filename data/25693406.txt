Now if the government had banned Trump from speaking, then you would have a point. Twitter banning Trump is, at root, a business making a business decision.<p>Here&#x27;s reality, and I&#x27;m going to date myself here, but there were, long ago, enormously popular digital spaces called BBS&#x27;s. You could chat, play games (MUDs mostly), etc etc. They are, by and large, no longer with us. New and admittedly better technologies came along. So will it be with Social Media. As difficult as it may be for people to believe, 40 years from now, Social Media in its current form will probably not be with us any longer.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing though, the government <i>will</i> still be with us. So it&#x27;s the government that we need to constrict. And, using the tool of our Constitution, we do an admirable job of constricting the government&#x27;s ability to restrict our free speech. That Twitter says a man can&#x27;t talk on their private property is not a societal problem. That the government says a man can&#x27;t talk anywhere in the country is a societal problem. There&#x27;s been far too much conflating of these two issues, they are not the same.')
