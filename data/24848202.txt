Most bugs <i>are</i> caught early without special precautions, but special precautions can be quite expensive. Most software doesn&#x27;t have truly catastrophic failure cases.<p>If there&#x27;s a bug slipping through, someone will run into it, report it, and it&#x27;ll get fixed. If nobody runs into it, the bug doesn&#x27;t cost anything.<p>This is the most economic way to go about it, which is the reason why pretty much all successful software is kind of buggy. We all like to complain about it, but then we don&#x27;t want to wait an extra year for the next version either.<p>At the other end of the spectrum, if you need <i>really</i> reliable software, the solution is not to eliminate all the bugs, that&#x27;s impossible. Even with perfect software, hardware can fail, bits can flip the wrong way. The solution is to make sure that errors can&#x27;t bring down the airplane.')
