Yes, a lot of innovation is not patented, but that&#x27;s usually the stuff that requires little investments.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget the disclosure part of patents. If you want something be protected by patents, you need to publish a description of how you do it. You can&#x27;t just keep the engineers isolated on an island or whatever. A no patent world would make manufacturers build in even more measures to prevent reverse engineering, engineers sharing secrets, etc.')
