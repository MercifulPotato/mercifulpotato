They recognized there is risk to systems and proposed to enhance election security based on the new (and proven) information that state actors were directly involved in trying to manipulate our election.  I do not remember (I may be proven wrong), Democrats undermining the fidelity of the election itself, or alleging fraudulent votes, excepting one or two places where it was proven to happen (see the Dan McCready campaign).<p>My understanding is both parties now are roughly aligned with their longstanding positions in terms of how they view election security and relative occurrence of voter fraud and malfeasance.  Comparing the 2016 positions on interference via fake news is apples and oranges, it is fundamentally a different subject â€“ and the allegations of election interference were literally proven true by a justice system run by the Republican party.')
