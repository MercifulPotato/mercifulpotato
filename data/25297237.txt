So not that great an expense. Effectively their power bills should cancel out the remaining costs eventually and then the home owner should effectively get &quot;free energy&quot; after that.<p>How much free energy? Maybe none and they are ripped off! Maybe lots. Generally people are betting on at least some, or they wouldn&#x27;t do it.<p>My point though is why not spend that money on power grid infrastructure which would benefit all of us!<p>In particular the economies of scale should have more environmental AND economic impact than thousands of custom roof sites installed with varying degree of expertise and maintained by home amateurs.')
