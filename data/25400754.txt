He was not certain she would save him, since she was not certain herself. He knew she was jealous. Her had a choice between a quick death and a life without his love (which I wouldn&#x27;t romanticise, love being more complex than binary.) I don&#x27;t know what he faced. I do know that I would choose to trust my love, and open her door, as an act of love and trust for us both to have, whatever the outcome.')
