I pick up my guitar few times a day to practice, not at set times. I exercise either in the morning or the evening depending on my mood and my plans. I’m usually working my way through a few books at a time so I may choose any of them to read. I work on projects when I can squeeze an hour or two in or when I wind up with a free afternoon. None of that would ever happen if I had to block out time for it or wait for the necessities to be delivered. Hell, half the time I don’t even know what I want to build until I rummage through the various fasteners and bits of scrap wood laying around and something strikes my fancy. The same goes for cooking, some of the best meals I’ve made were whipped up from the ingredients I had on hand. A perfectly planned life would be devoid of happy accidents.')
