This is going to be a backup cable for my USB-C power bank, since I already have a cable with that.<p>- The $30 price difference is bulllshit, agreed. It’s shitty of them to be marketing these prices with a $30 AT&amp;T&#x2F;Verizon discount included. I’m on T-mobile, so no discount even if I stuck with them, but will likely be switching to Mint.<p>- I haven’t filled 64 gigs on my SE yet, but I’m certainly glad I spent the $100 to get it over the 16 GB base model. Looking at getting a similar life out of a new phone, I should plan on the $50 for 128 GB.<p>The things that I want are:<p>- Modern camera technology, especially night mode and the ultrawide. Many years ago I paid $700 for a cannon 10-22mm ultrawide lens, I don’t know if this is superior in every way to my (oldish) DSLR, but as they say the best camera is the one you have with you. And most of the time I don’t have my SLR, let alone it’s extra lenses.<p>- On that note, compatibility with Moment cases and M-mount lenses. A small phone is more important to me than the 3rd telephoto camera in the Pro phones, but it’d be nice to have the option to mount a decent quality telephoto or macro lens.<p>- More RAM. The SE does a <i>lot</i> of relaunching apps when switching between more than two things, and it’s not particularly fast at it.<p>Losing TouchID is a bummer, but a trade off I think I’m willing to make. I could drag this phone out for another year if I had to (barring hardware failures), but I’m looking forward to the upgrades.')
