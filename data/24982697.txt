Exponential growth is unbounded and impossible with a finite population. The number of total infections is better described by a logistic function (epidemiologists use more sophisticated models of course, but the shape of the curve is similar).<p>About 28% of the Indian population has been infected (15-22% according to more pessimistic estimates). In some areas it&#x27;s even higher, 41% in the slums of Mumbai.[1] The virus is running out of hosts. That is not a miracle, it&#x27;s completely expected. India is just lucky to be reaching that state faster.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;indias-covid-19-cases-have-declined-rapidly-herd-immunity-still-far-away-scientists-say" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;indias-covid-19-case...</a>')
