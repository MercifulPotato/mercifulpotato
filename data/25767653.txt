I&#x27;ve seen a switch from outsourcing to poland(former east) to the ukraine(non EU+east). This is good for the polish guys, they&#x27;re almost at our level now.<p>* Residence requirements for people outside of the European continent are low, and on base wage mostly lower than for any other sector.<p>This makes the wages more internationally competitive from a business perspective, and hooks into &quot;Individual contributors in Europe are not as valued as much as managerial professions&quot; Because you can get the work from somewhere else cheaper.')
