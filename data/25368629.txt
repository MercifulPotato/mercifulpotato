This article makes the assumption that Google&#x27;s primary goal is performance&#x2F;page load. It&#x27;s not. Feature parity and dev speed is. With a gigantic app like Cloud with hundreds of developers, there are massive technical hurdles surrounding things like independent releases, split bundles, and technical debt.<p>Google&#x27;s business model for Cloud is b2b. The bottom line for getting b2b contracts normally comes down to requested features (among other things). Page load time doesn&#x27;t factor as much comparatively, so these priorities do make sense. Not to say performance isn&#x27;t on everyone&#x27;s roadmap, but Google has and will continue to make strategic decisions that sacrifice performance over things like dev speed.')
