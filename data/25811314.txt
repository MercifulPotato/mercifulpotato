How much do you value language integration? Do you have muscle memory for vim or emacs? There are many more questions here.<p>VSCode supports language server protocol arguably best, because LSP&#x2F;VSCode&#x2F;TypeScript were all developed somewhat in parallel. But some languages don&#x27;t have complete language servers, or already had their own forms of IDE integration.
