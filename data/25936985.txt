Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=[25937137, 25937129], score=None, time=1611798005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936859, text='The endgame is the destruction of Melvin Capital, and that&#x27;s going to happen no matter what. No one can swoop in and just tank the stock price. Even if BlackRock were to dump all their shares before Friday, it likely still wouldn&#x27;t be enough because that&#x27;s only 13% of GME. Michael Burry&#x27;s Scion Capital owns around 5%, but I don&#x27;t think Dr. Burry&#x27;s going anywhere either, and the reason they&#x27;re going to hold is the same reason Melvin is going to go down in flames, there&#x27;s simply no stock left to buy and no indication that selling makes sense right now.<p>The whole thing driving this is a massive buy-up of all available stock. No one wants to sell; everyone wants to buy.<p>If Melvin Capital were a patient in a hospital, it&#x27;d be brain dead and on life support. We&#x27;re just waiting for everyone involved to say their goodbyes so the plug can be pulled.<p>At $90 a share, Melvin had to get a $2.75bn capital injection to stay afloat. That was the time to get out. They instead tried to force a sell-off so they could buy up cheap shares and reduce the bleeding. That failed. For roughly every $12 over $90, Melvin Capital lost $1 billion. Well at $348 a share, they&#x27;re now negative $21.5bn in value. Its over. Their greed has resulted in their utter destruction.<p>Once Melvin&#x27;s corpse is wheeled out of the hospital, BlackRock and Burry might head for the exit, especially Burry, since he bought in at $4 a share, and a 5% stake there is such an enormous return even at $200, much less $348, that at some point, you&#x27;re just being a greedy asshole.<p>Some people on WSB a little more ruthless, and frankly with the BS that Wall Street has gotten away with for the past few decades, I can&#x27;t say I blame them; they plan to hold till $1000, which hilarious and crazy as it sounds, may not be impossible, but I&#x27;d judge it unlikely.<p>I&#x27;d say anyone that got in $GME before the huge price spike ($20 and lower), now&#x27;s a good time to cash out. You won. Your lottery ticket hit all 6 numbers. Go live your life.<p>To all the short-sellers, I can only bow and say, &quot;We who are about to die, salute you.&quot;')
