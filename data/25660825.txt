It shouldn&#x27;t be added in a way that can take out your site unless there is some business critical reason to track.<p>Then I&#x27;d ask, just how critical is the tracking? If losing a few hours of data is going to throw off your product development, do you have enough data to be making decisions? My experience is that bugs and misconfiguration of experiments is common in most orgs, so even if the system is up to capture all data, product managers check an experiment a week later to find they have only 50% of the data.')
