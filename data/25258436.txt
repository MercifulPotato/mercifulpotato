Quoting the abstract:<p>&gt; Macromolecular crystallography evolved enormously from the pioneering days, when structures were solved by “wizards” performing all complicated procedures almost by hand. In the current situation crystal structures of large systems can be often solved very effectively by various powerful automatic programs in days or hours, or even minutes. Such progress is to a large extent coupled to the advances in many other fields, such as genetic engineering, computer technology, availability of synchrotron beam lines and many other techniques, creating the highly interdisciplinary science of macromolecular crystallography. Due to this unprecedented success crystallography is often treated as one of the analytical methods and practiced by researchers interested in structures of macromolecules, but not highly competent in the procedures involved in the process of structure determination.<p>Certainly some proteins are extremely hard to crystallize, and the new single-atom EM work will help a lot. But are there really &quot;armies of students who routinely spend 4-6 years of their PhD trying to solve a structure of a single protein&quot; these days?<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m sure some do. But if so, that army is pretty small compared to the vast numbers who more routinely use crystallography.')
