There are a few others.<p>The second most impactful factor for me has been meditation and general spiritual development. I have conditioned myself to practice attention to breath meditation several times per day for anywhere from half a minute to several minutes.<p>Whenever I notice myself stressed, annoyed, waiting, rushing, indecisive, and in other circumstances where mental clarity would help, I return my attention to breath. I&#x27;ve been practicing this for several years, and have experienced tremendous benefits.<p>For example, I have been able to largely unwire my annoyance reaction. I just don&#x27;t become annoyed at things anymore. Crying babies, repetitive sounds, squeaky noises, arrogant or childish people, waiting for someone who&#x27;s late, running late myself, and so on. It just doesn&#x27;t bother me, no more than the wind or the rain.<p>Of course, if a program steals focus or a site is forcing me to use JS, or my [redacted] news feed is in some random fucking indecipherable sort order, it still annoys me. But that&#x27;s my passion domain, and I project all those things as potentially happening in my software if I&#x27;m not careful, so I let it happen as a way of keeping myself sharp and vigilant.<p>Diet-wise, I avoid processed food and tobacco, which are my addictions. I&#x27;ve never been much of a drinker, but I&#x27;ve cut alcohol out almost entirely, even the occasional sip of vodka or half a bottle of beer I used to have. I attended several AA meetings recently, and it was a clarifying and eye-opening experience, and I just can&#x27;t see alcohol the same way anymore.<p>I still love weed, but no longer regularly. I used to be a wake and bake, all day every day, no such thing as too much weed smoker.<p>Based on my prior psychedelic experience, I think I could have achieved many of these changes much quicker with the occasional acid trip, but I haven&#x27;t found the right set and setting in a while.')
