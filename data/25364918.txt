Because of the drastically shorter time to resilver, and drastically lower load placed on the pool while doing so. The only disk more heavily loaded than usual during a mirror vdev resilvering is the other disk in the vdev – which might sound bad, but remember that it’s no more heavily loaded than it would’ve been as a RAIDZ member.  Each block resilvered on a RAIDZ vdev requires a block to be read from each surviving RAIDZ member; each block written to a resilvering mirror only requires one block to be read from a surviving vdev member.  For a six-disk RAIDZ1 vs a six disk pool of mirrors, that’s five times the extra I&#x2F;O demands required of the surviving disks.<p>I think it&#x27;s perfectly okay to disagree. But any comment must contain a counterargument to be useful, for example, one could&#x27;ve argued that load is not an issue in a small array and so on, and I may happily accept the other side of the argument. However, I respectfully criticize that your comment doesn&#x27;t include any counterargument, it&#x27;s not useful, please read the article more carefully next time.')
