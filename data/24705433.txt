We have the same problem with people from certain country having a lot of experience and inflate the point system. The exp points in Australia acummulate twice as fast as exp overseas so those who worked in Australia like myself still have the advantage. However I am now not a fan of the point system as it&#x27;s just another standard test to be hijacked by multiple attack vectors. I&#x27;d much prefer the european way where work visa is given out easily with fair wage and better mobility, (in Australia you have 4 - 6 weeks to find a new employer, not impossible for software but a bit tight). From what I&#x27;ve heard there is no real incentive to acquire citizenship&#x2F;PR in many european countries b&#x2F;c temporary residents enjoy the same stability.')
