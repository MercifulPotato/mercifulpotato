If you have two expressions a, and b, and you want to unify them in a declarative language as a = b, then having an unknown subterm in one or the other can make the computation have a completely different complexity, making one direction easy and the other intractable. The P vs. NP problem is a famous question exactly about this directionality.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple example (in a declarative language that allows non-terminating computation; in a total language similar examples can be given, except &quot;impossible&quot; means intractable rather than non-computable, which, for all intents and purposes is the same):<p><pre><code>    X = terminates?(P(1))\n</code></pre>\nIf X is known then finding a P is easy; if vice-versa, finding X is possibly impossible.')
