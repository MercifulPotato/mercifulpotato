I get it that codebases inevitably rot over time, but the amount of rot can be mitigated by good dev practices such as unit testing, code reviews, best-effort (not perfect!) documentation, and standardizing dev practices. Dev teams that simply don’t care about code maintenance practices because the code “works” won’t be able to move fast enough during regular times, much less during a pandemic remote-setup scenario.')
