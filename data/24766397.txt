However it isn&#x27;t clear if this also affects tools that use a API or even just Plausible being used internally for a company.<p>The AGPL does have wording saying that in the case software is joined together only the original work has the AGPL requirement, however it is unclear what the difference is between modifications to the original work and other code that uses that original work.<p>FWIW this is non-specific enough that I am not completely comfortable using Plausible personally anymore. Of course you company&#x27;s legal team may have a different opinion.')
