I assumed that it was a membrane filtration system based on skids to reduce salts and hence soil salinity.<p>Someone(who shared the link) said that it’s based on ‘quantum physics’.<p>[..] With <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aqua4d-irrigation.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aqua4d-irrigation.com&#x2F;</a> you will only modify the water physical structure. That&#x27;s it.  About salts, in the water or in the soil, we make the crops able to have access to h2o with out the bad impacts of the salts all around the roots. It&#x27;s a green technology with no by products or chemicals and operation cost. Allow to reduce water and fertilizers by 20-50% without any bad impacts on the crops. Not a miracle but very close. [..]<p>I have to confess my ignorance. I don’t understand what this means?')
