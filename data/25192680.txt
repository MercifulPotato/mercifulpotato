They had about the same abundance when the Solar System was created but they have different half lives. U235 is about 0.70 billion years and U238 at about 4.47 billion years.<p>Currently U235 is only 0.7% of natural uranium, but one can make a nuclear reactor with natural water as a regulator with ratios of about 3%. So for most of Earth&#x27;s history an intelligent race could probably develop nuclear power at the wood burning level of energy production. If nuclear and coal were developed in tandem, I can&#x27;t imagine coal winning out. It is so much less safe and dirty.<p>There is even geologic formations where natural nuclear reactors existed in the past[1].<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Natural_nuclear_fission_reacto...</a>')
