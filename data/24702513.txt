I don&#x27;t want my ISP knowing when I use Tor, since my ISP is in the same country as me and that makes it easier for them to have access to me if they wanted to. Using a VPN means my ISP only sees me connecting to a VPN (which is arguably more innocuous). Then you can use Tor from there. And if you only use HTTPS sites, then only you and the end site can read the traffic. And obviously don&#x27;t login to accounts created outside of Tor or that use details that can lead back to your real identity.')
