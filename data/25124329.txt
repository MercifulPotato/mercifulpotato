It&#x27;s a recognition that monopoly is the end goal of every profit-driven company, and that economies of scale and compounding are purely free-market ways to reach that status. I.e. the more money you have, the faster you will make money, and the more you scale up, the less you spend per-unit. Of course eventually the organizational costs of scaling grow to compensate, but then there are many small people employed in inventing new business models and strategies that let companies get larger and larger before they become too unwieldy to keep the upstarts down.<p>Also: &quot;arcane legal loopholes&quot; are <i>caused</i> by accumulation of capital. Fundamentally, if you have a market and a government within the same light cone, they&#x27;ll find a way to affect each other. Government officials participate in the market and want the money, so they can be influenced with money. You can&#x27;t really treat them as independent entities.<p>Bottomline, though, all these elements are present here: DoorDash &amp; friends are using everything they can think of in their fight to dominate the space.')
