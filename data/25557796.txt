For most part the past 2000 years the Bible was probably the only book most people in the Western World saw or had. It was a required attribute of school curriculum. It was a required book to have at home etc.<p>None of that makes the Bible &quot;stand the test of time&quot; or make it popular in the same sense as <i>Harry Potter</i> is popular. Compare Bible&#x27;s &quot;popularity&quot; to <i>Quotations from the Works of Mao Zedong</i> (emphasis mine) [1]:<p>--- start quote ---<p>It has been reported that 800 million copies of the red-covered booklet Quotations from the Works of Mao Zedong (Tse-tung) were sold or distributed between June 1966, when <i>possession became virtually mandatory in China</i>, and September 1971, when its promoter Marshal Lin Biao died in an air crash.<p>--- end quote ---<p>I doubt any significant number of Bibles are actually <i>sold</i> anymore (especially in what&#x27;s called &quot;developed world&quot;), but are distributed via churches or other religious organisations. Gideon <i>distributes</i> 50 million bibles per year [2]. Most available statistics talk about &quot;printed&quot; or &quot;distributed&quot; when talking about number of bibles sold which is definitely not the same.<p>For example [3] (emphasis mine):<p>--- start quote ---<p>The Bible is by far the worlds best-<i>selling</i> book of all time. No other book, fact or fiction, even comes close. Most estimates place the number of Bibles <i>printed</i> each year at over 100 million. 20 million Bibles are <i>sold</i> each year in the United States alone.<p>--- end quote ---<p>The United States is quite religious, and it still only manages ~20 million books per year for a population of ~400 million people. This number will be significantly smaller in less religious countries, and higher in more religious countries. But once again it hardly makes it popular in the same sense as Harry Potter is popular.<p>And, of course, once you make more and more books available to people, you will inevitably have smaller numbers of those books sold, but a greater number of them in total. There are 650 million books sold in the US each year. [4] There are 300 thousand new titles each year [5]<p>But yeah, the Bible is &quot;popular&quot; because it&#x27;s pushed through an organised religion and has <i>for centuries</i> been a required reading for everyone (for everyone who could read that is, as literacy was scarce at best). And even today it&#x27;s possible that most bibles go to the same people (&quot;The average American Christian owns 9 Bibles and wants to purchase more&quot; [2])<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.guinnessworldrecords.com&#x2F;world-records&#x2F;best-selling-book-of-non-fiction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.guinnessworldrecords.com&#x2F;world-records&#x2F;best-sell...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brandongaille.com&#x2F;27-good-bible-sales-statistics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brandongaille.com&#x2F;27-good-bible-sales-statistics&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebibleanswer.org&#x2F;bibles-sold-each-year&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebibleanswer.org&#x2F;bibles-sold-each-year&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;1177&#x2F;book-market&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;1177&#x2F;book-market&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theifod.com&#x2F;how-many-new-books-are-published-each-year-and-other-related-books-facts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theifod.com&#x2F;how-many-new-books-are-published-eac...</a>')
