It involves muggles launching an operation to retrieve a key person from Hogwarts just as the final battle with Voldemort is about to erupt there. The story would follow a bunch of SAS soldiers who fly in on helicopters, while covered by a wing of fighter jets that intercept a dragon, and then provide distraction &#x2F; air support for the good guys. The overall tone was meant to be similar to the start of Gulag mission from Modern Warfare 2[0].<p>I&#x27;m not a good writer, so this will likely end up a military porn story to the tune of Salvation War[1] - so perhaps it&#x27;s best if it remains unwritten.
