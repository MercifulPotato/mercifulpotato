The spoon theory helped the author to feel a bit less alone, because her friend who did not understand her, could understand her a little bit more with the spoon theory.<p>Her friend probably thought, &quot;hey I also sometimes feel a lack of spoons&quot;. But the enormous extent the author has to deal with spoon management still surprised her friend. It surprised me too.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ok to have such a lack of spoons. I think some people are indeed very lonely when it comes to their kind of lack of spoons. I don&#x27;t think thinking that way is harmful. Getting such a severe illness is a severe loss of life quality. You will probably grief for the rest of your life. It&#x27;s nothing you can fully move on from.<p>At least I would never hug a person with such a background while saying &quot;I understand you&quot;. That is impossible for me. Hugging, of course, yes, but claiming any real knowledge about how such constant lack of spoons must feel is impossible for me.')
