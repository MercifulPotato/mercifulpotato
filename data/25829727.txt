No central authority told Amazon to drop Parler; Amazon decided on their own.</i><p>Actually, Amazon didn&#x27;t decide on their own—which is why none of us are surprised by their &quot;decision&quot;. It was made for them, somewhere else. But where? By who? How?<p>You&#x27;d think on a site supposedly interested in computer science that people would be aware that <i>distributed consensus</i> is a thing. You don&#x27;t need a literal monarch (or a conspiracy—same thing), there are many ways to achieve consensus in a distributed fashion that are extremely robust.<p>In fact, distributed consensus (as everyone here already knows) is substantially more robust overall. (Cockroach is more robust than Postgres, etc.) With a monarch, you can simply replace them—it&#x27;s no harder than swapping in a new CEO. But with distributed consensus, <i>the entire apparatus has to be torn down simultaneously</i>. Yikes!<p>So ask yourself, what institutions are involved in forming consensus in the US today? Are they government, private, or both? Are they democratic or oligarchic? Etc. We know it <i>can</i> be done, the only question is: where are the nodes? How do they communicate? What&#x27;s the protocol used? Etc.<p>The US today runs a distributed consensus algorithm that made Amazon&#x27;s decision about Parler for them, i.e. the values and decisions made by that consensus filter down to supposedly &quot;independent&quot; businesses like Amazon, who implement them. And if Amazon <i>disobeys</i> that consensus, everyone else in the system (especially the press) will gang up on them until they do….<p>tl;dr There&#x27;s nothing independent about what Amazon did, distributed political decision making in the US decided their actions for them.')
