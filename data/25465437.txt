The models that are just blobs and take ages to render in, the constant crashes on all platforms in the opening missions and a number of other bugs have made the game close to unplayable. I do hope they manage to bring the game to a workable state though because it&#x27;s clearly fantastic from a story, environment and gameplay standpoint.')
