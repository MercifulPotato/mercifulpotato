The protocol, sure, but most bugs aren&#x27;t introduced on a protocol level.<p>These are only things they <i>could</i> solve, i.e. that others do better. That their contact discovery solution (where you upload your phone book) is broken isn&#x27;t a downside because nobody else has that figured out either.')
