Once gout was confined largely to Western civilization (with some outliers, like the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan); now its ravages are global.<p>High fructose corn syrup seems to me the strongest contender for &quot;single biggest cause&quot; – it ties in nicely with the obesity epidemic, and the two surely snowball together.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that other factors (the same as 18th century&#x27;s) can&#x27;t bring gout on, like a comment elsewhere here reports, but I just cannot believe that high fructose corn syrup&#x27;s ubiquitous stance in our food isn&#x27;t met with some pernicious and hard-to-trace effects on our health.')
