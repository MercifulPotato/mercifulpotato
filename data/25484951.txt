The thing about fashion is that the way if develops is largely arbitrary. Changes in fashion resemble a drunken walk through possible design space with the drunkard receiving regular shoves from &quot;influencers&quot; who are usually trying to sell you something. Occasionally you have a fashion &quot;revival&quot; where someone takes an idea from the past, gives it a new spin, and then sells it back to newcomers as the next big thing.<p>This seems especially true in the types of startups and companies many HN readers work at or aspire to join &#x2F; build - that is ones which are low stake &#x2F; high reward.<p>I think when you combine the low stakes nature of the VC driven startup world with its cult of youth and the in group conformity of young people this is what you get.<p>[1] by low stakes I mean no one will die and you won&#x27;t be prosecuted if your single page app startup goes tits up. Indeed you&#x27;re supposed to &quot;fail fast&quot; precisely because the cost of failure is so low. Even if a VC or angel has invested a few million in you, to them that&#x27;s still low stakes because they exist on an entirely different plane of wealth and you are just one of multiple bets.<p>[2] We&#x27;re going to rebel by all dressing the same but not the same as our dad!')
