The bail system is terrible, and fundamentally unfair.<p>Edit: to be clear, making it relative to ability to pay, and eliminating commercial bail bondsmen would be a big step in the right direction. I still think that&#x27;s rife with issues, but it would be significantly better than what we have now.')
