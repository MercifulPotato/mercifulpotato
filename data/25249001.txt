Mike Dane has a lot of free video tutorials that some of my students have spoken highly of: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mikedane.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mikedane.com&#x2F;</a><p>Remember that with coding you learn by doing, so resist the urge to &quot;just watch videos&quot; or even &quot;watch videos and take notes&quot;. I recommend to my students to always have a side-project of some type. Pick something that will motivate you, such a game, or an application that you find interesting. Have <i>that</i> motivate you to learn the next thing, instead of just picking new topics and reading them one at a time. When we have limited free time as adults, learning new skills is all about maintaining that motivation and direction, so when self-teaching project work is probably the very best motivation and guide in lieu of an instructor.<p><i>Self-plug:</i> I teach coding courses for beginners. My program (Kickstart Coding) combines video-based graded coursework with weekly live sessions and 1:1 tutoring, for a $299&#x2F;month subscription.
