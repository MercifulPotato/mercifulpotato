Many people cannot distinguish fake news from legitimate sources of information.<p>The track record of restricting information from people because you feel like you&#x27;re smarter then they are is not great. It&#x27;s also impractically subjective.<p>&gt; Increasing noise (disinformation) is just as damaging to free speech as decreasing the signal (censorship).<p>I consider your suggestion of encouraging clamping down on free speech is too dangerous to discuss.
