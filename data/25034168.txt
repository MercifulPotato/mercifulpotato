So mutation isn&#x27;t expected to be a huge concern, unlike say influenza which mutates relatively rapidly and requires an annual tweak to the vaccines.<p>What&#x27;s more, any new strains we do see spreading more widely will do so because their mutations confer a competitive advantage. In practice that usually means more drift towards higher infectiousness but less severe symptoms - the same mechanisms that have left us with 4 other endemic but mild common cold coroanviruses.<p>The new SARS-COV-2 vaccines may be a useful tool to get us over this hump where the virus is still novel to a large proportion of the population, but are unlikely to be required indefinitely.')
