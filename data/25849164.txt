You don&#x27;t have to shell out for outsourced auth if you would consider a self-hosted solution. You also don&#x27;t need a team to run it.<p>I work for a large organization that incorporates multiple other businesses with millions of users under their own domains. After using Auth0 and other SaaS auth providers, we&#x27;ve settled on using Keycloak and are happy with it. Cost, security (you own all data) and extensibility were the driving factors.<p>+ If you have Java developers, you can extend its features via SPIs. Worked great for some custom authentication and migration flows we had to build for legacy systems.<p>+ It comes with batteries included: Install it, hook it up and for most cases you are done.<p>+ Redhat seems quite invested in it, so it has corporate backing. This could also be a bad thing, depending on your view of Redhat and which direction they take the product.<p>- It is a big pile of java. Since it works so well, even in cluster mode and containerized, we&#x27;ve never had to dig into its internals. But it is still a big pile of java.
