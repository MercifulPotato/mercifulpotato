This is to say, I try to be aware of my assumptions, to be clear about the distinction over what I know and what I believe.  For myself, I am trying to uncover the truth of our experience in this life.<p>I think we will probably agree that there are all sorts of problems with science and the scientific process.  And that&#x27;s fine.  If should be about putting the best hypothesis forward, trying to edge closer to the truth.<p>But, the system we have cannot do that.  It is funded by corporate interests, that cannot in good faith to their shareholders, present information that may be to the benefit of mankind, if its not in their financial interests.  I think that&#x27;s pretty clear.<p>Given all that, it does rile me that there are so man science fan boys, that scoff at religion, while acting as if science has the answers.  As if they aren&#x27;t in a state of religious belief!  And that they feel they dismiss a piece of anecdotal experience from a real individual, as it wasn&#x27;t proper science!<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m sorry this wasn&#x27;t fun, nor eye-opening for you.  But at least it was real!')
