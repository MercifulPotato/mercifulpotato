Automated testing has saved me so much time.<p>If I don&#x27;t have tests and make a change, I have to manually go through a whole set of checks to make sure I didn&#x27;t break anything. If I have a test suite, it will tell me in 2 minutes if I broke anything.<p>The thing I&#x27;m working on at the moment has tests on the backend but not on the UI. I can definitely say the UI work is slower because of the lack of tests.')
