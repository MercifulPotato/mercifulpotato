I was heading with the educational view point but is still thrown to the educational side just the same. I ask how else do you move to production if you don&#x27;t take your educational work to the next level?<p>If I create a mature, well thought piece of encryption. There is no irresponsibly in wanting to use it in production. Yes, I should have it validated and if that validation comes back as something with no thought, buggy and disastrous then that would be irresponsible of me. And one could argue it&#x27;s irresponsible to run it without validation too. To which I would agree upon.<p>I still disbelieve that those who create something being told: &quot;you should not be allowed in production ever&quot; and only run &quot;battle-proven&quot; is the wrong approach. Create something, validate it and then run it.<p>Besides battle-proven systems had to be ran in production in the first place and that those battle-tested systems still have vulnerabilities themselves, ie: HeartBleed. Again which was immune with Mbed TLS&#x2F;PolarSSL that someone had reimplemented TLS. Validation is the key that&#x27;s required.<p>&quot;You should create your own implementation of TLS but you should should not run it in production as that would be irresponsible until you have validation&quot;. Not just to blanket &quot;you should t&quot; end of. Above is what should be passed to developers. If you feel your work is good enough, then pay the price for validation.<p>Besides what makes an expert if you don&#x27;t make it for yourself?')
