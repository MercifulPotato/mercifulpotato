Item(by='celrod', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602765015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24785844, text='Definitely.\nOnce the AVX512-IFMA instruction set becomes more common (only available on Intel 10nm CPUs so far), I may try a PCG with 104 bits of state.\nWanting SIMD rngs (separate generator per vector lane), PCG is hurt by 64-bit integer multiplication being on the slower side. AVX2 has to perform three 32 bit multiplications, while the AVX512 instruction has much lower throughput than the likes of a xor, shift, or floating point arithmetic. The new IFMA may change that.<p>My use cases are Monte Carlo, where &quot;passes statistical tests&quot; is probably all that&#x27;s needed for good results.\nMaybe I should just try an mcg.')
