Item(by='owenversteeg', descendants=None, kids=[25382738], score=None, time=1607660077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372846, text='If you didn&#x27;t read the article (you should, it&#x27;s a very short read), the answer is basically that an hour of your free time is worth $14&#x2F;hr according to the government and $19&#x2F;hr according to some economists doing experiments at Lyft. The economists of course see their study as groundbreaking and claim their value of time is &quot;significantly larger than what the U.S. government values people&#x27;s time at&quot;. But $19&#x2F;hr is only 35% more than $14&#x2F;hr, and they measured the value of people&#x27;s time in 9 US cities. Sounds to me like that&#x27;s simply because most numbers in US cities - salaries, cost of living etc - are at least 35% higher.<p>In any case, I think that number is very individual. For example, tons of people in America who make in the $7-15&#x2F;hr ish range spend hours of their time on &quot;beermoney&quot; tasks, which pay only a few dollars an hour. Is their time, then, worth the $2ish&#x2F;hr they make with beermoney tasks? Then you have the marginal value of time. Say you&#x27;re buying tickets to an event: you might spend, say, $8 to skip a 20 minute line, but you wouldn&#x27;t spend $50 to skip a 2 hour wait - that is, as the duration gets longer, your hourly rate gets lower. And of course people will often pay exorbitant amounts of money to save time in specific situations (you&#x27;re late for a date so you call a taxi, you&#x27;re late for a meeting so you take the high speed train etc.)<p>Personally, I have saved insane amounts of money by &quot;setting my rate low&quot;, so to speak, doing everything to save money from taking cheaper flights to building my own home (a boat.) Firstly, a penny saved is actually between 1.6-2 pennies earned after taxes and other benefits. Secondly, additional work has many hidden costs - commute, stress, time spent finding a job, etc etc - that mean your job costs a lot more time than the time you&#x27;re paid for. And finally, saving has a bit of a &quot;momentum&quot; behind it. Change your own oil and the first time might be difficult, but the third time will be easy, and oh hey, maybe I can change that light myself, and soon enough you&#x27;ll save tons of money over the life of your vehicle. Expensive habits, however, tend to build on each other: oh, you got an iPhone, those Airpods do go well with it, oh and the Apple watch would work great with the fitness app to track my health... and suddenly you&#x27;ve spent $2000 on unnecessary consumer electronics - which, to earn back, you&#x27;d need to make an additional ~$3200-$4000 of pre-tax, pre-benefit income!<p>I think a big problem is that people don&#x27;t really understand the &quot;cost&quot; of each additional dollar earned. For most people reading this, of each additional dollar of income, the amount you actually get after accounting for everything is somewhere between $0.48 and $0.60. Seriously! It&#x27;s not just your federal marginal tax rate, it&#x27;s many other things - state taxes, many forms of government benefits, reduced insurance rates below a certain income, you pay more for your kids&#x27; college, etc etc etc. And that $0.48-$0.60 is assuming you make a decent income (if you don&#x27;t make a decent income, or have kids, this number is even worse!) If anyone&#x27;s interested in this kind of thing, I would highly recommend the interactive page on benefits cliffs by the Atlanta Fed.')
