Since lockdown, I have spent a fair amount of money on exercise equipment for my home—dumbbells, elastic bands, and, especially, a cable crossover machine that cost a couple of thousand dollars. Even though I have no experience with rowing or rowing machines, your product is the sort of thing I might have considered buying last spring.<p>Here’s my initial, superficial reaction. The video on your site shows people using the machine not only for cardio but also for resistance training. But as near as I can tell, the resistance training is possible in only one direction: bicep curls but not tricep extensions, pulling for the back but not pushing for the chest. The shot of the man doing dips is not very convincing, as that move can be done perfectly well without your machine, and it can’t be done while looking at the screen.<p>I can imagine buying a cardio-only machine that doesn’t try to provide a strength workout. But your video also seems to promote the muscle-building elements while going only halfway. For me, at least, that is a bit of a turnoff.')
