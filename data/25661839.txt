There are so few of these kinds of people that they aren&#x27;t even really worth thinking about (note: I am one).<p>2) Local bikers who live near the unconnected portions. Usually the unconnected portions will be either in a) extremely rural areas, or b) extremely built-up areas. If it&#x27;s (a), then there naturally aren&#x27;t many bikers for that section anyway, since the population of the area will be low. And if it&#x27;s (b), there will be more bikers, but also there will generally be alternate routes that are bikeable if you can&#x27;t go on that exact route.<p>So, all in all, this project is nice regardless of whether it is fully connected.')
