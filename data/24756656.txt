Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=[24758025], score=None, time=1602522528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755551, text='Something I&#x27;ve long thought on is what types of people are attracted to the US police force. If you look at it economically, by what incentives are offered, it&#x27;s a bit disturbing:\n1) Power over others\n2) Chance to stop violence\n3) Little educational requirements\n4) Access to cool gear\n5) Immunity from law\n6) Ability to help or hurt weaker people\n7) Access to drugs, guns, etc...<p>The list goes on, but I really see two types of people drawn to these: those that seek to help, and those that seek power. The defenders, and the bullies. The saviors, and the criminals.<p>It&#x27;s naive to expect that one type makes it through much more often than the other (the &quot;a few bad apples&quot; analogy). If I were in organized crime, or a gang, or a neo-nazi, or just someone who was a sociopath, what better possible job is there than being a cop? Would it be that hard to fake it through whatever screenings they use (which can be NONE in some PDs) to weed out the bad actors? No. We must expect some large minority or even a majority of cops to fall into the class of bad actors.')
