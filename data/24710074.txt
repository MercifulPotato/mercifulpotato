Google doesn&#x27;t let you run java that was compiled for the JVM. They have an entirely different mechanism that is not the jvm for their java code to compile to.<p>All they did was port the language to a new compile target. When you port a language over you also port the standard library or at least the parts that you need. This is <i>standard</i> across the industry. <i>Every</i> language implementation does it. What Oracle is trying to say is that you need a license to do it and that is a dramatic change in the industry practice right now.<p>It&#x27;s also short sighted. If Oracle wins then you&#x27;ll need a license to implement java the language (as opposed to the JVM) anywhere. Short term Oracle get&#x27;s a pile of money. Long term everyone stops using Java. But then again if you are Oracle, with it&#x27;s current values, Java&#x27;s only real value is short term money gains. It&#x27;s hard to make money on a programming language the way Oracle prefers to operate so this may be the best they can do.')
