Sales is a skill that can be acquired, and you don&#x27;t have to be very good at it to get started. Learn the basics of business development and sales; try experimenting with different approaches. See what fits you best.<p>IMHO, I think the problem is &quot;getting projects from 0 to POC&#x2F;MVP state.&quot; These are projects that typically have an expiry. Either the MVP fails to validate its viability, or when it succeeds, the business will try to find someone who can commit full-time. It&#x27;s hard to find something in the middle. More often than not, consultants who position themselves here spend more time on finding new contracts than doing the work. Since once a contract is completed, there is little continuity to it. Aside from a small maintenance contract, which is not enough to keep the light on. Doing the work pays, searching for work does not.<p>Another problem is, you are in the space where you have to compete the most, and therefore &quot;building MVP&quot; contracts become a pricing competition. Competing with offshore dev shops on price is hard to do.<p>So, to sum up, in my humble opinion, you need to spend time upgrading business development and sales skills. Think about what unique skills you can offer that are less price competitive in the market and offer you a long-term contract. I hope this helps.')
