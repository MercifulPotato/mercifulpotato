This is likely because SelectableText came after Text and because of Flutter&#x27;s mobile background. Most mobile apps use non-selectable text, and so this ended up on Flutter developers&#x27; default path.<p>I personally expect this trend to continue, as in most desktop native apps text is not selectable either. In fact, in many web apps (those that are really _apps_, not just static web-sites) there&#x27;s lots on non-selectable text. Case in point, I just checked Gmail&#x27;s landing screen, and I failed to find a single piece of selectable text.')
