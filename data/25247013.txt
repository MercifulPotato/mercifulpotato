I&#x27;ve had to bring each of them in (the subaru, twice) for recalls that could have been fixed with OTA patches had the manufacturers been so prepared.<p>So I can&#x27;t sign onto your &quot;we aren&#x27;t inundated&quot; assertion.<p>Before I got rid of it in favor of the Subaru, my BMW had its key fob hacked, but the manufacturer opted not to recall it for a fix, in the US at least. I think similar models had gotten different treatment in Europe.<p>I could only speculate as to why the Tesla hack that&#x27;s fixable OTA gets so much more attention than these others that apply to larger numbers of cars, but I have no inside knowledge and have done no study that would make my speculation on that front any more reliable than yours.<p>Whatever the reason is, it&#x27;s not because the hacks aren&#x27;t there, or because it takes something less than a recall to fix them. Why do you think it is?')
