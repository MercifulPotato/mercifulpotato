I mean, after lots of time consuming verifying of devices it kind of works. Except recently, all of a sudden, one of the people in our main chat room can not see the messages I sent from one of my devices. It tells him to get my keys from another session, he has only every used a single device&#x2F;session. There is no UI that either of us can find to help fix it. We can chat fine in a different encrypted room, or if I use a different device.<p>I&#x27;m not pulling anyone else into the Matrix ecosystem until encryption stops being just so god damn awful.')
