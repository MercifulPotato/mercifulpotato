I have not attempted to shame anyone. I simply let jwond know that they had used the wrong word, and as a courtesy, I let them know of the on-going rhetorical war.<p>Again, if I misused a word, I&#x27;d want to know. If my misuse was often used as insult (even if by others but not by me), I&#x27;d especially want to know.<p>This is no longer a productive conversation, so this is my final reply.')
