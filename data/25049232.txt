For example the Rocket docs are full of code examples on both the module and function level: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.rocket.rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.rocket.rs</a><p>I think there&#x27;s something to be said for javadoc, cargo doc, etc encouraging documentation to hew closely to the structure of the code as opposed to a free-form documentation system that can include multiple  pages about tasks, getting started, etc. But the vast majority of projects don&#x27;t bother to set that up, and the javadoc approach makes it very low friction to add docs to existing code that probably already has comments explaining how to use it.')
