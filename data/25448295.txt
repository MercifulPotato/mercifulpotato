Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[25448613, 25448417], score=None, time=1608151305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447830, text='I work with a <i>ton</i> of PDF&#x27;s between my Mac and iPad, and it <i>mostly</i> works but there are still just <i>way</i> too many bugs.<p>It&#x27;s a lot of little things, like in Catalina where opening up the sidebar for annotations (comments) seemingly randomized their order. (Big Sur, fortunately, fixed it to be page-order again.)<p>Or how printing a PDF from a website (in Catalina, also seemingly fixed in Big Sur) would <i>look</i> right on the page... but if you copied and pasted the text from the PDF to somewhere else, something like 10% of the glyphs were scrambled (&quot;lik3 thZs&quot;), like some sort of character table corruption.<p>Or reading a PDF with Books on my iPad, maybe 10% of the time bookmarking a page... doesn&#x27;t bookmark it. Or removing a bookmark... doesn&#x27;t remove it. Or a handful of highlights you just made have inexplicably disappeared the next time you open the file.<p>Or whenever you open the PDF in Books it remembers which page you were on. Except <i>sometimes</i> it doesn&#x27;t, so you can&#x27;t really rely on that for saving your place.<p>Or in Books, if you select some text to copy but accidentally hit the adjacent &quot;select all&quot; in the pop-up menu, and you&#x27;re dealing with a 400-page PDF, it just locks up and you have to restart it.<p>Or in Preview if you want to convert a PDF to black-and-white, there&#x27;s an option for it but your PDF will balloon in filesize to 10x larger or something.<p>I mean, I could go on and on. It&#x27;s weird, because Preview is an <i>incredible</i> app, really. But it really is like they build it and then never bother to test if basic workflows reliably work.')
