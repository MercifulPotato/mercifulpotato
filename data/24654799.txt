It&#x27;s meant to be exclusively accessed in situations like a person being admitted to the ER when unconscious. There is similarly an HIV database for the same reason.<p>Fluid transmissions happen easily in hospitals. Accidents happen. They aim to be as aware as possible so the incidental nurse tapping a vein doesn&#x27;t also have to live (or die) with HIV, or in this case, catch and spread COVID-19 because of a lack of situational awareness that can&#x27;t possible be gleaned by looking or sometimes even speaking to someone.<p>The problem here was there was little to no governance around the database and clearly there needed to be more. There need to be an avenue for justice for an abuse as well.<p>And more personally, I&#x27;d appreciate it being more even-handed. I don&#x27;t believe nurses have to disclose if they have HIV presently to their workplace or patients which is troubling to me because I&#x27;ve had a personal scare in a situation involving something related.')
