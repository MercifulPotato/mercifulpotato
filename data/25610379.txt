Item(by='amyjess', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609561559, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25608381, text='There are a number of these ghost kitchens in my area available on Uber Eats, some of which are pretty good.<p>Some of the best Nashville hot chicken I&#x27;ve ever had has been delivered from a place simply titled &quot;Nashville Hot Chicken Shack&quot;. Googling them, I couldn&#x27;t find anything about them. Not even putting in the street address gives me anything. But I did find out the address belonged to another restaurant, which let me realize that they were a ghost kitchen using that restaurant&#x27;s kitchen facilities. And then I noticed in the app that the restaurant&#x27;s name was mentioned in small print, which finally confirmed it.')
