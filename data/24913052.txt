Have had a very successful 15 year career until this last iteration of job seeking. In all this time I never bothered learning the grab bag of tricks for mathematically optimizing recursive algorithms because it never came up in the many thousands of lines of codes I&#x27;ve written or code reviewed. I&#x27;ve learned many other hard problems and I can usually run circles around all the super smart new grads with their memorized algorithms, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter now.')
