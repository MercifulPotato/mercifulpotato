I&#x27;ve also had two terrible experiences with Stripe&#x27;s developer support (and my co-founder has has one of his own).<p>I tweeted about it and @mentioned Patrick Collison back in May[1].  I was bloody impressed that he replied[2].  I shared my experience w&#x2F; him over email.  Didn&#x27;t hear back (didn&#x27;t expect to) and not sure anything got fixed.<p>At least they&#x27;re listening.  Stripe was great because it was no-nonsense and heavily focused on a great developer experience. That focus sadly seems like it&#x27;s in decline.<p>1- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kareem&#x2F;status&#x2F;1243540147775451136" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kareem&#x2F;status&#x2F;1243540147775451136</a><p>2- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropboxusercontent.com&#x2F;s%2Fjvjl1m808lx8a8t%2FPatrick%2520Collison%2520%2520Twitter%25202020-12-17%252012-19-40.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.dropboxusercontent.com&#x2F;s%2Fjvjl1m808lx8a8t%2FPatr...</a>')
