That means more people and tax revenue to solve problems. There are plenty of very dense areas around the world run just fine. This is a failure of policy not population. If people are such a problem then maybe tax-paying law-abiding citizens should be prioritized over illegal immigration.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;If ALL you care about is a big house and taxes, then CA is probably not for you... you may realize why CA is so crowded.&quot;</i><p>Who said that? Your dismissive and defensive attitude along with blaming completely irrelevant details like population is the reason why CA and its voting populace is in the state that it&#x27;s in.<p>Please list what has gotten better in CA over the last 10 years or I&#x27;ll assume you have no argument.')
