Pure and simple. Why would you think for one second that it would be anything different? You want to use&#x2F;live in the FB environment, you play by their rules. That means using their SDK in all of your things deployed via their environment.<p>So in this case, it&#x27;s good for the goose but not the gander when FB slaps terms on their platform, but not when Apple does it on theirs.
