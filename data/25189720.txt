[1,2] UP Squared also looked pretty interesting, if a bit anemic. [3] LattePanda&#x27;s have some nice engineering but you pay for it. [4] I hadn&#x27;t heard of the Rock Pi X before but it seems like a neat possibility... so yeah, thats a quick version of it. I am pretty sure I had settled on the UDOO&#x27;s but need to revisit my logic, especially after seeing the nice cooling and form factor stuff on the LattePandas. I worked with a few industrial fanless pc&#x27;s in the past I was also thinking about but those are a bit out of scope of discussion I suppose.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.udoo.org&#x2F;udoo-x86-ii-ultra.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.udoo.org&#x2F;udoo-x86-ii-ultra.html</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.udoo.org&#x2F;udoo-bolt-v8.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.udoo.org&#x2F;udoo-bolt-v8.html</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;up-shop.org&#x2F;up-squared-series.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;up-shop.org&#x2F;up-squared-series.html</a><p>4. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lattepanda.com&#x2F;products" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lattepanda.com&#x2F;products</a>')
