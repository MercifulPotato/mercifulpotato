I switched to MacOS because it&#x27;s fundamentally BSD with a nice&#x2F; well integrated GUI. Almost all of the good OSS I love is supported nearly perfectly.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m a bit jaded after running into too much bullshit trying to get Linux running well on laptops in the 90s and 00s. Since I made the move I never wax nostalgic for the &quot;Good Ole Days&quot; of fighting for hours to get Wifi working properly.<p>Even assuming Apple released the specs so you could port Linux to M1, on top of the usual laptop driver issues around the trackpad, wifi drivers, and video drivers, you also have to deal with the Secure Enclave. Without that, you are stuck with either a non-encrypted drive or running drive encryption on the CPU which is likely going to kill many of the performance gains from using the Mac hardware. Likewise, without the Secure Enclave, you lose fingerprint auth.<p>Not anti-Linux by any means, but dropping Linux on the M1 isn&#x27;t going to get you the same performance or battery life by any means. You are far better just going with a laptop which was designed to be Linux friendly to start with.')
