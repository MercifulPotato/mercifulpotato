I talked to a lot of couples and some people have patience to teach and some don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s nice though that couples are close enough to correct each other and help each other out.<p>I had a friend learning French that was French teacher, and she gave up after two sessions, not having the patience.<p>Actually, I just started working on an app to help couples improve each other&#x27;s languages. You&#x27;re pretty fluent already, I wonder in what other capacity&#x27;s your girlfriend who is an English teacher helps you!')
