That includes building internal business applications from the ground up (GUI, backend API, and server setup), CLI&#x27;s, and web sites.<p>I have a background in graphic design (10+ years), which tends to give me a leg up in GUI development. Not a leetcode wizard by any means, but have been brushing up on my algorithms.<p>Interested in full time positions. Not afraid to hop into new technologies.')
