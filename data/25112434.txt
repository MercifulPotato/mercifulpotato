Item(by='leto_ii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605538948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110680, text='&gt; Books are a classic thing that should just be digitized and the originals sold off.<p>&gt; The value is in the content, not the paper and ink.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t this logic apply to e.g. paintings as well? Or even sculpture and various historical artifacts...<p>Edit:<p>I was asking the question rhetorically, to highlight the weakness of the original observation. Personally I do think there can be intrinsic historical value in the object of a book, regardless of the information that it happens to store.')
