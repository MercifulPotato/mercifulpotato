Sometimes there are too many interruptions, other times we forget to take breaks.<p>A lot of engineers I know do their best work when using a timer (Pomodoro Technique) combined with some kind of music. But over time, fiddling with timers and playlists can become repetitive.<p>So I created a simple work companion app that does two things:<p>1. Reminds you to take breaks (and keeps track of time so you don&#x27;t get distracted)\n2. Streams music that helps with concentration when the timer is on<p>This product could also help writers, visual designers and students.<p>My vision is to gamify productivity to help makers be more productive in a healthy way. Users would have a productivity score that improves based on consistency.<p>I’d be grateful if I could get feedback on the app (available on App Store and Google Play). In particular, I’d love to know if this has added any value to you at all.<p>PS: I was inspired to do this a long time ago by Paul Graham’s essay “Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule” but only got around to doing it now. Thanks Paul!<p>Link to PG’s essay: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;makersschedule.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;makersschedule.html</a>')
