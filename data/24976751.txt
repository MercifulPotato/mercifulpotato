Item(by='tdeck', descendants=None, kids=[24977402], score=None, time=1604382447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976703, text='I sold an Apple IIgs that had a monitor in one of the photos to show it worked, but clearly explained that the monitor wasn&#x27;t included in the first paragraph of the listing. Someone bid and then emailed me asking me to cancel their bid because they didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t include the monitor, having taken a closer look. THEN the next highest bidder won, and after winning they must have bothered to read the listing because they emailed and canceled theirs as well.<p>I&#x27;m not used to selling on eBay and was shocked that people are so careless. Apparently even for unusual vintage items they just glance at the photo and then bid.')
