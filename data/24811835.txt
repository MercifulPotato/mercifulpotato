Why can we not require companies to design their products differently?<p>I&#x27;m sure car manufacturers would love to exclude all those pesky expensive safety features from their new cars, but they&#x27;re not allowed to do that. We&#x27;ve required them to design parts of their product in specific ways.<p>Or how about airplanes? Boeing sure seems enthusiastic to get rid of safety features on their airplanes, should we really allow them to do so?<p>Or how about the phone you might have in your pocket? It talks to a cell tower right? We&#x27;ve restricted the designs of the radios in the phones and cell towers such that they don&#x27;t emit more EM than a set limit. Surely Verizon could get much better coverage if they just crank up their signal, drowning out everyone else?<p>Point is, we regularly and consistently restrict how manufacturers can design, manufacture and eventually operate  various goods. Why should Apple get a pass?')
