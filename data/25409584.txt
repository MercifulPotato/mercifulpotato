In particular, it is easy to dismiss someone who proposes horrible solutions to problems. Just realize, the problem may be very real, even if their proposed solution is horrifying.<p>On top of that, people will propose straight up mad solutions, if they feel nobody cares about their problems.<p>Just recognize that we are talking about two very different things here; bullshitting and being &quot;wrong&quot;. And they need to be handled differently.')
