Censoring something important without knowing whether it&#x27;s true or not is pretty worrisome. If it does turn out to be true then it&#x27;s much worse. If it turns out to be false, the censor got lucky or knows something we don&#x27;t.<p>One thing I&#x27;m wondering is how can they censor it without getting either some evidence that it&#x27;s fake or at least a clear denial? (Biden&#x27;s campaign released a statement refuting it, but that&#x27;s not the same as Biden himself publicly denying the claims.)<p>Thin evidence (someone found some damaging-looking emails) can be dismissed with thin counter-evidence (a denial). But it can&#x27;t be dismissed with <i>nothing</i>.')
