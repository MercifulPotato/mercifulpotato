Period.  End of story.<p>Having a US based company with fabrication facilities on US soil is vital to national security and will be for the entirety of my lifetime and likely my grandchildren&#x27;s lifetime (if I ever have any).  For all the bluster of the investors wanting to chop Intel up: they will find a swift and full rejection from the government unless their plan includes selling the assets to another US firm.<p>TSMC building a fab in the US won&#x27;t be &quot;good enough&quot; - the US military will not allow the security of our country to be in the hands of a foreign corporation.<p>Now whether Intel remains a dominant player?  Who knows, but they aren&#x27;t going anywhere.  I wouldn&#x27;t be even a little bit surprised if for instance the 3-letter agencies cloud contracts suddenly included a clause that all of their infrastructure must run on Intel CPUs.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s fair, but I don&#x27;t see any other outcome.')
