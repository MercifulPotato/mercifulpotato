Item(by='dmurray', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603063760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24821015, text='&gt; I&#x27;m sure I fall victim to this when reading outside my expertise as well, i.e. when reading about genetics stuff or quantum computing.<p>I try to avoid this by focusing on the content, not who the researchers are. If they can do some cool new thing with mosquito genetics, now I know that. I don&#x27;t need to know whether the specific paper being hyped is novel or whether 95% of the content was proved by someone else: that&#x27;s a task for the Nobel committee and I wouldn&#x27;t recognise the researchers&#x27; names again anyway.')
