Two things make me uneasy with it: lack of perfect information; and the power of disinformation.<p>That is, &quot;unpopular&quot; and &quot;someone said something people didn&#x27;t like&quot; can&#x27;t be taken for granted.  A small vocal minority, especially one skilled with social media, can make something appear more unpopular than it actually is.  And few people are equipped to gauge what the reality is (accurate polling, eg, can be problematic even for those with large resources, let alone a small business owner).<p>It is easy, then, to force the employer to make a decision about a risk they cannot gauge accurately, and which is made to appear much larger than they would view it if they knew the true average opinions of their customers.  Couple this with most people&#x27;s natural risk aversion, and you have a genuine problem that you can&#x27;t write off as &quot;well, employers are just finally being forced to respond to the will of the people.&quot;')
