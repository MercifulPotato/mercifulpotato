Not explained nor backed up, and not easy to verify (unlike other points).<p>I did find a PEW Research article [1] that stated Hispanics made up 13% of democratic voters circa 2019, a growing metric (10% in 2012, 11% in 2004, 5% in 1996). Versus Replublican which was 7% in 2019. But I&#x27;m not sure how to interpret these (and what other context may be necessary).<p>It did illustrate Dems rather greater reliance on non-white voters, so if they lost many to Trump, that would at least support the general direction of the statement.<p>The Spectator article also states that in 2020 Trump grew his support among Hispanics by &quot;two-thirds&quot;, but from what? Presumably 2016, but what was that number? From the PEW article it could perhaps be inferred to be 6%, meaning it would be 10% for 2020, a significant jump toward near parity with the Democrats, a trend which might well engender some of the requisite puzzlement.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;what-the-2020-electorate-looks-like-by-party-race-and-ethnicity-age-education-and-religion&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;26&#x2F;what-the-20...</a>')
