Let me address intent first, then risk.<p>I would argue that intent might be relevant when assigning legal consequences, but not when assessing the damage caused.  If I catch a case of COVID, I’m not somehow less likely to die or suffer long-term effects because the person who gave it to me didn&#x27;t intend to do so.  Nor can I pay my hospital bills with their good intentions.  And if they engaged in reckless behavior such as attending super-spreader events or failing to wear a mask, I have to question how good their intentions were in the first place.  It sounds like the drunk driver who says “But I didn’t <i>intend</i> to run over that pedestrian”.  Maybe not, but their gross negligence allowed it to happen.<p>Now for risk.  I agree that we can’t eliminate risk from our lives entirely.  But I hope that&#x27;s not the litmus test for whether to take any prevention steps at all, especially if the cost of taking those steps is minimal.  Take your example of getting behind the wheel of a car.  It&#x27;s likely that sooner or later, if I drive long enough, I&#x27;ll get into <i>some</i> kind of accident, even if it&#x27;s just someone rear-ending my car.  I can&#x27;t prevent this entirely, but I can mitigate the risk by getting regular maintenance on my car (i.e. new brake pads so I don&#x27;t cause a fender-bender), refraining from driving drunk, keeping my auto insurance policy current so that I can pay out in the event I&#x27;m at-fault, etc.  Wearing a mask is the public-health equivalent of getting new brake pads.  It won&#x27;t eliminate the risk of spreading COVID entirely, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to throw my hands up and admit defeat.<p>I would further argue that people are less-than-great judges of just how big a risk vector they are, because of the delay between when someone catches COVID and when they present symptoms.  I&#x27;ve heard it can be up to two weeks, during which time that person is unknowingly exposing others.  Because of this, and given the potential life-or-death consequences of catching COVID, it seems insane not to err on the side of caution.')
