If you give me contact details, I can share a few bits.<p>Downsides:<p>* When you screw up, you can lose Internet connectivity.<p>* When you screw up, you can lose access to your router. I mitigate this by securing exposing the router on the Internet, and then using 4G to SSH to the router.<p>* It took a while for me to figure out how to get a decent IPv6 setup.<p>* NixOS specific: if you find some config on StackOverflow (eg) it takes a bit of time to figure out how to fit that into NixOS.<p>The result is great though:<p>* this router has been through 2-3 major upgrades, and it just works.<p>* NixOS is modern&#x2F;popular enough that it has had wireguard&#x2F;corerad packaged for a while.<p>* I have confidence my router is actually behaving according to its config, because NixOS does a great job of that. This allows me to easily rebuild, which is useful if I experiment with something but give up: revert code, then deploy and the router is back to its previous state.')
