Item(by='wl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610486279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753316, text='&gt; Did materials influence the style of script?<p>Absolutely. Cuneiform arose because the Mesopotamians had clay. It started out as stuff scratched in clay. Someone realized it was easier and faster to press a triangular stylus into clay and write with wedges. You would have never got cuneiform if the Mesopotamians used papyrus and ink. But I think you&#x27;re seeing something else.<p>Look at Egyptian hieroglyphs and compare them to Egyptian hieratic. Both writing systems were invented more or less simultaneously. Hieroglyphs were usually used in monumental or formal contexts, being carved or painted on objects or walls. But it was also written on papyrus. There&#x27;s tons of detail and it took a lot of time to write. Hieratic was a simplified form that could be quickly written on papyrus with a reed pen or brush. You&#x27;ve got a script writing&#x2F;cursive writing distinction.<p>When you&#x27;re looking at the green group, I think you&#x27;re mostly seeing a cursive&#x2F;script writing distinction rather than something arising from a difference in materials. Some scripts lost one style or the other.')
