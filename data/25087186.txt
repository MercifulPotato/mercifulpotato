Now my question is whether there&#x27;s some sort of standard for what&#x27;s in Calc 1, 2, 3...<p>I&#x27;ve seen a number of people on the internet refer to them, but it doesn&#x27;t seem clear to me what the numbers mean. Wouldn&#x27;t this be different depending on where you were? And yet people talk casually about the numbers instead of the topics (first order diff eqs).<p>I&#x27;m European, did my degree in the UK, and never came across any standardized numbering.')
