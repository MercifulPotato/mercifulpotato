Marketing did too good a job. I didn&#x27;t watch much of the hype just a few trailer videos, and it&#x27;s meeting my expectations. But I imagine someone who was really into the hype might feel its not up to what was promised.<p>I like it. The world visually is like nothing else I&#x27;ve seen. Absolutely amazing. Missions are entertaining. Fighting isn&#x27;t that good but hey. Few bugs of floating things in the air, but I can live with that. And they&#x27;ll prob be fixed in a few weeks.')
