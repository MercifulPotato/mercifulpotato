Item(by='xiphias2', descendants=None, kids=[25517578, 25517380], score=None, time=1608729042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25517103, text='&gt; Why do you think the toilet issue you described is a problem that needs to be fixed?<p>Because this way Google was effectively paying me loads of money to just go through 7 floors of bathrooms to find an empty one when I needed to use it. It&#x27;s a waste of corporate resources to use a human resource&#x27;s time like this. At the end the solution for me was just using the disabled toilet, as we didn&#x27;t have disabled people on the floor at all.<p>One solution would be to just build more sitting toilets instead of the standing ones, as those ones weren&#x27;t used as much. But on 1 floor there were 2 bathrooms for women and 2 for men, so yes, repurposing some would have helped.')
