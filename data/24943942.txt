I have to update my surveillence program design. Pretty sure they’re able to track me, and do. I’m a vocal activist against their data collection, have approached them and taken photos to make the drivers uncomfortable and tweeted about marking them with red paintballs to indicate recording (goal: make them signal their collection activity).<p>Literally every day I am greeted by patterns of Waymo vans, like 2 the moment I leave and at the majoroty of my destinations one+ buzzes me. They box me in at stoplights, park at my destinations. I know it sounds crazy, but a pretty simple program with a few compartmentalized functions would enable the legal team to feed my phone carrier loction stream into the dispatching system; could also be an element of prediction as well. None of the drivers or engineers would know what they’re building. The end result would be a surveillance system that can follow targets. The diagram is just pencilled on paper, but I’ve been deep enough in Silicon Valley to say it’s plausible. I also made a short story on SoundCloud, same handle.<p>What’s the economic value of this data? An element of my message is also that they’re profiting off of homeless people who can’t opt out; eg. they could be targets for training a prediction system, since they will always be available and be in the same few locations. I want an opt-out function.<p>I’ve been meaning to fugure out how to CCPA request their data, with my photo, license plate, photos of my car and bike.<p>Lawyer in the house? Biz@harlanji.com')
