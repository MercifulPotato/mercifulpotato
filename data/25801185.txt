SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.3% homologue.<p>The default, as with literally every other of thousands of viruses, is that like all the others it is the product of zoonosis.<p>For most viruses too, the exact intermediate animal hosts aren&#x27;t precisely known.<p>It&#x27;s really akin to find a new species of bird and trying asking for evidence that it specifically came from evolution and not genetic engineering. Sure, it&#x27;s possible that it didn&#x27;t, but every single other species of bird came from it and it&#x27;s fully expected to happen.<p>And by the way, the exact intermediate host for the original SARS was also never determined conclusively until fifteen years after the first outbreak.')
