For example, you could go door to door in your apartment complex and offer to take people&#x27;s trash out to the dumpster. You could offer to clean their house, wash their dishes, do their laundry, walk their dogs, whatever. Mow people&#x27;s lawns, weed their flowers, whatever.<p>If you are trustworthy and reliable and even slightly entrepreneurial, you will have more work than you know what to do with. It might not pay well (or hardly at all) at first, but it will build over time.<p>But instead, these losers are sitting at home watching anime and listening to K-Pop and moaning about how they missed their window of opportunity, while they live off their parents for years.<p>Gimme a friggin break.<p>I could definitely see this as being an issue with culture and depression, though. If the culture represses and shames entrepreneurs or people doing menial labor, for example, that would be a big issue. And if you are depressed, it&#x27;s hard to find motivation to get out there and work and be rejected by all of the people who turn you down as you go door to door.')
