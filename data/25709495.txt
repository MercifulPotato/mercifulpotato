The tech giants are booting Parler off their platforms because it&#x27;s unprofitable. Imagine being Apple and choosing to keep Parler&#x27;s app online when Amazon has booted them off. Or vice versa. You don&#x27;t want to be the &quot;last man standing&quot; and subject to, effectively, a boycott of your services, or at the very least a bunch of terrible PR.')
