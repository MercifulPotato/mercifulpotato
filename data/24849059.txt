Item(by='gridlockd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603295891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848980, text='&gt; This is just pushing testing to the customer.<p>Correct.<p>&gt; Why would the customer report a bug instead of switching to a less buggy product?<p>All products are buggy to varying degrees. As a user, you can&#x27;t easily tell if another product is &quot;less buggy&quot;. Would you risk investing time into figuring out another program that may turn out just as buggy? No. You most likely move on with your life.<p>Once users are invested into your product, it takes a lot to make them switch. Every single piece of software that I use regularly is either extremely simple or somewhat buggy. I haven&#x27;t switched once because of it. It&#x27;s a nuisance, but not a dealbreaker.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that I <i>like</i> this situation, of course I would prefer software that doesn&#x27;t have bugs and glitches, but I also prefer software that exists today, not tomorrow.\nThe market has spoken: worse is better.<p>&gt; Why do you think the customers are going to report bugs?<p>If it&#x27;s an important bug, <i>somebody</i> will most likely report it. If it&#x27;s <i>not</i> an important bug, not having it reported is most likely not important either.<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve ever attempted to report a bug on an iPhone app, Windows, etc. It&#x27;s like yelling at the wind.<p>So, did you switch to Android or Linux&#x2F;MacOS then? Is the grass really greener on the other side?')
