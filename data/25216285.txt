Soon after this, they&#x27;re pinging myself and other team leads on slack whenever X field is filled out on JIRA and demanding justification. Eventually because of this harassment I just stop filling out the field, leaving it as the default value and just verbally communicating the fact to whomever needed to know. Later on I find out that I wasn&#x27;t the only one that took this route,And guess what happened next! The scrum master is promoted to a management position, in part due to their stellar KPIs! Excellent work all around!')
