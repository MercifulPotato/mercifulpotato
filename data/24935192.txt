Item(by='flixic', descendants=None, kids=[24935399, 24938114], score=None, time=1604002447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24932538, text='&quot;Free&quot; is the worst pricing of all.<p>Open-source is great. One time purchase price is great for products that don&#x27;t require maintenance. Subscription pricing is perfectly valid for online services that are not open-source.<p>Free? Free is the worst. I don&#x27;t get any trust that the service will stay around, it can completely change along the way to &quot;paid&quot;, and I don&#x27;t get to keep anything in that case.')
