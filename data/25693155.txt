Would you rather ban a vindictive US president or an outgoing, lame duck US president in his final days of office? Besides, regardless of how you feel about him, he&#x27;s one of the main reasons Twitter is still relevant today. If they banned him sooner, they would have lost a ton of traffic.<p>To be clear, I am not for or against Twitter. I&#x27;m just making sense of their rationale.')
