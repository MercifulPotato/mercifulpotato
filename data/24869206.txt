But we knew that there would be particles associated to electroweak symmetry breaking at TeV scale because of a unitarity bound, among other reasons (as happens with this particular kind of dark matter at 100 TeV that Sabine dishonestly calls &quot;weasel words&quot;).<p>Something had to happen at that scale, the Higgs wasn&#x27;t guaranteed. Sabine gets experimental physics backwards because no one planned the LHC to confirm the Higgs, but to know whether the Higgs existed and if it didn&#x27;t what did instead. My money was mostly on it not showing up; many physicists were convinced it wouldn&#x27;t, then it was there but we couldn&#x27;t know beforehand.<p>There&#x27;s a scientific case for making precision measurements of it, as was done with the electroweak bosons for very good reasons that she dismisses without showing any kind of understanding about the research she wants to shut off.')
