You are supposed to have good jobs and savings and be secure. In previous generation, at least based what older relatives told about, there was pressure to marry, full stop.<p>Also, in even older generation, marriage was needed for financial security of the woman - the pay gap was large even when she worked and had good job for a woman. So women were under financial pressure to marry in addition to social one.<p>Plus, unmarried males were seen as immature or irresponsible. A guy was more likely to get pay raise or promotion explicitly with the &quot;he needs money to feed family&quot; thinking. So guys were motivate to marry because of subtle and not-so-subtle discrimination.')
