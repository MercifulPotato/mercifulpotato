Being sick for a few days won&#x27;t cause that. At that level grades are mostly just feedback to the parents.<p>As a parent, if my 4th or 6th grader got a lower grade due to missing homework as a result of being sick, it wouldn&#x27;t concern me.<p>In high school it starts to matter more due to grades being a component of college admissions, but unless you&#x27;re targeting really elite schools a couple of days of missed work isn&#x27;t going to move the needle much. And if you are targeting elite schools, you&#x27;re already working very hard and including a lot of AP courses and extracuricular activities and you will just buckle down and make up the work.')
