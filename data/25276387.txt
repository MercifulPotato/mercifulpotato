So under those laws, promoting to a king or a piece of the other color would have been legal.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read though, this sounds like it was sloppy wording, and the normal promotion rules we are familiar with today were actually intended, except for the option of remaining a pawn, which was obviously intentional since it is explicitly called out, and was actually the controversial part of that rule.')
