Looking at Kellys argument you could say the same thing “it has a will” about evolution ...but evolution certainly has no will, it just has probabilities and fitness of certain variants for certain environments. The same thing is true about technology there is a certain fitness of a solution for the environment and that environment is based on technological, market and societal “fitness”. Speaking about agency like Kevin Kelly does makes no sense in that context.')
