I did little to none between ‘04 and last year, when I moved off grid and got back into “gear” while installing a PV system, and got the first RPi all of six months ago because my NAS wasn’t up to running openhab - and haven’t looked back. The arduino stuff has been “buy the bits and put them together”, although some of the bits have been a bare PCB and a bunch of components. So far it’s almost paint by numbers, to be honest - I’m combining things in a somewhat novel way, but the components are all existing solutions to one degree or another.')
