That right there is a massive red flag. If this were legitimate traffic, that&#x27;d be enough reason to drop the vendor right then and there.<p>If this were HTTPS then it wouldn&#x27;t need the obfuscation to pass by undetected. And then there isn&#x27;t much you could do at that point to find it via traffic analysis, assuming the uncompromised app makes similar HTTPS connections, other than perhaps going deeper into traffic pattern analysis if you&#x27;re lucky.<p>Once the threat is identified some other way, it might be possible to develop blocking rules that work at the ciphertext layer (e.g. from packet size patterns exhibited only by the backdoor requests).')
