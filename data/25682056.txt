If the protests over the last year were mostly peaceful, then Jan 6 really was the most peaceful of them all. I was there, we had more then enough people to mount a serious insurrection. From what I could see, the members of the protest were used by some anarchist group to commit a BNE. Most, IE, 99.9% of the protestors were not involved in the BNE, and a significant portion of the protestors were fighting back against the anarchists.<p>The media is not telling the truth about what happened.')
