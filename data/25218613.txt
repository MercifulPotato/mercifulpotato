To the extent you shove something that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> random in as &quot;salt&quot; you don&#x27;t get the desired consequences.<p>And I think ISP hand out WiFi routers stopped having daft names like this a decade or more ago. The only AP SSIDs that aren&#x27;t partly random nonsense I see around here are my own (named &quot;Reformed Distributed Republic&quot;) and somebody&#x27;s FON router, the main ones I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere in my city are &quot;eduroam&quot; and &quot;govroam&quot; which are federated systems and so do not have a PSK - in all four cases you aren&#x27;t going to help yourself by calculating rainbow tables with those SSIDs.')
