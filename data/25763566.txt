But the hot question is: is Amazon the entity who should decide to shut it down?<p>I would personally prefer to have that decision be taken by a governmental agency or anything else managed by an elected person. Now, I&#x27;m not a US citizen, and I have zero trust in the current US administration, but in a &quot;normal&quot; context I would want to have at least some governmental overview of the shutdown process instead of delegating the full power to a private corporation.<p>Edit: In a &quot;Trump&quot; context, I really don&#x27;t know... Really sad to see this country dying slowly.')
