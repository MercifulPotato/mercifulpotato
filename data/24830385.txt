Who knows, depends on how the switch and device manufacturers interpreted the PCIe specs.<p>Software: there is no nice easy standard for connecting host-to-host (which I’m assuming is what one would want on a multinode system Like the one linked). There exists the idea of a PCIe non-transparent bridge, which if I recall correctly, allows CPUs on either side of it to do blind memory reads and writes to each other (hope your IOMMU is set up correctly to protect you from ugliness that could occur here).<p>Long story short there’s a reason PCIe is a local bus; it was never designed to do anything else. Anything else is largely a proprietary bolt on.')
