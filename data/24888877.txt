With Go, not only you had to put the code in a specific place in your home directory, but also every code written in Go you&#x27;d ever want to compile had to also be placed in that specific directory in a specific way, mixed with the code of other projects, instead of allowing you to place them separately in your personal projects directory hierarchy (which you already use with every other programming language).')
