I&#x27;m not sure there is anything I need to hear from these two. That&#x27;s not to say that polarization and disinformation being amplified due to social media bubbles isn&#x27;t a serious problem. Rather, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s up to these two to fix it, nor even understand it.<p>As a society we need to first understand the problem, then decide on what, if anything, we want to do to fix it. Fixes would most likely take the form of some sort of regulation.<p>E.g. something like where in Canada, some percentage of media has to be from a Canadian source. That law is very contentious in Canada, but you could imagine a similar law for any system that does content recommendation. E.g. some percentage of the content has to be sampled from the total body of content, and not come from the recommender. Something like this might address polarization, but disinformation is a thornier problem.<p>In any case, it needs to start first with understanding what is going wrong. Things like Mozilla&#x27;s media bubble study is a good start. From that we need to form policy. There is no role for CEO opinions in all of this.')
