Back in the day, we broke up AT&amp;T for precisely the reason that people didn&#x27;t have that freedom. And then we let them merge back together, for some reason.<p>I also think that not only is it legally permissible for Gmail to censor links, <i>they do so already</i>. Try reliably delivering a newsletter from a brand-new domain name (I have). Censorship isn&#x27;t any better when it&#x27;s the emergent effects of unknowable spam filtering and abuse algorithms than a decision by a human. (I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worse, because at least you can ask the human what they were thinking.) But the solution there is for consumers to stop using products that don&#x27;t do what they want, not for big government to tell companies how to implement technical systems.')
