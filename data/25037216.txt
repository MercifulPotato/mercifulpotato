Item(by='wlll', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604943187, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25034627, text='&gt; I would be outraged if I didn&#x27;t know what cookies were, but since I do, I think it&#x27;s entirely reasonable, any half modern browser provides a mechanism to allow or disallow, and otherwise manage cookiesâ€¦<p>Unfortunately that mechanism doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d much prefer that we abandon these idiotic &quot;we value your privacy&quot; nag-screens and bars<p>There&#x27;s an easy way of fixing this, and that&#x27;s to just not send the cookies. See basecamp.com or amazon.co.uk (from the UK). No cookie popups, and (respectively) 0 and 3 (seemingly essential) cookies.<p>&gt; let it be up to the browser and user settings.<p>That ship has sailed. You now require user consent before you set all but essential cookies <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr.eu&#x2F;cookies&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr.eu&#x2F;cookies&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; Even the smallest change to the Set-Cookie header could have made it trivial to implement a browser-side UI for this:<p>Set-Cookie: &lt;cookie-name&gt;=&lt;cookie-value&gt;; Max-Age=&lt;non-zero-digit&gt;; Description=&lt;LANGUAGE:User readable description,...&gt;; Importance=&lt;Required|Recommended|Noncritical&gt;<p>That ship has, as I said above, sailed.<p>&gt; If people don&#x27;t want cookies, they can disable them in their browser.<p>Ditto. But, seriously, do you know how ridiculous that argument sounds? Don&#x27;t like people speeding? Don&#x27;t drive! You are unlikely to be so thick to think that turning cookies off on a web browser will make the web anything other than completely unusable.<p>&gt; This is still one of the most idiotic laws the EU has made so far.<p>The butthurt from people about this is amazing. We&#x27;ve had companies playing fast and loose with our data for 20+ years and they had all this time to sort themselves out, and they didn&#x27;t. They kept on abusing the system to attempt to squeeze out ever more marginal gains from users personal data.<p>This is on them.')
