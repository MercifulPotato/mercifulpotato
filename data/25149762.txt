Item(by='bogwog', descendants=None, kids=[25151202], score=None, time=1605795960, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146276, text='&gt; Can we at least agree that this is 50% less bad. Or perhaps 25% less bad? 10%?<p>No, because as has been said many times already, it&#x27;s a deflection tactic. Focusing on whether 15% is less bad than 30% is a bad thing to do because it accomplishes exactly what Apple&#x27;s underhanded deflection tactic seeks to accomplish.<p>But if you really need that addressed, here&#x27;s a response to your very important question: no, 15% is not less bad than 30% because it means Apple makes less money, and if Apple makes less money they might have to abandon their fancy new M1 chips, and the pace of technological progress will once again fall into stagnation. Sure, small devs will make some more money, but those small devs aren&#x27;t giving the world shiny toys with rounded corners.<p>&gt; Ultimately the impression I get from posts like yours is some people just think whatever Apple does is bad regardless of how it affects others.<p>So if Apple releases a cure for cancer, you get the impression that I&#x27;ll think that&#x27;s bad? What is even the point of you writing this, is it an argument? Are you trying to passive-aggressively call me something negative? How does this even relate to the discussion?')
