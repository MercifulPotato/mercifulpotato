Fact checkers have given Clinton multiple “pants on fire” ratings for these claims:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2019&#x2F;sep&#x2F;19&#x2F;hillary-clinton&#x2F;hillary-clinton-wrong-again-wisconsin-voter-id&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2019&#x2F;sep&#x2F;19&#x2F;hillary-cl...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2019&#x2F;mar&#x2F;06&#x2F;hillary-clinton&#x2F;clinton-hot-seat-claim-thousands-were-turned-away-&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politifact.com&#x2F;factchecks&#x2F;2019&#x2F;mar&#x2F;06&#x2F;hillary-cl...</a><p>Based on the studies we have seen, complaining about Voter ID laws, like Clinton did about Wisconsin, is akin to complaining about mail in voting security:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2019&#x2F;2&#x2F;21&#x2F;18230009&#x2F;voter-id-laws-fraud-turnout-study-research" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2019&#x2F;2&#x2F;21&#x2F;18230009&#x2F;v...</a><p>&gt; The results: Voter ID laws do not seem to decrease turnout, even when the data is broken down by race. This held when the data was analyzed in different ways, like evaluating only the effect of stricter laws that require an ID with a photo.<p>Voter ID laws are also broadly popular, among whites and non-whites: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;194741&#x2F;four-five-americans-support-voter-laws-early-voting.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;194741&#x2F;four-five-americans-supp...</a><p>(81% of whites and 77% of non-whites support both early voting and voter ID. Funnily enough, “voter suppressed” states like Georgia and Texas have both. Georgia also had automatic voter registration, which non-whites strongly support, thanks to Brian Kemp.)')
