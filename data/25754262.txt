I get to decide who I think is a nazi and do what I want, _as a person_, and so do you. Of course I will try to convince you that I&#x27;m right, but if someone&#x27;s being a nazi and can&#x27;t be convinced that they&#x27;re saying nazi stuff and they get banned from society, that&#x27;s their problem, not society&#x27;s. They should have listened.<p>The point is that while free speech might be protected as a legal concept, it&#x27;s not protected as a personal concept. I espouse free speech, until someone really screws up and gets super evil, and then I don&#x27;t want them to talk anymore (especially not to rally people to their evil causes). I&#x27;m not a government. And that&#x27;s completely consistent with wanting a government&#x2F;overall society which defends free speech.<p>(also, you&#x27;re not doing your argument any favors by for some reason calling me a terrorist. it&#x27;s not even clear why you&#x27;re doing that)')
