I was there and when they asked if they could come in, I said &quot;No.&quot; There is no upside to allowing them in. &quot;We&#x27;ll answer any questions here&quot; I remember saying.<p>We didn&#x27;t have anything to hide, but you never know what law you may&#x27;ve broken. You never know what they may say and how you will react. The system sets up an adversarial relationship.<p>It would be in the best interest of law enforcement to play by the same rules as regular people.')
