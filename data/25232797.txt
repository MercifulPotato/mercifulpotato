Communication happens between the involved internal teams and the magic happens.<p>In the case of collaborations between separate companies, secrecy becomes a problem because inevitably, details that are held close and not communicated turn into stumbling blocks. For a collaboration between Nvidia and Microsoft for instance, the teams at Microsoft involved with the project would need the same level of access to Nvidia&#x27;s half as Nvidia&#x27;s employees do in order to be as effective as Apple&#x27;s internal teams have been. This isn&#x27;t impossible of course, but historically Nvidia is not inclined to do things like this.')
