Everything is modal and you can never predict the mode, multiple layers of controls are constantly popping and sliding over&#x2F;under eachother and there&#x27;s no tactical feedback that lets you know when you&#x27;re over the control you want. Screw touch crap I want my PDA keyboard back!<p>In a car it&#x27;s extra bad because now you have to look away from the road and position your hand in a bumpy car to adjust the temperature&#x2F;radio&#x2F;navigation. It&#x27;s so awful in my friends cars I dread the day I have to buy a new one.')
