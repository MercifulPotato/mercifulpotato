In particular, if a leaf PTE is modified but a subsuming SFENCE.VMA is not executed, either the old translation or the new translation will be used, but the choice is unpredictable. The behavior is otherwise well-defined.&quot;<p>This is not the &quot;particular&quot; case mentioned - essentially &quot;subsumed&quot; for satp is the entire space (you have to think of satp as simply being a non-leaf PTE)<p>To be fair I think that there&#x27;s issues in this area that may force a double pipe flush in some implementations')
