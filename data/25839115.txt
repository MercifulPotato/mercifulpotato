But this is fucking fascism. When you want to take your position and jam it down everyone&#x27;s throat and police how people can even talk.<p>Fuck this. Decentralize everything.<p><i>Edit</i>: I just re-read the article after skimming and now I feel completely different. The article title is really bad. Mozilla is just calling for more transparency into how advertisers and social media operates.<p>What a bad headline.<p>I hope Mozilla never treads into the censorship territory.<p>They can keep my money. :)')
