More features? Cyclomatic?<p>I&#x27;m not sure of any definition of complexity you could appeal to which makes my argument weak.<p>&gt;&gt;rewriting an established program from one language to another will always introduce more bugs than it fixes, and more severely the more complex the program is.<p>&gt;Should be obvious to anyone that this isn&#x27;t true.<p>The opposite is painfully obvious: (1) Writing code causes bugs. (2) Rewriting an established project involves writing more code than leaving it would. (3) Writing all of that new code will introduce new bugs which were not present in the original.')
