He would likely reject it himself.<p>The word &quot;avant-garde&quot; comes up not once in Philip Glass&#x27;s Wikipedia article [0]. The only uses of the word &quot;experimental&quot; are in reference to his early interest in experimental theater.<p>Philip Glass is easily the most popular, mainstream living music composer. His music is extremely &quot;listenable,&quot; and inoffensive to the casual listener. Calling him avant-garde is a complete disservice to what he has actually accomplished in his career. It&#x27;s more avant-garde to call Philip Glass avant-garde than his music is avant-garde.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Philip_Glass" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Philip_Glass</a>')
