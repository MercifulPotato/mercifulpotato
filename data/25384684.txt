Why wouldn&#x27;t this just be an opt in thing?<p>&quot;Oh cool, I&#x27;ll set a $1k cap, never gonna spend that on this little side proj.&quot; Fast forward a year, the side proj has turned in to a critical piece of the business but the person who set it up has left and no one remembered to turn of the spending cap. Busy christmas shopping period comes along, AWS shuts down the whole account because they go over the spending cap, 6hr outage during peak hours, $20k sales down the pan.<p>Of course it is technically the customers fault but it&#x27;s a shit experience. Accidentally spending $72k is also technically the customers fault and also a shit experience. I don&#x27;t think there is an easy solution to this problem.')
