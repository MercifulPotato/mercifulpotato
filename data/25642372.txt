If you believe in indenting from the left, and you have the typical wonky (to me) irregular and wonky line wrapping&#x2F;breaking rules, 80 columns frequently causes very weird pile-ups on the right margin.<p>I tend to champion both wider lines (120 or so, never rigidly any number) and much simpler and more regular principles for breaking and indentation.<p>Hope there aren’t too many codebases developing for x64 and ARM that need 1980s-era limitations on code!')
