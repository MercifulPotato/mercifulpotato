You repair the car and move on. Many will call the sheriff, but that is because if you report it you get a permit to eat the deer (otherwise it is poaching - the sheriff is supposed to make sure you aren&#x27;t intentionally hitting deer with your car).<p>If you hit a dog with your car it is the fault of the owner for not taking care of the dog.<p>I worry about children though, as we all know they are not as smart as they should be.')
