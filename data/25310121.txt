Their speech isn&#x27;t really muffled.  You were relying on reading their lips and didn&#x27;t know it.  I did some speech therapy when I was young to learn how to lip read and one of the things I was shown was how someone looking down, covering their face, or mumbling affected my ability to hear.  I was taught to ask others to not mumble or cover their mouth.  Not much of an option to ask people to not cover their mouth at the moment.<p>Closed captions help for tv&#x2F;movies.  Hearings aides help if you can stand to wear them.  Usually I talk louder myself to encourage people to speak up.  When I can&#x27;t hear someone I don&#x27;t hesitate to tell them I can&#x27;t hear them and that they need to speak louder and more clearly.<p>I&#x27;m not terribly concerned about masks affecting my ability to hear others.  I just ask them to speak up and politely point out that I am hearing impaired.  It is more difficult to understand people but I find that it is mostly low talkers&#x2F;mumblers who I would have struggled to hear mask or no mask.')
