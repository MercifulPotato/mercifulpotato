You&#x27;d still need to &quot;wait&quot; for 3+ years. I&#x27;ve never seen such a course myself, only heard some stories, so it may be an urban myth.<p>There definitely are universities that allow taking courses at your own pace. I&#x27;m currently doing Bachelor of CS at University of Wroclaw, designed as 3.5 year course, and there are people finishing it in 2.5 years (though that&#x27;s rare, it&#x27;s much more usual to see 3.5 years turning out not to be enough time). Sadly, offered only in Polish, and requires a lot of time and effort.')
