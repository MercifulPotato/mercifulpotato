Because everyone who&#x27;s worked at 111 eighth avenue knows what happens when big tech wants you out. There&#x27;s no lease for cloud infrastructure and I don&#x27;t know what collective psychosis made operations folks think that&#x27;s a good idea. Was Amazon even obliged to give them 24-hours on the eviction notice? That sounds like just enough time to make sure you have an offline copy of the database. It&#x27;s possible that Amazon could have been legally entitled to push a button that instantly deletes their ec2 virtual machines and then recalls their s3 glacier offsite tape backups for shredding too. So even if you do all the &quot;right things&quot; in the cloud it can all just be taken away in a day because Ro Khanna tweeted at your hosting provider. Western Union was destroyed for far less meddling and scheming than this and AT&amp;T rose to power on the explicit promise to not do basically everything the tech giants have done these past two days, so maybe we&#x27;ll see some disruption in the future.')
