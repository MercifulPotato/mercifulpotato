Someone has to plan these buildings, someone has to build them. It creates jobs in various sectors.<p>We should be glad that the Chinese view our countries as safe and want to invest into them.<p>The real problem is that our local governments are unable to adjust the supply to the demand. THAT drives up prices and nothing else.<p>&#x2F;edit: You could even make a law that foreigners can only invest into new construction which would make it impossible to invest without value creation for the local economy.')
