But since it&#x27;s a single-sign-on, I had to talk to Amazon staff, who were insisting that once you delete an account you cannot restore it, so there was no way for me to login to stop the services.<p>No matter how much I tried to make AWS understand that it doesn’t make sense for my services to still be up when I deleted my account, they wouldn’t have it. I don’t think I have dealt with such arrogant, bad customer support before.')
