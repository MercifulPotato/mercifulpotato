This means it can switch faster (smaller RC time constant) and less energy is expended in switching. Thus, going from generation to generation, the overall energy expenditure of a chip can be kept within a reasonable range despite adding many more transistors. You also may have heard of a &quot;die shrink&quot;, where an existing design gets shrunk to the next technology node, using less power and clocking faster.<p>Shrinking isn&#x27;t always a walk in the park though. Some nodes ago subthreshold leakage became a big problem until they figured out how to solve it.')
