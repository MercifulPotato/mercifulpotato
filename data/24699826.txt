COVID is actually showing this strongly. Freedom Trail and related powered a downtown that otherwise died since March.<p>Of course it&#x27;ll come back whenever it does, but the &quot;real culture&quot; of the areas that aren&#x27;t total millennial, college, or medical resident playgrounds is up in Cambridge &#x2F;Somerville.
