That is, you can inject claims from the Auth jwt into variables. This gives you a lot more flexibility than schema directives or a resolver middleware. This feature is unique to WunderGraph.<p>Next we&#x27;re able to execute the persisted query on the edge using etags for low latency.<p>WunderGraph adds the capability to use @stream &amp; @defer on top of any existing GraphQL or REST API. You don&#x27;t have to change anything on your existing GraphQL server. This works especially great with Apollo federation. WunderGraph is a replacement for Apollo gateway. We support federation with subscriptions, @defer and @stream, another unique feature to WunderGraph. The generated code gives you simple to use hooks, in case of react, to fetch data or streams.<p>Finally the generated code is authentication aware. WunderGraph has its own OIDC server. Generated clients know if authentication is required for a specific persisted query. This way a query will wait until the user authenticates and then fire off.<p>I think this should be enough. I don&#x27;t want to get too much into the details as there are a lot more benefits.')
