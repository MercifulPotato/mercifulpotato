Item(by='cforrester', descendants=None, kids=[25577455], score=None, time=1609282194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575849, text='&gt; What&#x27;s troubling to me is that people like you act like some kind of saviour for women yet you don&#x27;t appear to have ever spoken to or really, really listened to one of them.<p>Your choice of words is curious. Unless you yourself are something that women need to be protected from, nobody is trying to be a saviour here. I&#x27;m not overly concerned if you want to dismiss me as a white knight, since it&#x27;s not my own social abilities which are in question.<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t want to go to work. Who the hell would?<p>You won&#x27;t find much argument from me that the modern working environment is inhumane. If this is the root of your argument, you can drop the sexual angle entirely -- we all want fulfillment, no matter our sex. Patronizing women and dictating their social roles to them will not bring us any closer to achieving that as a species, nor will falling into the trap of trying to wrap human social behaviour up in a nice little bow with overly simplistic biological hypotheses.')
