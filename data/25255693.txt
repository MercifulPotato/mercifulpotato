I do not remember the syntax, but in each file it was like: %headermacro%  ...the content... %footer%. Then the macros were replaced by layout data, turning each file into a generated static page.<p>Then I realized that is the wrong way around. All the content files had the same macros. It is very redundant. So I wrote a new one, that did it the other way around. Now there was a layout file with placeholders {{$WRITEX content&#x2F;data}} and it would load the data from an XML content file and insert it in the layout file to generate the output file.  And it had loops and conditions. Afair I could even write my &quot;Makefile&quot; in that language.<p>Then I wrote a webscraper and implemented XPath 2, because nothing else supported that. Then XPath 2 is very close to XQuery, so I  implemented that as well. Now XQuery is very similar to the second generator, but with a w3 standarized syntax. The above insert expression simply becomes {content&#x2F;data}. So now I use the webscraper as site generator.')
