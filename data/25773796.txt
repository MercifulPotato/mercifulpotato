My case is a little different though. I realized the tickets database is a generic sqlite database you can use as you wish, but comes with a web server, syncing, and version control out of the box. It was simple to create a CGI app in my language of choice that gave me a web interface to my notes system but without having to implement my own authentication. If I want to work locally using Emacs, I can. If I want a full or partial backup in text format, it&#x27;s a regular sqlite dump of the tickets database.')
