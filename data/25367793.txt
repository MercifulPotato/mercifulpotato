I don&#x27;t really see this as a nanny state action, either. YouTube is not part of the state. From a libertarian point of view, shouldn&#x27;t they have the right to censor what they want on their own platform? Yes, politicians are urging YouTube to take down the videos, but the key word there is &quot;urging&quot;. They have no way to force them to take them down.')
