To get experience, make something on the side that gets you talking directly with users&#x2F;customers. It doesn’t need to be software - as long as you’re identifying the problem and iterating to create something they like&#x2F;use&#x2F;buy, that’s what’s important.<p>For a founder, this might be the most important skill. For an early-stage employee (say, after the first 5 or 10), it’s valuable but a lot less critical.')
