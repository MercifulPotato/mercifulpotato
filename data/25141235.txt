That said I was efficient&#x2F;focused during office hours, although more annoyed at stupid people than usual. As long as I was able to focus on my own work it was great.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say it had a positive effect overall. The effects lasts long enough that you can&#x27;t really take any more after early afternoon if you want proper sleep, and once the effects wear off, well, you want a drink...<p>Just my personal experience though.')
