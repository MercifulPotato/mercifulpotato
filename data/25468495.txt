If you aren&#x27;t paying for software, <i>it&#x27;s not written for your benefit</i>. If you enjoy ad-driven software, it is, at best a happy coincidence or altruism on the part of the developer.<p>What ad driven software has done is rob developers of good quality paid apps of the ability to charge a reasonable price for their goods. So we have a market place filled with mediocre to terrible ad supported apps. The few developers who do spend the time and effort make good quality software get constant complaints about pricing and charge more than $0.99 for software that actually does what people want.')
