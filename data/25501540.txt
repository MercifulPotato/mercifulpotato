One does not imply the other.<p>Our 401Ks are not amoral tools.  They provide necessary resources that companies use to grow.  A publicly traded company in our country should not be allowed to support oppression, genocide, exploitation, and other violations of human rights anywhere.  If we allow it, we are all complicit in crushing the lives of others.  We are culpable for their suffering.<p>&gt; In the field of modern business, so rich in opportunity for the exercise of man&#x27;s finest and most varied mental faculties and moral qualities, mere money-making cannot be regarded as the legitimate end. Neither can mere growth of bulk or power be admitted as a worthy ambition. Nor can a man nobly mindful of his serious responsibilities to society view business as a game; since with the conduct of business human happiness or misery is inextricably interwoven. -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis.  &quot;Business â€” The New Profession&quot;, La Follette&#x27;s Weekly Magazine, Volume 4, No. 47 (November 23, 1912), p. 7.<p>The right, just, moral, and American thing for Facebook to do is to treat Vietnamese people the same way they treat western people.  Ban people who abuse the reporting system.  Ban folks that dox others.  Push back against unreasonable government demands.  Provide comprehensive privacy features for vulnerable folks, with local-language instructions and how-to videos.  Facebook would quickly get banned in many places and the company would make less money.  This hasn&#x27;t happened yet because of the greed and callousness of Facebook&#x27;s leaders, the greed and cowardice of Facebook&#x27;s employees, and the U.S. doctrine of shareholder primacy.')
