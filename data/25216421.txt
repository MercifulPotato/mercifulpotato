This is a pretty clever &amp; general-purpose meta-algorithm that works for pretty much any problem where you have competing algorithms with different strengths.<p>Quitting and starting over as GGP mentioned is another option that also works for this problem, though it might not work as well for other problems where you can&#x27;t put a nice bound on the number of steps.<p>FWIW there&#x27;s also a very dumb (or smart I guess, depending on your point of view) solution, which is to just have 2 threads run simultaneously, and report the result of the first one. It might make sense for some problems. And in any case, this is basically equivalent to what you&#x27;re doing on 1 CPU with the previous technique.')
