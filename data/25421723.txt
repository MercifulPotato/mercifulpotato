The code is there already, the implementation is there already, they just require everyone in every other state to call in during tight hours if not absolutely forced to via regulation.<p>Blizzard&#x2F;EA: Call of Duty has an option to opt out of selling your personal information. This option is only visible to be modified at all (not disabled - just gone entirely) if you are on a CA IP. If you ever log in once from another machine or another location, it&#x27;s reset to retroactively sell all information and also not shown on the options menu.<p>Excessively heavy handed legal controls are needed because nobody can fucking behave.')
