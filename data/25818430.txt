At Google the &quot;people person&quot; was called your &quot;business partner.&quot; I like the notion that they are the inquisition though, that metaphor includes the adherence to dogma at the expense of common good.<p>There are also people who enjoy &quot;the game.&quot; That being the corporate politics of &quot;gotcha&quot; and &quot;praise&quot;.
