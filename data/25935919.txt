If the price goes up enough, your broker starts worrying that you won&#x27;t be able to buy the stock in future. They then might force you to buy now, which pushes the price up further. Hence the squeeze. (Source: learning about this for about a week, completely ignorant, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.)')
