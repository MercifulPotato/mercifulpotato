Leadership made a big deal about remaining peaceful. Things escalated most of the time when the _police_ instigated attacks. Given the racial tensions, and generally charged atmosphere I am absolutely not surprised rioting broke out. Lets remember that low-impact&#x2F;low-disruption protests had been done prior, and were not met with attention or change they were ignored and sidelined. Cripple peoples ability to be heard and they will use increasingly forceful methods to be heard. This is _not_ a case of protestors rocking up to a street and beating on random pedestrians - which didn&#x27;t happen and is the kind of &quot;violence in the streets&quot; I&#x27;m talking about. In my opinion some broken windows and torched stores are less important than peoples human rights - if in the course of a legitimate protest some shopfronts are destroyed, I don&#x27;t have an issue with this. I do have an issue with people using a protest (which went to lengths to remain peaceful) as a cover&#x2F;excuse to destroy things &quot;just because&quot; or to loot - this I absolutely condemn, as it does nobody any favours and takes away from the issue at hand.')
