People defend territory all the time. It&#x27;s very, very expensive to do that -- have a look at some city walls -- but it&#x27;s cost-effective because they are using the territory.<p>But no, no matter how large the group, they cannot buy cost-effective security for their giant stretch of wilderness if their plan for it is &quot;don&#x27;t use it&quot; and there are other people who do have a use for it. Compare American government efforts to stop people from using land to grow marijuana. Is the problem that the American government just isn&#x27;t big enough?')
