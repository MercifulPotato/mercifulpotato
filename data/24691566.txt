Author here.<p>What I meant is that there is no way to tell certain children to disregard the constraints of a container; if a parent is 800px wide, there isn&#x27;t a way to say &quot;keep this child in-flow, but fill the viewport&quot;.<p>The alternative you propose is problematic for a couple reasons:<p>- I don&#x27;t like &quot;reaching in&quot; to child elements. Especially in a component-focused architecture, it&#x27;s a quick way to make a mess. My solution DOES reach in to apply a grid column, but that property only makes sense within the context of a grid, so it doesn&#x27;t seem as problematic to me.<p>- the `ch` unit doesn&#x27;t work properly when applied individually to different elements; an `h1` with 65ch width is going to be much wider than a `p` with 65ch width. You need the width to be applied to the parent, so that it remains consistent<p>- It&#x27;s likely that you already have a constrained container, if you&#x27;re adapting this solution to a page that already exists. If so, your approach isn&#x27;t really workable without a major overhaul.<p>I&#x27;d also just add, the nice thing about using Grid is that it&#x27;s super extensible. If you want to add a sidebar, it&#x27;s quick and straightforward.')
