The guy who is shown in the twitter image is Brian Sierakowski (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;briansierakowski&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;briansierakowski&#x2F;</a>) who is in charge of running the &quot;Xenon Playbook&quot; for Baremetrics.<p>What Xenon does is acquire floundering &#x2F; stagnating &#x2F; doing ok SaaS companies from founders who want to sell. They buy the company with a structured acquisition (see above) and then they run their &quot;playbook&quot; to pump revenue and profits. Then they will sell the company for some multiple.<p>They will arbitrage their payments to the founder to make sure that cash flow works out. So, what you&#x27;re seeing here is the Xenon playbook in action: accelerate revenues, decrease churn, slow payables, all that. I wonder what else is in their playbook.<p>Xenon was itself acquired by a firm called DreamFactory which seems to have started the model in 2017 or 2018, and then took on the Xenon brand themselves to operate their SaaS Private Equity &#x2F; Hedge Fund model.<p>[1] HN discussion on the acquisition here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25045325" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25045325</a>')
