Do you then believe that it is responsible to willfully help spread it and blast it all over every social media site? Aren&#x27;t you doing the foreign nation&#x27;s bidding then?<p>If you do agree there, then where would you draw the line for blocking such information being spread? Is the fact that the reporter at the singular publication in all the the US willing to report on it didn&#x27;t want their name on it worry you? The fact that the only evidence comes from some random Trump supporting repairman in some random state not worry you? The fact that unreliable (self-exposing to 15yo) people such as Giuliani are attached to the story not worry you? What about our own intelligence services saying that foreign nations have been trying to use said person to manipulate our election?')
