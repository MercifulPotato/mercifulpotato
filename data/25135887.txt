That&#x27;s true, but misses the point.<p>Before NK had nuclear weapons one of their main deterrents was that they&#x27;d had years&#x2F;decades to fortify conventional artillery at the border pointed at Seul. So even if their military couldn&#x27;t stand a chance in a conventional war they could plausibly threaten MAD by holding Seul hostage.<p>That&#x27;s the context in which the border proximity is brought up. Replying to that by saying that Pyongyang is 150 km from the border or whatever is irrelevant.<p>Yes of course the US could win an all-out conventional war with an enemy 50, 150 or 1500 km from its border. That was never in question.<p>The question was whether a relatively weaker enemy could present an outsized threat due to some strategic geographic position.<p>That&#x27;s been the case with NK precisely because mid-century artillery technology can be dug-in close enough to the border to matter.<p>Whereas if the border happened to be 150 km away those assets could be taken out by missiles once they tried to move in position to shoot on a major target like Seul.<p>Whether the NK artillery actually poses a strategic threat is another matter. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s all mapped out be the US&#x2F;SK and would be taken out in the first 5 minutes of a conflict by targeted missile attacks.<p>But it&#x27;s not just a strategic question, but whether e.g. NK can make threats that are taken seriously by the SK population for it to pressure its government to make some concessions to NK.')
