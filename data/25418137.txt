The price, like you say will inch up slowly from 98 to 100. I can then sell this security at any point with very low but steady return. This is the hallmark of a low risk investment.<p>It&#x27;s true that if I hold the security until maturity, I could lose my investment. This, however, is easily offset by buying many such securities and recognizing that many will fail but some will succeed, giving me my expected return on average. In fact, I might even decide to buy many of these and repackage them into a basket of securities and split them up into many pieces and sell them off as low risk tranches.<p>Now, if you claim that all the outcomes are correlated (i.e. there&#x27;s only one pair of dice that is tossed once), then the price you&#x27;re talking about ($98) is absolutely not the price it would trade for because of the inherent risk associated with the asset. Instead it would trade at a much lower price. Just imagine that you were given the option of buying this asset for $98 or something like a US bond for $98, both of which will yield $100 at maturity in expectation. Which one would you choose?')
