I guess this happens because Rust has received a lot of attention and promotion, enough to make some people consider it, where otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have thought of using tools that stand at a lower level than what is most appropriate for their needs (or knowledge).<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve now read that in this particular case, the parent commenter is consciously playing with different languages to learn about them. Still, I think it would be a misconception to think that C# and Rust are at an equivalent level of programming abstraction, and thus should offer similar ergonomics.')
