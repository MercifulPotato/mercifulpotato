Item(by='icedistilled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607581632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360492, text='I actually stopped reading after the statement &quot;[minimum wage] Americans are ungrateful, lack perspective and are entitled&quot;. Because a statement like that is kinda toxic and doesn&#x27;t help anyone but the top 1% who&#x27;ve hoarded all the gains over the last few decades. Reading the rest now, I&#x27;m actually even more displeased at the poster&#x27;s take. While it&#x27;s very true some minimum wage earning americans are not understanding or hostile to immigration, this person seems to be wanting to stir trouble among groups of people who have the least in america. Immigrants and minimum wage workers both get the short end of the stick.<p>Telling a minimum wage worker who likely can&#x27;t afford rent and are probably below the poverty line, they should be grateful because there&#x27;s &quot;starving children in africa&quot; sounds patronizing, entitled, lacking empathy, and does no help anyone. It does not help the minimum wage worker or people in the other countries.<p>In America, the top one percent holds over $25 trillion in wealth, exceeding the wealth of the bottom 80 percent. That other people have it worse than the bottom of the 80 percent is only to distract from that bigger issue.')
