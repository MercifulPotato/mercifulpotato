I made a script using python transmissionrpc which watch the torrent pieces being downloaded and send them with sftp as soon as they are available.<p>Then on the receiving side it just creates a sparse file and fill in the pieces using dd (so no dependencies on receiving side).<p>The sending speed was not very good. It could probably be improved by doing multiple transfers in parallel and using a less hacky way to transfers the data.')
