The signal paths in studios at that time were complex meandering things all adding minor or not-so-minor levels of color, and now can all be substantially replaced by something like a &quot;Universal Audio&quot; DSP box, which is capable of reproducing 99% of the sonic&#x2F;tonal qualities of the classic equipment.  I can&#x27;t, however, shake the assertion that old, analog, recordings have a certain quality and warmth to them that to my ears sounds amazing, and we have moved so far from this with crappy compression algorithms and equipment which mostly does not match 90&#x27;s HiFi, unless you spend a lot.  Particularly, anything processed at CD quality, seems tinny to my ears.  Recording at 192KHz seems to be set to overcome this however.')
