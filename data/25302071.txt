The notion &quot;personal data&quot; and &quot;anonymized data&quot; are quite clearly defined. [1][2]<p>&gt; Personal data that has been rendered anonymous in such a way that the individual is not or no longer identifiable is no longer considered personal data. For data to be truly anonymised, the anonymisation must be irreversible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;info&#x2F;law&#x2F;law-topic&#x2F;data-protection&#x2F;reform&#x2F;what-personal-data_en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;info&#x2F;law&#x2F;law-topic&#x2F;data-protection&#x2F;refo...</a>  \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr.eu&#x2F;eu-gdpr-personal-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr.eu&#x2F;eu-gdpr-personal-data&#x2F;</a><p>Especially that last part is important. If the output of the algorithm can be reversed in a way that it can be tied to a person, you&#x27;re violating the GDPR. The responsibility of choosing a good algorithm is very much yours. And so, that algorithm is a liability on your part.<p>Implementing a proper consent banner and adding a page with the correct GDPR information poses less of a liability when it comes to becoming GDPR compliant. There&#x27;s plenty of information out there on how to do that properly. The EC even has a handy checklist just to get started: [3]<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr.eu&#x2F;checklist&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gdpr.eu&#x2F;checklist&#x2F;</a><p>The notion &quot;personal data&quot; should also be interpreted in the broadest terms possible. Barring a few exceptions, the definition of &quot;personal data&quot; is really a limited set of principles that you are required to apply to a dataset rather then &quot;these types and groups of data are protected, these aren&#x27;t&quot;. The GDPR acts akin to a &quot;right of way&quot; principle which you are required to apply regardless of the context.<p>The nuclear way of becoming GDPR compliant without consent banners or GDPR notice pages is to not collect anything at all. I&#x27;ve done that exercise for myself, and that&#x27;s something to take extremely literal when you start to think hard about it.<p>No Google Fonts. No analytics whatsoever. No using CDN&#x27;s. No hotlinking. No embeds - No YouTube, Instagram, Google Maps, Vimeo,... - No collecting e-mail addresses for newsletters. No Avatars - no Gravatar - No comments - Not locally, not via Disquss. No keeping server side logs with IP addresses or any identifiable names.<p>It&#x27;s not mentioned all too often, but the GDPR isn&#x27;t about restricting what you can and can&#x27;t do. It tries to enforce website owners to make conscious choices over the technologies and the platforms  they use and the content strategy they would like to apply.<p>Looking at the author&#x27;s site. Google Fonts is used, CloudFlare sets a cookie and the bottom of the page has a &quot;subscribe to my newsletter&quot; with a third party service. All of which are GDPR concerns.')
