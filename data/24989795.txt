The &quot;page tearing&quot; problem is caused by the way imgui handles events.<p>You describe the UI by making a bunch of function calls, each of which immediately renders a piece of the UI <i>and</i> returns any relevant events (e.g. render a button, return whether it has been clicked). But this means that any event that should change how the UI is rendered may have missed its chance- what if the changed part of the UI has already had its function called that frame?<p>The &quot;ideal&quot; dataflow, as far as this problem is concerned, would be to fully process all the events in a frame (from raw input, to widget-level events like button presses, to application-specific stuff) <i>before</i> rendering anything.')
