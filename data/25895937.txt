Those are not even remotely the same thing.<p>I would be shocked to learn that Exxon mobile will go bankrupt in half a day because one bank has an outage. It would speak volumes to how piss-poor financial networks are architected.<p>More realistically, JPM goes down and within an hour all of its large repo clients have already called BNY or whatever and are ready to go. Billion dollar businesses have contingency plans for headquarters being taken out by a bomb, you better believe they have a plan for their repo provider taking a shit.<p>&gt; Lovely<p>Do you not see how ridiculous it is to suggest that the entire functioning US economy hinges on a single service run by a single company being available 24&#x2F;7? If it were true, it would be a bigger terrorist target than the Whitehouse.<p>Apparently the entire US economy is dependent on the uptime of the work of a few engineers at one company. Better hope that information doesnâ€™t become public or else they will be prime targets for coercion, bribes, nation state level manipulation, etc. These engineers are literally more important than Congress to keep alive and working.')
