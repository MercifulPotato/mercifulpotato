The Guardian didn&#x27;t dislike Corbyn due to a lack of Leftyness, but because for all the fact I disagree with them politically, I can at least recognise that they have some standards and integrity.<p>Corbyn wasn&#x27;t exactly a Left Trump, but not all that far off with the antisemitism, and sucking up to the fascist theocrats in Iran and Hezbollah, naked opportunism, etc. I wish more people on the right in the US had stood up for their principles in that way over the last 4 years.')
