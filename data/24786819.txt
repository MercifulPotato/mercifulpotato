Item(by='jraph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602756273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786703, text='&gt; I wish CUPS would not be installed by default<p>I don&#x27;t. CUPS does not harm (it&#x27;s lightweight and quiet), and I don&#x27;t want to have to install it or configure it if I ever need to use a printer. Drivers should be installed automatically too, so I don&#x27;t have to think about it. I install whatever mainstream distro, connect to whatever printer there is at the place I am with my laptop and it should just work. People have other things to do than (finding out how to) configure a printer and install packages for that.<p>Distros cannot assume people will know in advance what printer they will need to use with a laptop. For a desktop computer, it&#x27;s slightly different, but still, common things just need to work out of the box, life is too short for fiddling for most people (I like fiddling though, but only when I choose to do it).<p>On less mainstream &#x2F; more KISS distros, it would be okay (better) not to install CUPS by default though.')
