No broker wants to be held responsible in court for &quot;letting me do something stupid&quot; (and yes, that happens).  Some number of participants are going to be left holding stock when this flash in the pan action reaches its peak, and if it&#x27;s a bunch of a single broker&#x27;s customers, then their liability is much too high compared to their own gain.')
