I went and skimmed through the handlebarsjs link. I&#x27;m used to cl-who and can not see what the js lib does have that is not possible or harder in cl-who.</i><p>They are very different styles, though.  With cl-who you write code that mimics the structure of HTML and that code outputs HTML.  With Handlebars etc. you write your HTML in HTML and embed code in it.  Some prefer one over the other.')
