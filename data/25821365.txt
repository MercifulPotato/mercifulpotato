Of course there is place for closed and open elements of their offerings. Let me clarify.<p>In the past, Microsoft was very aggressive about open source. When they realized this strategy of FUD brings little result, they changed their attitude 180 and decided to embrace it putting literal hearts everywhere.<p>Personally, I find it hypocritical. There is no love&#x2F;hate, just business. They will use whatever strategy works to get their advantage. What I find strange is that people fell for it.')
