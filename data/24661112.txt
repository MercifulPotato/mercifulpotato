It encodes the same text, but it encodes it a different way.<p>And the difference is not negligible. With quotes, i can type or paste more into the middle, and the string is still valid. With escapes, i have to be careful to escape the added text. It&#x27;s significantly more ergonomic to use quoted text.')
