Item(by='o_class_star', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607305231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25325716, text='The problem with Paul Graham isn&#x27;t that he&#x27;s &quot;not intellectual&quot;. It&#x27;s that he pretends to be something he&#x27;s not.<p>He&#x27;s a business guy. He rolled a Natural 20 (or few) on the &quot;where and when to be born&quot; check... which is kind of 95% of what it takes to make money in capitalism (unless you&#x27;re born rich). He&#x27;s a decent technical writer. I tend to find his opinions on PL out-of-date and pedestrian— but I imagine mine are, too, because I&#x27;m a middle-aged ex-techie who left the industry in disgust.<p>For a contrast: Joe Rogan, whatever you think of him, doesn&#x27;t pretend to be an intellectual or a brilliant guy. His schtick is that he&#x27;s an average-ish guy with a lot of curiosity— not that he&#x27;s a genius who has conversations with God on the regular. Jordan Peterson, on the other hand, embarrasses himself with shit takes well outside of his expertise. (His claim to fame is interpreting a reasonable Canadian law in an extremely unreasonable way.) Peterson&#x27;s experiences as a therapist aren&#x27;t to be discounted, but his opinions on politics and society and economics are utterly worthless.<p>Paul Graham&#x27;s original Lisp books were very good. His &quot;Billionaires are a Gift From God&quot; schtick is a massive embarrassment. That&#x27;s self-serving polemic, not intellectual discourse. Chomsky, he ain&#x27;t.')
