Customers would ask whether I&#x27;m interested in taking VC or if I wanted to keep it as a &quot;lifestyle business&quot; - not realizing that we were doing more than fine without requiring outside funding. After a while though it nags at you and makes you wonder whether you should take VC because doing so makes building a business formulaic. Bootstrapping a company can feel like you&#x27;re in uncharted waters in comparison because a lot of articles assume you&#x27;ve taken or want to take VC. And they assume that you want to exit. I wish there were more publicly shared success stories of bootstrapped companies that didn&#x27;t take funding because there are more of them out there than people realize. And taking things slower can help you validate use cases, flesh out the product and build the type of company that you want. I&#x27;m very happy that we never took VC.')
