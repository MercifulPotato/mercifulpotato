Honestly a very large portion of the markets trading type business for investment banks is really just taking advantage one way or another of these kind of regulatory loopholes, not as blatantly as this maybe but some still very questionable. That and ripping off clueless corporate clients with bid-ask spreads. Some traders are still able to convince themselves it&#x27;s cause theyre some sort of market wizard though cause tbh most of these people aren&#x27;t that bright. Any other finance guys can correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, it could be just because my experience had been working with teams that I was never too impressed with')
