I do believe that modern technology has lowered (financial) barriers to access art, no doubt.<p>However, if it&#x27;s only artists that appear to be mostly suffering from this new reality, while big (record&#x2F;copyrights&#x2F;tech) corporations still appear to be doing very well, I&#x27;m inclined to argue that this is probably more about unfair distribution (even more than it traditionally already was) than about the argument you put forward.<p>No matter how you slice that cake, if in the end artists have to struggle to get by while others make a killing from exploiting their creations, then there is something fundamentally wrong. Personally, I think that today it might even be more wrong than it has been for a long time.')
