Many of us that now work in the tech industry, whether black, white, etc, have worked these shitty food service and retail jobs, but unless you worked your way up through McD&#x27;s tech statk from the grill, it just doesn&#x27;t matter. Of course Mr. Hightower here is just reusing the title of the article, so this isn&#x27;t a slight against him, but journalist should try harder, even in this clickbait world we live in. I&#x27;d hate to think my time working at Hardee&#x27;s, McDonald&#x27;s and Walmart has any bearing on my current career.')
