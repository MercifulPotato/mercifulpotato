With Catalina, my Mac Pro (2019, W5700X) was able to drive 2 LG 27GN950-B 27&quot; monitors at 4K, 144Hz, HDR.<p>Under Big Sur? 60Hz only, for HDR, or 95Hz without HDR. It seems Display Stream Compression (DSC) is broken in Big Sur, including 11.1, including for some Apple display users. For other users, doesn&#x27;t matter the display, the GPU, or the cable, this seems broken.<p>Apple gets bit (again) by the WFM bug.<p>Multiple people report having spoken to Apple who has said &quot;Macs max out at 95Hz&quot;, though it is unclear where the confusion may be there (perhaps the M1), as they definitely don&#x27;t under Catalina.')
