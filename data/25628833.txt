Unclear how&#x2F;when a credit would be used.<p>Most landing page saas apps I&#x27;ve seen price based on page views, which lends me to believe those credits also limit page views.  If not, I suggest explicitly stating unlimited page views (or what ever the limit is) if it&#x27;s unrelated to the &quot;credits&quot; system.')
