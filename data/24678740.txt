It doesn’t make any difference whether you created the account yourself or got a friend to do it for you. You&#x27;re still showing that anyone who knows my email address can access my Grindr account, which surely ought to grab people&#x27;s attention.<p>From my point of view, its a precursor to a sensible discussion about this that we acknowledge that Troy had Scott make the profile purely to add a little humor to the post.  There’s of course nothing wrong with adding humor to a blog post. However, subtly mocking people for being gay is a pretty ingrained part of our culture, and it’s easy for straight people to thoughtlessly slip into doing it.<p>I know that you have given an alternative explanation of the intention behind the photo, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not the explanation that Troy himself gave in the comments.')
