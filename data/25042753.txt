He advised all of us (American undergrads) to drill and kill certain techniques in order to build up our pattern matching.<p>I don’t think they’re advocating doing hundreds of worksheets on the power rule or trig substitutions or memorizing line by line proofs. Our brains do follow formal rules when doing math, but the insight necessary to find a way to solve a problem that isn’t straightforward isn’t through application of rules, it’s through a tacit intuition that you build up by doing lots of math.  There is no other way.<p>It’s like how everyone feels like they understand physics to a PhD level while watching the Feynman lectures, but if you were to hand them any of the problems afterwards, what seemed like such a natural stream of thought is just simply out of reach.  It’s much easier to go over something and declare “this makes sense” than it is to come up with that something in the first place.')
