As someone who builds software for distribution, the cross compilation is much better, and getting it done with compatibility that wide is technically really impressive.<p>But putting myself back in the headspace that had me using HyperCard, sharing my stuff without any build step at all was a big deal.<p>I like your loader stack technique.
