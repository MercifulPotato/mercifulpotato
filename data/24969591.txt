It&#x27;s deeply ingrained in both existing code and Google devs&#x27; mentality, and quite depressing if one is serious about de-Googling in the sense of never connecting to a Google server unless by explicit action of the user.<p>This is why phrases like &quot;completely de-Googled&quot; are frustrating and likely misleading - superficial de-Googling is possible, but I haven&#x27;t yet seen evidence of deep de-Googling on any Android derivative.<p>I&#x27;m heartened to read what&#x27;s now at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;#never-google-services" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;#never-google-services</a> , but there&#x27;s a major sentence that&#x27;s aspirational rather than reflecting reality: &quot;Text-to-speech, voice-to-text, non-GPS-based location services, geocoding, accessibility services, etc. are examples of other open Android APIs where we need to develop&#x2F;bundle an implementation based on existing open source projects.&quot;<p>Also given the pace of Android development, maintaining patches that strip out Google references will be a non-trivial endeavor.  Let alone finding every new insertion of access to a Google system.<p>After diving into this issue, I came away more convinced that we need projects like the PinePhone and mobile-capable versions of Linux applications&#x2F;environments to succeed if we want more control over what our devices are doing and to whom they provide data.  Unfortunately, I suspect it is still quite some time away before we can reliably do relatively simple stuff on an open source-based phone as a daily driver that is table stakes on Android&#x2F;iphone today.')
