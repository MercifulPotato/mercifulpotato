As far as Trump&#x27;s obstruction of justice, correct me if I&#x27;m misremembering, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the Mueller report basically said &quot;He did it, but we couldn&#x27;t come up with solid enough evidence that we would be confident we could indict a sitting president&quot; and the last line saying something like &quot;this absolutely does not absolve the president of wrongdoing&quot;. Basically if Trump was anyone other than the president, they would have charged him.<p>Without 100% rock-solid evidence, the legal complexity of trying to indict him (and him potentially pardoning himself) would have likely caused a constitutional crisis, and who knows what might have happened then. It wasn&#x27;t worth the risk.')
