On forum X or Z where there is like 3000 users max at some point you get to learn people. Often reddit posts are optimized for &quot;karma&quot; and &quot;gilding&quot;, not for QA or being really helpful.<p>Also, for some reasons, reddit makes it really hard to find old content.<p>Reddit also couldn&#x27;t replace Q&amp;A such as stack overflow for instance.<p>There is a need for better, free and secure forum software though. I know Discourse tries to disrupt the market a bit.')
