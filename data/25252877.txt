As a non-British person living in England, some local accents are nightmarishly different from the basic &quot;international English&quot;. For example, I absolutely love Irish and Scottish people, their history, their culture, their traditional attitudes etc etc, but when they &quot;go thick-accent&quot; I can&#x27;t fucking understand half of what they&#x27;re saying. I feel like the Robin Williams sketch on landing in Scotland.<p><i>&gt; decided to trash my $5 mike and get a semi pro one</i><p>Did the same, and also got decent headphones, and it made a ton of difference on both sides - people understand me better and I understand them better. Some people are so impressed they actually ask how I get to &quot;sound so good&quot;.<p>I dread to answer my landline phone now, I keep it working just for emergencies.')
