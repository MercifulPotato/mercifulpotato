MAC addresses from a device that doesn&#x27;t do MAC randomization are also good for that sort of thing. Android devices can also be tracked via advertising id&#x27;s if the user doesn&#x27;t reset it and you haven&#x27;t pissed off Google. I draw the line at assigning what are effectively UUID&#x27;s to people specifically because they are so often abused in that manner.<p>Across the pond, things work a bit differently, and the criminal justice systems are a bit lower friction for the authorities as I understand it. Not that I&#x27;m criticizing mind. The American System has not endeared itself to me as of late.')
