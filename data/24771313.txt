To a man with a PHP hammer, everything looks like a PHP nail. Hence Wordpress (although, I must admit Wordpress&#x27;s plugin ecosystem was genius).<p>Every web developer in 2020 is a React dev. To a man with a React hammer, everything looks like a React nail. Hence, Gatsby.<p>In neither case did it really make sense to build simple marketing sites and blogs with those technologies, they are best suited for dynamic web apps.<p>But, the technology that all the devs want to put on their resumes will ultimately end up powering everything. Common sense be damned.<p>After the static site hype dies down I am hopeful that Webflow will become the defacto solution for marketing&#x2F;blog sites going forward and the design&#x2F;marketing teams can fully own them and manage all changes. I&#x27;d be happy if I never had to touch another marketing site again.')
