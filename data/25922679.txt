Total public and private spending on drug R&amp;D hits ~190B per year. So even including government and charity donations your only up to 4 billion per drug.  Private companies nominally cover ~60% of that dropping their investment to ~2.3 billion per successful drug.<p>However, that’s overly generous as a great deal of tax breaks etc indirectly subsidize that 2.3 Billion.  So, it’s true drugs are expensive on average to create, larger numbers tossed around are generally intentionally misleading.')
