They&#x27;re nothing more dressed up ad hominem--attack the messenger without engaging with the substance.<p>Here are the facts that aren&#x27;t in dispute:<p>1) Other countries that have tried wealth taxes have started abandoning them, most recently France and Sweden: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;commentary&#x2F;why-europe-axed-its-wealth-taxes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cato.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;commentary&#x2F;why-europe-axed...</a>.<p>2) There is little economic consensus on whether wealth taxes would be efficient or hamper economic growth: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.aspeninstitute.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;Wealth-Taxation-An-Overview-of-the-Issues.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.aspeninstitute.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;We...</a>.<p>3) Economists do generally agree, however, that consumption taxes on individuals are the most efficient and least distortionary strategies: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;money&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;157047211&#x2F;six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;money&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;157047211&#x2F;six-...</a><p>&gt; Three: Eliminate the corporate income tax. Completely. If companies reinvest the money into their businesses, that&#x27;s good. Don&#x27;t tax companies in an effort to tax rich people.<p>&gt; Four: Eliminate all income and payroll taxes. All of them. For everyone. Taxes discourage whatever you&#x27;re taxing, but we like income, so why tax it? Payroll taxes discourage creating jobs. Not such a good idea. Instead, impose a consumption tax, designed to be progressive to protect lower-income households.<p>4) Warren&#x27;s and Sanders&#x27; proposed wealth taxes would be dramatically higher than anything a developed country has attempted (up to 6% and 8%). And even based on the candidates&#x27; own projections, they would raise not very much money (under $300 billion per year, or less than 1&#x2F;6 of what would be required to fund Medicare 4 All).<p>5) Billionaires just don&#x27;t have that much money in the aggregate to warrant such an outsized attention in tax policy. All the wealth of all U.S. billionaires adds up to $3.4 trillion. Even if you confiscated it all in one go, that would fund the local, state, and federal governments for a bit over six months, without even accounting for the new spending proposed by Warren and Sanders.')
