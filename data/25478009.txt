And there is a sense that those algorithms are created by people with no real love for music or personal investment in it as part of our culture, which is kind of sad.<p>I think this is a big part of why music discovery through Spotify feels so soulless, especially compared to something like Bandcamp Weekly.<p>I guess their next step would be to start creating the music itself with algorithms. You would simply turn on Spotify and it would start playing a continuous stream of algorithmically created music to match your profiled tastes.')
