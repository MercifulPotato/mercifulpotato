In the specification, the TIME type is defined as containing HOUR, MINUTE and SECOND fields, representing the &quot;hour within day&quot;, &quot;minute within hour&quot; and &quot;second within minute&quot; values, respectively, so, the valid range for that type supposed to be &quot;00:00:00:00.00000...&quot; to &quot;23:59:59.99999...&quot;. It&#x27;s not intended to represent an interval, although that seems to be the intended semantics for MySQL&#x27;s TIME type:<p>(from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;refman&#x2F;8.0&#x2F;en&#x2F;time.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;refman&#x2F;8.0&#x2F;en&#x2F;time.html</a>):<p>&gt; but also elapsed time or a time interval between two events (which may be much greater than 24 hours, or even negative).<p>For representing temporal intervals, the specification defines two kinds of INTERVAL types (year-month and day-time). Year-month intervals can represent intervals in terms of years, months, or a combination of years and months. Similarly, day-time interval, can represent intervals in terms of days, hours, minutes or seconds, or combinations of them (e.g, days+hours, days+hours+minutes, hours+minutes, etc.)<p>As a sidenote, the TIME and DATE types are related to the TIMESTAMP type in that TIMESTAMP can be thought of as combination of a DATE part (year, month, day) and a TIME (hour, minute, second) part.')
