They refuse to back nuclear without offering any reasonable alternative (let&#x27;s be honest if there was a good alternative we would already be using it).  Hand-wavey stuff about hydrogen and turbines don&#x27;t cut it I&#x27;m afraid.  They have done good work in the past, but perhaps if they had backed nuclear a long time ago we wouldn&#x27;t be in the mess we are in now?<p>I&#x27;ve actually been pretty critical of them for years because of this stance they have.<p>And before anyone comments about Chernobyl, my view is all energy production comes with risks.  You have to weigh those up against global climate change IMHO.')
