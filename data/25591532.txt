The general public has a vague awareness that the victims of COVID are overwhelmingly people aged 75+ with multiple comorbidities. Deaths of younger people are statistical outliers, and claims of &quot;long COVID&quot; are mainly uniformed self-diagnosis by people on the internet, the same people who before COVID were claiming to have &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot;.<p>Furthermore, that elderly demographic that represents the real risk group, doesn&#x27;t contribute to the economy much anyway. (In Russia and other economies based on resource extraction, for example, thinktanks have referred to such as &quot;superfluous population&quot;).')
