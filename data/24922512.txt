If you buy a product, you should be able to use it throughout your lifetime or until the product naturally cease to operate. In this case, Microsoft should release an open source tool to cross sign the drivers if they don&#x27;t want to support it or add an update that disables checking for signatures. \nIf a company can disable software features in the future, then you are no buying the product but merely renting it. \nImagine if you bought a car and then 5 years later company rep would come in and welded the wheels so that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to upgrade your tires. That wouldn&#x27;t fly, so why software companies are allowed to do this?')
