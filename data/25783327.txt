Your target audience gets <i>tons</i> of unsolicited email, most of which is trying to sell them something. You also are selling... not asking for their money (yet), but asking for their time.<p>You need to get warm introductions by other means. Use your professional network if you have it. Find out where some of these people hang out (industry events) and start chatting casually; this includes virtual events during COVID. Is there a support group or message board where these individuals go for support regarding the problem you&#x27;re solving? Try helping them directly since they&#x27;re actively seeking help.

Target that person instead of the VP.<p>People with power at the top of an organization are difficult to reach, by design. The front door is locked: you need to find the side door.<p>Imagine you had a skin-care product that helps any person instantly look 10 years younger, and you want to offer this product to your favorite movie star.
