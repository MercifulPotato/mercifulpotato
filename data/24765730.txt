Break down the interactions within the application by all the logical boundaries and you have a basic distributed system. Typically the input and output are via a single controlled mechanism and state is handled in a single place in memory during the series of events for a particular operation, so consistency is just assumed. But give all the series of events their own state, and each event a different input and output in random ordering, and you have distributed system problems. Threaded apps have similar problems to solve and have their own mechanisms to deal with these problems, so you can compare them and see how multiple mechanisms may be needed to compute safely.')
