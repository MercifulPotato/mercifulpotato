I wouldn&#x27;t feel the same way I did in SF, for example.<p>In NYC you learn quickly what&#x27;s safe and what&#x27;s not. I was <i>taught</i> that, at a very early age. You learn how to spot the difference between someone who&#x27;s homeless and someone who&#x27;s dangerous. You learn to be aware of your surroundings, you learn to duck into places like shops if you think someone is following you, etc.<p>It sounds awful listing it out like that, but those were just what we learned growing up. It was just how we took care of ourselves.')
