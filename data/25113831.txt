My impression is that almost nobody uses windows for theses tasks, but anecdotes are not data. There are of course workstation type acceleration tasks like simulation that are very windows heavy(e.g. ANSYS), but I am not privy to the breakdown of compute demand per segment.<p>&gt; What AMD needs to do to &quot;win&quot; an HPC GPU launch is to have an event which is 95% &quot;How we fixed ROCm, and here is our full software roadmap and support guarantee for the next 5 years&quot; and the remaining 5% &quot;oh btw here is our new silicon, it&#x27;s really fast and shiny&quot;.<p>This is a great point. NVDA has worked on CUDA for years and has a great ecosystem of material and questions on places like stackexchange. AMD will have to work very purposefully to close the gap, but it seems like they are aware and headed in the right direction.')
