Also, the physical size of the monitor is irrelevant, it’s the resolution that matters. Your video card doesn’t care if you have a 40” 4K monitor or an 80” 4K monitor, to it, it’s the same load.<p>The reason I still have a cheese grater Mac Pro desktop at all is because I have 128gb RAM in it and have tasks that need that much memory.<p>[0] I’ve connected eight external monitors to my 16” MBP (with laptop screen still enabled, so 9 screens total). I don’t use the setup actively, did it as a test, but it very much works. The setup was as follows:<p>TB#1 - 27” LG 5K @ 5120x2880<p>TB#2 - TB3&lt;-&gt;TB2 adapter, then two 27” Apple Thunderbolt Displays @ 2560x1440<p>TB#3 - eGPU with AMD RX580, then two 34” ultrawides connected over HDMI @ 3440x1440, two 27” DisplayPort monitors @ 2560x1440<p>TB#4 - TB3&lt;-&gt;TB2 adapter, then 27” Apple Thunderbolt Display @ 2560x1440<p>So that’s almost 50 million pixels displayed on around 4,000 square inches of screens driven by a single MBP laptop.')
