I&#x27;ve started going through my contact list and started reaching out for a quick call to the people I&#x27;d like to build up contact with again using COVID as a reason to reach out. Anybody that answered was really happy that I rang. I try to do this once a week, all it takes is a few minutes, try scheduling it and picking one person a week, worst case its a short call best case its a friendship renewed. I think during COVID people are happy to take a personal call as casual conversation has died a death and work calls don&#x27;t fill the same gap for human contact and conversation. Try it, what&#x27;s the worst that could happen!')
