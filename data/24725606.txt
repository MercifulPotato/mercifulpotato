What a surprise.<p>And I guess highway designers who choose to make the speed limit 65 mph instead of 3 mph also need to go to jail, right? After all, they KNOW WITH CERTAINTY that a 65 mph speed limit will contribute to many more deaths than if they limited cars to going 3 mph on the highway, but they chose to do it anyway.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, why don&#x27;t we prosecute the mother who bought a $18k Honda instead of a $300k tank even though the $18k Honda exposes her children to more risk of serious harm in a car accident? The mother is knowingly risking her children&#x27;s lives in order to save money!<p>Get real and cut the rhetorical hysteria. EVERYTHING in life and the real world is about tradeoffs. And acceptable vs unacceptable tradeoffs change with time as we gain in economic prosperity. If you want regulation, pass CLEAR laws. Don&#x27;t use weasely rhetoric to pretend that regular businessmen are murdering children because they sell soda.')
