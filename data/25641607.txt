It&#x27;s easy to use.<p>When I once tested std::sort against qsort (sorting 4-byte integer) I measure a 2x difference. So yes, definitely non-trivial, but it won&#x27;t get much worse than that.<p>Have you ever seen a program that was slow because of a slow sorting routine?<p>If you ever need a fast sort (~ never) then the last thing you should do is use std::sort anyway. You should figure out what your data looks like and hand roll an implementation. For example, a radix sort is often possible to use, easy to implement, and much faster than std::sort.')
