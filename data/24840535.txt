Default going into Pitch are beautiful slides, which are fun to work on because it makes it easy to make them beautiful.<p>Easy to use and collaborate on as well.<p>From the outside I tend to be almost as cynical: is it that much of a difference to become a killer enterprise tool taking marketshare from Google slides ? I never saw a big difference between Zoom and Google meet, even worse, for Zoom you had to download something, but as it happens, Zoom became a behemoth, so now my mind is open to even minuscule improvements over incumbents can sort lead to a run off growth and usage cycle.')
