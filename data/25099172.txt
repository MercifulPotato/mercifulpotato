There will be someone you can talk to regardless of your means and who can find you people and resources so you’re not struggling alone. Call a suicide hotline for your country, talk to a therapist, call a Priest, but make a connection and stop suffering alone. You matter. I might be just a person on the internet but I’m praying for you.')
