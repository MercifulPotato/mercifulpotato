The entire system is always seeking an equilibrium, and the increased relevance of the fringes indicates the direction the Overton window is shifting in. Cutting things off on one side just guarantees an unsympathetic schism forming on the other, where the people just barely this side of the schism point are left wondering whether the folks on the other side may have had a point. Rinse repeat. Authoritarianism in all forms tends to capture the public imagination in times of crisis. The issue right now is magnitude, and if you keep pushing the censorship button now, there&#x27;s going to be a loss of quite a few reasonable people previously amenable to putting their differences aside.<p>For those without ShowDead on, there is a user, AnHonestComment, who has apparently run afoul of some moderation policies, and tends to get his posts nuked from orbit (likely by the user base) as a response, I figured that it was worth pointing out the irony of his attempted statement &quot;This is what HN wants,&quot; sans the combative tone with regards to the moderation team.<p>If you take a spin through his comment history, it&#x27;s not terribly unreasonable aside from a serious chip on his shoulder with regards to the moderation team.<p>AnHonestComment, if you&#x27;re still reading this, you aren&#x27;t necessarily shadowbanned or anything like that, you&#x27;re just inviting downvote bombing with the constant references to the moderation by the community.<p>You seem a decent sort, and I know as well the harrowing plight of the conscientious objector. There is a place here for it, even if it might be well advised to build up some karma first. It shouldn&#x27;t be that way arguably, but it is, and it&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve all got to work with.')
