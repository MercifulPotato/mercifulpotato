If women in pink hats stormed the Capitol during the Kavanaugh confirmation vote (well they did, but not in enough numbers to overwhelm security), the parties would be having polar opposite reactions.  GOP saying it was a coup and democrats saying it was justified outrage.<p>These people don&#x27;t realize they were pawns in Trump&#x27;s bad faith attempt to steal the election.  They believe they are doing the right thing.  *That doesn&#x27;t justify their actions, but it explains their actions.*')
