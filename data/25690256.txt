LA ICUs are now nightmarish.<p><i>&quot;At Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, the breaking point came Sunday night.<p>There was not one available bed for at least 30 patients who needed intensive or intermediate levels of care, and the hospital had to shut its doors to all ambulance traffic for 12 hours. Some patients, including the very sick who required intensive oxygen, experienced wait times as long as 18 hours to get into the intensive care unit.<p>The front entrance of Community Hospital of Huntington Park was closed to the public Monday; the back of the building saw a steady stream of ambulances over the weekend, with one security guard saying the vehicles arrived as frequently as every half hour.<p>And Memorial Hospital of Gardena on Monday was running at 140% capacity, forcing officials to ask for a four-hour suspension of new ambulance calls so it could move patients. The hospital is struggling to keep enough oxygen and supplies on hand amid the crunch of COVID-19 patients who need it.&quot;</i><p>...<p><i>&quot;The crisis at Los Angeles County hospitals hit new levels as patients continued to stream in during the holiday weekend, and the medical system is bracing for a new wave of coronavirus spread arising from Christmas travel and gatherings. L.A.

Imagine if CA behaved like North Dakota.<p>Meanwhile, China is back to normal, with only minimal contact tracing required for the occasional outbreak here and there. They couldn&#x27;t even run clinical trials for their vaccines in-country because not enough people have the virus anymore. There&#x27;s a certain freedom in that. Hard to be free if you&#x27;re dead.')
