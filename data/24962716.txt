Even if a comment is toxic, abusive, or just off-topic, I think there is value in being able to attach a _reason_ to a downvote. Rather than downvotes, I would like to see &#x27;vote-comments&#x27;, where you can leave a +1 or -1 comment, so it acts like an upvote or downvote, but there has to be some text there as well, which would serve to contextualise the upvote&#x2F;downvote.')
