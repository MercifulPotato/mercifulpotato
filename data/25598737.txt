R. Haldeman, Nixons Chief of Staff\n[1]<p>&quot;Another leading Watergate burglar was James McCord, a former top official of the CIA Office of Security, the agency bureau which is supposed to maintain contacts with U.S. police agencies in order to facilitate its basic task of providing security for CIA installations and personnel. The Office of Security was thus heavily implicated in the CIA&#x27;s illegal domestic operations, including cointelpro operations against political dissidents and groups, and was the vehicle for such mind-control experiments as Operations Bluebird, Artichoke, and MK-Ultra. The Office of Security also utilized male and female prostitutes and other sex operatives for purposes of compromising and blackmailing public figures, information gathering, and control. According to Hougan, the Office of Security maintained a &quot;fag file&quot; of some 300,000 U.S. citizens, with heavy stress on homosexuals. The Office of Security also had responsibility for Soviet and other defectors. James McCord was at one time responsible for the physical security of all CIA premises in the U.S. McCord was also a close friend of CIA Counterintelligence Director James Jesus Angleton. McCord was anxious to cover the CIA&#x27;s role; at one point he wrote to his superior, General Gaynor, urging him to &quot;flood the newspapers with leaks or anonymous letters&quot; to discredit those who wanted to establish the responsibility of &quot;the company.&quot;&quot; - George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography by Webster Tarpley<p>Another angle worth considering, especially given his actions the last 4 years, is how Woodward was former naval intelligence and an FBI asset.
