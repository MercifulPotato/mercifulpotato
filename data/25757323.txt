Item(by='aufhebung', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610505628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752614, text='&gt;customers get a base package and need to pay extra for the &quot;social media package&quot; (which unlocks twitter and facebook) or the &quot;streaming package&quot; (which unlocks netflix, youtube, etc.)\nAccording to snopes this doesn&#x27;t seem to be fully accurate. There was a mobile plan with which you could buy extra data for different services (which I admit is not ideal), but no extra package to &quot;unlock&quot; services.')
