This is particularly important if you want to create a library that can be shared and used by everyone. You cannot do that with C++ without a lot of caveats. Google, for instance, forbid creating libraries in C++ for good reasons. Creating a C++ library with a C ABI sounds stupid. I.e. if the library’s functions and types can  be presented as simple C, you have already folded down to C and C++ is just an implementation detail and you will probably also have to static link libstdc++. That’s no longer a small, simple library anymore. The stable ABI makes C also famously easy to include and inter opt with other languages and frameworks. Swift for example can easily utilize C libraries and code but cannot inter opt with C++ (yet, apparently it’s wip)')
