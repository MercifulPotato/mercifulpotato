It would be interesting to see experimentation in using this data for more than just screen readers and the likes, so that you <i>could</i> do things like slurp a table of numbers and add them up regardless of which program it came from (—though PDFs are unlikely to pan out, because the tabular structure is typically just not encoded in the file).<p>On macOS, there’s AppleScript which can, I believe, achieve some of these sorts of things using accessibility APIs and similar. I’m not familiar with the extent of its capabilities as I don’t use a Mac.')
