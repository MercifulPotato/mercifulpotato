It&#x27;s what the term needs.<p>Those behaving in morally incompetent systems deserve some judgment. They may deserve a pat on the back for their efforts, but just because you&#x27;re pursuing a feel-good dream doesn&#x27;t mean you get to ignore the reality around you. I&#x27;ve seen nonprofits ruined by such mindsets. Working on the mission at all is the moral component. Being effective, neutral or making things worse through naivety is the competency component that needs to be weighed in any effort -- regardless of the effort&#x27;s moral imperative.')
