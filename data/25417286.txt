What if I tell my friend, that my new TV is really good? What if I tell it to 10 of my friends? What if I send an email to everyone I know, saying, that my new TV is great?<p>Would you investigate, if the TV manufacturer paid me or not? How exactly would you do it? Or did they gave me a discount on the TV?<p>I wish you could see, that you can not ban advertising, without banning free speech.<p>It would be also great to ban lying in media, right?')
