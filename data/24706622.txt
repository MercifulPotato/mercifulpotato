Personally I think it&#x27;s silly to romanticise and wax lyrical about what are - when it comes down to it - errors in the data; artefacts of the crudeness of the technology that was available when the material was created. Do we routinely add errors of this type to modern footage? No. Why not? Because they detract from the material.<p>The material is already hugely compromised as a historical document of the reality on the day the events were captured. Let&#x27;s not put it on a pedestal. For example, if we remove the effect of hand-cranking on film to make it more watchable, are we destroying or enhancing? I would argue the latter. The hand-cranking adds little of value.')
