They sound very different to the likes of Opera Mini <i>Turbo</i> or Amazon Silk&#x27;s <i>Cloud Browser</i> or Chrome&#x27;s <i>Fly Wheel</i>...[0] In Cloudflare&#x27;s case, the rendering happens on the server and only rasterization commands are sent to the clients similar to AWS NICE [1].<p>As a security product (if you trust Cloudflare), browser isolation sounds super tempting on-paper. As they mention in the blogspot, an ashtonishing 70% of the exploits are through various forms of Phishing and other attacks in the browser. DNS based blocklists (and Google SafeBrowsing) which form a viable defence against Phising can only protect you from so much [2].<p>So, my point is, regardless of the thin-client &#x2F; thick-client cycle, there&#x27;s a real value to this product. It isn&#x27;t for everyone but there&#x27;s no denying its utility, especially when you consider the fact that most SaaS tools are browser-friendly.<p>I have also been following MightyApp.com that is trying to do something similar but for consumers and with focus on productivity. It is interesting to see how this would play out. If there&#x27;s a huge market for this, Google is sure to pounce on it too, and then things will get real interesting... as if AMP, WebComponents [2] and Privacy Sandbox [3] weren&#x27;t already enough.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19774768" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19774768</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;hpc&#x2F;dcv&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;hpc&#x2F;dcv&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.akamai.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;a-death-match-of-domain-generation-algorithms.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.akamai.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;a-death-match-of-domain-gen...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24390324" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24390324</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20767891" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20767891</a>')
