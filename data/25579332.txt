For more popular blogs&#x2F;sites that have comments on posts like Slate Star Codex or Less Wrong, there can be literally hundreds or thousands of comments on a single post. This makes scrolling through the post or judging the amount of content in the post via scroll bar basically impossible, but just loading comments with a button click fixes that in such a simple way.')
