There&#x27;s like a handful of companies[1] that make it all.  I&#x27;m sure the execs all own yachts but if you were to compare executive fleet displacement it&#x27;s more of a Venezuelan navy than a French navy.  They can&#x27;t just call up their lobbyist who&#x27;s already scheduled to golf with a congressman every other weekend and tell them to bring it up on their next trip.  Only the Googles and the Exxons of the world have that kind of access.<p>What really happens is the some company notices that &quot;hey, those other people are doing X and they&#x27;re not supposed to, I&#x27;m losing money because of it.  Then they call up the congressman in their district and say &quot;I employ people in your district and pay taxes and I am getting screwed because morons who you have oversight over are not doing their jobs, make them do their goddamn jobs&quot; but in nicer words and with situation specific details.  And then the congressman&#x27;s aid writes an email to someone that explains the situation and asks the relevant people to please take a look at it again.<p>The law might be stupid and the complaint might be petty but it&#x27;s better than living in a world where state and federal legislators don&#x27;t try and solve their constituents problems with government.  For every stupid pasta beef there&#x27;s a dozen more legitimate complaints that cross the desk of whichever staffer is doing constituent relations.  My point is that the process of getting &quot;access&quot; to one&#x27;s congressman is not really as nefarious as people make it out to be.<p>&gt;Medium sized businesses (up to $100m revenues) will find it very difficult even getting a response. Even getting their attention is a competitive advantage for large corporate.<p>This hasn&#x27;t been my experience but I suspect that it&#x27;s going to depend a lot on the political optics of the specific industry relative to the representative.<p>[1] Check out this handy list and research the companies if you don&#x27;t believe me. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ilovepasta.org&#x2F;membership&#x2F;membership-directory&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ilovepasta.org&#x2F;membership&#x2F;membership-directory&#x2F;</a> Many are owned by larger brands but they are not particularly big businesses themselves.
