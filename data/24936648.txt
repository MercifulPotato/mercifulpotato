How do I make sure the emails are threaded properly?<p>Most people will (and you should, too) use reply-all when participating on a mailing list, which should land the replies straight into your inbox. Just reply-all to these normally, making sure not to top post. If someone makes a mistake, and you weren&#x27;t subscribed to the list, the web archives usually have a mailto: link somewhere that you can click to reply to the thread.<p>&gt;The git email client seems to have support for message IDs.<p>You should never have to directly work with message IDs if you&#x27;re using git-send-email and letting your mail client handle replies.<p>&gt;Also, gmail has moved on to newer authentication mechanisms.<p>They should still have support for SMTP PLAIN authentication unless you use gsuite and your admin has turned it off, if I understand correctly. I have written a mail client which has support for OAUTH, however, which you might find useful:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aerc-mail.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aerc-mail.org</a><p>I don&#x27;t use gmail so if you run into problems, please reach out to the appropriate mailing list - I won&#x27;t know how to help.<p>I would also, of course, strongly recommend that you ditch gmail ASAP.')
