They can handle IPv6, though.<p><i>If it were made truly backwards compatible</i><p>It can&#x27;t be made backward compatible. Every switch on the internet needs to understand your new extended address scheme otherwise they&#x27;ll send your packets to a dead-zone somewhere in Uzbekistan. Backward compatibility was never an option. As soon as you add new bits to the address, old routers won&#x27;t send them to the right place.')
