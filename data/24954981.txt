My apologies for not engaging previously with your answer.<p>I agree that computation is likely a better model than string theory.  However I have the humility to not insist that reality must match any set of concepts that I have.<p>In particular in this case results like the ones discussed at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=3827" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=3827</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4372" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scottaaronson.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4372</a> say that quantum mechanical systems can perform operations in ways that are different from and fundamentally impossible for classical computers.  Therefore it seems likely to me that classical computing is going to break down pretty hard as a model for how things <i>really</i> work.')
