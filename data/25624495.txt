Item(by='josefx', descendants=None, kids=[25625210, 25625010, 25624672, 25624566], score=None, time=1609702966, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25624290, text='&gt; Yeah I think Google and other advertisers are great at predicting what people will buy and then shows them ads for it.<p>Seems to be entirely subjective.<p>I bought a new blade for a bread cutting machine on amazon, the last one lasted ~25 years. My current recommendations: blades for bread cutting machines.<p>I also checked some Christmas decorations on Amazon, but didn&#x27;t buy any. So next to the blades I get Christmas decorations recommended. January is a bit late for that, isn&#x27;t it?<p>I also bought a single server rack on eBay. Now I regularly get spam emails from eBay reminding me of new offers for server racks. Even the company I work for doesn&#x27;t have that many, so why?<p>In short I am not really convinced that these platforms are good at predicting what I want. Rather it looks as if they are good at showing me what I already have.')
