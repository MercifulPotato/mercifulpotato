If masks are not adequate to protect you from others who may not be following best practices then I think the PPE standards need to be adjusted.<p>That&#x27;s not the point of using a mask at all. It never was, to begin with.<p>Masks are intended to limit or eliminate the chance <i></i>you<i></i> infect people around you. Sure, they also help you not breed in particles, but masks are quite literally a filter you place over your mouth and nose to stop the droplets you&#x27;re emitting from spreading around.<p>The rationale is that covid carriers can spread the disease for over a week without even suspecting they have it. They spread the disease by spraying infected droplets through their airways. Thus, the right thing to do is to be on the safe side and ensure we cannot contribute to spread the disease.<p>If the whole community acts responsibly and takes basic measures to stop the disease from spreading, the disease stops spreading and the epidemic is reigned in.<p>You wear a mask to protect the community and ensure everyone around you stays safe. You&#x27;re intentionally putting everyone around you and everyone you contact with at risk if you not only refuse to take basic precautions such as wearing a mask but also engage with people who also refuse to do so.')
