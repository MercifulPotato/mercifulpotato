The point is Google is not putting only the &quot;I have opt out&quot; cookie, but putting instead &quot;I have opt out and my ID is 751DBC849846494494A894984&quot; cookie (which is the issue at hand).<p>Edit: this should be opt-in really, as tracking is explicitly stated as a consensual activity.')
