Item(by='Karellen', descendants=None, kids=[25221572], score=None, time=1606403014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25219766, text='The point isn&#x27;t that bridges never fall down. The point is that engineers who build bridges know that it&#x27;s their responsibility to do everything in their power to make sure it doesn&#x27;t, even if no-one else around them seems to care about that, or specifically asked for it. That they should walk away from a project rather than sign off on one where they will not have the resources or support to do a competent job.<p>That said, all bridges have design specifications and limits. If someone drives a convoy of trucks carrying gold bullion over a bridge and exceeds its design max weight by a factor of 10, and it doesn&#x27;t hold up, that&#x27;s not the engineer&#x27;s fault. If a bridge is designed for a geologically active area and is designed to withstand a quake 10x more powerful than the strongest that&#x27;s ever been recorded in the area, or is predicted by seismologists, and the area gets hit by a 100x quake, that&#x27;s not the engineer&#x27;s fault.<p>And if a bridge designed to last say, 5 years, is neither re-certified for use, or just closed, when its intended lifespan is up then that&#x27;s not the engineer&#x27;s fault either.<p>But the engineer is responsible for finding out what the likely max load of a bridge will be, or how powerful the strongest quake will be, or how long its intended lifespan is - and for adding in safety margins on top of that. They can&#x27;t just assume that any new bridge will only be needed for 5 years, just because that no-one told them that it will be needed for longer, and then claim &quot;well, it was only temporary&quot; afterwards.')
