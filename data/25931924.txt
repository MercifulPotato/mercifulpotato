In other words, there’s ‘weirdness’ around the provenance of those pangolin cov datasets, and the lack of formal retractions from Nature and PLOS Pathogens (despite those journals’ editors’ posted Q&amp;A with the authors) means that the natural origin line continues to gain unearned steam (beyond being reasonably treated as simply the pandemic origin’s null hypothesis).')
