For the last few years, this perfectly reasonable and balanced viewpoint was taboo so it&#x27;s good to see more and more people approaching the debate rationally as opposed to waging a religious war over sensitive emotions.<p>Personally, I have no issue with TypeScript purely as a language and I concede that it provides much better IDE code completion than JavaScript. That said, I don&#x27;t agree that these benefits offset the drawbacks of the transpilation step, the source mapping and the added versioning complexity between JS and TS.<p>I also miss the way that JavaScript encouraged people to define very simple function signatures (e.g. strings, numbers, plain objects&#x2F;clones as arguments and return values).<p>For example, I really liked how the React&#x2F;Redux community came up with a philosophy around cloning plain state objects before returning them from functions in order to prevent unexpected mutations. I think this philosophy does not translate very well to TypeScript which encourages developers to pass around complex live instances instead of raw objects and other primitive state representations.<p>As Alan Kay pointed out, OOP is not about objects, the &quot;The big idea is messaging&quot;. Instances should communicate with each other via simple insterfaces using simple messages; they should avoid passing complex live instances to each other.')
