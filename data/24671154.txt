If they aren&#x27;t compatible at all something is really off, i.e. what happens to electrons in a gravitation field?<p>2. We can combine (quantize) gravity, but the problem is that using the tools we have today (Quantum Field Theory) the theory doesn&#x27;t give meaningful answers. There is a process called renormalization that we use to squeeze an answer out of the theory, but that process don&#x27;t work for all theories and not gravity.')
