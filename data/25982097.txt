For example, against teams with easy-to-land poke, QSS is better than Bansheeâ€™s Veil.<p>If you modeled team composition, it may be possible to even model pick-ban phase via min-max search. A full exhaustive search would be computationally impossible, but you could approximate it AlphaGo style with a neural network estimator + Monte Carlo tree search. You may be able to sell such software to professional teams.')
