Greenwald has been a go to for a long time. Article reads like Trump propaganda.<p>Central argument is that the &#x27;story&#x27; about Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop and the emails on it is not being taken seriously by the mainstream media.<p>The purported emails have not been provided with their metadata as far as I can tell.<p>The story told by the emails appears to be some vague, &#x27;Hunter Biden was pursuing a business deal and trading on his family name&#x27; type thing.<p>And all of this from an unnamed author in the New York Post citing evidence on a laptop left in a computer repair shop? All sounds completely ludicrous.<p>Makes me wonder why the hell Greenwald is making so much hay over this. Kompromat?')
