I have come to hate my job over the years - too much lying, politics, and general BS.<p>I don&#x27;t think it will happen for me. I live in a relatively HCOL, have a young family, child has a medical issue, and I pay all the bills. My wife will not contribute to the bills and refuses to relocate.<p>Maybe I could technical coastFIRE someday. I feel like I will have to quit at some point or I may lose my sanity. I try to live cheaply, so maybe I could work part time at Lowes if I can get enough saved for retirement, pay off the mortgage, and have enough to pay medical bills.')
