But entry was about 5000 to 6000EUR when I last looked. It may depend. From time to time I use them in washing saloons when I have larger batches of dirty (sports) clothing or blankets, bed linen(other &quot;sports&quot;, don&#x27;t ask).<p>Anyways, <i>very</i> easy to use, fast, and looking indestructible, while the washing drums look space age from the inside(materials wise, and the shape&#x2F;structuring of it).')
