They haven&#x27;t been building stocks. They&#x27;ve been manufacturing vaccines and shipping them straight out as they have signed contracts with many other countries other than the UK. Demand is outstripping supply.<p>Vaccine production started before any country gave any approval, it&#x27;s well documented that it started in 5th JUNE 2020, so I don&#x27;t quite get what you&#x27;re saying. If it took Europe 4 more weeks to approve a vaccine all the stock produced until that point should have been flushed to countries who approved it before, even though the production started way before anyone approved - so they take advantage of stock build up, but Europe doesn&#x27;t because?<p>&gt;The EU&#x27;s argument, which is well documented in the press, is that they&#x27;ve promised about 300 million Euros to AZ to build up capacity, only a small amount of which they&#x27;ve paid AZ. It is also well documented that it takes time to get a vaccine manufacturing plant working at close to 100% yield, something even the UK plant hasn&#x27;t achieved. It&#x27;s simply the case that the EU should have agreed and paid sooner so that AZ could have invested that money in the EU plants sooner. All of this is covered in the &#x27;best reasonable efforts&#x27; parts of the contract.<p>Again, something doesn&#x27;t add up - it&#x27;s well documented that it was EUROPEAN factories in the Netherlands and Germany that produced the first batches of AZ vaccines for the UK. So even before UK has any production capacity they are already taking advantage of Europe capacity of production financed by EU.<p>Basically the UK took advantage of EU capacity, and EU didn&#x27;t get anything out of their investment? And now that UK has some capacity, all of it will be for UK, and EU should keep investing to make vaccines for UK and the rest of the world, while AZ is failing to fulfill orders.<p>This is weird, no?<p>&gt;Evidence? As far as I can see in the press, the AZ doses in the UK are coming from the AZ manufacturing plants in the UK, and it is vdL &#x2F; the EU that is demanding that AZ doses in the UK are diverted to the EU to make up the current shortfall in EU manufacturing.<p>It&#x27;s well documented in the media, quote:<p>&quot;Ian McCubbin, the manufacturing lead for the UK&#x27;s Vaccine Taskforce said that the “vast majority” of the Oxford&#x2F;AstraZeneca vaccine will be manufactured in the UK.<p>AstraZeneca also has some plants in Europe, with sites in Germany and the Netherlands producing the jab - these were the first to be rolled out in the UK.&quot;<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.business-live.co.uk&#x2F;manufacturing&#x2F;uk-factories-making-astrazeneca-vaccine-19708380" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.business-live.co.uk&#x2F;manufacturing&#x2F;uk-factories-m...</a>')
