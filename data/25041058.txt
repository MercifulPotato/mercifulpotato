Proper E2E requires that you do something out-of-band from the software that it can&#x27;t decode regardless of what the developers add.  That is of course high friction and only a small number of people do this.  For low friction E2E, there has to be some level of trust that a company won&#x27;t back-door the software.    Some people believe in solving this trust issue with legal agreements, but I dont ascribe to that.  Governments can still force changes, provide immunity and use gag orders.  There are also canaries, but I don&#x27;t buy into that either, nor do corporate lawyers I have talked to, as well as other lawyers.
