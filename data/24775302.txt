I would have loved to follow their daily updates, but seems like too much work to go through them here afterwards.<p>Does anyone have a good idea about where news about this type of expeditions are shared up front? I searched to subreddits called something with &quot;expedition&quot; but no luck. So all ideas are welcome. Even more cool would of course be to join an expedition like this - but following one must be second best.')
