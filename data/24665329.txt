There&#x27;s nothing a distro maintainer can do about them.<p>The &quot;authors won&#x27;t keep their own software up to date&quot; point isn&#x27;t an argument against Flatpak in specific, it&#x27;s an argument against custom package sources in general.<p>If we really don&#x27;t trust authors to update their own software, then we ought to be pushing for even <i>stricter</i> sandboxing and system isolation than what Flatpak currently provides. The cat is already out of the bag: people already run software on their system from the AUR, from private repos, from custom Linux installers that just bundle everything into a tar.gzip. Dynamic linking won&#x27;t save you from them.')
