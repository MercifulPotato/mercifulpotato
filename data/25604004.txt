Take for example Habbo Hotel. Started off with Shockwave, then before that EOL’d they rewrote it in Flash, and now they are working on a Unity web assembly based rewrite. I think the reality is FarmVille isn&#x27;t as popular as it once was. I haven’t heard of anybody playing it in years. Funny how games got people to be far more active on Facebook but their usage died down significantly over time. With how addictive those games were for some its probably for the best.')
