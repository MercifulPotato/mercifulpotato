There&#x27;s not a good, simple way I&#x27;m aware of to prevent data exfiltration in that kind of environment. Once I have the ability to change a page&#x27;s source code before the browser loads it, I suspect I can kind of do anything.<p>On the other hand, that proposal would make it at least marginally harder for malicious scripts to go undetected, and it&#x27;s at least as much (if not more) of an improvement to privacy than the system Manifest V3 is going with, given that V3 doesn&#x27;t prevent request monitoring, network requests from extensions, or script injection into the page. And there are probably ways to implement what you&#x27;re talking about without breaking a huge number of extensions.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a solution, but it&#x27;s significantly better than what Manifest V3 is trying to do.')
