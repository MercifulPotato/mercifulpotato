I usually use the latter, since it can be done one-handed, but I would still prefer a real key.<p>My next keyboard is likely to be something like a Dactyl Manuform, and I don&#x27;t see the point of _not_ including the F-keys when I&#x27;m printing the case myself.<p>I don&#x27;t miss dedicated PgUp&#x2F;PgDown&#x2F;Home&#x2F;End keys.  I have these as Fn+â†‘ etc, which is fine -- I mostly use these keys when I&#x27;m typing with both hands, whereas the F-keys are often useful in combination with the mouse.')
