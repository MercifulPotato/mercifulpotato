I mean, we are talking about psychiatrists using psychedelics to aid therapy, I want to believe they are not the kind of people to trick others.<p>Other than that you are absolutely right. Drug effects depend on dosage and who is taking it.<p>Thing is anger and agressiveness are well known side effects of steroids, and in my opinion doctors are too quick to prescribe them.\nI feel there is a double standard with drugs, and issues that are found in, say, psychedelics seem to be non issues with other prescription or recreational drugs. But that is my opinion and I do not think is more valid than anyone else.<p>Honestly, I believe all drugs to be dangerous, and utmost caution should be taken when using, even with otc painkillers.<p>I am not necessarily for legalization, but definitely for decriminalization. I do not believe having psychedelics widely available for public consumption is necessarily a good idea (I carefully worded that sentence, please notice). Same goes for alcohol tho.')
