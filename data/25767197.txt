If those numbers were correct, we&#x27;d have diagnosed 23% of cases. Do we really thing we&#x27;ve done much better than that? I&#x27;m not certain. I&#x27;d be a little surprised if it were over 50%, but that&#x27;s purely based off intuition.<p>The other point the author kind of brings up: the current Alabama numbers are roughly in line with the &quot;Ireland event&quot; <i>already</i>. So a &quot;rolling series&quot; of these events is kind of what we already have happening, isn&#x27;t it? That doesn&#x27;t diminish the toll of the situation or the mistakes in the responses from the authorities.')
