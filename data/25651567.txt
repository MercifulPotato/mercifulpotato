It matters what my monthly is because it is _a loan_ that I need to pay back every month.  If I didn&#x27;t need to think about what the monthly payment was I wouldn&#x27;t need to take out a loan (unless I guess you got a magical loan that could only be paid off as a lump sum?).<p>You&#x27;re implying &quot;worrying about&quot; or wanting to know what the monthly payment is on a loan is a bad thing and I don&#x27;t understand why.')
