They have set aside opcode space for doing just that. RISC-V can&#x27;t forecast everything someone will want to do with a RISC-V chip. Instead, they promise not to use those opcodes so that it won&#x27;t conflict with a chip manufacturer&#x27;s &quot;custom&quot; instructions.<p>Here&#x27;s a post from SiFive talking specifically about DSAs in RISC-V: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sifive.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;part-1-fast-access-to-accelerators-enabling-optimized-data-transfer-with-risc-v" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sifive.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;part-1-fast-access-to-accelerato...</a><p>In terms of virtualization, most of the extensions can be emulated. This happens a lot with the hodgepodge of extensions laid on Intel&#x2F;AMD, such as SSE, SSSE, AVX, and so forth. Just because the underlying physical machine doesn&#x27;t necessarily support it doesn&#x27;t mean that the guest can&#x27;t. At the operating system level, the OS can read the misa (Machine ISA) register to see which extensions are supported, and emulate those which are not. I don&#x27;t think RISC-V solves the issues that virtualizing Intel&#x2F;AMD also suffer--and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really their goal.<p>In terms of the host, if there is an extension that cannot be emulated, then yes, I would think you&#x27;d need the physical machine to be able to support it.')
