We take all of the security critical information and then alert on what&#x27;s important, generate reports, show cool dashboards, and simplify demonstrating compliance to their regulators and auditors.<p>I got my job here through an HN Who&#x27;s Hiring post 5 years ago, and I love working here. Strong engineering culture - weekly hour &#x27;topic sync&#x27; to share knowledge, minimal meetings, flexible hours&#x2F;wfh, happy customers that give good feedback, and interesting problems to solve. Currently our engineering team is fully remote for COVID and we are conducting interviews remotely.<p>For Devops, we are looking to add a third SRE to improve our bus factor, help manage our Elasticsearch cluster hosted on AWS, use Terraform and Chef to keep our Java microservice architecture happy, and otherwise make our systems run smoothly and securely.  Our stack includes AWS, Elasticsearch, Terraform, Chef, Sensu, InfluxDB, Postgresql, and Phabricator. Ideal candidates will have some experience in several of these and be good at grokking docs to quickly get up to speed on the ones they haven&#x27;t used.<p>For Full stack engineers, we use AngularJS&#x2F;Angular (upgrade in progress), Typescript, Java 11, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and we&#x27;re built on AWS. Our interview loop is one or two ~1-hour phone screenings, followed by a ~4 hours video call - and we&#x27;ve designed it to approximate realistic day-to-day coding and code review (no algorithm riddles).<p>Email jobs [at] defensestorm [dot] com to apply.')
