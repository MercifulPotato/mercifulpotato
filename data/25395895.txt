He contrasts it with vaccinating entire population on day 1. Read it carefully.<p>Vs.<p>&quot;Now assume that the vaccine can’t roll out to everyone immediately. For the sake of this simple model let’s assume that on day one you can only vaccinate half the population. By doing so you save 1000 lives on day 1 and 2000 lives every day thereafter for the length of the pandemic. That’s the fourth panel. Now suppose we delay the vaccine rollout by one day. 2000 people die on Day 1 but you save 1000 on Day 2 and 2000 on Day 3 and every day thereafter for the length of the pandemic. How many people were killed by the delay? Compare the 4th and 5th panels. 2000 exactly as before! &quot;<p>This compares vaccinating 50% on day 1, and the remaining 50% on day 2, to vaccinating 50% on day 2 and the remaining 50% on day 3.<p>But in blowing through the supply, we&#x27;re comparing vaccinating 1% on day 1 and another 1% on day 7 and another 1% on day 15 to vaccinating 1% on day 7 and 1% on day 8 and 1% on day 15.  Not at all the same scenario.')
