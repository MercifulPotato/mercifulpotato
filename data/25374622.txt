This shaved a whooping 11 mbs off the total machine code size and bought us enough runway to keep development going.<p>&gt; This terrified the Swift compiler engineers, they were worried that untested complier pass orders would expose untested bugs<p>This would scare me too.<p>&gt; I had privately had the “we need to stop” conversation with my director.
