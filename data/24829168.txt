For now, these are the allegations against them. Evidence would be introduced at trial and the prosecutors would be loathe to introduce any evidence that exposes &quot;sources and methods&quot; of intelligence. And the defendants will likely never set foot in a place where they could be extradited to stand trial.<p>So, sort of a paper tiger.<p>Does the US Government (as represented by these prosecutors) have a good faith belief these individuals committed these crimes? Probably, though you might believe otherwise. I would say my trust is very high in that statement, despite everything else going on in politics right now. The government doesn&#x27;t make indictments like this lightly, and the grand jury saw at least enough evidence to establish probable cause. At the same time, there is a saying about ham sandwiches and indictments.<p>Will we ever see the underlying evidence? I doubt we will.<p>Should we trust the US Government&#x27;s representations in this case? Again, I would - but you may have priors to suggest you shouldn&#x27;t.')
