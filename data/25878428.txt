Shoddy software design has been bailed out time and time again by Moore&#x27;s law. I&#x27;m excited by the prospect of a software industry where &quot;tell the client to buy a faster computer&quot; is no longer an acceptable excuse.<p>For example, there&#x27;s room for a clean, native cross-platform application toolkit that does everything that electron does. But we don&#x27;t have that. Instead application developers use electron (trading my CPU &amp; RAM for their time). And people get angry at Apple for &quot;only&quot; shipping 16 gigabytes of RAM in their computers rather than angry at lazy app developers. And we don&#x27;t invest in the tooling we&#x27;d need to actually fix the problem. (In this case, Electron but small and native).<p>Another example - as an industry we know how to make fast compilers (eg Go, Jai, V8, LuaJIT, etc). But instead most new languages (rust, pony, zig, etc) are built on top of LLVM. LLVM used to be super fast - but now even in debug mode its sluggish.<p>There&#x27;s usually nothing wrong with old computers &amp; phones, but we throw them out anyway because software developers buy faster computers then take shortcuts.')
