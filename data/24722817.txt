Will the status quo be ok, and will it therefore be ok to ban political activity in the workplace?<p>The problem with the view that activism is ok if the current administration is objectionable is that the &quot;status quo&quot; changes from cycle to cycle.<p>Presidential politics is only a very small part of political activity in the US (though it is the most visible). What if your frame of reference is state and local politics? Is political activism in the workplace ok if you don&#x27;t like the local school board?')
