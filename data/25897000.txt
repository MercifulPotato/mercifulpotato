Keep in mind that under reasonable assumptions, half of those people are false positives. A portion of them will falsely test positive again. However, some of the true dog test positives (anywhere between 2% - 25% of them) will falsely test negative. Therefore, this strategy will result in more infected people not being quarantined.')
