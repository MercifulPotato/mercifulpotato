At some point in the future the work is done and the car shipped. Doesn&#x27;t seem like a useful construct, everything is subtractive then.<p>Just like a software project if someone does shoddy parts of the car it will greatly detract from the value of the car even if the other 99% are in stellar condition. That is true for almost everything, the weakest link mostly determines the quality of your product so to ship good products you need to ensure nobody does shoddy work. The work is still additive though, just that producing shoddy pieces is negative value if quality is so low that it makes the product unsellable.')
