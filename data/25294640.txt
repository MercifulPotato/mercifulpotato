Item(by='csharptwdec19', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607028519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292336, text='&gt; I get that, but I would have thought it would make more sense to approach TimescaleDB for a licensing deal. That way, right from day one they get a mature product with incredible features and performance. And they&#x27;d win developer mindshare by supporting OSS.<p>In their mind, long term, that leaves money on the table. If they entered a licensing deal, they would have exposure risk if they ever wanted to replace it with an in-house product (and, given their corporate culture, an actual legal exposure, intentional or not, is a possibility).')
