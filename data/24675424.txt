The media lab is a tiny part of the smallest school in a very large institution and the sums were correspondingly trivial compared to the institute&#x27;s annual budget.  (even all of education is a small fraction of that budget).<p>It&#x27;s as if Google&#x27;s parking valets were found to be running a car theft ring (made up example): unless Google seemed to think it below their notice, I would have a hard time considering that should be grounds for condemning Google.<p>I&#x27;m not defending MIT (or conflating car theft with sexual abuse) I&#x27;m merely saying that if you want to attack MIT consider something more substantive like its slow progress in recruiting and retaining female scientists; it&#x27;s intimate ties with the government and military (despite various fig leaves assembled over the decades), or its treatment of undergraduates which at best is neglect.  Don&#x27;t waste your efforts on a small, if noisy, lab that has produced negligible research of consequence.')
