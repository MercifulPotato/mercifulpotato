Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602712338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24781502, text='Babylon 5 is a bit of an oddball. They were originally told they&#x27;d have a fifth season. Then they were told they wouldn&#x27;t, so they wrapped it up in season 4 (and season 4 is quite compressed as a result, which might be what you like). Then they ended up getting that fifth season. They used it to do all kinds of fun &#x27;post show&#x27; things.<p>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine went 7 seasons. They could have done it in 3-4; especially if they could have had modern 50-60 HBO-style shows, rather than 35-40 minute network television shows.<p>I&#x27;d like to see creators target 3-4 seasons and contracts be written for them to create all those seasons. The really good, fan-centric ones could then do the Babylon 5 style post-seasons or a contract could be written for additional seasons to cover the next story arc. (I&#x27;m sure this is impossible for some reason, but I can dream.)<p>As things stand, I generally don&#x27;t watch any new show that doesn&#x27;t already have a few seasons under its belt. I really dislike watching a season of a show, falling in love with it, and then finding out its already gotten the axe.')
