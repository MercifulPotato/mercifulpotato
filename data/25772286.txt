Whether or not someone thinks these services are &quot;censoring&quot; things or not isn&#x27;t a real argument, again for the reason it must be a ruling authority that violates law by removing a person&#x27;s speech from a given area or location, which then is censorship.<p>A company can&#x27;t censor someone who is on their platform given the platform is owned, not ruled.')
