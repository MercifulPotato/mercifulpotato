I&#x27;ve never experienced a difference myself. Once methods get big, assuming no usage of IDE functions (regions), going through these large code sequences will quickly fill my mental space, whereas stashing away the code in methods does not.<p>On the flip side, smaller methods do not encourage code duplication and help set up unit testing for those who desire it. There are also arguments to be made depending on language and coding style (e.g. encouraging guarding, early returns and avoiding bracket use and indentation in old imperative-style Java).')
