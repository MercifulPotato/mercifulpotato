I&#x27;d also like to highlight this quote:<p>&gt; <i>With only vibration and light, there simply is nothing there to identify individual shoppers.</i><p>Their approach seems to have some privacy merit, but I&#x27;m a little discouraged to see claims that appear to be salespersonship, not engineering nor science.<p>In addition to what you pointed out (and possibly also correlating &quot;anonymized&quot; shopper with cameras at checkout and&#x2F;or entryways), I&#x27;d also be a little curious about what all is picked up by the vibration sensors.  Can they sense steps&#x2F;gait&#x2F;shoes at all?  Any qualities of voice?<p>And, hypothetically, even if the sensors in the current version could really only detect touching of the product, no matter how much signal processing and ML one throws at it, what happens when there&#x27;s B2B sales incentive to disambiguate movement of individual shoppers, or to link them to identifying info with more accuracy than currently, and quietly upgrading the vibration sensor would enable that?')
