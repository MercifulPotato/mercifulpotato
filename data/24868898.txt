I rank it as some of the softest science fiction I have ever read.  It’s a decent story, but falls heavily into the science as magic trap.<p>Contrast it with say <i>The Cold Equations</i>  which as I recall has FTL and everything else is bog standard physics and yet it was still criticized as unrealistic from an engendering standpoint.  You can’t make that kind of criticism of <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> because everything is handwaved.')
