It&#x27;s like saying that &quot;words are violence&quot; to justify actual violence.<p>To crowd something out means &quot;to push, move, or force (something or someone) out of a place or situation by filling its space&quot;. Youtube videos do not crowd out other youtube videos, there&#x27;s enough space on youtube for everyone.')
