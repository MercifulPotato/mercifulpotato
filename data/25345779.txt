Why is it up to Jeff Dean to publicly represent the company? Pichai appears to be in hiding, as per usual. It&#x27;s astounding how weak he is, especially compared to the very strong decision making that typified life under Larry&#x2F;Sergey&#x2F;Eric.<p>It&#x27;s obvious that people like Gebru terrorise their colleagues by claiming anyone who doesn&#x27;t join their racist jihad against white men are terrible and need to be fired. When Pichai canned Damore he set Google up for a never ending strem of events like this one: he basically told the extremist activist wing of the workforce that they were in charge, not him. Very few tech CEOs in America are more deserving of being replaced than Pichai but given the voting structure of Google stock it&#x27;s hard to see how that can happen.')
