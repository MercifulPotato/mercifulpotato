A large part of why the far right &#x2F; racist movement has grown a lot the past 20 years or so is that their narrative is so simple: &quot;Immigrants have higher crime rates and we&#x27;re taking in more immigrants, which is bad.&quot; Fighting this with nuance and trying to say that statistics is more complicated than that hasn&#x27;t worked. I would say that the public education system needs a complete overhaul to fix this (critical thinking, media literacy and such), but even if that were to happen, it would take 20-30 years.<p>Also, in the end, I don&#x27;t think these type of views causes that much harm. Okay, so a group of people end up being &quot;fake&quot; anti-racists, but it&#x27;s still raising awareness and it might cause people to make slightly different choices in their day-to-day lives. This isn&#x27;t comparable to Kony 2012 where people changed their profile picture on Facebook for literally no effect.')
