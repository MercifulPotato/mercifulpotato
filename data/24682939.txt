One thing I liked about Factorio that I&#x27;m not sure if this has in the main version (or possibly just somewhere I haven&#x27;t discovered yet - ~1 hour in), is the stats feature.<p>I&#x27;d like to see how many blocks of each kind I&#x27;m producing.  I loved driving those metrics up in factorio, and it felt immensely satisfying to raise production to orders of magnitude higher than I previously had them once I was done with some refactoring.<p>Likewise, I feel it would help gameplay to understand the relative throughput of each of each of the pieces.  For example, when painting it seems a few extractors are enough to provide all the paint I need compared to many extractors to get the shapes.  What are the ratios here?  Is painting faster than cutting?  How long does rotating take, etc.')
