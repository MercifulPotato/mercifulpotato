I like both very much.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I would say that the XPS is equal or better quality than the MBP though.<p>The trackpad isn&#x27;t better than the Mac&#x27;s and neither is the case construction.  I prefer the aluminium unibody to the carbon fibre (rubberised plastic) stuck to aluminium plates of the XPS.<p>I really like the XPS though and would buy another if it broke.  i.e. I wouldn&#x27;t buy a Mac to run Linux but when Apple finally stop supporting my MBP I see no reason not to install Linux on it and extend its life.  Especially as I like Linux as a desktop OS.')
