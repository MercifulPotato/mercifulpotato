I think it&#x27;s the amount of mind reading that the author projects on everyone. The author writes as if she understands other people better than they understand themselves. Everyone gets taken down a notch with some mind reading from the author, such as the forum member who had &quot;mommy issues&quot; to the conclusion that the primary reason MetaFilter users disliked her was that she &quot;scared the hell out of them&quot; and the assumption that others read her as upper class because she wore a t-shirt and sweatpants.<p>The mind reading extends all the way to the reader, with a veiled suggestion that the author&#x27;s own mental models are superior to the reader&#x27;s &quot;broken&quot; mental models:<p>&gt; I encourage you to see this as a heavy dose of reality concerning where your mental models are broken. The only cure for what ails you is to start getting over your delusions and start adjusting your mental models to come up with a more accurate understanding of reality.<p>There are some interesting points in this writing, along with some thought-provoking perspectives on the nature of homelessness in America.')
