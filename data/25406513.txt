They also have to prove that there was no lawful configuration for those items. For example, you can own a short barreled upper with a pistol-compliant lower and also own a complete rifle. You have the same parts that could build an SBR, but they have a lawful configuration so you aren&#x27;t in violation unless you actually put them together in that way.<p>This theory doesn&#x27;t generally apply to 80% stock because the finished product is lawful (non-prohibited people can build their own guns). Also, the frame&#x2F;reciever is the &quot;firearm&quot; regardless of the other parts, so it doesn&#x27;t matter if they are selling it alone or with additional parts.<p>For example, if a felon is in possession of just a finished frame, they would go to prison just the same as if it were a completed gun. This could also be a scenario where constructive intent could come into play - where the finished product would not be lawful to own for the felon (that&#x27;s the case for the frame without the parts too). So there&#x27;s really no legal difference between selling just the frame kit or the full parts kit.')
