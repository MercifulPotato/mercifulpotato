That said, what you can do is:<p>- Provide a plan that fit within common purchasing card limits&#x2F;tiers, to enable those who want to bypass the internal controls of their purchasing department and just slip it in on an expense report and be done with it.<p>- Provide a plan that adds several zeros, to make it worth the hassle when you get a customer that <i>does</i> try to go through the official purchasing department process. This will entail contract reviews, security&#x2F;compliance certifications&#x2F;audits, invoicing hassles, ongoing support requests (you will get lots of emails, even for things that could trivially be self-serviced by the client), etc. You&#x27;ll be sinking lots of labor into this process regardless of the price tag, so make it worth it.')
