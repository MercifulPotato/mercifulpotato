I unfortunately don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have time to answer everyone but feel free to reply to this comment if you&#x27;d like to ask me anything.<p>It seems like the article was a bit polarizing, some of the comments made me realize I made a few imprecise statements and I&#x27;ll fix those. Other comments didn&#x27;t approve of my tone and that&#x27;s a bit harder to fix since I tried writing this article in the same way I usually speak. I&#x27;ve written a lot of more dry content for my robotics ebook and I was purposeful in trying something different for this article.<p>Some of the comments actually generalized my observations to management and software more generally and it&#x27;s always nice to see people taking my ideas further than I thought they could go.<p>One major thing I&#x27;d like to point out is I don&#x27;t think &quot;ML is dumb&quot; is the right conclusion, there are lots of incentives making it so more of ML is stagnating but this is certainly not true for the field at large. Interesting ideas need to involve a certain amount of risk. The latter half of my article showcases a few ML adjacent projects which I think are absolutely fascinating.<p>And if you&#x27;re interested in reading more stuff by me my robotics and machine learning ebook is very easy to read <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;robotoverlordmanual.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;robotoverlordmanual.com&#x2F;</a> and will teach you all you need to start building robots at home')
