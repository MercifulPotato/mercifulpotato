Item(by='wolverine876', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607751244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391186, text='As I pointed out regarding Musk&#x27;s move, it&#x27;s the companies with the strongest links with reactionary politics (and Trump): Thiel&#x2F;Palantir, Musk, Ellison&#x2F;Oracle. Does HPE somehow fit that mold?<p>For the sake of their many stakeholders, I hope the CEOs are not overreacting to the reactionary idea bubble - that they are not taking too seriously what is political rhetoric - or acting for political purposes. Many people do not share their political views.<p>It also matches the corporate outrage &#x2F; take-my-ball-and-go strategy: If someone dares to regulate or tax a company - the outrage! - they say they are leaving. Think of Amazon in France and other places (IIRC Philadelphia passed a law requiring businesses to take cash and Amazon threatened to leave, then backed down). Think of Uber and Lyft in California. It&#x27;s childish and I think if someone called them on it, it would be revealed for what it is. It&#x27;s not clear to me how it&#x27;s good for society that they don&#x27;t have to contribute and pay their share.<p>Finally, where will these companies recruit from? The University of Texas is pretty good, but not close to the level of Berkley and Stanford, two of the top ~6 schools in the world. Also, many more people want to live in the Bay Area than Austin in general, and IT professionals want to be in SV where the center of their industry is. Austin is nice but simply is not real competition.')
