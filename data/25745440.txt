That might make it a lot more likely to be used by people, because it is all nice and stand-alone.<p>Who would benefit from this most? Is the benefit so diffuse it would almost have to be an open-source project without funding? Or could there be parties that see enough of an advantage to fund this?<p>I guess you could try and get a certain instruction set vendor (probably RISC-V, maybe ARM or x86 based) to have this as a boost for their chips. I guess the &quot;functions are pointers to blocks&quot; compilation could benefit from hardware acceleration.')
