An early multiuser computer system did fine with a small number of users, but choked when one more was added, above a certain threshold. &quot;No problem&quot;, said some wag &quot;just find where that threshold is stored and increase it.&quot; The joke, of course, is that the number didn&#x27;t exist as an explicitly-realized value; it emerged as a phenomenon out of how the system as a whole ran.<p>When you are in pain, your conscious mind - an emergent phenomenon from the physical processes of your body (primarily the brain), or so I suspect - observes itself. There is nothing mysterious in systems observing themselves; that&#x27;s what a computer doing when it raises and responds to a segfault, for example.')
