They have limited used only in defensive warfare if they don&#x27;t have to move. If they move, they are quickly destroyed.<p>Russia has no logistical capacity to move any of those weapons far beyond it&#x27;s borders like it had in Soviet Era.  They could do single assault with 50-70k troops 300 km from their borders but they could not rotate or supply them or provide enough air cover.')
