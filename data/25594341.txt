When editing a comment, the textarea is tiny and placed in a pop-up, instead of in the page. Can&#x27;t resize that to see the comment better.<p>2. After disabling shortcut overrides, the shortcuts are simply disabled, along with the default browser behaviour for them.<p>3. Refreshing a page resets scroll-status. Seriously, webdevs, stop hijacking normal browser scroll behaviour. You always make it worse, never better.<p>4. If your login session times out when you&#x27;re writing a comment, you can&#x27;t publish it, but the error message isn&#x27;t clear about the reason why. There was some button in the error message that caused you to lose the entire contents of the comment you were writing. Happened to me several times after writing comments 8+ paragraphs long. It&#x27;s infuriating.')
