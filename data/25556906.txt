Had I actually bought mine instead of passing on it I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with a refund, Watchdogs Legion had similar bugs, too, and Online play is still not available which was a critical part of its selling point, but pretty much went under the media&#x27;s radar.<p>Instead the producer just reduced the price by 30% in less than 2 months since it&#x27;s release, which if they reduced the expansion&#x2F;DLC too it would totally be forgiven until Online play is available.<p>What I personally don&#x27;t get after not gaming for nearly a decade is this new ever extractive business model of expansions and DLC they created; you pay ~$60 for a game on release day only to have to pay even more for Online play (Sony+) and then pay the game creators even more for DLC to give the game more play until it can be played Online.<p>I get micro-transactions (less than a dollar) for in game skins or something equally as trivial, but $30 more for something that should have been sold is why I think I&#x27;m too old and have way more interesting stuff to spend my money on to care for this stuff anymore. And I&#x27;m their &#x27;prime demographic.&#x27; It&#x27;s no longer just nickle and diming you to keep things going, its asking someone to pay sums that exceed the actual game cost just to use it as it was intended and otherwise succumbing to software based planned-obsolesce.<p>It&#x27;s absurd, my PS4 Pro came with Mortal Kombat 11 as a bundle and I was a die hard MK fan as a kid and I had all the games up until PS2, so when I inserted the game I noticed 1&#x2F;2 the characters on the screen were missing and I thought I got a demo instead of the real thing only to look it up online and realize that you have to buy those characters as an add-on. So, I never bothered to play it and just saw the fatalities and brutalities online which is what all I really wanted to see anyway.')
