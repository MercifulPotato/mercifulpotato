I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb here and assume they chose black for a reason; many plastics degrade in sunlight; adding carbon black is an effective way to make plastic more resilient to UV.  Probably this boat would degrade if left out in the sun for too long, particularly if it wasn&#x27;t black.  But a black boat is going to be pretty damn unpleasant to be on in sunny warm weather anyway; it would be like a solar cooker.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem like the future of boat building to me.')
