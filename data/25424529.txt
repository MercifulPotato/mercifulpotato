That&#x27;s reasonable. He can refuse to object to others of the same sexuality not so much having it publicised but having their heads cut off with a sword. That&#x27;s his choice.<p>If he choses both at the same time, everyone will draw the obivous inference about his principles or lack of them.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;whataboutism&quot; it is literally the same man being judged against one principle that he applies with strength to himself, using the power he weilds as a senior manager of other people&#x27;s assets and simultaneously he applies not at all to others who are having a much worse time of it. I call that unprincipled. You can draw your own conclusions. That&#x27;s completely fine.')
