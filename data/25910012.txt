Is there any research into whether people trained on some software consider it more reliable than people thrown into it?<p>In the 2018 thread someone writes[2] &quot;<i>but if I sit down with a new user for an hour, they discover all the bugs I knew about and a few I didn’t! But an hour of someone’s time is hard to get</i>&quot;; but the internet is full of people clamouring to give feedback about your code, desperate for someone - anyone - to listen. An hour of someone&#x27;s time is hard to get, are you kidding me? I&#x27;ve spent hours challenging myself to find hundreds of nitpicks in something, for free, just because they asked. What did they do with it? Ignore it. More zeitgeisty look at the &quot;MS Teams is slow&quot; complaints, thousands of upvotes on UserVoice, one reply &quot;we&#x27;re working on it&quot;. Stuck that way for years.<p>It&#x27;s not hard to get feedback, you don&#x27;t <i>want</i> feedback because you don&#x27;t have time or interest or spare effort or motivation to fix all the bugs, you have more fun things to do - more interesting, higher priority, more defensible. It&#x27;s way better to have forum users pass around the Chinese Whispers of their grandfather&#x27;s command line which he found on a BugZilla comment on an unrelated issue, which came from a mailing list, which came from an unsourced email from an internal chatroom where they found it in a fossil,,, than it is to fix that edge case. Users telling each other to clear the PRAM and run &quot;sfc &#x2F;scannow&quot; and &quot;chmod 777 -R&quot; and &quot;setenforce 0&quot; costs you nothing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.dribbble.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;6205&#x2F;screenshots&#x2F;5556008&#x2F;penrose-triangle.gif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.dribbble.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;6205&#x2F;screenshots&#x2F;5556008&#x2F;penr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16866679" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16866679</a>')
