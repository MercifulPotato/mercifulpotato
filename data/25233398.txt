I memorized everything without understanding anything. I got through AP calculus (and got a 5 on the exam but I honestly didn&#x27;t really understand any of it). I didn&#x27;t take any math in college. I can&#x27;t help but feel like I missed out on great beauty. I was looking at an explanation of one of Euclid&#x27;s proofs and this made me want to take action.<p>I have almost none of the building blocks. Can anyone refer me to a book that starts from the very building blocks of math (I assume things like prime numbers) and the simplest logic and builds off these first principles to create understanding?<p>I understand this probably doesn&#x27;t exist, but is there anything close?')
