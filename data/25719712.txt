If they relied heavily on specific services provided by AWS, they would need to either recreate them or reengineer their code to do things differently.<p>These are on an entirely differently level of &quot;just make your own&quot; from &quot;make your own payment network&quot;.<p>Unless, that is, there is no hosting service that will have them (and maybe no colo facility that will allow them presence). If so, then I would view the situations as essentially equivalent.')
