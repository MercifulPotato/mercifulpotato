I&#x27;ve heard this used as an argument for variable&#x2F;dynamic speed limits which are changed on factors such as road conditions and visibility.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speed_limit#Variable_speed_limits" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Speed_limit#Variable_speed_lim...</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0001457517302270" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S00014...</a><p>† <i>Numberphile</i> has an interesting video on the topic: if a blue car is doing 70 (units&#x2F;hour) and manages to <i>just</i> stop before an obstacle, what would happen to an <i>identical model&#x2F;mass</i> red car going 100? Even though the red car was going only 30% faster, at the point that the blue car managed to (<i>just</i>) stop, the red car would be going 70.<p>The energy scrubbed from a starting speed of 70 is 70^2, so 4900; but going at 100 you have 10&#x27;000 energy (100^2): so if both cars managed to scrub ~5000 worth of energy, the blue car stopped, but the red car still at 5000 worth of energy left—i.e., 70 units&#x2F;hour of speed.‡<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kottke.org&#x2F;18&#x2F;02&#x2F;why-speeding-is-so-dangerous" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kottke.org&#x2F;18&#x2F;02&#x2F;why-speeding-is-so-dangerous</a><p>‡ If you had the same blue&#x2F;red cars going 55 and 100, while the red car would been going &#x27;only&#x27; twice as fast, it would have had <i>three times</i> the kinetic energy because of 55^2 versus 100^2.')
