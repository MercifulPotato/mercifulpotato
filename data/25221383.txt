I agree it may not be worthwile for a chip developer or a documentation writer to spend their full time on doing support - but a set amount of time, say four or eight hours a week? That&#x27;s direct, unfiltered input from the customers where the documentation is either missing, unclear or buggy.”<p>I agree that direct experience with customers is good for many engineers.  It is definitely not good for <i>all</i> engineers.<p>However there is a huge difference between professional customers and hobbyists.<p>You are now taking about a multi-tiered support organization.<p>You personally may be willing to spend 200 euros per hour for access to such an organization.<p>The question is, are there enough customers like you to justify millions of Euros in investment to build such an organization.<p>Starting from the hourly rate <i>you personally think engineers should be paid</i> gives exactly zero information about the demand, and therefore zero information about whether such a rate is meaningful.')
