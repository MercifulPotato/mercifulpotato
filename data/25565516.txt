If I had access to a facial recognition system, I would use it as a whittling down tool, to reduce the amount of hay to find the needle in. But they clearly see a straw and conclude that it is a needle.<p>It&#x27;s like giving a four year old a handgun. It&#x27;s just not responsible. They&#x27;re just not as good at this as I am. So no handgun for you.<p>It&#x27;s a pity. Ideally you should be able to discriminate, and intelligent police should be given the tool, and stupid police not. However, because stupid police and smart police exist in an emulsion, it is better to just waste the time of the smart police than to give the stupid police too powerful a tool.')
