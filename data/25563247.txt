They somewhat at first said they&#x27;d help negotiate, but then had to tend to other things. We were so close to a deal, but my recruiter didn&#x27;t want to go that extra mile. So, they made $0 since no conversion. (And I was only looking for 15% additional compensation -- I wasn&#x27;t asking for the moon here).<p>They went so far, to only drop the ball at the very end. I understand third-party (kind I was working with) and in-house recruiters operate a little differently, but I still found this surprising.')
