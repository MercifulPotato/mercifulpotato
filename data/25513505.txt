A lot of the statements were superficial things that you&#x27;ll pick up while working on adjacent areas (and as we know, it&#x27;s pretty easy to jump around different teams&#x2F;fields in Amazon) or from Amazonian friends.<p>Interesting things he didn&#x27;t really talk much about: Alexa (there was 1 like 1 very superficial reference to it), Kuiper, and others.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a PR piece, and most likely it is not approved by the company (the reference about Jeff&#x27;s Sex Life would&#x27;ve been removed). This does feel like a real view from an insider, it&#x27;s very opinionated, and not all of it is right.')
