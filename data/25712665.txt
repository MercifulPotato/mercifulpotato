I don&#x27;t think they &quot;collude&quot; in the traditional sense.<p>But every time one of the entities takes some decision or step or action, whether censorship or otherwise, it makes it a little bit more excusable and easier for others to do it and justify it.<p>E.g. (hypothetical)<p>1. Reddit bans &#x2F;r&#x2F;ABC for &quot;TOS violations&quot;.<p>2. It&#x27;s news and many reporters report on it across various articles. Some say it&#x27;s due to &quot;repeated&quot; &quot;alleged&quot; &quot;hate speech&quot; violations, whether true or not. Probably 50% true, who knows.<p>3. ABC makes its own website and has a mailing list from some mail newsletter provider X because that&#x27;s just what you do when you have a site and need to keep in touch with visitors&#x2F;members.<p>4. Activists on Twitter notice. Outrage mob starts. &quot;@X mail provider hosting known hate-speech movement&quot; &quot;@X mail provider...did you know you&#x27;re hosting known white supremacists?&quot; &quot;Everybody, please stop using @X, they&#x27;re supporting white supremacists!&quot; &quot;@AWS please look into what @X is using your infrastructure for!&quot; ...all citing some selective articles as legitimacy.<p>5. Articles get written about a &quot;movement&quot; to have X drop service for controversial and &quot;alleged&quot; hate-speech website ABC.<p>6. X mail provider gets pressured and eventually drops service to ABC.<p>At this point, X mail provider probably won&#x27;t get many &quot;legitimate&quot;, &quot;official&quot; and &quot;mainstream&quot; criticisms for effectively dropping customers (even if all the mail sent by those customers on X&#x27;s platform is 100% legal and innocent). Nor can their shareholders complain about losing profit because &quot;we can&#x27;t be seen supporting racists&quot;.<p>The problem is that each time this sort of thing happens, it adds &quot;partial proof&quot; of the accusations without an actual &quot;court-like&quot; process that decides if it&#x27;s really true or not. After a certain point, it&#x27;s just accepted and then carries an aura of truth&#x2F;legitimacy.<p>Edit. Formatting.')
