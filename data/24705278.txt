When people spend 10 years in some place, the perspective changes a bit. It does become a complicated issue, with moral overtones too.<p>Make the goddamn greencard approval (or rejection) faster. If processing the papers took a few months, instead of years, after which you got your yea or nay decision, then the whole issue would be much simpler - and, indeed, as you say it would not be a moral issue at all.<p>But think of someone who spent here 10 years, brought their spouse here, had a couple kids (that clock doesn&#x27;t stop ticking just because you&#x27;re waiting for a rubber stamp to hit the paper), the kids go to school, and from a cultural perspective the kids are American - and then they are all told to get the hell out of here. That&#x27;s terrible.<p>Speed up that stupid process. Then sure, tweak the rules any way you see fit.')
