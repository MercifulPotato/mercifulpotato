Mental health, unemployment, pregnancy that year, international travel but still a citizen, w&#x2F;e. As soon as you start pointing to reasons that a government can&#x2F; can&#x27;t take away your power to vote you are screwed as a populace. Not that i have much faith in the voting system anyways cause&#x27; who knows how they count the votes anyways.
