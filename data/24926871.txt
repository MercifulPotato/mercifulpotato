The back-and-forth, even with campy insults, creates a framework for understanding the key points and evolution of the disagreement.<p>Using more forceful, even facetiously <i>disrespectful</i> language expands the range of imagery&#x2F;metaphor&#x2F;emotion that can be deployed, often to humorous or insightful effect. It makes conversations, whether live in person or slowly over months of counter-performances, more <i>memorable</i>.<p>If such talk rubs a few people the wrong way, out of some expansive concern for targets who do not themselves find the tone&#x2F;language objectionable, I&#x27;d love to find a place where those people can be comfortable.<p>But I don&#x27;t want to sabotage the value of the free-to-all discourse for the much <i>larger</i> group of people who find vibrant, disputative, raw communication – even to the point of prickliness – more efficient and preferable.<p>We&#x27;re losing something if we require all speech to be sanitized for maximal gentility under new secular Sunday School rules.')
