I started out by manipulating simple games in qbasic. Then switched to Visual Basic and made my first serious yet small projects. In the meantime got into web design and always thought I was doing something wrong when creating a UI with HTML &amp; co - so painful compared to the drag and drop UI creation in Visual Studio. Same when I&#x27;ve learned Java: UI creation was a nightmare.\nSorry for going off rails...QBasic was just awesome!')
