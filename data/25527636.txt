MuZero does its planning entirely in its own latent space (it may not even actually think of the game in terms of &#x27;moves&#x27; but in whatever steps it considers relevant instead), only the output is filtered for legal moves.<p>It&#x27;s no different than a monkey operating a chess computer that makes sure the monkey only performs legal moves. Your suggestion would be akin to suggesting that the chess computer would be affecting the monkey&#x27;s mind so that it can only think in terms of legal chess moves.')
