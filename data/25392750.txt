They explicitly say so:<p><i>&quot;The authors observed that neither symptoms nor blood investigations were predictive of organ impairment.<p>“Causality of the relationship between organ impairment and infection cannot be deduced, but may be addressed by longitudinal follow-up of individuals with organ impairment,” the authors said.&quot;</i><p>The paper took 201 people who self-reported as long Covid sufferers, and found that 66% of them had <i>something</i> that could be characterized as &quot;organ impairment&quot; when a whole-body MRI scan was conducted. It&#x27;s not at all clear that this would differ significantly from any random group of people whom you stick in a whole-body MRI scan (let alone a group of people who had recently recovered from <i>any other</i> viral illness). Which is why we don&#x27;t do them.<p>Thus far, ~all such &quot;long Covid&quot; research has been anecdotal and&#x2F;or uncontrolled. The evidence quality is quite poor.')
