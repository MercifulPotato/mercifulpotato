This is doubly true during the past year when they&#x27;ve had to re work plans so that they work over zoom or in person.<p>I think perhaps the point of friction is that all of this is true and the city can&#x27;t afford to pay them more, so they get other concessions.<p>I fundamentally disagree with your claim about lack of innovation - in a public high school 15 years ago your story doesn&#x27;t ring true, much less seeing my friends who are teachers talking about lesson plans today.')
