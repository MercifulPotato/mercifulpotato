With Wordpress I &quot;Just&quot; use Dreamhost and do a one-click install.<p>The trick with Wordpress is to accept that somethings wont be as slick as if you spent $1-10k of your own time building  perfect static site generator and customising it beautifully. You have to do what most non-IT people do and make do. But I feel like I rarely have to make do with Wordpress - I can get speed, I can customise a bit with PHP sometimes (although I avoid that) and there are a tonne of plugins.<p>You can build many &quot;no-code&quot; level solutions in Wordpress for free.')
