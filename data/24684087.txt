I&#x27;ve always longed for a class called &quot;differential reasoning&quot; that focuses on building differential equations, proofs with differentials, and tricky arguments and mathematical justifications for all the stuff physics professors say &quot;is technically invalid, but works&quot;.<p>In my engineering program, they did something like this, though it was weak on the differential reasoning part.  And heavy in hand-coding numerical solvers in FORTRAN.')
