My anger at censorship is coming out. The proper academic term is postmodernist; at least that&#x27;s what the Cynical Theories book by Primose mentioned.<p>I told my husband I would stop looking at Twitter since it upsets me so I&#x27;m handcuffed to find specific proof there. But, I was primarily referring to the list tweet where AOC mentioned gathering republicans who worked for Trump. There have been other similar sentiments expressed by her to punish people over time; she has an activist side which can get aggressive for a Congresswoman.<p>To be fair AOC isn&#x27;t the worse I&#x27;ve seen as far as Twitter threats. The worst I&#x27;ve seen is the guy who acted like the controversial professional Mike Adams&#x27;s suicide was good who is currently a North Carolina professor. Also, there were tweets against Rand Paul which were violent after he got attacked by a neighbor. There have also been tweets for years mostly by random accounts threatening Trump; Gab has organized all the data.')
