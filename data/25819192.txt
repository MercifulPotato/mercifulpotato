Something that has struck me recently are the government-led educational efforts focused on nutrition for infants and children.<p>My daughter and one-year-old grandson live with me, and ever since he started eating solid food she has been feeding him exclusively homemade, vegetable-centric meals. When preparing the food, especially at first, she referred to guidelines for <i>ri’nyū shoku</i> (“weaning food”) in the Maternal and Child Health Handbook issued by the government for all babies [0, 1] as well as some cookbooks she bought. The emphasis of <i>ri’nyū shoku</i> guidance is on handmade, nonprocessed food; my daughter has yet to buy any commercial babyfood. She hasn&#x27;t been able to have much interaction with other young parents (for obvious reasons), so I don&#x27;t know how typical her approach to babyfood is. But my impression is that she is not unusual.<p>For older children, the government promotes something called <i>shokuiku</i> (food and nutrition education, [2]) that is incorporated into the school curriculum and is coordinated with the food that children actually eat at school. (Most schoolchildren eat school-supplied hot lunches.)<p>The specific guidelines for <i>ri’nyū shoku</i> and <i>shokuiku</i> seem to reflect both scientific research on nutrition and a nationalist nostalgia for traditional Japanese diet and eating customs.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.med.or.jp&#x2F;english&#x2F;journal&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2010_04&#x2F;259_265.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.med.or.jp&#x2F;english&#x2F;journal&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2010_04&#x2F;259_265.pd...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstage.jst.go.jp&#x2F;article&#x2F;jaih&#x2F;27&#x2F;2&#x2F;27_121&#x2F;_pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstage.jst.go.jp&#x2F;article&#x2F;jaih&#x2F;27&#x2F;2&#x2F;27_121&#x2F;_pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maff.go.jp&#x2F;e&#x2F;policies&#x2F;tech_res&#x2F;shokuiku.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.maff.go.jp&#x2F;e&#x2F;policies&#x2F;tech_res&#x2F;shokuiku.html</a>')
