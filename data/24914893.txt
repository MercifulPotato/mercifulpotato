Simplest example is: in the absence of glucose&#x2F;glycogen, our body converts fat to ketones for energy and&#x2F;or protein to glucose. But unused glucose gets converted to fat and stored, whereas unused ketones get peex out - there is no process to store them again.<p>Unless you check ketones, a body in ketosis used to HIIT will seem to defy cico balance. And many times even when not in ketosis.<p>Popular thermodynamics (Carb=Protein=4, Fat=9, etc) is useful as a first order approximation but requires so many wrong assumptions that it cannot be assumed to hold in any particular case.')
