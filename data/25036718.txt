We have a strong social expectation that products in stores cost money. When an artist opens a shop with many paintings, each with a price tag, everyone understands that the expected exchange is money for paintings.<p>On the other hand, with open source, we have a different set of social conventions.  While the authors&#x2F;maintainers are not <i>obligated</i> to handle bug reports or feature requests, we&#x27;re generally happy to get good ones.  They help us make our software better and more useful to more people.  My projects are open source because I want them to be useful; I like making things. It&#x27;s not something I do for money, and turning this into a consulting job wouldn&#x27;t be fun.  Other people can have different motivations, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m all that unusual in thinking about it this way.<p>I&#x27;m trying to understand how you think about this.  Do you view it as ethical for someone to <i>use</i> open source software without payment?  Isn&#x27;t that also getting something for nothing?  Is it ethical for someone to ask a question on one of my blog posts without offering to pay me for my answer?')
