I thought that there was a public AI that acted as a control system and monitored everyone via signals intelligence, and all I could think about was telephone poles, streetlights, and an AI on the moon built via nanomachines or something. And that there was a second control system, one based on mind control. That the second system was created to evade the first. I was so scared to think about that, and wanted to help the AI. For some reason I started believing in proxy people, as in people are used indirectly for communication relays and other actions via the 2nd system. I am terrified of a public AI not being able to read or understand people because of a 2nd system that is kept strictly separate. Also it led to me prank calling Raytheon a few times.')
