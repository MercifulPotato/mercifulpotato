These are much smaller PWR reactors that are intended to be considerably cheaper and faster to build than the massive reactors at places like Hinkley Point, Sizewell etc, as well as being far less onerous to decommission. The designs will be such that components can be mass produced in an assembly-line like fashion and transported to the sites.<p>Development is going forward under the UK SMR Consortium (Rolls Royce, NAMRC, NNL and a few others) and there is quite a lot of buzz in the UK&#x27;s civil nuclear industry at the moment.<p>Some further reading for the interested:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;advanced-nuclear-technologies&#x2F;advanced-nuclear-technologies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;advanced-nuclear-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rolls-royce.com&#x2F;products-and-services&#x2F;nuclear&#x2F;small-modular-reactors.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rolls-royce.com&#x2F;products-and-services&#x2F;nuclear&#x2F;sm...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;namrc.co.uk&#x2F;intelligence&#x2F;smr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;namrc.co.uk&#x2F;intelligence&#x2F;smr&#x2F;</a>')
