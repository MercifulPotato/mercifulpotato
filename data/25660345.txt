I also used it when I started &quot;living&quot; in emacs about 12 years back. I had SES worksheets for various things I&#x27;d often use Excel for. One was a stock tracker (downloaded data periodically form Yahoo! Finance), a tax estimator, a paystub tracker, a budget, leave tracker. Some were just worksheets for work problems (had a set of formulae and equations related to test cases, plug in numbers and determine what the expected output should be, or reverse it plug in received output and see what input should recreate it).<p>If you use org-mode, it has its own format for doing the same thing:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org&#x2F;worg&#x2F;org-tutorials&#x2F;org-spreadsheet-intro.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org&#x2F;worg&#x2F;org-tutorials&#x2F;org-spreadsheet-intro...</a><p>If I use emacs-as-a-spreadsheet, I tend to the latter anymore since I org-mode is my primary use of emacs anymore (with org-babel for editing source code).')
