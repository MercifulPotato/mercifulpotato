It also, currently at least, produces a less useful concrete, as it isn&#x27;t as strong.<p>The question is what is the net environmental and CO₂ impact when you also include the inputs.<p>One area where this new process has a positive impact:\n* No need for virgin river sand, although it is unclear if desert sand could be used. At least this would be a good way to &quot;recycle&quot; concrete, which is notoriously hard to re-use.<p>One area where it has a negative impact:\n* This concrete is no longer vegan friendly. Although to be fair, many plantation woods are not strictly vegan either, since may plantations directly lead to a lowering of biodiversity and&#x2F;or loss of animal habitat. Sand mining is also typically not &quot;victimless&quot;.\n* Requires a more diverse input&#x2F;supply chain. Although the article doesn&#x27;t really go into the impacts of this, so it&#x27;s hard to estimate how bad this is. For example, do we need a kg of gelatine per kg of concrete, or per tonne of concrete?')
