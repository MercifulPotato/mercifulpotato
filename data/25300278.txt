What&#x27;s it gonna be?<p>There&#x27;s a POV that, on the internet, &quot;anything goes&quot;, i. e. whatever you can do, you&#x27;re allowed to do.<p>Then, there&#x27;s a perspective that works a lot like the offline world, where any clear communication that a reasonable person would understand as denying them access becomes legally binding.<p>In the offline world, we derive great benefit from following the second model. Indeed, if only measures that successfully prevent people from entering your house without permissions were to count, you wouldn&#x27;t need laws in the first place! You would, however, need a bunker. Which is quite a bit more expansive than a functioning legal system.<p>In that offline world, we have created all sorts of additional rules to balance rights for specific situations, and we rely on a canon of <i>expectations</i> that say, for example, that it&#x27;s usually not ok to enter a private house, but you don&#x27;t need explicit permission to enter a supermarket.<p>These are still developing for the online world, and your idea of the &quot;ecosystem&quot; hints at that. But you&#x27;re just taking from those contradictory ideas above to arrive at the outcome you intuitively feel is &quot;just&quot;: a bit of might-is-right when it comes to &quot;whatever is online is fair game&quot;, followed by principled ideas of rights and obligations when websites try to defend themselves in that jungle of yours.<p>What&#x27;s really needed is something that can, for example, distinguish between a journalist scraping Facebook to map out a terror network vs. some other entity scraping Facebook to sell your embarrassing photos to the highest bidder ten years down the road.')
