If a regulation were imposed, people would feel a need to comply. If they said to block transactions from Iran, on penalty of imprisonment, then they would do so. Etc.

Adding all of the features and drawbacks of existing systems into bitcoin would undermine bitcoin&#x27;s reason for existence.<p>Centralization at every layer of bitcoin has been the rule. Mining, exchanges, etc. Their dominance is so complete that if only a few of the primary exchanges were to blacklist an individual, they would have a very difficult time. In the same way that Mastercard and VISA banning PornHub is a major harm to that website.<p>Censorship-resistance is thus out the window, and there really isn&#x27;t that many benefits left for bitcoin after that.')
