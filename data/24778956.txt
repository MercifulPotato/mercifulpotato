The Quest is a headset and two controllers you put it on and pick the controllers up, draw a room boundary and you&#x27;re in. Works in any room in your house, completely stand alone.<p>Index requires you to install multiple sensors in a specific room in your house, and requires a connection to a desktop PC tower and fiddling around with Steam to play.<p>I think the FB account requirement is incredibly dumb from Oculus (Don&#x27;t understand why it couldn&#x27;t just be a shadow account like Insta&#x2F;Whatsapp which everyone seems fine with weirdly) but really the product their offering is entirely in a class of it&#x27;s own for a fraction of the price a normal VR setup costs and a fraction of the hassle.<p>I think if the market was different and what they were offering wasn&#x27;t unique I think far fewer people would care and we&#x27;d all just buy different headsets.')
