I actually considered buying the bfg edition a while back so I could relive a bit of my childhood. Glad I didn&#x27;t now as they seem to have ruined a lot that was good about Doom 3.<p>Also, whenever I have done that with games it actually ruins the memory. In my memory N64 games looked lifelike. Doom 3 looked like a Pixar movie. I happened to see Goldeneye running on a CRT TV at some hipster gathering and couldn&#x27;t believe how bad it looked. I wish I hadn&#x27;t seen it.')
