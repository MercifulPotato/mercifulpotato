Tall people in the NBA might lead to a more beneficial outcome (more interesting games?) but it does not arise because tall people are more &quot;deserving&quot; of being in the NBA.<p>Since we get to choose how to structure the human sphere of the &quot;game&quot; of life, it seems better to optimize for an outcome that is fair, ie. equally attentive of people&#x27;s moral worth.<p>If that requires giving more $ to some who are more talented in order to better off everyone, then life does seem fair because our society is structured w.r.t. everyone&#x27;s benefit.')
