The package program is just a helper that checks to make sure DIRECTDEPS variables are correct. That&#x27;s the part Google said was tricky back in 2006. Have you ever seen people talk online about how it&#x27;s super difficult to have a single makefile build multiple library files? Particularly static ones? Like the pitfalls of making sure the linker arguments are the correct order, or removing a dependency  from one will break all the others that needed it transitively? This is how it can be done. I found out it just requires following a highly specific convention, where it&#x27;s a little toilsome to type, but so rewarding once it&#x27;s done. It also means I don&#x27;t need to ask users to install a cutting edge build system to build my code, since I&#x27;ve just seen too much drama in that space.')
