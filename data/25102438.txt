We had our last TV over the fireplace for 12 years. Our seating was ~15 feet away, and we did not need to crank our necks to watch TV.<p>I think I&#x27;d be much more critical of those things if I was 20+ years younger, when I was more into &quot;home theater&quot; than I am now, but my attiude nowadays is &quot;if it works for you, who cares what other people think.&quot;')
