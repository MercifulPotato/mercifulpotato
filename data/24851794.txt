I&#x27;ve beaten speeding tickets, I was the victim of an assault where despite video evidence I was given a citation for disorderly conduct. The US  has executed innocent people, recently. It isn&#x27;t even about &#x27;innocent until proven guilty&#x27;...the idea that someone on trial must be guilty of something is incredibly common and deeply problematic for our society, not just our system of justice. It presumes that policing is not just always accurate but automatically accurate. It is propaganda used to marginalize certain communities in a very intentional way.<p>That idea is so incorrect that it is disqualifying from participating in this conversation further.')
