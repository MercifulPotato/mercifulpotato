Especially the key management, the encryption itself is not the issue.<p>s&#x2F;mime is expensive in terms of certificates and difficult to set up. GPG&#x27;s trust chain based on key signing parties has never taken off outside the crypto geek community (Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m one too!)<p>Perhaps a &quot;let&#x27;s encrypt&quot; approach to s&#x2F;mime could work though. I could see that happening. It would indeed solve a lot of issues.')
