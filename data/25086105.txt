Calories in&#x2F;out is the only requirement for weight loss. Calories in&#x2F;out is a percentage of the overall picture we define as &quot;health&quot;.<p>To lose weight, you only have to be at a caloric deficit. You can eat _only_ three cupcakes a day and probably lose weight (unless they&#x27;re kinda insane cupcakes). If you only eat 3 cupcakes a day and nothing else, you will be malnourished and nutrient deficient, which I would extend to mean &quot;unhealthy&quot;, but you will lose weight.')
