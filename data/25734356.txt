He lost and now the Democrats seem to assume that those 75M people will suddenly change their beliefs because 78M people hold different beliefs. Moreover, it seems that people voted <i>against</i> Trump more than <i>for</i> Biden because they thought Trump was rude and distasteful.<p>They fail to recall that this was actually a political route for Democrats. Democrats lost seats in the House when they were expected to gain. They eked out parity in the Senate that probably disappears in 2 years. More importantly, they lost almost all state government races.<p>Remember, Trump&#x27;s biggest policy positions (bring our troops home, bring our jobs back, hard on china, the wall, etc) were all Democrat positions a mere 5-7 years ago. Now that the Republicans have taken over those more centrist ideas, they have gained a huge number of supporters.<p>The Democrats are fractured between centrists and progressives. That fracture is <i>much</i> worse than the Republicans because it is ideological while the Republican fracture is a cult of personality.<p>Trump will fade. Another person will replace him. They will have all of his populism and charm (yes, he&#x27;s a natural entertainer). They won&#x27;t have his rude abrasiveness. He&#x27;ll then have the majority needed to censor the other side now that the Republicans have decided they agree with the progressives on that point.')
