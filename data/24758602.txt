It allows for setting 1 tab = N space. Faster natigation, better search and replace. It expresses intent much better. The issue is that lot of editors, formatters etc implement this so badly that there is little choice for everyone but to be forced to lower yourself to lowest common denominator and use spaces. That giant button taking up so much space on most keyboards largly gets unused :(.')
