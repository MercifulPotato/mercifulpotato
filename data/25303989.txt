This is extreme.<p>&gt; Should I get to choose whether taxes work for me or not?<p>Thinking that no people or entities make the very deliberate choice to not pay any taxes is not only extreme, it&#x27;s blindingly and overwhelmingly untrue. We see people complaining all the time on HN about how Amazon, Walmart, etc., get away with not paying any taxes through their expert utilization of accounting, legal loopholes and insider access.<p>&gt; Should I get to choose whether criminal law works for me or not? Sure be nice to take what I want and shoot anyone who tries to come after me, at least until we&#x27;re all at each others throats.<p>It is indefensibly extreme to suggest this is not happening every day. I just wrote in my prior post how NYC&#x27;s rapid increase in senseless violent crime is the actual pandemic here.<p>This summer during lockdown I was walking back from the grocery store and got randomly assaulted - punched in the face numerous times - by a complete stranger, who took nothing from me before running away. This is happening all the time now - in all regions of the world.<p>&gt; People who are taking unnecessary risks aren&#x27;t just projecting their belief systems onto others, they&#x27;re threatening their health and their lives.<p>You are in no way certified to claim who is taking a risk and what constitutes that being a risk.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s better than not having a society at all<p>What we have now is the absence of society. And it&#x27;s the most wretched, inexcusably grotesque thing I have ever seen governments do to their own citizens.<p>If this is the way life continues on Earth, who will truly want to live on it?')
