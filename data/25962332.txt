Not talking to the cops is an easy policy to adopt if, like most of us, you live in a pretty safe neighborhood with nothing but victimless drug crimes, but a lot of people who have the most reason to fear the police also have the most reason to need them to do their job effectively.  It&#x27;s not so simple for them.  If they talk to the police, maybe they go to jail, but if they don&#x27;t talk to the police, maybe the next house that gets burgled is their mom&#x27;s.  Maybe the next car that gets stolen is theirs.  It&#x27;s a shitty bind to be in.')
