These courses are intended to make sure you&#x27;re well-rounded in your education. But spending more than 50% of the time making sure you&#x27;re well-rounded in Physics is useless for a software engineer. 99.9% of software engineers don&#x27;t use physics in their career (except maybe some game or graphics programming). 99% of software engineers don&#x27;t need Calculus (except maybe for innovating some ML core algorithms).<p>A better way to be a well-rounded software engineer is to make sure graduates know more than just algorithms and a couple of programming languages. They should know Networking, Databases, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Big Data, Distributed Systems, etc. Because of the time spent on general education (that will be forgotten as soon as they graduate), CS graduates are missing out on valuable topics such as those I listed.')
