We&#x27;re working to fix online identity for US government services. The Login.gov team operates like a startup within the government, working in the open as a distributed, agile team. The core product is open source, hosted in modern cloud infrastructure, and built for scale. Tens of millions of people have Login.gov accounts, and we aim to be the preferred entrypoint for all government digital services. Our users include people accessing benefits, applying for government jobs, serving in the military, and collecting funds awarded through grant programs.<p>Find us on Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;18F&#x2F;identity-idp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;18F&#x2F;identity-idp</a><p>The Login.gov project began as a collaboration between 18F and the U.S. Digital Service (USDS).
