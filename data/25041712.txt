They are stuck in usage patterns from their former preferred language.<p>I remember as a Objective-C developer all these Java&#x2F;C++ guys complaining. So often it was because they were trying to use Objective-C as if it was Java or C++.<p>Now as a Julia user I see all these Python guys complaining about stuff which is really about Julia not working like Python.<p>A lot of people just donâ€™t have time for the language they are using. They just want to bang out stuff as quickly as possible in the way they are used to.<p>Not saying that is your case but I have seen plenty of complaints regarding generics in Go which could easily have been solved in other ways if one actually understood the language. Go without generics is not the same as Java without generics.')
