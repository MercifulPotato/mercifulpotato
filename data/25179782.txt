Or a ESL student (english as foreign language, to a native speaker).<p>The wealthy kids, probably went to better schools, had taken PRE-SATS since 8th grade, has tutor, and everything in between to get better.  Poor kids are probably sharing a room with their parents, live in crappy conditions, and have to start working as teens to help out the family economically...<p>All upper middle class folks know this:  the more testing practice you do, the better you become at that test...<p>SAT and IQ tests are a valid tool of measurement when two people have had the same conditions and training.<p>Let me translate into engineering terms:  Two engineers go to interview, one is good and has some great experience, the other one is average, but just LEETCODES for months before the interview.<p>The average engineer gets the job, while the better one might not, as he probably didn&#x27;t solve some Leetcode style of problem fast enough.<p>Im real life scenarios, the good engineer would have outperformed the average one.')
