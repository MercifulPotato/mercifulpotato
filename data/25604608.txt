HPC is not a mass-market, how should this niche be economically viable to amortise the huge cost of processor development? HPC in the US (and other countries) is often connected to military spending (although this is not always openly expressed). Processor development is extremely expensive, to the extent that Intel is now struggling to finance catching up with TSMC&#x27;s fab process.\nWhere is the EU&#x27;s micro-architecture design capacity? ARM is about to be swallowed by Nvidia, and a lot of Arm&#x27;s micro-architecture development is done in the US already. Now compare the micro-architecture design capacity with that in China (the world&#x27;s biggest processor market).<p><pre><code>   I really hope it will work out.\n</code></pre>\nI do too.<p>Given 40 years of failure to catch up with the US, and now China, I am sceptical! I expect this to end up like previous EU attempts at catching up: the monies available will be <i>much</i> smaller than originally announced (by at least an order of magnitude), spent over much longer a time-frame, but more importantly, mostly flow to existing EU-based companies that are good ad lobbying, e.g. Siemens, and French conglomerates.<p>Another prediction: China will soon dominate RISC-V, since they are now forced, by US sanctions, to move away from Arm. I cannot see big Chinese processor companies moving to local ISAs such as Loongson. Alibaba announced a RISC-V processor at ICSA this year [2]. The big US players (Intel, AMD, Nvidia) have much less of a need to move to RISC-V.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Loongson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Loongson</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conferences.computer.org&#x2F;isca&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;ISCA2020-4QlDegUf3fKiwUXfV0KdCm&#x2F;466100a052&#x2F;466100a052.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conferences.computer.org&#x2F;isca&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;ISCA2020-4QlDegUf...</a>')
