You both must be local, which means you have opportunities to hang out and see each other in a wider context than long-distance makes possible.<p>2. Assuming you pick from within your social circle and not random bar hookups, you probably have at least a few friends in common who can vet the match.<p>3. Corollary to 2, if you&#x27;re single and lucky, sometimes friends might play matchmaker, and mutual friends are the best &quot;love algorithm&quot; because they actually know you and give a shit.<p>This is of course on top of avoiding all the dark patterns the dating monopoly inflicts upon its users.')
