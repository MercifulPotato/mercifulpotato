In obfuscation the result comes out clear text. General obfuscation is impossible, but iO gives you basically the best possible result which is &quot;given any method of computing the same function (for some complexity parameter of the function in question) you will always be able learn at least as much from said method as from the obfuscated function&quot; (in other words iO gives you a circuit that is as hard to reverse engineer as the hardest circuit of a given size that computes the same function, but it doesn&#x27;t give you a guarantee on how hard that actually is).')
