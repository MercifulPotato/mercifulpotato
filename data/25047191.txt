Please don&#x27;t try to substitute the argument.<p>&gt; Except you didn&#x27;t stop spreading falsehoods. You&#x27;ve spent more lines lying with your brand new account on HN.<p>I spent much more time researching this project and trying to figure out the least ugly way to fix its problems. This time was effectively wasted. I just wrote my post so someone who faces issues similar to mine will investigate the matter more carefully.<p>&gt; Fixating on hyper specific implementation details taken out of context without considering the design, intent, and usage is not what I call professionalism in the software industry.<p>Ad hominem, moving on.<p>&gt; So packaging problems won&#x27;t exist if we just stick with Docker, but you would use distro packages to create a Docker image? How would that even work?<p>I am not going on to explain how to work with docker, it&#x27;s a mainstream technology that has plenty of documentation and examples.<p>&gt; You see, Please. Stop. Repeating.

This issue is submitted by Nix devs themselves.<p>&gt; The typical Nix way of handling secrets is that you store in them in a secure path and point the configuration to that path.<p>And this is precisely the hack I was talking about. Because of this approach you cannot manage secrets with nix at scale (just to clarify: when I say &quot;nix&quot; I always mean the package manager). This is an issue submitted by core designers.<p>I think we ran out of productive arguments in this conversation.')
