Item(by='wott', descendants=None, kids=[24745092], score=None, time=1602409831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744472, text='&gt; Seriously though, I have a light yellow car, because itâ€™s always easy to find in the parking lots.<p>A couple of years ago, someone took me to a shop and didn&#x27;t want to come inside with me and waited in the car. When I came out, I had to peak into each car because I couldn&#x27;t tell one car from another on the car park. 100% of them were metal grey! (and since they more or less have the same shape nowadays...)<p>That was when I remembered how, in the 80s, people would mock eastern countries for having almost only a single type of car. &quot;Imagine how sad that would be, you wouldn&#x27;t want to live under such a regime.&quot; That would be the typical ultimate anti-communist argument in bar conversations...<p>Well, fast-forward 15 years and into the West, in the first decade of the XXIst century, basically all cars sold here (in France) were metal grey. Big change for the second decade: all cars sold were this time either black or white, yay... Can&#x27;t wait for the fad of the present decade, 50 shades of grey perhaps?<p>To increase the depression rate, public transport was also often made grey; the rebirth of tramways: metal grey + black mirror windows in many places, trains as well. In the city in which I lived, they even replaced the much acclaimed blue&#x2F;yellow&#x2F;red livery of a few buses with white or grey. (This depended on cities, some kept colourful paints.) And then you&#x27;d get into your work building (for the external appearance, if it is new enough, no more brick cover, probably grey walls + mirror grey windows), and inside the floor carpet was grey, the partition walls were grey, the false ceiling was grey, the windows were grey (aluminium), most furniture was grey. Inside and outside, people wearing grey and black. Thanks you, joyful economic liberalism, for saving me from the boredom of planned state socialism :-)')
