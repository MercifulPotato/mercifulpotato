They wouldn&#x27;t really need to - how would we know, if they didn&#x27;t?<p>Enough naivety...<p>If people don&#x27;t think that this has been going on for years, or that they actually announce Orwellian surveillance, I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you!  We have been already living in a track and trace world - what is happening is that it is becoming overt.  And there is nothing to be done about it.  We all need the paycheck, right?<p>Even if there is a massive outcry about this - and I doubt there will be - they will just come back and do it another way.  They claim it is a right for employers to get the &#x27;metrics&#x27;.<p>What&#x27;s kind of dark, twisted and funny, is that the people building the cages of today and tomorrow, are doing so with open eyes - technologists are some of the most surveilled people about, but - no problem! - we&#x27;ll code tomorrow&#x27;s hell for you!')
