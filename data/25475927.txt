I&#x27;ve got no issue with around 50 tabs in Firefox in a similar laptop. But maybe I don&#x27;t visit the same memory heavy websites.<p>It&#x27;s usually gcc that eats up all my memory, turns out with template metaprogramming a single gcc instance can eat 3GB of RAM, and I usually build with 6 parallel instances.
