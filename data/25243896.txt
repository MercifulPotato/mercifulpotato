Just a permission change to install F-Droid, Amazon App Store or something else. Another permission change in developer settings lets you unlock the boot loader and install alternate ROMs like Lineage and get root. A few of the cheaper phones sold by carriers as part of pre-paid plans and such might not be able to unlock the boot loader, but you&#x27;re still free to sideload any apps you want.<p>I wish there were more big name apps that would get on F-Droid or one of the alternative app stores on Android. The more competition there is, the better for developers and users.')
