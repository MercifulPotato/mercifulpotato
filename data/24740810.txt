Item(by='jorams', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602354274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740614, text='&gt; Tiny official repos. You&#x27;re going to have to rely on the user-submitted repos for most of your packaging needs. It&#x27;s cool how easy it is to make a package and submit it to the AUR, but I don&#x27;t love the idea of installing random user-submitted stuff for the bulk of my software needs.<p>Can you expand on this? My system contains a total of 20 &quot;foreign&quot; packages from the AUR and private sources, installed over a period of 5 years. It&#x27;s certainly not even close to &quot;most of my packaging needs&quot;, because I have 1267 &quot;native&quot; packages installed.<p>Some of these foreign packages could be in the official repositories, but most are modified or built-from-source versions of existing packages, software that is now in the repositories but wasn&#x27;t when I installed it, or don&#x27;t belong in the repositories at all.')
