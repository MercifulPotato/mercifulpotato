There isn&#x27;t enough room in the world for 100 OSes for us to get a competitive market. There isn&#x27;t even room for 3. There is barely room for 2 with great downside. Companies spend a lot of money developing an app for one OS and basically re-creating it for the other.<p>I&#x27;m looking at my phone&#x27;s home screen. Most of these apps are available in the other OS too, with almost the exact same functionality, but completely different codebases. Each of these duplicate efforts represent anything from X×100K $ to X×10M $ of development cost. This is just part of the cost of having more OSes. And the consumer ultimately pays for these costs.')
