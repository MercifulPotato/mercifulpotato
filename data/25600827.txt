Ancient Cistern alone is probably the pinnacle, but it&#x27;s also got Sandship and Lanayru Mining Facility. Wind Waker and Twilight Princess are replete with weak dungeons aimed at more novice gamers. You&#x27;d have to go back to N64 or Link to the Past to find something that challenges the player, and none of these are as thematically satisfying as what Skyward Sword offers.<p>Skyward Sword&#x27;s overworld is oozing with rich and evocative atmosphere, too. If you take away the Gothic veneer, Twilight Princess is almost sterile in comparison.<p>It&#x27;s a great game that gets blamed for small pitfalls.')
