IME, the main obstacle to TypeScript is that you have to have the discipline to learn TypeScript and endure the compile errors it generates.<p>I think you could rewrite the author&#x27;s example the opposite way:<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t need to write careful JavaScript, you just need enough discipline to learn and use TypeScript&quot;<p>But this is a different kind of discipline; it&#x27;s the discipline to seek out a &quot;better&quot; (or at least more scalable) way of doing things. You typically hear static-typing fanatics calling dynamically typed languages &quot;undisciplined.&quot;<p>TypeScript is an order of magnitude less popular than pure JavaScript, even considering just new code on Github. TypeScript may be better, but it isn&#x27;t taking over the world--not yet, at least--because it requires (enforces!) more discipline to get started.')
