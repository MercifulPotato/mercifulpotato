But there&#x27;s a tradeoff between security and usability so they accept passwords as a param in URL, which for 95% cases is a good tradeoff (for example Outlook Zoom plugin generates the URL with password directly in meeting invites). Most people don&#x27;t live-share their super secret in-progress meeting IDs and passwords on Twitter. Probably more people share their CC number or boarding passes on instagram each day.<p>However what Zoom and other conf tools could do is that they could read the password from the URL and then use `history.pushState()` DOM API to replace the URL and erase the password once the meeting is launched.<p>Downside would be though users wouldn&#x27;t be able anymore to just copy the URL from browser&#x27;s URL bar and send to other people to join.')
