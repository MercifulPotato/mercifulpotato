Disks are less unreliable now so it is less necessary, but there are still some scenarios, especially when the filesystem is in a dirty state, where the table can be corrupted.<p>This can also really hurt in unexpected ways with otherwise badly written drivers. Nintendo&#x27;s driver for the switch would constantly write to the table unnecessarily, and while this doesn&#x27;t do all that much in normal operation (other than waste a small number of writes), it made it drastically more likely (in some cases for some games almost guaranteed) that the table would be partially written and corrupt if the system crashed or lost power unexpectedly. When some new Pokemon games came out and were initially a bit unstable this came up a lot.')
