Being consistent with a deliberate architectural decision that is actually useful is important. Otherwise you could potentially have a broken window effect where more and more calls leak out of the service layer with the justification being if it was OK in one place why not others? Putting it in the service means that it is ready for any new calls that might be added and future collaborators know there&#x27;s generally only one place to look for these calls. Now maybe in this situation it would be overkill but with bigger and longer lived the project, the more consistency pays dividends.')
