I have no problem with data science.  The difference between all of the complex technology you pointed out inside the baby monitor and what we&#x27;re talking about here is that all of that complex technology is <i>robust</i> and, for the most part, well-designed!  The data science work here has <i>tons</i> of issues, and I think the vast majority of reactions are reacting to that: machine learning and data science really can be useful... but not if you apply it really badly.  Someone else commented elsewhere in the thread that a simple thresholding algorithm would be just as effective---and not suffer from the myriad potential problems present with blindly applying TensorFlow because it&#x27;s cool.')
