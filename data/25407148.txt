Item(by='otterley', descendants=None, kids=[25408169], score=None, time=1607873071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406651, text='It doesn’t invalidate my advice that you should hire the best defense counsel possible. We have an adversarial trial system because we don’t know of any better system to get to the truth of a dispute or a charge, and if you find yourself on the wrong end of it, you’re well advised to come armed with the best defense possible.<p>Case in point: the very document you posted says, “The proportion among adult sexual assault exonerations is particularly low, 4%. Perhaps avoiding the stigma of a sex-crime conviction is so important that few innocent rape defendants plead guilty...”<p>Are innocent people imprisoned? Yes, that happens and that is terrible. I don’t think any right minded individual wants that. But as the document itself pointed out, most innocent prisoners plead guilty. If they had good defense counsel (which they almost certainly didn’t) and they were in fact innocent, then they would not have been advised to plead guilty. The document itself says that most innocent prisoners plead guilty to avoid pretrial detention, which no competent criminal defense lawyer would recommend.<p>The existence of exceptions to a general observation doesn’t mean the general observation is invalid, just like the existence of cosmic rays screwing up a computational answer doesn’t make the general design of a CPU a doorstop.')
