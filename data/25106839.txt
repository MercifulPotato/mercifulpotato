I have Nvidia GPU, multiple monitor, so Wayland don&#x27;t seem to be ready for my use case. I aware of proton too, but needing tweaks to run games doesn&#x27;t seem to be ready to me. I expect games to be &quot;just work&quot;. Also, there are also non-steam games and anti-cheat. Currently, WSL perfectly fit my needs for development environment.<p>I had used KDE, which gave me a good experience, but the general Linux desktop ecosystem doesn&#x27;t feel ready for me. Maybe years later, the situation will be good enough to switch, but it is not now.')
