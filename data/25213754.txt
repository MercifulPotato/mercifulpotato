Silicon Valley hosts the most Superfund sites in the US for a reason - there&#x27;s an <i>awful</i> lot of really nasty chemicals involved in semiconductor manufacturing, some of which can probably be used to make drugs or explosives (so subject to various control laws), and the feature sizes are so small that the fabs require expensive air filters...<p>Custom boards are a thing already, you can go up to three layers in an amateur&#x2F;hobbyist setting AFAIK, but that won&#x27;t help you much when dealing with high-frequency stuff or very fine pitch settings as the thickness and other parameters will vary across the board. Many countries already have somewhat cheap-ish &quot;rapid prototype PCB&quot; shops, some even do assembly for you. That&#x27;s good enough even for most HF stuff.')
