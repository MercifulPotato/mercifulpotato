Our source of truth is a Postgres database where all updates and inserts are sent using a microservice. The data flows from Postgres to Elasticsearch using SQS in AWS. The Angular app then queries Elasticsearch using a different microservice. So essentially our command domain model is separate from our query domain model.')
