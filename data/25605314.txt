That was unsurprising.<p>To everyone else who has to contend with tight pools of talent that are often fielding multiple offers and using them against each other, the desire for change is much stronger. Many more companies fit this bill.<p>There are some challenges though:<p>Remote workers have historically not worked on premier projects and products at hybrid companies. Effort will have to be made to ensure that remote workers are included in the kind of reports that indicate work distribution.<p>Remote workers get payed less. I can&#x27;t prescriptively say how much less, but many companies in tech participate in geo-based compensation models while not being geographically locked in sales. I&#x27;ve long told people I would understand if I&#x27;m a welder and my product is only sold in one state why you may lazily geo-lock my pay. That stops making sense when my part is sold nationally or internationally. Then I really want my income to reflect what my position contributes to the business. This is why I think RSUs are so great. The compensation model for remote cannot just be padding margins for a business, especially if I&#x27;m going from SV to Texas for instance.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to a more remote future, but without these problems sorted out remote work will only create an underclass of developers.')
