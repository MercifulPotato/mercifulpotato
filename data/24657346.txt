They are filling in the blanks with their best guesses according to the information present.<p>As long as they aren&#x27;t presenting their results as more real than the original images, I don&#x27;t see it as a bad thing.<p>In fact, I think that the field in general needs to be more open about just how much this happens with history in general. Our understanding of the middle ages comes from evidence far less clear than these photos and yet its rare to see professionals admit how much of the field involves countless evolving, educated guesses.<p>Others may feel differently, but I find the field even more impressive with the understanding that historians are not seeing a clear picture.')
