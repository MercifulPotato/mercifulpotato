I would just like to have a better understanding of the actual risk of interacting with people on a day-to-day basis.  The title of this article suggests I have 20% chance of mental illness after being exposed to the virus.   Having read the article, I now understand that I have a 0.0000000001% to 20% chance of such an outcome.  I feel I&#x27;ve learned nothing, and I regret wasting my time reading it.')
