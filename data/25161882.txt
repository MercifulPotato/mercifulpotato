That powerpoint is horribly out of date and I&#x27;d argue full of FUD (intentional or not).<p>&gt;â€¢ Raid 0, 1, 5, and 6 are also built in the filesystem<p>BTRFS RAID has been a nightmare from day 1 including complete data loss.  Parity-based RAID has been &quot;just around the corner&quot; for almost a DECADE. Sure you can do RAID-1 but in 2020 I&#x27;m just not interested in losing half of my capacity.<p>Yes you can layer it on top of MDRAID but that eliminates half the elegance of what ZFS brought to the table.<p>&gt;ZFS is fairly memory hungry, it&#x27;s recommended to have\n16GB of RAM and give 8GB or more to ZFS (it wasn&#x27;t\ndesigned to use the linux memory filesystem, so it uses its\nown memory that can&#x27;t be shared with the rest of linux).<p>This is just flat wrong.  You need 2GB of memory for a happy filesystem, 8GB+ is if you&#x27;re doing deduplication which is unnecessary overhead in most environments.  I&#x27;m also not sure where the &quot;memory that can&#x27;t be shared with the rest of linux&quot; is coming from - ARC will use and free memory as needed by the system.<p>&gt;Due to the CDDL being incompatible with GPLv2, a linux vendor or\nhardware vendor will never be able to ship a linux distribution or hardware\ndevice using ZFS<p>Except Ubuntu already is.  I believe SLES does as well.<p>&gt;As a result, you shouldn&#x27;t plan on using ZFS for any product that you\nmight ever want to ship one day.<p>Delphix ships a product today based on ZFS.  0 issues.<p>&gt;Oracle may have stopped further work on ZFS as a result.\nOr it could be another reason entirely...<p>Oracle absolutely didn&#x27;t stop work on ZFS, I&#x27;m not even sure where he came up with that nonsense.  Oracle continued to update and release new versions of ZFS long after the lawsuit was settled.<p>You know what&#x27;s far more telling?  13 YEARS after starting BTRFS: Oracle uses ext4 as their default filesystem, not BTRFS.  Redhat has dropped support for BTRFS entirely.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossbytes.com&#x2F;red-hat-deprecate-btrfs-filesystem-stratis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossbytes.com&#x2F;red-hat-deprecate-btrfs-filesystem-str...</a>')
