And you have very little control over how much of your time and attention that will take up. You are forced to multitask and your mind is distracted.<p>Not only that, but your switching costs are very high. Like a person with a small poker stack, you can’t afford to take regular-size risks, only tiny risks. Any bad risk can set you back.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;amp&#x2F;economy&#x2F;making-sense&#x2F;analysis-how-poverty-can-drive-down-intelligence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;amp&#x2F;economy&#x2F;making-sense&#x2F;analys...</a><p>This is why a UBI can raise the national IQ level, reduce stress, improve public health AND make us more productive and make better choices.<p>That is also why limited liability for entrepreners in USA is a great thing.<p>A person working overtime at McDonalds to make ends meet is not benefitting society as much as a person using some of that time on things not valued immediately by the market, such as spending time raising their kids, learning science, contributing to open source software or wikipedia etc. Their job will be gradually automated anyway, and we as a society will try to slow that process down because many consider wages to be the only “moral” way to get money to the people.<p>At the other extreme, having “f u money” you can say no to lots of things.<p>The “costly signal” that identifies a successful person with many options in a given area, is that — unlike the one still starting out or scrambling — they pass up perfectly good opportunities and are instead focused on actively avoid potentially inconvenient opportunities. While a person who is just trying to “make it” will have the opposite approach. They will pursue a lot of false negatives.')
