We could marshal the world&#x27;s best minds and fastest computers, and within a year we could probably calculate the value.<p>If the aliens demanded the Ramsey number for red six and blue six, however, we would have no choice but to launch a preemptive attack.&quot;<p>In other words - some of the basic questions about these unbelievably small numbers (that you could count on your hands and toes) are so difficult, they push the limits of human ingenuity.')
