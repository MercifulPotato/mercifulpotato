Got there on a scholarship, studied unhindered by the politics of the day for 5 years, and it made me who I am today.<p>Unfortunately the same institution is today spending too much time and energy on various socio-political abstractions, hence it is not being able to offer the same opportunities for scientific exploration I enjoyed during my time there to the new generation.<p>From my experience, the pinnacle of education was around the end of the cold war here in the West, then it started going downhill once we lacked a properly defined adversary and started to look for enemies and oppressors in our own midst.')
