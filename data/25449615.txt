We have contributions from my company, Geocode Earth, which I plugged in another thread so I won&#x27;t repeat, other contributors like Jawg(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jawg.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jawg.io&#x2F;</a>), and of course individuals and teams from many other places.<p>The core architecture uses Elasticsearch, Node.js, SQLite and some Go to build a fully featured, modular geocoder.<p>Geocoding is both a fascinating and incredibly frustrating challenge so we are always looking for more people reporting bugs and contributing fixes or other improvements. We truly believe a quality geocoder can&#x27;t be built outside the large bankrolls of Google, etc without growing a strong open-source community around it.')
