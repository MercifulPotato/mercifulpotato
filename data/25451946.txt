If your job isn&#x27;t doing well by you, absolutely you should threaten to quit... you are essentially in a relationship and if you think the issue is correctable, everyone will be happier if you offer that option, and you do yourself a big disservice tolerate something you aren&#x27;t comfortable with. But for Wikipedia? Would they even notice if you left? Did they negotiate with you originally to be there? Did they promise you anything? It is just a massive time sink for everyone if you threaten to quit: you should probably just leave.')
