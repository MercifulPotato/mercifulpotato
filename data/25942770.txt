Item(by='dalbasal', descendants=None, kids=[25943202], score=None, time=1611846130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25942201, text='&gt;&gt; disappointed that Protonmail provides no evidence that this is really the underlying purpose of the proposal<p>Be a little generous. This is a blog post, and this is the middle of a debate that&#x27;s been happening for years. That backdoors are actually what this resolves to is not a controversial position, except that advocates are trying to avoid these terms. In any case, it has been discussed heavily. Not every blog post needs to go through the motions.<p>Meanwhile, for evidence you can read the resolution yourself and make up your mind... It is linked in the first paragraph. It&#x27;s short, but here&#x27;s a paraphrase:<p>[1] We love encryption, human rights and all that  kind of stuff.<p>[2] Lots of people use encryption. For really important stuff, we even make them use encryption.<p>[3] BUT(!) Criminals also use encryption. This makes it hard for police to read their DMs even though they&#x27;re just trying doing their job...<p>[4] We want to keep encryption, but make it so police <i>can</i> read criminal&#x27;s DMs.<p>[5] Big Tech needs to do this.<p>[6] Regulation something something<p>[7] More words, no discernible meaning.<p>Point 4 is the disingenuous point the post is referring to. You are disappointed in a blog post that doesn&#x27;t cover everything. How about being disappointed in the Council of The European Union&#x27;s formal resolution demanding something that they know to be impossible. It&#x27;s not even just technically impossible. It is logically impossible.<p>This is not the first version, as the blog post mentions. Earlier version were unpopular because banning encryption seems like a bad idea. Even politicians seems to have noticed that. This version is demanding a ban on encryption, but also demanding that whatever weaker alternative is implemented still be called encryption so people aren&#x27;t worried.<p>Honestly, this is hideous. Whatever the merit of their arguments, this is not the way. Everything here is subtext. Nothing is stated plainly. About 40% of the text is &quot;reassuring you that this isn&#x27;t exactly what it sounds like.&quot; Quite literally Orwellian.<p>Like the top comment says. Let&#x27;s start with them. All members who have signed this resolution can beta test whatever &quot;encryption that only police can break&quot; means. We can all look forward to reading their emails.')
