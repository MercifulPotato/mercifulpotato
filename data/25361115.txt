In PA alone, you had 1.7 million mail in ballots sent out and over 2 million received. There are completely insane numbers of cases where dead people have voted, where signatures were not verified at all, where people who moved voted, where women found others had voted under their maiden names.<p>There is a real big problem with election irregularities. There was a lot going on. Whenever counting stops .. and takes days, that&#x27;s a sign that someone is injecting ballots. That&#x27;s what happens in corrupt nations in South&#x2F;Central American and Africa and Russia.<p>We are in very real danger of losing all confidence in the election process in America. If you don&#x27;t see that, you are selectively ignoring a dangerous reality.<p>The Supreme Court is going to take these cases, and if they see the evidence and declare these States violated the laws ... America is going to loose their collective shit and we&#x27;ll see riots like you wouldn&#x27;t believe from the left.<p>If Biden gets certified ... you&#x27;ll see massive violence from the far-left and the media will blame it on right wing conservatives.<p>You should probably go read 1984 and then watch the news again.')
