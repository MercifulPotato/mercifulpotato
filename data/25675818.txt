If you look at a stock that is crashing, bid&#x2F;ask spreads become very wide, it can be impossible to get a limit fill. Market fills will have big slippage from the quoted price.<p>It&#x27;s hard, but you have to sell into <i>strength</i>. You can&#x27;t wait for the top.<p>Also, how Coinbase lacks limit orders is beyond me. For a mission focused company they are not very focused.')
