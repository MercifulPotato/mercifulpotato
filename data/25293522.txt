It is the only viable competitor to SpaceX that I see at the moment. One other possibility is for some company in China to appear on the scene.<p>Elon Musk has said he would love some competition because it helps increase the pace of progress. He even tried that internally for a bit by developing StarShip in two locations for awhile. I heard him in an interview saying that SpaceX might have too many great engineers and that it would be better for his goal of a city on Mars to have them spread over many companies.')
