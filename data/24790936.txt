You generally expect users themselves to contribute quality reviews which you then publish directly (plus maybe do a bit of curation to gather sentiment). It&#x27;s difficult to both ask users to pay you for the service and also contribute the very content you charge them for.<p>I think the only way to make a user review site work are:<p><pre><code>  (a) Be a non-profit and have a donation based model. Would people actually donate though? I&#x27;m not sure... but at least you don&#x27;t seem like a greedy middleman.\n\n  (b) Charge a membership fee, but grant free durations of membership for quality reviews. The downside here is that you&#x27;re likely severely limiting the already small pool of people willing to leave a review.\n</code></pre>\n[1]: The nearest comparison to CR&lt;-&gt;Yelp would be Zagat (well, pre-Google Zagat) and Michelin. However, they both only cover a narrow slice.')
