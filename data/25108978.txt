The comment was in response to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25105426" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25105426</a>, which specifically mentioned employee contributions: &quot;Still, his political spending remains almost entirely partisan. Koch Industries’ PAC and employees donated $2.8 million in the 2020 campaign cycle to Republican candidates and $221,000 to Democratic candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.&quot;. If Koch Industries employee donation bias is discussion worthy, so should be BigTech employee donation bias, which is even more strident.<p>Granted, the original article and the comment which cites it mixes PAC + employee. For the purposes of identifying political bias in an organization though, the employee donations are quite a bit more illuminating. PAC donations are more strategic investments in incumbents, thus tend so be roughly 50-50 in the current political landscape: &quot;A company’s PAC donations have less to do with supporting a specific party than with accessing those in power. Corporate PACs donate the vast majority — 90 percent in the last midterm — of their money to incumbent candidates, who are much more likely to be elected than challengers. Tech companies are no different.&quot;<p>For completeness, here is Googles PAC + employee donation breakdown: 87% D, 13% R. On par with the partisanism of Koch Industries, which even Charles Koch decries as a mistake. I don&#x27;t have the data to split KI PAC vs. KI employee donations.')
