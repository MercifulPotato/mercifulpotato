At least at restaurants, it&#x27;s pretty standard that you&#x27;re supposed to tip and roughly how much.<p>It&#x27;s like, there&#x27;s some mysterious unknown correct tip amount. If you don&#x27;t just automatically know this amount and don&#x27;t tip at all or too little, then you&#x27;re a jerk. If you tip too much, then you&#x27;re a sucker or trying to get some other kind of favor. How about if you want to make a particular amount of money for doing some job, you just tell me how much you want? I can either agree and pay it and we&#x27;re both happy, or not do it at all and at least nobody feels ripped off.')
