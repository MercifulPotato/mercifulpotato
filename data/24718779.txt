The work on it started in 2013.<p>Apple released version 1 of metal in June 2014. So, they&#x27;d already spent at least a year working on it. So why would they want to somehow go ahead with something proprietary that AMD was developing at the same time?<p>Khronos groups announced they were going to work on the next generation graphics API in July 2014 (a full month after the release of Metal v1).<p>AMD donated Mantle to Khronos in 2015, a full year after Metal v1.<p>---<p>There are reasons why Apple went with Metal, and they make a lot of sense: OpenGL was a disaster. Any improvements to it would require immense effort, and fighting against Khronos committees. OpenGL ES was only marginally better and only marginally better suited for mobile devices. So why would <i>not</i> Apple develop their own low-level graphics API for their own devices?')
