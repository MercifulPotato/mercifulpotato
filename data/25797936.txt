Item(by='rufus_foreman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610752789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25796385, text='I did unskilled labor for 10 years of my life, 5 years of it in a factory where a typical job involved lifting 50 and 100 pound loads repetitively the entire day. It started at maybe 20 cents over minimum wage as a temp and went up a few dollars above that by the time I left.<p>First of all, comparatively Amazon warehouse work doesn&#x27;t sound like &quot;terrible working conditions&quot;, it sounds like a dream job, and it sounds like you have never really experienced typical manual labor if you describe it that way.<p>Second of all, was I exploited? What would that matter? Every other choice I had was worse or I would have taken one of them. Should the company have improved the working conditions? They did! They automated everything. All of the unskilled jobs are gone and the jobs that remain are higher paying mechanic or process operator jobs. Today I would have to take one of the worse choices.')
