Item(by='eigenket', descendants=None, kids=[25287980], score=None, time=1606994066, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25287351, text='Starting for Euler&#x27;s formula you can write cos(x) = (exp(ix) + exp(-ix))&#x2F;2 so the cosine is in some sense a &quot;type of exponential&quot;. If the cosine is a type of exponential then its inverse (the function that takes you to the angle measurement) is inherently a &quot;type of logarithm&quot;.<p>This is a very handwavey statement. I would say a more precise statement is that the proper exponential and log maps are the &quot;correct&quot; thing to use to map multiplication to adidtion and vice-versa. They are exactly the maps that do this properly. The fact that cosine is a sum of exponentials means that you can write the inverse of cosine as a (slightly ugly) formula in terms of logarithms (arcos(z) = -i log(sqrt(1-z^2) + z). This is the sense in which the map to angle measures is a &quot;type of log&quot;.')
