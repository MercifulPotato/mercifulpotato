For instance: it doesn&#x27;t help the 99.9%ers if one .01%er pays another 10x for a Picasso and a 0.1%er makes a commission on the sale, and I don&#x27;t imagine the elite demand for new-art production would increase much from current levels.  Production of personal goods, luxury or otherwise, for elites can&#x27;t fill the gaps caused by automation, since they already buy them today.  Even over-the-top conspicuous consumption won&#x27;t cut it either (e.g. employing tens of thousands in North Korean Mass Games-style performances just to employ tens of thousands), is getting into pretty dystopian territory.')
