Every woman I know uses a fake name, and most of them are using fake numbers too.<p>Covid risks are _way_ lower here than risks of random creeps misusing names&#x2F;numbers of women...<p>I&#x27;m less affected by those particular risks, but I still use a burner Twilio SMS number and a burner gmail address that doesn&#x27;t get used for anything else, with plus addressing to help try identify where a leak happened. If that account starts getting spam to nomdeplume+somesmallbar@gmail.com or nomdeplume+someQRcodesigninservice@gmail.com, I might get a smoking gun about who leaked it.<p>If the spammers are cleaning their lists of that well-enough-known email tracking trick and sending enough smtp to make the address a problem to use, I can just walk away from that gmail account and set up a new one.<p>I&#x27;m contemplating building an automated system of &quot;rolling 4 week validity email addresses&quot; that I can easily enough work out on-the-spot, perhaps month&#x2F;week-of-month encoding so I&#x27;d use nomdeplume-102+randombar@example.org this week (102 being october 2nd week) and only have the addresses live long enough for contact tracing purposes. Perhaps using something t5hat works the same as gmail&#x27;s &quot;plus addressing&quot; but different enough that spammers list cleaning tools won&#x27;t know about it. That&#x27;d involve running my own mail server though, and the risks here right now are so low (in the single digit cases per day in a city of 5million people) that I&#x27;m more motivated to just lie on the contact forms instead...')
