Really appreciate the insight you’ve provided in this post I’ve always thought about moving back to Kenya and building a startup but systems and government bureaucracies are so frail and corrupt (perhaps I’m being a little unfair to the country as a whole, my bias comes from stories I’ve heard). But really unsure where I’d even begin or how I’d raise money for a startup out there. Are you working on any interesting projects&#x2F;startups related to Kenya? How have you navigated maybe any challenging conditions you’ve faced if you have started a Kenya based startup? Let me know if you have useful resources for those interested in starting up a business in Kenya. I’d love to chat further and glean more insight from you. Thanks')
