Or Amazon was still allowed to ship online orders,  but Jane Doe&#x27;s Knickknacks was not allowed to even sell online during the pandemic....(true story from NJ))<p>For Civil Libertarians livelihood can not be separated from Life, and Life with out freedom is not life at all.  Simply taking in oxygen and exhaling CO2 is not &quot;life&quot;. Life is living, interacting, being productive, enjoying the fruits of our labor, etc.<p>Life is not about existing,  people that believe that are some of the saddest people on earth.')
