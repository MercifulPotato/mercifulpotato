I noticed that 10-13 episode&#x2F;year shows tended to be better than average, while 22-26 episode&#x2F;year tended to be worse on average and have large numbers of garbage episodes.  The second group is how traditional US shows were done in the days of classic TV, to be shown twice in a 52 week year.<p>It came to me a few years back after watching the remastered Star Trek TNG, later an early season of Game of Thrones.  Even though TNG was given plenty of time to hit its stride and had some incredible episodes, another <i>half</i> were just crap.  Meanwhile early GOT season would have ten decent episodes in a row.  The difference in average quality was striking.<p>Of course, GOT had the benefit of being mostly written beforehand, similar to Babylon 5, one of the first series to break episodic containment.<p>TL;DR: TV show law - A dozen or so episodes per season is the limit of a writing team.  Produce any more than that and they are guaranteed to be phoned-in filler.')
