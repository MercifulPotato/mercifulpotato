There has never been (to my knowledge) any vaccine that prevented your from getting a different one latter.  People get flu vaccines yearly and nobody asks what the last one you got was even though there a dozens of manufactures.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t get one vaccine and then a week latter get a different one.  (I&#x27;d guess this is safe, but there is no reason to do it).  However getting one and then a year latter a different one is normal practice and shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.<p>In short, take what you can get now.  If COVID is still a problem in a year (I&#x27;m assuming there is a lot more supply of vaccine then) ask your doctors if you should get a different booster.<p>Odds are good than in 6 months to a year we will have a different vaccine anyway to cover the variants.  The vaccines don&#x27;t seem to be doing well against the South Africa strain of Covid (only applying to the few that have done real trials, many need more testing), so it is back to the drawing board already.')
