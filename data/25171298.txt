Each day things like FreeBSD become less and less of an option for general use, due to a lack of drivers. For example, it&#x27;s a poor choice for newer laptops, as it doesn&#x27;t have 802.11ac support.<p>New kernels and OSes that show up are at a massive disadvantage compared to Linux because of this. I think that an OS that prioritizes being able to borrow drivers from Linux or one of the BSDs would give itself an advantage.')
