Item(by='lliamander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602007899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24699905, text='&gt; I would never consider a state that didn&#x27;t even have parental leave benefits, simply because I would rather my descendants live in a state with some level of protections for employees versus employers.<p>I can understand that, thought I don&#x27;t personally relate. Once they&#x27;re grown my kids will likely be able to live in whatever state they want, I just want to make sure they have a good environment for growing up.  For me, things like school choice are more important (which California is actually pretty good on).<p>Also, I haven&#x27;t personally been in a position where using the state sponsored parental leave made sense.  Instead, a combination of saving up vacation time, working from home, and whatever benefits my employer provided for me made more sense.  Not a complaint, just an observation.')
