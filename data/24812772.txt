It seems like this would be a <i>much</i> better metric than counting deaths. I&#x27;ve been looking for regularly updated charts using YLL (years of life lost), but DALY seems even better. It&#x27;s disappointing that DALY isn&#x27;t the most commonly shared&#x2F;referenced chart. I need to find COVID DALY numbers compared to other causes of death to better understand this.')
