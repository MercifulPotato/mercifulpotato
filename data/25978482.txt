Clearly diamond rings are a big thing in other countries, but I&#x27;m not aware of other places that have such rules around them like numbers of months of salary, or such an obsession with having a huge shiny diamond on your finger.<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s generational. Either way, none of my friends or family in the UK seem to have gone in for this stuff. That&#x27;s not to say that there have been no diamond rings, just no stupidly gaudy rocks.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s down to changing traditions - the &quot;big day&quot; is no longer the start of life for a couple, they&#x27;ve usually been living together for some time, may even have kids already. And perhaps it&#x27;s down to changing gender roles, now that most couples have two earners, the &#x27;signal&#x27; you talk about may be out of place. It certainly seems old fashioned.<p>Either way, I don&#x27;t think diamonds are important as once they were.<p>If I marry my current partner in a traditional ceremony, any diamonds involved will be synthetic, because science is amazing and De Beers are manipulative exploiters.')
