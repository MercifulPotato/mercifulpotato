Spelling errors are my bane - I&#x27;ll make sure to fix those.<p>And yep, I think fixing some of those time errors is where I&#x27;ll start. I feel that pandas is better optimized for handling dates than times, which explains some of my wonky work arounds.<p>Days of the week is also interesting - did you have a full year of imessages on your computer or do you auto-delete after a certain period?<p>The map is puzzling and I&#x27;m working to debug. It seems that it works occasionally on reload and that it works consistently if all fade-in animations are removed from page.<p>I put this together in the last two weeks, so it&#x27;s definitely been rushed. Thanks again for the feedback!')
