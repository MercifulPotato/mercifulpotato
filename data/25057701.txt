The presentation is not just illuminating on how socket programming works in Python, but it is also a fun and relatively unique example of live coding being an effective presentation tool. I was at the conference live for this session and someone next to me in the crowd, when it was over, said, &quot;I think we just witnessed the Jimi Hendrix of Python.&quot;')
