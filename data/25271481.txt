This is what a company from the last decade might do to hide security issues, except it’s coming from the world’s largest company with a highly skilled security team. Is there some old-school manager with so much influence that they’re able to override any calls from internal and external sources? It’s gotten to the point where Apple engineers privately brag about their new proprietary security mitigations after researchers who scrounge for accidentally symbolicated kernels (thank you, iOS 14 beta) do the work to find them. Why does this situation exist?')
