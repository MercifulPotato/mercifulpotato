Or Cobol?  Or APL?  Or Dylan?  The world is chock-full of obscure programming languages.  The only difference I see is that Urbit is wrapped in this air of intrigue and mystery which IMHO is wholly undeserved.  But if you like that sort of thing and are going into it with your eyes open, by all means, be my guest.  Just don&#x27;t try to represent it as something that it&#x27;s not.<p>But if you just want to explore the programming language design space I think you&#x27;re much better off designing your own language than trying to wrap your brain around Nock and Hoon.  And even before you do that, there&#x27;s Haskell and Rust and Webasm and Clojure and Prolog, which I think give you a lot more bang for the learning curve buck.')
