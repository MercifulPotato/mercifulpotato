Item(by='darthdeus', descendants=None, kids=[25517374], score=None, time=1608728009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516691, text='Stan gives you the ability to do probabilistic reasoning. There is actually Tensorflow Probability (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tensorflow.org&#x2F;probability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tensorflow.org&#x2F;probability</a>) which has a lot of overlapping algorithms, but isn&#x27;t as mature and approaches some things differently.<p>The main difference is that with Stan you think in terms of random variables and distributions (and their transformations), while with Tensorflow&#x2F;DL you think in terms of predicting directly from data. Stan lets model a problem with probabilities and do arbitrary inference, generally asking any question you want about your model.<p>There are many other interesting alternatives, e.g. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyro.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyro.ai&#x2F;</a> which takes a yet another approach merging DL and probabilistic programming with variational inference. (Stan and TFP can do variational inference too, but I guess it&#x27;s like Python vs JavaScript vs Ruby vs Java - all of them can be used for programming, but not the same way).')
