You&#x27;re not immune one day and susceptible the next. It&#x27;s much more likely that immunity to getting sick might start decreasing over time, but still remain relatively high. So, perhaps 80% in 3 months, 60% in 6 months, and 30% in 9 months to use made up numbers. Additionally, production is still ramping up so it&#x27;s highly unlikely that we&#x27;ll have less vaccine in 3 months than currently. We&#x27;ll also likely have 1-3 more approved vaccines by then as well.')
