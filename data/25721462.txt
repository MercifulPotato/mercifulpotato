Video chat apps today are extremely naive and try to get away with &quot;what if we just dump everyone in the same room and hope it works&quot;. Zoom added &quot;reactions&quot;, but for some reason decided to only show reactions on your own tile. Push-to-talk is barely supported. None of them have implemented the bare minimum feature of showing participants in the same order. None of them have support for dynamic breakout rooms.<p>I swear, the best video chat experience I had was from The Go Game. At no point were you dumped into a massive shared room. Instead, people can join others at-will into small &quot;rooms&quot; of up to six people, which is much more manageable. Then you can implement whatever games you want and let people decide what they want to do. No need for next-gen hardware, no fancy &quot;VR spaces&quot;, just a different interface paradigm that actually scales.')
