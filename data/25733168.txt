I&#x27;d say Discord actually makes a pretty good social network, although most people don&#x27;t treat it as such. In my experience, the biggest issue with discord-as-a-social-network is the binary nature of discord server membership. I&#x27;ve had my one &quot;friends group&quot; server split into 3 or 4 servers (each with 80% membership overlap) over some people who had drama, and this makes it much less manageable as a social network because you tend to spend most of your time on one or <i>maybe</i> two servers.')
