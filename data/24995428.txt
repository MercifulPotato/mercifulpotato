Git absolutely makes it trivial to impersonate commits. All you have to do is change some Git config settings. Or, export your commit into a patch&#x2F;email file (git format-patch), modify it, and then import it (git am). Or, set some environment variables (GIT_COMMITTER_NAME and GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL). etc.<p>As you yourself mentioned, very, very, very few projects&#x2F;people sign their commits. Even fewer actually verify them.')
