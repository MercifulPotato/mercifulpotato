It took me a very long time to find about this. Once my manager asked me if i was a vegetarian. My brahmin friend educated on this. The test is to ask if a person is a vegetarian. If no then ask if their family were a vegetarian. If no then don&#x27;t proceed further. You now know he is a non-brahmin, else you now know he is a brahmin and you freely discuss about caste.<p>Whenever you are very surprised during promotions the reason is always the manager is a brahmin. No matter how friendly, i never want my manager to be brahmin, but it not possible always.')
