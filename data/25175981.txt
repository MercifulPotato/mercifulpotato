Which is mostly popularized by new kind of programmers breed who learned everything purely from YouTube.<p>They don’t know their tooling, systems, how web apps works, make huge mistakes on each level. Just putting the one solutions they know in everything. Do they think about what they doing and if this approach is feasible? No, not at all. It’s like with Wordpress, everyone is using it because of popularity, but WP is a nightmare to work with, and most of the time a huge overkill for what’s intended. I will not even mention Gatsby and super simple websites made in React because of it...<p>&gt; It&#x27;s really unfortunate because Rails is such a brilliant framework, and Ruby such a lovely language, and they&#x27;re falling out of the mainstream and losing popularity because of this. I wish the community would re-align.<p>And this, this is just outrageous. Do you have anything to back this claim up? I’m not rails&#x2F;ruby developer, but it always irked me when someone’s saying such thing about any language.<p>Don’t get me wrong, JS is awesome, React&#x2F;VUE on top of it too, but the point is, to know when and how to use them.')
