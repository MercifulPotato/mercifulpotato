You end up having to compile it yourself from source (and it isn&#x27;t like build environments don&#x27;t have their own compatibility issues), or use something like PPAs (assuming they exist for what you want), or manually doing the job of a package manger to adapt a foreign package. Static executables and AppImage make this a lot better, but they are not the convention so they can&#x27;t really be relied upon either. Good luck getting a package manager to install anything to a non-standard location like a removable disk.<p>When it comes right down to it, I prefer the Windows convention of installers and zips to package management and all its limitations. Precisely because things like &quot;Another example were various driver tweaks&#x2F;hacks or anything else a gamer or power user might want to do.&quot; are easily available with that model. Distributing software on Windows is something anyone can do very easily, without relying on a third party package repo or maintainer.<p>However, what we should really be doing, in my opinion, is something like AppImage (or NeXT Application Directories , or RiscOS AppDirs, etc.) combined with a sandbox-by-default similar to what exists on mobile, but without pops or the ability for the application to tell when it has been denied a permission.')
