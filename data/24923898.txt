If the value <i>may be null</i> then you <i>must</i> check if it is null before you dereference it. There is no &quot;forcing of branch stalls&quot;, because if used correctly (and designed correctly, which std::optional is not, sadly) it is merely a way for the programmer to use the type system to enforce the use of null checks <i>that are necessary for the correctness of the program</i> anyway.<p>If you and your coworkers find yourself in a situation in which you <i>know</i> that the value of a pointer cannot be null, then you should not model that value with an optional type, and then you will not only not be required to add a null check, it will be immediately obvious that you don&#x27;t need one.')
