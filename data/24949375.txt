Some people feel a public utility is closer to everyone&#x27;s control, as they feel we have a good reign on our government. Others feel corporations are closer to everyone&#x27;s control, as anyone can start an opposing corporation and compete on even ground, or influence an existing corporation by leveraging social cues.<p>It&#x27;s also about trust. If you are an individual that can more naturally give and help with little in return, it is easier to see the government as an altruistic and balanced entity that will do good in the end, especially if you feel empowered to assist or even lead those efforts. If you are often more worried about being hurt by other people, it is easier to see corporations as powerful tribes that can collectively protect us in the end, especially if you possess the skills to succeed in such environments and gain access to their benefits.<p>On your example, it is a great benefit not having to worry about money, but there are still many reasons why a public water utility still might not deliver safe water, some of which still revolve around money: If the utility is not adequately funded, it may still be unable to deliver safe water. Consider the difficult situation we have today with lead pipes. It&#x27;s not any easier for private corporations to deal with, but theoretically I think each one would feel a greater sense of urgency to fix the problem first.<p>As for your terror, I find it comforting to see it this way: If an entity fails to use public infrastructure constructively, regardless of whether it be a public utility or private corporation, it will be modified or replaced until we find something that works. It will take time but we will get there, as long as we&#x27;re in the company of good faith -- and we certainly are.')
