The Wikipedia article on guide horses is much better in that regard: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Guide_horse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Guide_horse</a><p>Note also that the wiki article is not entirely positive, as it includes this tidbit:<p>&gt;  In 2019, Janet Burleson pleaded guilty to 10 counts of animal cruelty after the carcasses of 22 horses were discovered on her farm, apparently starved to death. She was sentenced to 15 months in prison and 24 months of probation, and as a condition of her probation, cannot own animals.<p>Also note that dogs and miniature horses are the only animals recognized by the Americans with Disabilities Act as assistance animals.')
