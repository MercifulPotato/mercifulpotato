Through this and other pathways, some genes are expressed which are supposed to increase survival, so overall there is a window of free raficals concentration. If you get below it (total blockade) you will prevent the hormesis (beneficial) effect, but if you get above it, you can get all the free radical related diseases e.g neurodegenerative diseases.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1038&#x2F;nm.3624" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1038&#x2F;nm.3624</a>')
