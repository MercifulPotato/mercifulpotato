They also mention that this behavior was triggered by me having 2FA enabled on my Facebook account.<p>So I&#x27;m interested but beware right now (especially 2FA people).<p>Edit: Concerningly, the FB error page still has a 2019 copyright ^_^;<p>Edit 2: This was resolved by using the FB app to verify logins and restored my access in firefox.')
