I wasn&#x27;t trying to say that rust isn&#x27;t influenced by languages that came before it.<p>I mean that, when they decided it was time to make a new language, the team would have had some understanding of what the language would be like. That understanding couldn&#x27;t come from using the language itself (it doesn&#x27;t exist yet). Instead, teams do cultural work to communicate &amp; come to shared understandings about what the language they are making &quot;should be like.&quot; That shared understanding survives past when the language is working and influences decisions to improve the language.<p>It&#x27;s just worth considering and talking about project culture! It&#x27;s common for there to be many possible improvements to a language and have the culture of the project (or wider community) be what tips the scales.')
