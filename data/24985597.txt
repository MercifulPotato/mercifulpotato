To me it doesn&#x27;t seem actionable in any way, and if it was actionable (like significantly raising security), how would that help considering all the terrorists have to do is to wait for the level to go down (thus the security is lowered) before striking again?<p>Furthermore the threat level has <i>never</i> gone below &quot;substantial&quot; (which signifies that an attack is likely), so it&#x27;s akin to &quot;cry wolf&quot; all the time - eventually everyone learns to ignore it and it stops being a useful metric (if it ever was one, that is).')
