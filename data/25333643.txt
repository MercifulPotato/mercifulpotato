Communication&#x2F;synchronization overhead is usually growing faster than linear in the number of threads.<p>SMT isn&#x27;t an unalloyed good, it helps for many workloads and hurts for some. That said, the very wide cores in M1 are asking for SMT to increass utilization, I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;ll happen eventually. OTOH, the weaker memory consistency rules on ARM seem to allow for a lot more out of order execution, which seems to keep things busy.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see Intel and AMD increase the width of their cores so much; they need their cores to scale to 5Ghz (even if it takes 1KW of cooling) for marketting and competition reasons, and wider cores are harder to clock so high.')
