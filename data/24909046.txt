They basically revealed to the world that they are able and willing to replace the content on any website and as a user then you&#x27;ll have no idea if they did it or not (for instance, one of the browsers made the repo visible but prevented people from starring the repo). CCP could easily order all these browsers (which come pre-installed with their cheap phones) to rewrite the content on any website. Imagine them rewriting the content of Wikipedia articles, Twitter posts, Google search results, hijacking download links to download software bundled with spyware (e.g. if you were to download Chrome), etc.<p>If they&#x27;re willing to engage in such shady behaviour and break all users&#x27; trust just because they didn&#x27;t like a repo complaining about long work hours, then imagine what they would do with all your financial transactions. My god. The fact that we&#x27;re allowing these companies into our markets truly saddens me.')
