Most (reasonable) people only invest long-term.<p>&gt;Sounds like a waste of time when what we really want is for people to own the means of production.<p>Yup.<p>&gt;Dump 100% of federal tax revenue into index funds and let it grow faster than the interest on T-bills issued for expenditures. Churn for ~50 years and start paying UBI from the massive profits.<p>Tax revenue is not &#x27;profit&#x27; by the state. That&#x27;s not how tax nor money issuing works. But to the topic at hand: There are countries that put money into investment funds that will invest into infrastructure and safe long-term assets. But usually not for UBI, but for retirements (e.g. Denmark).<p>&gt;If the market can magically let everyone with enough money invested in their youth retire happily then it follows that letting the government own all the stocks and issue UBI would result in roughly the same outcome.<p>Generally the idea of not having to work at all is still heavily controversial within science. Some believe in UBI, some in job-guarantees and others just in relatively high minimum wage and very strong retirement plans.')
