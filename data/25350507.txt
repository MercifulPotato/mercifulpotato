I’m very much a speedy, excited programmer. I want to build the thing and see if it works afterwards. This can make me a bit sloppy <i>especially</i> in a time boxed coding problem.<p>What I’ve done to improve this to pretty good effect is follow this rough formula on problems:<p>- ask questions<p>- write out assumptions<p>- come up with a basic solution (pseudocode)<p>- see if i can come up with edge cases or converse examples that break my solution&#x2F;assumptions<p>- code while stopping occasionally to repeat the previous step<p>- walk through the code manually with some examples<p>After doing this a bunch I’ve actually internalized a lot of the edge cases or errors I might have missed before. So I think I am slowly teaching myself to be more precise for these types of questions. It’s slow going but decently effective.')
