The waves are so deadly simple to work with that you could even use them as exercises to start learning programming. You would also need to be aware of the buffer you send the audio samples to; yes, you need to be aware that latency exists, there&#x27;s no way around that. But in practice it&#x27;s much more annoying: you have to deal with the APIs on each OS, which treat audio devices differently. Even getting info about the devices might be poorly documented and rather cumbersome, and then each device might or might not support the sample format you need&#x2F;want, and might or might not support the buffer sizes you need&#x2F;want. And if you try to work with a language that&#x27;s not C&#x2F;C++, then you have to resort to C wrappers to connect to the APIs (which in many languages is not trivial). 99% of the things we want to do could be so easy (give me a format that&#x27;s 100% supported everywhere, a minimum buffer size supported everywhere, and support for 2 channels everywhere)... but nope.')
