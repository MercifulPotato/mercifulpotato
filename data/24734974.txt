Like I said, they might technically win it this time around, but the next &quot;Trump&quot; will probably be younger and even more charismatic, and he (or maybe a she, why not?) will have to conquer a public scene which  will have already known by that point that the democracy rules don&#x27;t exist for either party, so why care for the democratic process anymore?<p>If it matters I&#x27;m not from the US, have never set foot there, just saying how I see things from half a world away.')
