And that&#x27;s just Facebook.<p>I hate this argument. It&#x27;s tries to find a solution to sustain the status quo in the face of change. But that&#x27;s illogical because if there is a change, then the status quo is going to change too.<p>The only way Facebook is going to stop doing targeted advertising is if they&#x27;re forced to, likely due to new regulations. If that happens, Facebook&#x27;s entire business model will collapse, so they&#x27;ll either have to make massive fundamental changes to how they make money, or they&#x27;ll die and be taken over by a competitor.<p>In either case, users don&#x27;t &quot;owe&quot; Facebook anything. Consumers are the life blood of the economy, and thinking about how consumers should change their behaviors to sustain a corporation is backwards thinking.')
