Their position, as capitalists, ends with their interests.<p>Many (not all!) landlord are quite simple:  “Pay rent or I will evict you and find someone else”. That’s it.<p>After an eviction, they don’t care whether the person moves elsewhere or is homeless. In fact I’d argue that most people are probably on the gooder side of good and would prefer their former tenant move elsewhere and live a nice comfortable life and someone else can deal with their poorness.<p>What they do absolutely want is the ability to enforce that eviction. That’s key. But I doubt they care so much about the looming threat of homelessness.')
