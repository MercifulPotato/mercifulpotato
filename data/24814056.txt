Why? Because I can still go out and murder someone (not that I would, lol - just making a point). Totally up to me. Feel like murdering someone today? I just go out and do it.<p>The &quot;restricted freedom&quot; version of outlawing murder would be if my hands were cuffed behind my back every time I left my house, just so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to murder someone if I felt like it.<p>I hope I&#x27;m getting my message across (not a native speaker). My point is that, to me, there&#x27;s an ocean of difference between forcing me to do something in order to prevent me from possibly doing X (no matter how likely &#x2F; unlikely it is that I would do it), and having consequences in place for actually doing X. The former is a violation of my freedom; the latter is justice.')
