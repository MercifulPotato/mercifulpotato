The compression factor (when liquid) is about 1000...you&#x27;d need a zepellin the size of 1000 trucks in order to transport the same quantity as a single truck. That leads to materials costs and aerodynamic efficiency being significant factors. You simply cannot transport hydrogen very efficiently using such methods.')
