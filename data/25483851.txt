A retreat like that will be less strenuous if you already have a daily meditation practice.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t describe a weeklong meditation retreat as the &quot;extreme&quot; side of the Buddha&#x27;s middle way. That would be more like starving yourself in asceticism. With the right practice&#x2F;preparation (IE a few months of daily hour-long sits), I think a weeklong retreat would be beneficial and reasonable for most people.<p>Of course, getting to the point of a daily practice is pretty challenging itself, but not too much more than the average workout routine in my opinion.')
