The article says they&#x27;ve reduced the impact and gives a single example but I&#x27;d be interested to see a proper benchmark of a system with these patches installed.<p>I can imagine most of a powerful core&#x27;s performance going unused if the operating system isn&#x27;t doing anything special and a multithreaded workload is trying to get a lot of work done. The same can likely be true for systems still rocking a dual core design, where &quot;one core for important stuff and one for applications&quot; can be quite taxing on system responsiveness.')
