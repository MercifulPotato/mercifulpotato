When you get away from the Free Software hippies (i say that endaringly as one of them) who want freedom from copyright, the way religious people want purity, copyright is largely about risk management.<p>&gt; Twitch isn&#x27;t any different than the screenshot case...<p>There&#x27;s lots of differences (in both directions). Lots of twitch has explicit permission to use the video games, most of twitch isn&#x27;t streaming abandonware, the argument for fair use is probably present for both but much easier to make for wikipedia, etc. In terms of wikipedia, the concern is ideological purity, not that some defunct video game heir is going to come out of nowhere and sue us.<p>&gt; it took art to load the DOSBox programs...<p>It took skill, not art. The screenshots themselves don&#x27;t contain originality by the author of the post, so he doesn&#x27;t get copyright of it in usa (european countries are often different). See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel...</a>. I&#x27;m not sure how that relates to your point though. Even if the screenshots contained originality from the author, like how twitch streams do, it doesn&#x27;t remove the copyright from the original video game designer, it would just mean both have a copyright and you would need permission from both to do stuff with the created work.<p>Disclaimer: IANAL')
