They knew there was fluid around cells, but the tissue sampling method would not preserve it so they couldn&#x27;t inspect it. With the new sampling method they could see the structure, and realized these are more like connected spaces filled with fluid rather than small individual pockets.<p>&gt;Although researchers already knew that there is fluid between individual cells, the idea of a larger, connected interstitium — in which there are fluid-filled spaces within tissues — had been described only vaguely in the literature, Theise said. The new study, he said, expands the concept of the interstitium by showing these structured, fluid-filled spaces within tissues, and is the first to define the interstitium as an organ in and of itself.')
