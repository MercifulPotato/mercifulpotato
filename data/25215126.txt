Item(by='mrandish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606344353, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213196, text='The naming process often boils down to balancing a decision matrix of objective and subjective trade-offs between positives and negatives for a given scope, audience, market and requirements (legal, perceptual, cultural, linguistic) as well as constraints (time, money, creativity). These tend to be priced in different, &#x27;currencies&#x27; and individual preferences that are challenging to reconcile.<p>As someone who has done quite a bit of pretty successful product and company naming, the choice &quot;Mmhmm&quot; has quite a few negative aspects which I consider to be fairly important, though not requirements.<p>* Hard to only hear first then spell correctly.<p>* Hard to only read first then pronounce confidently.<p>* Hard to find when searched, even in combination with other likely terms (e.g. video, streaming, app).<p>* Can be confusing when introduced as a new-ish term in conversation.<p>* Such a notably &#x27;unique&#x27; name can trigger discussion about the name itself which can lead to distraction or delay in communicating the product&#x27;s value prop (as seen in the first third of their own intro video).<p>* Even for those who may find it &quot;clever&quot; or &quot;cute&quot; initially, it will likely become annoying over time for those in the company as well as the company&#x27;s most valuable stakeholders.<p>Against that, the upsides don&#x27;t appear (IMHO) to be a good trade-off.<p>* Short<p>* Quick to say<p>* Unique<p>* Memorable (at least on the verbal dimension, if not written)<p>* The domain was apparently affordable.')
