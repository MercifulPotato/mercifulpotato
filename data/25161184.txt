I can relate to it feeling a little awkward at first wearing a mask in public in a culture that doesn&#x27;t usually do that, but, despite being a social person and sympathizing with the social isolation pain of staying at home, the idea that &quot;all of the joy has been taken out of routine daily activities&quot; due to the masks for psycho-social reasons was outside my realm of imagination. I genuinely feel bad for people with that piece of personality.')
