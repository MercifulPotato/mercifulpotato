Many—perhaps most—products are designed to serve more than one kind of user.<p>Obvious example: building an e-commerce platform. The merchant is a kind of user. The customer is a different kind of user on that same platform. Yes, they&#x27;re humans, but they&#x27;re not doing the same thing.<p><i>Any</i> B2B or B2C type product will have at least two very distinct roles like that. And in those cases, arguing that everyone is just a person as a sort of moral position is destructively vague. It&#x27;s more difficult to serve someone&#x27;s needs if you can&#x27;t start to narrow down what they&#x27;re trying to accomplish.<p>While I totally agree with the sentiment that we shouldn&#x27;t conflate personhood identically with their role in a product, solving useful problems <i>does</i> require that you de-scope and discretize the interactions a bit.')
