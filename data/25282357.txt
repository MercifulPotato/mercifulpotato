I should work towards becoming management if I want that to change. But I probably have better things to do than such a trivial disagreement.<p>I wish corporations were less psychopathic, too, but this is not the hill I&#x27;d die on. Or, I&#x27;d be damn sure ready to die if I redlined as a &quot;nice to meet you&quot; first act.')
