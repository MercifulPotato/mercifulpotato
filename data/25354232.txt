Other than that I&#x27;ve just worn out the ear foams a few times which are 2 seconds to replace. They&#x27;re also still made in Brooklyn!<p>I totally get how much engineering goes into the Apple products. There&#x27;s also something beautiful about a completely passive headphone using a hundred year old connector technology made by a 67 year old company with a BIFL philosophy that is repairable and will never go obsolete. White and seamless is not the only kind of cool.')
