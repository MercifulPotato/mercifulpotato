It&#x27;s not a great apartment. There&#x27;s mould in the bathroom caused by a lack of ventilation. The carpet is a mess. The power keeps cutting out if we plug too many things in.<p>Now imagine I tell the landlord I&#x27;m going to move out unless he fixes these issues and he then offers me a 50% discount on the rent. Now imagine he recoups that discount by putting your rent up by the same amount. And now imagine that I use those savings to buy a nice big TV for the two of us. The bathroom is still covered in mould. The carpet is still a mess. The power still cuts out all the time. And you pay more rent than me.<p>But I bought an awesome TV for us. So I&#x27;m the good guy right?')
