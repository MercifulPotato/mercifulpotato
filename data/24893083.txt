[1] Guliani met with Derkach in Ukraine explicitly to get dirt on Biden - incredibly in the middle of impeachment surrounding Ukraine.. Derkach is a known Russian agent (recently placed on sanctions list - the timing must be noted as well). [2]<p>It&#x27;s been reported that the Biden emails were already being pitched around the time Guliani was in Ukraine - which throws into question the timeline of this computer repair story. [3]<p>Burisma emails were also hacked, and it was widely reported that Russia was going to use them for an &#x27;October surprise.&#x27; Hacking emails&#x2F;iCloud etc is a proven method employed by Russia&#x2F;GRU many many times for similar political interference over the last 4 years. [4]<p>Russia is also known to have mixed false materials into legitimate hacked materials in FR-17 - which is a reported reason why FB&#x2F;TW&#x2F;the legitimate press has refused to spread this [5]<p>It should also be noted that the Trump campaign shopped the story around and not even the Journal (and evidently Fox News too) wouldn&#x27;t report on it. [6]<p>It&#x27;s been widely reported that the FBI is currently investigating. [7]<p>Though personally I call F U on Trump&#x27;s DNI going on Fox News while the FBI sends a &#x27;won&#x27;t break longstanding precedent to comment&#x27; letter to Congress. [7]<p>While not the same as a reciprocal &#x27;Comey disclosure&#x27; at least someone is leaking enough to the press that we know the above. Ironically let&#x27;s hope for more in the the way of Comey -&gt; Richman -&gt; NyTimes<p><i></i> an addition. while not fact, Putin going to the press to &#x27;reject&#x27; this story feels very very much in line with trolling and his underlying effort to just make one question what is real and mess with us [8]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;giuliani-biden-ukraine-russian-disinformation&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;43158900-0ef5-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;giuliani-bi...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;sm1118" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;sm1118</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5902557&#x2F;hunter-biden-rudy-giuliani-ukraine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5902557&#x2F;hunter-biden-rudy-giuliani-ukraine&#x2F;</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;hunter-biden-ukraine-facebook-twitter.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;hunter-biden-...</a>\n[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlanticcouncil.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;The_Macron_Leaks_Operation-A_Post-Mortem.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlanticcouncil.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;T...</a>\n[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;fbi-hunter-biden-laptop-russia&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;3478408a-133d-11eb-bc10-40b25382f1be_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;fbi-hunter-...</a>\n[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;25&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;hunter-biden-wall-street-journal-trump.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;25&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;hunter-bid...</a><p>[8] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-election-putin&#x2F;putin-rejects-donald-trumps-criticism-of-biden-family-business-idUSKBN27A0TA?il=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-election-putin&#x2F;putin-...</a>')
