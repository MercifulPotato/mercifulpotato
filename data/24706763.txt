I coded up a perl script that was basically something like this:<p><pre><code>    #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;perl\n    $score = $ARGV[0]\n\n    if ($score &gt; 90) {\n        print &quot;A&quot;;\n    elsif ($score &gt; 80) {\n        print &quot;B&quot;;\n    elsif ($score &gt; 70) {\n        print &quot;C&quot;;\n    elsif ($score &gt; 60) {\n        print &quot;D&quot;;\n    } else {\n        print &quot;E&quot;;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd I&#x27;d ask, &quot;What do you think happens if you put in &#x27;85&#x27;?  What about 10000?  What about -30?&quot;  If the group I was talking to seemed pretty sharp on the uptake, I&#x27;d ask, &quot;If you wanted to hack it so that people who got 95 got an E, and people who got 50 got an A instead, what would you do?&quot;<p>The kids really seemed to enjoy that.  Apparently they even told the teachers I was teaching them to hack programs -- a bit concerning for the teachers, but mission accomplished as far as I&#x27;m concerned.')
