You &quot;only&quot; need 100khz sensors, fast processing and super quick actuators. You can lower this a bit with lower depth of cut and slower feed rates.<p>Like I said in theory. In practice we don&#x27;t really have the ability to sense that well. While drivers that are that quick exist, they are exotic, or have limited range of motion.')
