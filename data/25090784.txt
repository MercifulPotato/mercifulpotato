I&#x27;m still puzzled by the passion behind &quot;didn&#x27;t happen&quot; claim which still remains unsupported, while showing that the mechanisms for the Thompson&#x27;s statement to be true unsurprisingly exist. I&#x27;m also surprised by your insistence on &quot;C++&quot; sources and &quot;certification&quot; there because neither is a part of his statement.')
