So what do we do with the disenchanted youth?<p>Being in a job is not required for mental health. Women all over the world ...millions of them even..find meaning in life being stay at home moms and working moms quit their jobs to find meaning elsewhere. They don’t suffer from ‘mental health crisises’<p>Employment is not a right. It is an economic transaction. Translating labour to wages is not a given right either without a contract.<p>Every 50+ person would have the opportunity to make a living and the social contract should make way for the next generation to make a living too.<p>Between the ages of 25-50, the working population supports the youth. After 50, the youth will support them. There is no need to fret about massive costs. If anything costs will come down. More people die of stress, hyper tension and heart disease than boredom.')
