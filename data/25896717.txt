Certainly Tesla will have to keep upgrading its systems to achieve true FSD. They could even decide that LIDAR has become cheap enough to use anyway. What they have is cars on the road collecting data. They&#x27;ll have to collect new data and develop new algorithms on that data but that path is not excluded from them.<p>&gt; &quot;It is a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system,&quot; Krafcik said. &quot;In terms of robustness and accuracy, for example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what we see on the road from other manufacturers.&quot;<p>Not a good argument, very handwavy. Better sensors is not a moat. What is your software, how is it qualitatively superior? No one suspected that NNs or even DNNs could produce AlphaGo&#x2F;AlphaZero until it did.<p>Until Waymo gives their tech to the public and we can compare how well their less used but superior hardware and software performs it&#x27;s all opinions and PR.')
