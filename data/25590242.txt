And while this sounds very exciting and fresh I am just not seeing it take hold in Fortune 500s I have&#x2F;am working for.  A few reasons:<p>1) biggest gripe:  I don’t have time to maintain and fix models after I move to a new role.  If it’s a Python based model I build, no one can seem to fix it when some tiny thing breaks 6 months after due to a change in the data.  I’ve had to work weekends to help colleagues fix models that I don’t use anymore.  I can hand Excel to a young or old worker and they can always seem to figure it out and take it over.<p>2) The tools seem limited when directly doing Python in Excel like the one mentioned nothing the article.  VBA kind of sucks in 2020 but until Excel natively accepts Python as part of its base, I don’t love being dependent on these 3rd party tools.  VBA always works.<p>3). I’ve recently complete an MS in Data Sci so I am very familiar with Python and R.  My company doesn’t need that level of model for most things.  We are a best in class in our industry and we get by using lots of Excel models.  I mentioned in my first point that I have built a few things with Python.  When I had to fix I just rebuilt in Excel and that was all I needed.  When I kept fixing the Python code I always felt like I let folks down if I couldn’t fix their stuff right away.  Yet our business makes money and we continue to do well without much Python.<p>I love Python.  But until others start to see its value and a critical mass of individuals knows&#x2F;supports&#x2F;can implement Python, I will put emphasis on learning Excel tools or SQL first because those will always be supported.')
