Yes, you can only remove something if all callsites are gone, need to take care of breaking changes etc, but on the other hand you have clear insight into that and individual components can&#x27;t as easily drag behind and require you to keep old versions around&#x2F;maybe even backport fixes&#x2F;...<p>And ideally a monorepo workflow gives you the tools to a) find all callsites, b) run tests to ensure your changes won&#x27;t break anything, c) apply changes in lockstep. Those tools are an engineering effort, but the equivalents for a large multi-repo setup are too.')
