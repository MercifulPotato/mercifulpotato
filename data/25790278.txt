Probably just comes down to numbers.<p>I think it&#x27;s likely less a question of focusing closer to home and more a product of how the publishing industry operates, as you suggested earlier. Would certainly be an interesting question for more investigation. If it were just down to numbers, I&#x27;d expect at least one book written in a non-Western language-- English language readers assuredly aren&#x27;t quite as insular as the list would suggest.<p>&gt;It would be interesting to see how culture impacts story&#x2F;book. Russia seems to have so many amazing works of literature, but is that a function of their culture, or because of the intense focus the USA&#x2F;UK put on Russia and learning their mindset during the Cold War, or because of something else?<p>This is also a really interesting question. There might even be some historians here who can chime in on it. It&#x27;s common for certain countries&#x27; language and literature to become &quot;in vogue&quot; at different points in time (e.g. French was really popular in Russia in the 19th century, following the French Revolution). Maybe a similar effect played a role?')
