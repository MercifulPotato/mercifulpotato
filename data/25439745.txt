I&#x27;m not hooked to their platform because they don&#x27;t show me what I want to see. But what you said imply that there is some addictive content that people would normally avoid, but Facebook helps them get addicted. Truly evil. I&#x27;m not active Facebook user so I don&#x27;t know how it goes there.')
