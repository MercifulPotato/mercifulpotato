Eg. California (large solar generation) shares a grid with Washington and British Columbia (large hydro generation). When the sun is shining, hydro reservoirs can be filling, as solar is meeting the demand. When the sun goes down, hydro facilities can duty cycle on and drain the overhead. This requires some flexibility in reservoir levels, as well as the ability to stop&#x2F;re-spin turbines on a daily cadence. But you eliminate all of the efficiency losses with schemes such as pumped storage (though gain some transmission losses due to the increase length of geographic arbitrage).<p>The same opportunity exists on the East-West axis. The sun is still shining in California after its set on the East coast.')
