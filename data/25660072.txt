But, there&#x27;s a Buy-Nothing group I want to join, and they are on FB.  I admire the concept of Buy-Nothing, but I abhor FB and am not going to make an account to join Buy-Nothing.  Even if I were to start a new Buy-Nothing group, FB provides the most reach because it&#x27;s pervasive and probably easiest to use, and one can be tagged with one&#x27;s location. Mailing lists don&#x27;t thread well, GoogleGroup is a dumpster fire.  What other tools can I use to build a like-minded community for good?')
