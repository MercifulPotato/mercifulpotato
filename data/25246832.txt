The point of failure was when I burnt out and ran out of money in month 5.<p>Looking back, the venture was doomed from the beginning. I think it was due to a lack of structure:<p>* No daily routines to take care of my physical &amp; mental health (working 0-16 hrs a day on 3 coffees is not good haha)<p>* No systems in place to socialize (sometimes I&#x27;d go weeks without talking to friends)<p>* No clear weekly&#x2F;monthly goals. I would operate on 1-2 day sprints and constantly change the product roadmap &amp; distribution strategy<p>* No clear distribution strategy. I kind of just did whatever came to mind<p>* No focus on generating income. I wanted to build cool shit that impressed people &gt; building something of value and asking people for money in return<p>That period of my life was pretty dark and depressing, but a period I&#x27;m glad I went through. In the end I learned how to code (which has 2x&#x27;d my income potential) and I learned a ton about product &amp; business.<p>I&#x27;m going to go for it again, and when I do I plan on putting a much bigger emphasis on taking care of my physical &amp; mental health, as well committing to 1-2 month plans (instead of changing plans every 1-2 days)')
