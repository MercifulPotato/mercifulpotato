No exceptions.<p>Are there any thermostats like that?  The only mass market product like that that I know of like is Philips Hue lights (their base stations have a local REST API, or at least they did last time I really used them).<p>My &quot;don&#x27;t buy it&quot; threshold is unnecessarily cloud-only features or mandatory cloud integration.
