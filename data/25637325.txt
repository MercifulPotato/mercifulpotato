(Or at least all names that he didn&#x27;t know belonged to people whose lives would not be put at risk by their publication.) He didn&#x27;t.<p><i>&gt; Newspapers were NOT in the same position.</i><p>It is true that newspapers (and other &quot;mainstream&quot; media organizations) have a special relationship with governments (and note that I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s right that they do, only that as a matter of fact they do), so they aren&#x27;t in exactly the same position as Wikileaks. That still does not excuse Wikileaks putting people&#x27;s lives at risk by publishing their names.<p><i>&gt; people exposing war criminals get more blame that actual war criminals</i><p>I haven&#x27;t said anything at all about blame regarding anyone other than Assange, so you have no basis for even making any such comparison.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not blaming Assange for publishing the material itself. I&#x27;m blaming him for publishing people&#x27;s names and putting their lives at risk. As I&#x27;ve already said, he could have published the material without publishing the names. He chose not to.')
