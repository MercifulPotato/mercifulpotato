Item(by='cgearhart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607117312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306554, text='None, but the app had notifications enabled because they were previously using them reasonably (eg when someone replied to a comment). Then they started using them for all kinds of other things like “did you see the new post in &#x2F;r&#x2F;funny?”, and while I _could_ just turn off the notifications this was the last of many signals that their objectives and motivations no longer align with a positive user experience for me.<p>The overall quality of my experience on Reddit was slowly degrading for the past few years. I didn’t enjoy the culture of the subs I visited any more, or the apparent culture of the site overall—and Reddit itself seemed to be funneling me towards those people and places because that kind of mild controversy drives engagement. But it felt like it had become an unjustifiable waste of time because I wasn’t even being enriched or entertained anymore. They started pushing harder to share my location, watch live broadcasts, use their chat, started abusing app notifications, and the ads became surprisingly intrusive. Eventually I just decided to leave.<p>I don’t really begrudge them any of the changes if it helps them build a successful, sustainable business that their users enjoy—I’m just not interested in the new experiences and functionality they have prioritized.')
