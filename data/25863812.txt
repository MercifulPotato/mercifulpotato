If this new generator requires access to the .winmd files or .h files from the SDK or whatever, where is the non-Windows builder going to get those from? And will this generator look for them there?<p>From memory (I haven&#x27;t done Windows development in forever): there&#x27;s a few projects that try to provide an open source version of the Windows API headers. The MingW project, for example, has a full set of drop-in replacement headers (meaning you can take code that compiled with Visual C++ and compile it directly with MingW&#x27;s GCC and it should &#x27;just work&#x27;). The LCC-Win64 project has a similar set of headers.<p>Does that answer your question?')
