Is that not true? Otherwise I’m not sure how this is relevant to my comment, since I explicitly called out that two of the deaths were “natural causes”.<p>I’d say that poor woman died precisely because she was brainwashed by an amorphous, cult-like movement—the very same movement behind the entire event, more or less—to think that leading an armed mob to where the members of our government’s legislative branch were taking shelter wouldn’t result in the use of force against her. So maybe the rioters didn’t kill her on an individual level, but the <i>riot</i> certainly did—and that’s relevant in the quantitative comparison I made in my previous comment.')
