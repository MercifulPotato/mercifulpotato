We&#x27;re depending on remill not only to lift binaries, but also to add instrumentation for interposing on and translate memory accesses and function calls. We could use uninstrumented LLVM IR as input, but would need to write an LLVM pass to add in equivalent instrumentation. This shouldn&#x27;t be terribly hard, but we&#x27;re currently focused on getting everything working with remill.')
