They&#x27;re almost comically predictable as time goes on.<p>Everyone in a group falls into patterns, roles. The same jokes get told, or variations there-of. You do the same thing every year. BBQ for Bob&#x27;s birthday. Jill hosts a cheese&#x2F;wine night a couple of times over winter. The geekier sub-group all gather to watch the first few episodes of the new marvel series. Everyone gets together for a picnic in woolaton park on the first or second sunny weekend of sunmer.<p>Occasionally something new gets thrown in, and if everyone likes it, it becomes the &#x27;new&#x27; regular thing. Or something gets dropped due to changes in life or circumstances. No more games nights till 2am now 80% of my male friends have kids. No more Saturday night clubbing in the cookie club after we left our 20s.<p>If you want to keep doing unpredictable things, you really have to meet someone who&#x27;s extremely hyper&#x2F;exhausting, or keep joing new social groups (by meetups, etc.). And of course, they become predictable too, by their very nature being a scheduled meetup about a specific thing.<p>And it&#x27;s worth it. Personally I feel the best experience in life is laughing so hard you end up crying while chatting with your friends.')
