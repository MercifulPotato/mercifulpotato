Person B has 1 day to get the share back or they&#x27;re in default.  It&#x27;s up to Person B to buy back from whoever is selling at whatever price they want.<p>It is possible for short sellers to get caught as you describe (someone owns all the stock and they have bought 1 additional share and now wont sell).  But it&#x27;s very rare.  It requires a few things to all happen at the same time:<p>* 1 person has to own all the stock.  This in itself is very unusual.  In many jurisdictions there are a whole bunch of extra requirements once you own more than X%.<p>* Someone has to want to short the company.  If it&#x27;s small enough to be owned entirely by 1 person, it&#x27;s probably too small to attract short sellers or to be lent.  Unless someone BOTH wants to short this small stock, AND happens to know the broker in question has some, no one knows who to ask to borrow it.<p>* They have to short it over 100%.  This is unlikely, since a small company that&#x27;s been bought entirely by 1 person, who is left to buy more?  The market is one sided as apparently the only buyer is the guy holding 100% already (if anyone else bought those shares, they could sell them back to the shorter).<p>It&#x27;s really really rare.<p>Technically the short seller defaults when they cannot source the stock, he has to absorb whatever losses he&#x27;s caused the broker.')
