I don&#x27;t hold out much hope for future regulation,</i><p>GDPR is quite decent as laws go; the problems you mention happen because the regulation <i>enforcement</i> is too weak. Displaying a cookie popup was never anything but an admission that you&#x27;re doing something you&#x27;re not supposed to. GDPR notices again mostly give the same evidence. A lot of them aren&#x27;t even compliant. I honestly wish DPAs of EU member states would start beating these companies down until this bullshit stops.<p>&gt; <i>I suspect you are confusing corporatism (which is a form of fascism) with capitalism (which is a party of liberty).</i><p>Potayto, potahto. Capitalism structurally favors something resembling corporatism, because <i>capital compounds</i> - the more you have of it, the easier it is to get even more.
