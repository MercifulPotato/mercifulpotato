I did try to look you up on LinkedIn to maybe find out more (before writing my previous comment) - but found nothing.<p>For reference, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve jumped around a lot. I&#x27;ve had 5 different software engineering jobs in the 5 years I&#x27;ve been in the bay area. I moved to learn more, increase my pay, and hopefully find a rewarding environment. Still looking. Most everyone wants money, recognition, and control...<p>Do you think what the article wrote about is more important to your success (managing a standup act, mcdonalds, joining puppet) than the years that were not really mentioned? I wonder if maybe the person you were managed by, if the people who mentored you (if any), and what not were influential to your success and desire to push yourself out into conferences and making talks. I guess - I just wonder if your formative years of becoming a more senior software engineer meant nothing. Was it all just your own internal desires and no one would&#x27;ve influenced anything regardless and you were bound for whatever an L8 gets compensated?')
