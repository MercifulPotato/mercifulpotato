And no, Google office suite doesn&#x27;t count; it barely matured out of toy stage recently.<p>MS tools have also huge, compounding advantages for larger companies who go all-in - they interoperate deeply. UX-wise, it&#x27;s all quite not bad, and I could even bear it being proprietary; I just wish they didn&#x27;t put all that telemetry crap into it - MS is ruining both their OS and their office suites by doing that.')
