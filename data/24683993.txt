Lemire&#x27;s algorithm is not an RNG, but a way to map uniformly random bits (from some other RNG) to a non-power of two[1] range 1..N (or 0..N-1) efficiently on average.<p>---<p>[1] Well, it works for power-of-two too, but you certainly wouldn&#x27;t use this if you wanted a power of two range: you can just extract the required number of bits directly.')
