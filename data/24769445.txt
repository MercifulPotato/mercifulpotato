I started by exploring. It is the path that we take which is the interesting part in life, not the end of the road.<p>When I first thought about Open Startup List, it was from pure interest in learning, and thinking broad and &quot;out of the box&quot;.<p>When I set out to build the idea, while other similar sites existed, it was my way to express what I wanted that differentiated my website than the rest out there, and it is the work I had put into it that made it surface above other websites in the genre.<p>It started really tiny, at first it was just a simple list with open startups but later it evolved into a blog and was featured in many places including getting featured in a tech magazine.<p>The hype was huge around this, what I call - a tiny product, that eventually after being approached by a buyer, that spiked my interest in selling, I listed it and sold it to another entrepreneur.<p>Later I&#x27;ve written an E-Book about my experiences and takeaways, which is now on AppSumo.<p>All of this wouldn&#x27;t be possible if I wouldn&#x27;t set my mind on trying and being out there.<p>So I encourage each of you to give your best and be the best you can.<p>Plus, don&#x27;t forget to enjoy life and appreciate your close ones. Life is too short to focus just on success.<p>For anyone interested, my book is called Start With A Side-Project.')
