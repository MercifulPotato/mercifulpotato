Backup, delete repo, re-pull and re-add my changes. No explanation of what&#x27;s doing under the hood. Simplify branches for simple repos. Power users can do their thing seperate.<p>And improve GitHub. A WYSIWYG to edit .md files for instance.<p>I think it&#x27;s not impossible to get Git and GitHub good.')
