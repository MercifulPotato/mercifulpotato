Lambda is the only one I&#x27;m familiar with. I can guess something about CodeDeploy. CloudFormation has always been unclear to me, and a quick Google suggests that it overlaps with Kubernetes.<p>That&#x27;s OK; I just read this as &quot;not for me&quot;. Every time I touch AWS, I get the impression that it&#x27;s for large-scale deployments of stuff that&#x27;s way out of my hobbyist league. I&#x27;m sure I could get it if I put my mind to it, but I&#x27;m just as happy that I don&#x27;t have to.')
