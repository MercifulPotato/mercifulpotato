He definitely deserves kudos. But here&#x27;s the rub. You will not see this post. I have been secretely ghosted out so all my comments goes to bottom no matter how thoughful or informative it may be. There is no way for me to de-ghosted. He or other mod probably did this to me for some reason I don&#x27;t even know or remember. The moderation at HN is like life sentense that you don&#x27;t even know why and when you got it and then cannot be challanged.')
