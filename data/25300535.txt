Item(by='francislavoie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607074125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298795, text='Right now I have an HP Spectre laptop that I&#x27;m running Linux on. It&#x27;s showing its age as my daily-driver for work (only like 4 years old). It can manage to pump out the 3440x1440p60 signal over USB-C thunderbolt that I need, but just turning on youtube or a video call makes it slow to a crawl, it can barely keep up.<p>I&#x27;ve been eyeing an upgrade to a Dell XPS because it ticks pretty much all the boxes for me, but it&#x27;s Intel. I&#x27;d much rather go AMD, but thunderbolt support is a huuuge plus for me because I have a Dell monitor with USB-C that acts like a KVM. Button on the monitor to switch from my windows desktop to my linux laptop, swaps over all my USB devices at the same time, charges the laptop through the monitor; only one cable to do it all! It&#x27;s AMAZING.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering what kind of support for Displayport over USB-C this System76 laptop will have. I realize I won&#x27;t be able to do the whole &quot;one cable to do everything&quot; approach here (omg can we please standardize on USB 4 already so everything can do this? gah!) but if I went in this direction, how much would I need to do to plug in everything?')
