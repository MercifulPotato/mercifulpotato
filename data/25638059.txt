There are plenty of people with similar stories like this one complaining on forums like r&#x2F;PPC. Dealing with Facebook is like a bureaucratic nightmare from a Kafka story even for customers who spend millions of dollars.<p>But of course these cases remain a minority or else Facebook would already be bankrupt. That&#x27;s why the majority will call these people whiners, probably guilty, and so on.<p>Basically, what Facebook is doing is automatized slander. You&#x27;ve violated some policy but we don&#x27;t tell you which one. You&#x27;ve been caught in &quot;suspicious behavior&quot; (an actual term used by them) but we don&#x27;t tell you what we mean by that. You&#x27;ve tried to circumvent our policies - or maybe you haven&#x27;t, just beg us to give you another chance.<p>Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s not fun having to deal with this, and no company should rely much on Facebook ads.')
