Almost everyone was predicting a landslide for Biden and it&#x27;s dead heat right now.<p>It seems that there&#x27;s something wrong with the polls themselves, how the models interpret the polls, or both.<p>There&#x27;s lots of talk about &quot;stealing the election&quot; coming from both sides.  Lopsided predictions from polls and models can increase the perception that the election was &quot;stolen&quot; if the vote defies the predictions.')
