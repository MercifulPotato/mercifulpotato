If you use OPUS for example, it becomes nearly impossible to tell.<p>But one thing we should not forget: these codecs are used for <i>distribution</i> or <i>streaming</i>. If you ever record something that has to be edited, filtered, treated with an EQ, denoised etc. then go for at least 24 Bit Wav. Compressed audio is great for when the thing already sounds the way it should, but it starts to fall apart very quickly when you manipulate it heavily.')
