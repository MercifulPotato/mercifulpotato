Yes it can scale up, but what it gives you at any scale is a reliable ordered log that supports multiple producers and consumers. If this is not what you need, then by all means don&#x27;t use it or similarly complex software. I&#x27;ve used AWS SQS and Kinesis at small and large (not big data) scales and even then in retrospect believe Kafka would have served much better.')
