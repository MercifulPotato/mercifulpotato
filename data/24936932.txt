Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604011008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24935823, text='&gt;&quot;All of these new materials, the authenticity of which has never been disputed by Hunter Biden or the Biden campaign&quot;---absence of a denial is not proof of its validity.<p>He explicitly explains why he thinks it does serve as some additional evidence of such, and I agree with it. It&#x27;s not proof, but it&#x27;s evidence:<p>&gt;Why is the failure of the Bidens to claim that these emails are forged so significant? Because when journalists report on a massive archive, they know that the most important event in the reporting&#x27;s authentication process comes when the subjects of the reporting have an opportunity to deny that the materials are genuine. Of course that is what someone would do if major media outlets were preparing to publish, or in fact were publishing, fabricated or forged materials in their names; they would say so in order to sow doubt about the materials if not kill the credibility of the reporting.<p>&gt;The silence of the Bidens may not be dispositive on the question of the material’s authenticity, but when added to the mountain of other authentication evidence, it is quite convincing: at least equal to the authentication evidence in other reporting on similarly large archives.<p>----<p>&gt;Facebook, through a long-time former Democratic Party operative, vowed to suppress the story pending its “fact-check,” one that has as of yet produced no public conclusions.&quot;---an unnamed source told me that Facebook is really trying to push the election to Biden…<p>He doesn&#x27;t name him in this article for some reason, but he links another article he wrote, where he explains this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;facebook-and-twitter-cross-a-line-far-more-dangerous-than-what-they-censor&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;facebook-and-twitter-cro...</a><p>&gt;Just two hours after the story was online, Facebook intervened. The company dispatched a life-long Democratic Party operative who now works for Facebook — Andy Stone, previously a communications operative for Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, among other D.C. Democratic jobs — to announce that Facebook was “reducing [the article’s] distribution on our platform”: in other words, tinkering with its own algorithms to suppress the ability of users to discuss or share the news article. The long-time Democratic Party official did not try to hide his contempt for the article, beginning his censorship announcement by snidely noting: “I will intentionally not link to the New York Post.”')
