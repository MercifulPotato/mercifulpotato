That seems pretty narrow-minded.<p>My country has almost no black people (probably &lt;1% though I don’t know that official stats on race are even collected) and it would be extremely expensive for us to include black people at US levels (13%) in all research.<p>Perhaps they are advocating we use world demographics but that would be logistically impossible for basically all researchers around the world.<p>Am I misunderstanding the author or does the article seem pretty ethnocentric? (is that the right word?) US-centric?<p>Wouldn’t it be better to just qualify&#x2F;label the demographics of the research data (we used all black people, all white people etc). They talk as if there is some golden ratio we should all be following but that just isn’t the case.<p>In any case, I don’t think it is useful to shame researchers that are just doing the best they can with the data available cause the data they have is useful to someone.')
