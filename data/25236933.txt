Every time I try to search for something on GitHub, I have to sift through tons and tons of useless results from tests.<p>Edit: The discussion has taken a weird turn into support for ignore files. To be clear, this feedback is about dynamically filtering searches when using a website to do code search, most likely searching someone else’s repo on someone else’s website; you don’t have access to the filesystem, the search form is the only input. So all this “rg supports ignore files” (I’m aware, but thanks) is not really relevant.')
