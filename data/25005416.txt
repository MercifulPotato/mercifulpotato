You can&#x27;t make this stuff up. The students have every right to be very angry, they&#x27;ve been ripped off for money and are stuck in a very uncomfortable place to do lockdown. Everyone knew it would happen, staying home and refusing to return was &quot;discouraged&quot; by way of pure retribution. You don&#x27;t come back, you forfeit your place and everything you&#x27;ve worked for.<p>People aren&#x27;t scared enough of students because apparently naked fear is the only motivator to get these awful politicians to behave with even the smallest shred of decency. Lock them in, claim they were told it would happen then acknowledge that this claim was a total lie. No consequences. All the expense, all hassle and frustration on the students. Milk them harder, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re for say the powers that be.')
