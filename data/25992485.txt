Item(by='NobodyNada', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612207377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25990281, text='&gt; NES.css uses 12 distinct colours. So how exactly is NES.css breaking &quot;that feel&quot;?<p>Some of the colors used here don’t exist in the NES palette — for example, the NES cannot display bright yellow (the best it can do are are the colors of the coins in Super Mario Bros. or the colors of Brinstar enemies in Metroid). The NES does not at all look “vibrant” or “crisp”, especially after all the artifacts from its cheap analog video generator.<p>&gt; the NES [...] does allow you to define your own type faces<p>Yes, but (unless you want to do some really awkward tricks) the characters must be aligned to an 8x8-pixel grid. The text in this page is ~9x12 or something like that (including spacing), and the alignment is not consistent throughout the page.<p>&gt; All these complaints about colour pallets, while demonstrably wrong, is just nitpicking of the highest order.<p>Sure, it’s definitely nitpicking. This framework looks great: it perfectly captures the “faux-8-bit” style that’s popular today. And it’s true that the NES is now the representative console of the 8-bit era. However, it’s also true that the NES (like every console of that era) had its own distinctive look-and-feel beyond just “big pixels”.')
