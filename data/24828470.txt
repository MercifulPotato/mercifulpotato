I was messing around on my Ti-83, when I discovered that `e^(i*pi)` resulted in `-1`. That blew my mind, so I showed my pre-calc teacher and he thought it was just a calculator glitch because it didn&#x27;t know how to calculate imaginary powers.<p>I kind of forgot about it until the full formula surfaced  in one of my electrical engineering classes in college and I realized I had (partially) stumbled across the formula by accident a few years earlier!')
