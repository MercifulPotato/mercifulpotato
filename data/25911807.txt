I&#x27;ve observed (in a completely non-scientific way of course) that in whichever groups that contains both men and women if a woman says &quot;Hey all, let&#x27;s move to Signal?&quot;, almost everyone will move quickly. If a man initiates that instead, you&#x27;re going to get blank responses. So convince a woman in the groups ;)')
