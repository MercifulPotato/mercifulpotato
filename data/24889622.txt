A more non-statist communism (re: unions and local area orgs that manage 90% of all needs), worker coops, less power for D.C. more for states and local municipalities.<p>healthcare being ran by a union of worker coops, that all pay taxes into the union of unions to manage healthcare for all members (workers and consumers who are members of the union)... Don&#x27;t want to be part of the union then don&#x27;t and if your employer still has their own health ins. use that, or maybe they use ours anyways cause it&#x27;d be better... Either way options still exist with the best ones rising to the top like normal capitalism, just CEOs and execs wouldn&#x27;t be paid as well, because their value is a lot less than they think it is.')
