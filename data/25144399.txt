Item(by='ttt0', descendants=None, kids=[25144504], score=None, time=1605743995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25144022, text='I don&#x27;t keep track of this, but there is a lot of &quot;canceling&quot; going on recently. If we talk strictly about politics, I did saw a couple of left-leaning people who got fired for politics, because the angry mob went after their employment. But most of the time I see it happening to right-leaning people. And what I never saw was anyone on the left got kicked off platforms like PayPal for example. Though it&#x27;s within the realm of possibility that the social media just gave me the impression that this is the case. However, considering the fact that basically every corporation and even some of the smaller companies are changing their logos in support of BLM, LGBT Pride etc., I think it&#x27;s quite reasonable to assume that.')
