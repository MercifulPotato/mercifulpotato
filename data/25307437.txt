Instead the economics is pretty clear that most large firms create synergies that empower individual workers to produce much more than they&#x27;d be capable of individually or in small, informal organizations. As a bonus, the sizable bulk of this productivity surplus accumulates in the form of higher wages to the workers themselves.<p>Big business accomplishes this by consistently applying the best practices in organizational management[2]. In contrast small business tends to be much more sloppily managed with a lot more decisions made haphazardly, with many more decisions being made for individual gain rather than the good of the organization as a whole.<p>If anything the balance of the evidence would make a much stronger case that small business is really more exploitative than big business.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;117089?seq=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;117089?seq=1</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.aeaweb.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdfplus&#x2F;10.1257&#x2F;jep.24.1.203" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.aeaweb.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdfplus&#x2F;10.1257&#x2F;jep.24.1.203</a>')
