Item(by='duckerude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611757993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928196, text='&gt; Your total payoff is also the contribution that other voters pay to you, and they pay to you because you pay to them.<p>That&#x27;s too indirect. It&#x27;s a tragedy of the commons style situation: if nobody votes then everybody is much worse off, but if any one person doesn&#x27;t vote that barely hurts them individually.<p>The concrete incentive to vote is social. If you don&#x27;t vote then people will consider you a freeloader. That changes the equation: while there&#x27;s still barely any individual election result payoff of your individual vote, there&#x27;s a social cost of not voting that&#x27;s higher than the cost of voting, so voting is worth it even for purely selfish reasons.<p>And that takes it into crony belief territory. You&#x27;re doing it for social reasons, not just because you think it&#x27;s correct, but because your social group thinks it&#x27;s correct.<p>(That doesn&#x27;t make it wrong, or bad. It&#x27;s a useful mechanism.)<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not really that different from your money on your bank account if you think about it, only small amount of daily spending gets immediately back to you as &quot;reward&quot; for the decisions you made.<p>The difference is that coordinating with myself is much easier than coordinating with other people. There&#x27;s no way to freeload off myself in the long term, but freeloading off other people is a real possibility with all kinds of countermeasures. Social pressure is one such countermeasure.')
