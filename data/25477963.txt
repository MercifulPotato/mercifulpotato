To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure how the refurbished thing works. That&#x27;s why the whole paragraph is full of &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;perhaps&quot; and &quot;my theory is&quot;. It&#x27;s all just speculation. The shop where I bought it had it marked as refurbished, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m sure about, but I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the exact history of the machine. I&#x27;ve heard rumors those are computers from Apple Store etc., hence the speculation about worn out display, but I&#x27;ve never really investigated it further. Doesn&#x27;t matter much now, whatever the reason, the display is dead.')
