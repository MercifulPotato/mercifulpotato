I tried to create a table called `test`, but I got `something went wrong but we won&#x27;t say what`. It&#x27;s also not clear to me what to do with a table (I don&#x27;t see any options to add columns or data).<p>EDIT: Maybe it&#x27;s just being hugged to death. Just about every action is throwing the aforementioned error now.<p>EDIT2: This would be really cool if it were self-hosted (obviously without the auto-deletion)!')
