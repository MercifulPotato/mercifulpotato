I never really looked because when I bought my headphones I wanted to have noise-cancelling and for them to be compatible with phones without any additional gear, so BT was pretty much the only choice.<p>However, I remember some fifteen years ago a friend of mine had a pair of wireless headphones that had no perceptible lag when playing games. They weren&#x27;t USB, they would plug in a standard audio output, though.<p>I also have a Jabra kit with a base that connects to the computer via USB and a wireless headset. This seems to have much less lag than BT, but I don&#x27;t know how the two communicate nor how little lag there actually is.<p>I expect the &quot;gaming&quot; USB models to work similarly.')
