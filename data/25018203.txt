From my perspective, it&#x27;s something that was originally designed with fairly good intentions, that is now being abused by the minority to impose their will upon everyone.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that Democrats have won the popular vote in all but one presidential election this century. And that the Senate&#x27;s structure has allowed the party representing a minority of Americans to reshape the federal judiciary for years to come. (And unless a rabbit gets pulled out of a hat somewhere, they&#x27;ll <i>still</i> have outsized control over judicial confirmations for at least the next 2 years.)<p>I&#x27;m all for preventing the tyranny of the majority, but these features of US government haven&#x27;t resulted in moderation, they&#x27;ve resulted in tyranny of the minority.')
