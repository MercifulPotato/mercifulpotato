It&#x27;s confusing, but explicit in the ecmascript spec.  That form of class definition is called a ClassDeclaration, and they don&#x27;t take semicolons.  I haven&#x27;t checked, but I think what you&#x27;ve typed here is valid because the parser sees a zero-length expression after the &#x27;}&#x27;.<p>The reason it&#x27;s confusing is because if you modify it very slightly, then the semicolon becomes required:<p><pre><code>    let Bar = class Foo {\n      ...\n    };\n</code></pre>\nIn that context, precisely the same sequence of characters as you had before is now called a ClassExpression, and the semicolon isn&#x27;t attached to the class, but instead to the preceding let.<p>I do find semicolons useful as an indicator at the end of the class expression that there&#x27;s a let or a const somewhere above, but it&#x27;s far simpler to just <i>not do that</i> and pretend that language facility doesn&#x27;t exist unless you really, really need it.')
