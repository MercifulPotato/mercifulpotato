I also do TLS there. However, everything gets its own records in DNS too. I use dynamic updates from my DHCP server to a bind9 instance for that. This all works very well for IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously... I admit its more complicated to set all of this up properly but maybe its just the way it is ;)')
