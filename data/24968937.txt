More if you want some of the paid features and a database instance. It all works out of the box with instant deployment out of the box, it&#x27;s fantastic.<p>Then it suddenly goes $50 more per gigabyte of RAM, which makes it massively expensive for any serious workload. It&#x27;s crazy hot much they can try to charge, makes AWS looks like a bunch of clowns in comparison.')
