If they are connected to my computer and I am watching a video and my phone rings, they switch over without any intervention.  At the end of the day when I hop on my Peloton they connect to that without intervention, too.<p>I am sure the Apple stuff works well too but let&#x27;s not pretend that they are doing anything unique in this space.')
