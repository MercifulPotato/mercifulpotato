It&#x27;s an excellent practice that often leads to an appreciation of the work, or at the very least an understanding of other people&#x27;s pleasure in it, which in itself can be enlightening. It&#x27;s difficult to do without the discipline of an essay - just thinking about it doesn&#x27;t force you to explicitly articulate your dislike as much - although it&#x27;s also possible in cordial discussions with someone who does like it. I came round to artists like Rachel Whiteread and Tracey Emin because of that process and it widened my horizons considerably.')
