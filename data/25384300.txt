I’ve even seen a number of .NET teams who bootcamp with them. I’m contracting in a reasonably large bank right now, and most of the people in my office use MacBooks.<p>It’s true that large enterprise is slow and cumbersome. But they really don’t care too much if they’re buying you a MacBook, or a surface, or a Dell. Their main concern is whether they can properly manage all their devices, which isn’t too hard to do these days. Whether a large enterprise has MacBooks or not depends a lot more on whether or not they’ve figured out how to use JAMF than it does anything else.')
