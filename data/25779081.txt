But if you&#x27;re shipping a small library and only need one or two of these functions, you might want to forgo the dependency. Using jQuery in your library forces it as a dependency onto everyone who uses your library, potentially making them deal with version conflicts if your version of jQuery doesn&#x27;t align with their version of jQuery (or the version that another dependency wants).')
