But this is the version of the story that puts the OP in the best light, and still, my overall impression is it just seems like it&#x27;s not worth it.<p>What&#x27;s the best case scenario they could get out of it? Maybe 6% equity, or maybe a $10k severance. But going after a company with no revenue and only $40k in the bank doesn&#x27;t really seem like the best use of anyone&#x27;s time, energy or money.<p>There&#x27;s minimal available short-term value, and litigation&#x2F;fighting will sharply blunt any potential long-term value.')
