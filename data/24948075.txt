Unions in the US started out fighting for basic decent treatment - reasonable hours and pay, safer working conditions, etc...  Some years ago I was in a manufacturing plant and the break (lunch) room had a big television in it. Turns out the union had demanded the TV in their most recent contract. Someone I was speaking to berated the union &quot;those idiots demand a TV, don&#x27;t they have real concerns?&quot; I realized the problem is that the adversarial nature had grown so bad - probably on both sides - that <i>nothing</i> could be had without a negotiation and putting it in writing. That goes for work from the union: &quot;that&#x27;s not my job&quot; or worse - &quot;you&#x27;re getting written up for doing something that&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s job&quot; to the management &quot;no we&#x27;re not giving you anything we don&#x27;t have to by contract&quot;. Once you start writing things down and trying to nit-pick it can lead to a terrible place where nothing is easy for anyone.')
