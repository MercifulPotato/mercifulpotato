Not that police should escalate.<p>In any case, they&#x27;ve now posted the body cam videos. I don&#x27;t see any evidence of police &quot;freaking out&quot;. You can see from the video, there was never a gun in her face. IMO they demonstrated patience (trying to get her to open the door for over 20 minutes) and seem very professional.<p><pre><code>  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;489556079\n  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;489554493\n</code></pre>\n&gt; <i>The body camera video starts at 8:25 a.m., when a female Tallahassee Police Department officer and male FDLE agent approach the door. At 8:26, they began ringing the doorbell and knocking on the door. During the initial approach, agents tried to minimize disruption to the children, attempting to speak with Ms. Jones at the door to explain the search warrant. At approximately 8:31, agents went to the back of the house and saw Ms. Jones’ husband going upstairs.  The situation continued for 23 minutes without cooperation of Ms. Jones, including several phone calls to her.</i><p>&gt; <i>Upon entry into Ms. Jones’ residence (8:48am), agents observed a video camera, pointed in the direction of the front door, which appeared to be recording the entire time the agents were inside the residence. The video, property of Ms. Jones, was not seized during the search warrant. Electronic devices belonging to Ms. Jones’ children and husband were forensically examined on scene and determined to have no investigative value. Those devices were not seized in an effort to minimize disruption to the family.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fdle.state.fl.us&#x2F;News&#x2F;2020&#x2F;December&#x2F;FDLE-releases-full-body-camera-footage-from-Rebeka" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fdle.state.fl.us&#x2F;News&#x2F;2020&#x2F;December&#x2F;FDLE-release...</a>')
