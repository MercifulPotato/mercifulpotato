I called him after he was hired to do a story about it and he acted like I was trying to kill him . &quot;I CAN&#x27;T TALK TO YOU!!! you&#x27;re a reporter!!&quot; Imagine that feeling being imparted like 2 days after yer hired. Also imagine how hard they made it for him to keep contributing to CUPS. I only wanted to talk about CUPS, I didn&#x27;t give two shits about the Apple news, only what it meant for CUPS going forward. They never let me even speak to Apple PR about it, let alone him.')
