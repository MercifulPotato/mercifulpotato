I won’t touch or recommend DigitalOcean to anyone unless it employs some humans to address and respond to queries instead of sending the same automated replies. The very first time I created an account, it charged my card for verification and then blocked my account (the charge was also immediately reversed) since its systems believed this was fraud. There was no way to get to a human, get any additional verification done and get my account reinstated. All I got was a string of automated replies with the same text. I decided then that this is not a company to rely on.<p>I don’t mind fraud protection measures, and am willing to provide additional verification based on what’s asked for and relevance. But there’s no such process with this company.<p>Later I see large scale layoffs in DigitalOcean, and I don’t think the situation could get any better.<p>I know the same kind of lack of customer service could be said of Google and certain other companies too. But DigitalOcean made my very first experience a bitter one and to advocate against it.')
