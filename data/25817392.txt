I find delivering the things, assuming they are small enough as I have no car so it will be done by cycle or by taking a detour on a run, at a time if my choosing works.<p>I also ask directly in the listing that people let me know approximately where they are without me having to ask, and I ignore anyone who doesn&#x27;t - this weeds out the people who just mash &quot;can I have this&quot; or &quot;is this still available&quot; without actually reading the listing, who are most likely to be time wasters in my experience.<p>For higher value items in the current C19 climate, insisting I deliver locally also stops people taking unnecessary journies between risk areas, and puts me in more control of my risk profile.')
