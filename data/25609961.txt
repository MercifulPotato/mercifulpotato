I&#x27;m sure a lot of you set resolutions for yourself today and I wish you nothing but success. Personally I&#x27;ve never been a goal setter and shy away from attaching myself to any particular vision of the future.. But I&#x27;m curious:<p>If you have a vision&#x2F;dream&#x2F;passion, what&#x27;s holding you back from pursuing or, if you&#x27;re already in pursuit, achieving it?<p>I&#x27;ll start:\nI don&#x27;t think I know or maybe even have let myself decide on a vision to pursue. A lot of you have &quot;life&#x27;s work&quot; visions or passion projects here and I admire that, but for me my attention span for any single vision thus far has been quite short (~1 year) and thus unfruitful in terms of traditional &quot;success&quot; metrics..<p>So I&#x27;m curious - what do you think is holding you back?<p>There&#x27;s no right&#x2F;wrong answers here, except to maybe just write what first comes to your mind. Thanks all :)')
