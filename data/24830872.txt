We use Facebook Messenger for all of our communication. This is despite quite a few valid complaints (privacy, not everybody has Facebook, lack of custom rooms, etc). Why? Well currently the onboarding process is this: person expresses interest, person gets added to Messenger group. With another platform, it becomes person expresses interest, we give person a form to create an account. The difference is push versus pull.<p>Facebook is nobody&#x27;s favorite platform and yet it&#x27;s the one most people have.')
