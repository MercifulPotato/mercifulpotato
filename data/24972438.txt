Problem is, plants establish at different rates and conditions. They close canopy at different rates. They change soil biology in favor or against other species at different rates.<p>In his ideal world, the &#x27;planting&#x27; would be spread out over 4 years, where the slow plants get a head start. However, I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s entirely right either. Because after 4 years, you&#x27;ll have an area full of opportunistic plants if you don&#x27;t do something to close the canopy fairly quickly.<p>And if <i>that&#x27;s</i> true, then there is no way to replant a forest except to spend 40 years doing it, forcing successions to get to your target species in 80 years instead of 200.')
