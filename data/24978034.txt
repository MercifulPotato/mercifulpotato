Unless you define mainstream as the Old Granny who doesn&#x27;t even know how a mouse works.<p>&gt; Code syntax highlighting as well and a lot of other things in the roadmap that I will be happy to share (mentioned in github but will uploaded in the main website as well).<p>syntax highlighting doesn&#x27;t make it for software-guys. That&#x27;s something you get for free with most editors these days anyway.<p>&gt; Also and most important: created and used for everyday actions by a senior software engineer (myself) with 12+ years of experience in the industry.<p>So there is nothing...<p>&gt; What would you expect to see? You can openly suggest things which can be added to the roadmap.<p>A tool dedicated for a specific trade, should offer the tools used by this trade. Syntax highlighting is not what makes a software developer. Development is about planning software, analyzing and discovering software, writting software and building software. So any funcitonallity for this, besides the basic features anyone has, would justify calling it &quot;for software engineers&quot;.<p>Things like creating diagrams, navigating code, creating &amp; tangling code, executing code, customizing the environment... At least to be able to write plugins or call external scripts for doing something with a document is the the least I except with a dedicated tool for this trade.')
