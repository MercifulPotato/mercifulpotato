This gave me a desk in an open floor plan with nominally disruptive neighbors while still fielding messages on chat and meetings I would have to walk to that could be in other buildings (or, albeit rarely, campuses). Free food and drink, a gym I was too weary to use, a pool that was often too cold to use, and the view of construction that was going up faster than my code thanks to constant changes from different levels of management.<p>Now, at a remote company, I&#x27;m paying $1,700 for a 2x2 to myself, a dedicated room for work, dedicated setup, no commute, the only distraction is occasionally my upstairs neighbor, a heated pool, a gym I&#x27;m able to use after one of my very few meetings, and non-free food but a full kitchen to work with during work hours.<p>I do miss my coworkers and some of the fun face-to-face interactions, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but not enough to give up the relative paradise I&#x27;ve gotten in exchange. While it can get lonely at times I do also get to spend many (many, many) hours online with friends playing games; if not for covid I&#x27;d be going out or having friends over often as well.<p>All this to say that despite all this, I still respect that others don&#x27;t share a similar set of options and&#x2F;or circumstances. Those who have geographic ties, others living with them, space constraints, amenities that are hard to replicate, or just straight miss their peers, and many other variables I haven&#x27;t considered. My personal paradise may be their hell and I respect that, and hopefully they can return to their normal while I can also keep what I have.')
