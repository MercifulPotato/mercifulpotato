Better yet, offer restricted stock units (RSUs). Restricted Stock Units are a company’s promise to give you shares of the company’s stock. Unlike a stock option, which always has a strike (purchase) price higher than $0, an RSU is an option with a $0 purchase price. The lower the strike price, the less you have to pay to own a share of company stock. Like stock options, RSU’s vest.”<p>Aren’t RSUs taxed at the time of grant? Therefore in a refresh grant, the employee would get hit with a large tax bill on the fair market price of the equity, even with an 83(b) election. Most people\nprobably don’t have that kind of money to lay down up front on something that could still go bust. At least with options, you can always (unless you get fired) stay long enough to see the come through to IPO where options are then a sure thing. Am I missing something here on the quote above?')
