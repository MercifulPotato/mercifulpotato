Alexa has always (?) supported concurrent timers but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that it started asking me if I want to name my timers. But it tries to be &quot;smart&quot; and only ask me when it thinks I need to name them.<p>I only figured out through trial and error that I can name my Alexa timers without waiting for it to prompt me:<p><pre><code>  &gt; Alexa, set a pasta timer for 10 minutes\n  &gt; - Pasta timer, 10 minutes, starting now.\n  &gt; Alexa, cancel pasta timer\n  &gt; - Pasta timer canceled</code></pre>')
