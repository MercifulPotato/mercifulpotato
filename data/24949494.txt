The old saying, &quot;First they came for ... then they came for meâ€”and there was no one left to speak for me&quot; rings in my mind.<p>It&#x27;s important we highlight these struggles and do our part in supporting them... you might find yourself in a similar situation one day. With that I&#x27;d encourage folks to read more about BLM, Uighur concentration camps, Palestine, etc. Even if you feel powerless in stopping oppression the very least you could do is be aware and spread the word.')
