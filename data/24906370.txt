It&#x27;s just that the users interest are not identical with some users political interest.<p>A users best interest is that the tool works without pain and solves the task at hand fast. Anything else comes afterwards. And VS Code is seems to be very dedicated to make exactly this possible. They don&#x27;t compromise with pointless stuff, and focus on satisfying the most customers. And this works very well so far. Better than any open source-project I&#x27;ve seen to be honest.')
