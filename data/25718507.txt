While I was reading them the first time, the new comments and replies coming in sufficiently shuffled the order around to make much of which I just finished now be second page.<p>I think that to make pagination work well, time must be taken into account.<p>Simplest would be when a thread is rapidly growing to change the ordering to be strictly oldest comment first.')
