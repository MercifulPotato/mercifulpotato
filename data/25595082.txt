If you are doing something like sending every SQS message to a Lambda with infinite concurrency then, sure, but many queues are feeding into a compute or persistence layer of some kind.<p>Back-pressure here would mean that emitters of messages into your queue behave differently when there is an excessive number of messages waiting to be processed.<p>For example:<p>- If it&#x27;s a job queue, load-shed less important jobs until the queue is healthy.<p>- If you are ingesting a high volume of messages, be more aggressive with batching them together before inserting as a single queue message.')
