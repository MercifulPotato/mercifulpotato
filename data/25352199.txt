As in, they knowingly look at the slowly boiling pot of water and get in because it&#x27;s not hot enough to burn them yet.<p>But I think for the most part, Apple is exploiting a common blind spot in human psychology, the ability to predict the future. People look at the Apple devices they have <i>now</i> and make a decision to buy Airpods. They don&#x27;t see the future implications of being locked-in.<p>The typical Apple consumer probably starts with an iPhone or mac (because of phone plans, open standards, apps, etc). The real lock-in begins with the AirPods, iWatch, etc. Once they get you to buy one of these &#x27;lock in&#x27; devices, they&#x27;re much more likely to continue making more money off of you the next time you need a new laptop&#x2F;phone&#x2F;desktop. That&#x27;s all well and fine if you know this going in, but I&#x27;d wager most don&#x27;t.')
