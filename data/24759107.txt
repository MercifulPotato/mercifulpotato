Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602534628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757834, text='If I order a catalog house from a manufacturer that does prefab it would probably either mean completely prefabbed wall panels, i.e. wall panels with a handful of layers (timber framing, OSB, plasterboard, wind&#x2F;moisture barriers, lathing, external panel with a base paint), plus roof trusses. Or it could mean just the framing (wall panel timber frames and roof trusses). There would be passages for vents etc but you wouldn&#x27;t see entire prefab &quot;rooms&quot;, or even prefab walls with e.g. tiles or fittings like plumbing or electrical, like you see e.g. in large hotels or cruise ships.')
