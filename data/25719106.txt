You don&#x27;t have an affirmative right to either Apple <i>or</i> Starbucks. If your behavior gets you kicked out of either, that&#x27;s on you. Companies have the right of free association too, and while you can complain when you&#x27;re on the short end of that stick, your rights have not been violated.<p>Pretending that anyone has a right to either is not only entitled nonsense, it&#x27;s downright authoritarian. What is being advocated here is that the government should come in and force Apple to do business with fascists and terrorists against their will. Even if you imagine that this will encourage &quot;free speech&quot;, and I promise you it will not, this is a power that will come to haunt us all if you give it to the government.')
