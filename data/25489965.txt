Series 60 wasn&#x27;t competitive and the repeated ground-up rewritings of their Linux platform meant it was way behind schedule. The N9 shipped late, and even then only shipped as early as it did because development of the followup device had been sacrificed to put more people on the N9. Realistically, in 2010 it was already clear that Nokia would have nothing to ship in 2012.')
