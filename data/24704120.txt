The fragmentation is what would happen, and the consumers suffer from it rather than benefit from it. This has been proven over and over again by history. When AT&amp;T was broken up, there were like a hundred smaller players, incompatible with each other, and everyone has to pay extra cost to communicate with each other. It is a backward step for the society. The consumers benefit from nothing. Don&#x27;t just assume more smaller companies means better competition and better for the consumers. It is not necessarily true.')
