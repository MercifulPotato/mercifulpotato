ABC went through user testing to see how to develop a programming language that would make it easier for non-programmers to learn how to program.<p>Remember, I am presenting what I think are counter-examples to &quot;is strictly superior to Python in everyway&quot; (excluding &quot;existing projects&quot;). I still think that&#x27;s true even if Python weren&#x27;t popular at all.<p>As an example of the influence, the &quot;:&quot; at the end of lines which start a block in Python is not required, in the language sense. However, ABC testing showed it made the language more useful.<p>As an example of improving Python for learners, one of the reasons for Python&#x27;s change from 1&#x2F;2 == 0 -&gt; 1&#x2F;2 == 0.5 was feedback from the Alice developers, where they found that students did not understand van Rossum&#x27;s decision to follow C&#x27;s semantics.<p>Python started being used in schools <i>when it wasn&#x27;t popular</i>. One of the presenters at the Python conference in 1998 or so was a high school AP comp sci teacher. At that time C++ and Java were the AP languages. He reported better success teaching students Python <i>first</i> and then teaching C++ or Java, than spending all of the time in one of the latter languages.')
