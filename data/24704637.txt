I can&#x27;t connect how the XKCD comic has acted for or against the points the author is trying to make.<p>This comic is reactionary to an existing situation, it hasn&#x27;t created the situation.  Same as the comic that adamnemecek calls out.<p>quoting the last line of the article:\n&gt; It is my friend Daniel&#x27;s observation that tolerance is the experience of suffering through unpleasant ideas. We endure that suffering because the world is dramatically better on balance when we do.<p>There are limits to this.  Unpleasant ideas continually raised by very few people adds nothing.  If an idea or point needs to be continually brought up by a small group of individuals then it probably doesn&#x27;t have much value.  Hell, even QAnon has &#x27;caught on&#x27;, so the bar is low enough that I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s not much of a problem with the stuff that&#x27;s getting filtered out.  &#x27;Proud Boys&#x27; exist, QED.<p>If you don&#x27;t like that you&#x27;re censored on someone else&#x27;s platform, then build your own.  If you&#x27;re getting jeered while proselytising on your soapbox in public place X, keep moving until you find a more receptive audience.<p>Having said that, even non-public platform (FB, twitter, etc.) censorship is a situation that requires on-going re-evaluation.<p>Unless I&#x27;m missing the point of the article.')
