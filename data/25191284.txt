Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606162979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25187100, text='&gt; The trick to maximising timber production is to employ coppicing – cultivating trees such as ash or willow that resprout from their own stump, becoming ready for harvest again in five to 15 years. This way you can ensure a sustained supply of timber and not face an energy crisis once you’ve deforested your surroundings.<p>Coppice and pollard creates &#x27;water shoots&#x27; - long, straight, copious branches. For crafting material, the taper of the material creates problems, so coppice gives you better results.<p>Similarly, charcoal made from coppiced wood will have a fairly uniform diameter, and few side branches to create snags. Post-industrial, that should allow you to make more charcoal per batch, but I don&#x27;t know if that matters as much for brick retorts.<p>For steel making, I don&#x27;t know how important air gaps are versus calorie content of the furnace. Uniformity would certainly get you more calories into it but might also suffocate the fire.')
