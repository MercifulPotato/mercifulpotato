Our Big Software Vendor in the field depends on specifically the products of 10.2.1.  They&#x27;re extraordinarily clear on that.<p>So I assume that the geodatabases, the address locators, and such are all the sticking points in terms of the &quot;products&quot; of ArcMap.  I suspect that sometimes their software dips into that specific version of arcpy, as well.<p>Until the vendor hops, we cannot hop.  It&#x27;s a problem that will be eventually fixed, but I bring it up because many people here at HN think of greenfield development often, and also in industries where tons of iteration are met with approval.')
