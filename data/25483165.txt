At least back in the late 90s and early 00s, IceWM seemed to be the Window Manager that was designed to look like a sexier Windows 95. 15-20 years later, that seems like a weird thing to hang your hat on, but it looks like that is pretty close to where it is.<p>I also tried Blackbox, used Gnome&#x27;s desktop for a while, but it was too heavy and settled on XFCE. Were I to go back to Linux, I would probably end up on XFCE again (or maybe Elementary).')
