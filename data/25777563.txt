I doubt the average is anywhere near that.  People getting loans for more than just tuition can easily hit 100K, though.  IIRC the university I went to, which is a state institution, lists the average cost at about $28K a year including room, board, tuition, books, etc.  So if someone wants to pay for the whole thing on loans and not work any kind of part time job, they&#x27;re going to end up with a mountain of debt.')
