Just saying that, if it helps you type faster by keeping the device from jamming because you are typing too fast, then it is by definition helping you type faster by limiting the speed that you can type.  Hence, slowing you down so that you don&#x27;t go so fast that you crash.<p>As per the claim of the fastest typist.  I would be shocked it steno doesn&#x27;t win that, hands down.<p>Edit: Added in &quot;because you are typing too fast&quot;, which was part of the original claim.  I should have noted I don&#x27;t know if I believe it, but I did want to raise that something that makes you go as fast as you can by keeping you from going too fast, both slows you down and makes you type faster.
