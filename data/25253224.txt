Many states have fatal crash units that are part of the state police, for example NJ. I would guess that NY does too, but that NYC uses NYPD instead of the troopers.<p>Reducing the accidents is the goal. There are safety studies done prior to installing new infrastructure or when deemed necessary due to accidents. There are already things like bike lanes, crosswalks, plastic bumpers, etc to keep people safe. Education and testing is the best solution as it would provide a reduction of fatalities not just in the cities, but also on the highways. You can see that the fatality rate is about double compared to countries that have stricter tests.')
