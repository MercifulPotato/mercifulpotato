In practice, it&#x27;s easy to see that many people who run corporations use them as an excuse for taking entirely self-interested actions that harm the rest of society. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but I have to act in the best interest of the company, you understand.&quot; Of course there&#x27;s nothing magic about corporations, and it&#x27;s perfectly possible for individuals and private owners to be just as cruel. For purely cultural reasons, it&#x27;s easier for most people to act in self interest when it feels like they&#x27;re doing it for The Company rather than themselves.<p>Note that there are other ways to organize people to farm efficiently, like worker cooperatives.')
