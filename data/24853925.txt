Tone matching was a skill that everyone was able to improve in, with just two notable exceptions.<p>There was one girl who was truly tone-deaf, and as a result could not tell that she was only ever singing one monotone note.<p>And then there was the teacher&#x27;s son, who would run sound during our productions and claimed to have perfect pitch.
