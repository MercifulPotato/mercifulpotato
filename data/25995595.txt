It&#x27;s well paid, the people are great, but I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I stay relevant to them as the things I was doing I won&#x27;t be doing anymore (because the machinery is in the cloud.) And I&#x27;m feeling all the things those people must have felt when they changed careers. Don&#x27;t think I want to change careers, though.<p>I think part of it is recognizing where I&#x27;m at, and not poisoning things with the wrong attitude (be it fear, complacency, or annoyance.) If it were 10 years ago, I&#x27;d go get a different job. 10 years from now, I&#x27;d retire.')
