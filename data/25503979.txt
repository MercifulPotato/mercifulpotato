For instance, I&#x27;m a touch typist and used to be able to type nearly flawless, but now I have to proofread even the smallest communications because there typically will be a couple of obvious errors in it. Highly frustrating. Short term memory issues can be dealt with though note taking.<p>Now, who is to say that the two are related, this is obviously anecdotal and the one might have easily happened without the other, I had some pretty bad O2 dips though and before everything was fine. So for me the correlation is strong enough to believe there is a connection. But the physical aspect is so strong that for me that is 1:1 related for sure. The mental part is not such an easy to point out difference, it is far more subtle.<p>Fogginess is an excellent description by the way, that&#x27;s exactly it.')
