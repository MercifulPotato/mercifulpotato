Maybe some other companies do this.<p>However, if a candidate answers my first question easily I will try to extend or constrain the problem enough that it pushes them out of their comfort zone a bit. This gives them a chance to show off more skill than if I only asked an easy question.<p>Also, there are very rarely &quot;perfect interviews&quot;; it&#x27;s rare for people to get the highest score on even one of their interviews, let alone all of them.')
