Even though they live in an expensive city. Of course, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find such examples these days.<p>On the other hand, I have cousins in marriages where both are forced to work because they live in an expensive city where one person&#x27;s salary is often not enough to cover living expenses. And as trends go, I think we&#x27;ll be seeing more of the workers by &quot;force&quot; example in the coming years.<p>Increasingly the trend I&#x27;ve observed within my large extended family and my fianc√©e&#x27;s family (different cultures altogether) is that the wives in more affluent families tend to work as either housewives or in less taxing roles where they can still take care of the house, even if they can afford servants and carers, while the less affluent ones are required to have two breadwinners.')
