You can take an ordinary low frequency photon, and just observe it while moving arbitrarily close to the speed of light, and the frequency of the photon will appear arbitrarily large.<p>Pair production won&#x27;t happen until two photons collide, with a large &#x2F;relative&#x2F; momentum. So if they have the same frequency and are traveling in the same direction, no pair production.<p>But, you&#x27;re absolutely correct in the case of &#x2F;astrophysical&#x2F; photons. A high-energy astrophysical photon will have to pass through, among other things, the background of CMB radiation, and that gives plenty of opportunities to pair-produce, so there is in fact a cutoff to the spectrum of photons we expect from far-away events.')
