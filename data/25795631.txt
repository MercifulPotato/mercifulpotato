But if you think it won&#x27;t just give Amazon warehouses a stronger foothold, you are mistaken. I, personally, don&#x27;t think it is necessarily a bad thing if Amazon warehouses gain more workers due to their conditions becoming better as a result of unionization. But quite a lot of people will disagree with that statement.<p>You know why, despite all those current awful-sounding conditions, people are still signing up to work at Amazon warehouses in droves? And no, it isn&#x27;t because those workers are dumb and don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s better for them or because they are that desperate. It is because warehouse jobs are usually always somewhat hellish, and Amazon warehouse jobs tend to be a bit less hellish than other warehouse jobs, while paying quite a bit more. Bumping the pay up to $20&#x2F;hr will make it even more not worth it to work any other warehouse jobs, when Amazon ones give you a no-brainer choice that is even better all around than before.<p>Again, not commenting on whether it would be a good or bad thing, just an observation. I, personally, think it would be a good thing if those workers got paid more and got better conditions. But the externalities of that decision (giving Amazon more power) might be a bit too much for a lot of people to swallow. I will admit, I haven&#x27;t thought about those externalities much past what I have already described in this comment, so I definitely could be missing something. In which case, I would love to learn more about those, if someone has meaningful points to contribute to this discussion in the comments.')
