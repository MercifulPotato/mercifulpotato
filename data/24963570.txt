Two, it assumes that the violations are needed for national security, a claim which can easily be dissected by understanding what William Binney has told us about thinthread, just as an singular example in a vast sea of examples. Three, it&#x27;s a strawman to jump to arguing that because other countries are doing this, we need the NSA too.  Very few people are actually calling for the dismembership of the NSA, and in general want accountability and a return to constitutional surveillance. Four, implying the constitution is a &quot;moral position that loses&quot; is absolutely a machievellian, realpolitik, ends-justify-the-means policy position that we and the world have suffered enough consequences and blowback of.<p>Your entire argument revolves around using the safety as justification for violations of their mandate and oaths, when all the evidence points towards the truth being quite the opposite: the surveillance program has failed to be effective for safety, and not only that, that failure is largely due to this very kind of thinking in the first place! By being willing to undermine the constitution the NSA (et al intel agencies) inherently reduce long term security and safety in the US by allowing bad actors in all kinds of sectors the ability to abuse the data they get.<p>The totalitarian surveillance system is about control, not safety, always remember that!<p>&quot;Go again and see not just the film and the play but read the text of Robert Bolt&#x27;s wonderful play &quot;Man For All Seasons&quot;, some of you must have seen it - where Sir Thomas Moore decides that he would rather die than lie or betray his faith and at one moment Moore is arguing with a particularly vicious witch-hunting prosecutor (a servant of the king and a hungry and ambitious man), and Moore says to this man &quot;You&#x27;d break the law to punish the Devil, wouldn&#x27;t you?&quot; And the prosecutor, the witch hunter, says &quot;Break it?&quot; He said &quot;I&#x27;d cut down every law in England if I could do that, if I could capture him.&quot; And Moore says &quot;Yes you would wouldn&#x27;t you? And then when you corner the Devil and the Devil turned round to meet you, where would you run for protection? All the laws of England having been cut down and flattened, who would protect you then?&quot; - Christopher Hitchens')
