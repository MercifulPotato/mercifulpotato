(Stories about people publishing their own music on YouTube only to get it taken down due to a false positive were posted even on HN, I believe.)<p>Thus, creators seem to use either 1) no music at all, 2) their own music, or 3) generic-sounding music from some royalty-free content platform.<p>I am wondering whether Bandcamp will finally do the next logical thing and streamline the process of licensing music for video creators directly from musicians (those who opted in).<p>[0] For obvious reasons, few good musicians are willing to publish music on those royalty-free commoditized music farms.')
