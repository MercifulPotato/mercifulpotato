It&#x27;s massive, it has so many nations worth it&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>Seriously, let&#x27;s compare the top 1% of China with the bottom 1%.<p>China has 1.4 billion people, 1% of 1.4b is 14 million.<p>Actually, that&#x27;s not that important. Let&#x27;s talk about the top and bottom 10%.<p>The top 10%, being 140million, are the size of Germany (~80million) and France (~60million) combined.<p>The bottom 10% are the same size, obviously, but they share all the laws of the top 10% (at least on paper). Now the real question is &quot;what percent of China&#x27;s population are &#x27;developing country&#x27; level?&quot;, because if it&#x27;s 40%, that&#x27;s 560 million people.<p>So how the fuck do we deal with it? China is unique, although India may face the same problem later.')
