If they bought a modest house for 100K back then, it&#x27;s probably not big.<p>I bought my current house in my 20s. It is tiny because it was all I could afford back then. I always expected to move up, but it hasn&#x27;t happened. So I&#x27;ve made my life on this street, these parks and forests. I could afford to move up now but it&#x27;s a nice area and it has become home. I&#x27;m not ready to retire but when I do, there&#x27;s no point in downsizing, it&#x27;s already tiny.<p>Also don&#x27;t underestimate the pain of moving for an older person. I often wish my &gt;90yr mother would move closer to here but at that age she is terrified having to change any of her regular doctors and neighbors.<p>The grandma may be an &quot;useful narrative piece&quot; and it was, but it is also very real. These are the people who benefit the most from being able to stay in their home to the end. It is very cruel to force an older person to move from their comfort zone.<p>Of course, corporations taking advantage of prop13 is a travesty. It should be for individuals in their own home only.')
