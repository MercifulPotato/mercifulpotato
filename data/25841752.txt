I went the same Melbourne lockdown and am extremely grateful for how the government handled it. I have colleagues in the US and, while they&#x27;re not under strict and enforced lockdown, they&#x27;ve had to effectively self lockdown since the start of the pandemic. They also have 400,000 deaths and no real end in sight for when some normality might resume.<p>I&#x27;m happy with the measures taken, even if they were a bit draconian, because now I can, without needing to worry too much, do normal things like going to visit friends&#x2F;family and going out to restaurants&#x2F;cafes. It sucked to have a curfew and only be able to get out of the house for 1 hour per day, sure, but it would suck much more if we were in a perpetual limbo state with only the promise of a vaccine to hope for.')
