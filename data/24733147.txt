If you want a phone which allows you to run random binaries found on the internet, buy an Android phone.<p>I recently started submitted apps to the iOS store and I found it very much fair. I don&#x27;t have to worry about scailing servers to host my .ipas, users are ensured I&#x27;m not going to try and hack their phones.<p>I do think Apple should allow apps to clearly state they charge more due to Apple policies. But it&#x27;s like if you come into Apple&#x27;s house , you need to respect Apple&#x27;s rules.<p>I guarantee you within days of allowing 3rd party App stores users would be getting their IDs stolen and blaming Apple')
