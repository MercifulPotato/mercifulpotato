Item(by='gravitas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602769563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783908, text='&gt; Fundamentally, I don&#x27;t see a difference there. They are general computing devices, which are then restricted to talk only to a subset of computers, and only on a subset of protocols.<p>I would choose to disagree on this concept; from a business perspective, the hardware engineering design going into making the device has a targeted purpose from the outset, and is (cost) subsidized by that company specifically for their service (meaning, they could take a loss on the hardware and make up for it on the Service). Roku and RSA are extracting money for their service, not for their hardware - just like the Amazon Prime TV stick, or imagine if you will a Netflix stick made and sold by Netflix directly. The value to these companies is your service fee month over month, not the hardware they&#x27;re providing - the hardware is just a delivery vehicle.<p>That does not mean the devices cannot technically do something other than what their primary intended purpose is; the alternative &quot;TV in a box&quot; projects can run on things like an Amazon Stick with a bit of work (I did it myself to mine, was neat to play with) just that it&#x27;s not their primary purpose from the OEM. So can you use a RSA key without RSA? Maybe, but that&#x27;s not what our primary argument is about here. The GP to this thread stated:<p>&gt; Hardware requiring an online account to work must be outlawed.<p>This is what I&#x27;m discussing - the GP would have the government require a device which is <i>designed</i> to work with a very particular online service be able to work... without their service. &quot;Netflix, your Netflix TV stick which is designed to work with the Netflix service must also be able to work without Netflix service.&quot;  That is what the GP is proposing be made a law, which I very much don&#x27;t agree with - it literally ignores the entire point for the existence for certain types of hardware such as a Netflix TV stick.')
