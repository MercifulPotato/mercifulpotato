However - maybe I am wrong - but you seem to equate these values with &quot;conservatism&quot; and believe other people think these are ideals of &quot;entitlement&quot;. I don&#x27;t think non-conservatives, myself included think that way or don&#x27;t believe in these values. But feel free to correct me if I misunderstood you.')
