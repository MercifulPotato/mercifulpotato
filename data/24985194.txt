Item(by='zepearl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604446030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24981591, text='&gt; <i>I&#x27;m curious why cities don&#x27;t directly lay down the infrastructure work for broadband access.</i><p>Wondering the same thing here (Switzerland), but I might not understand the context: decoupling the &quot;cable&quot; from the &quot;provider&quot; is not common in the US, or there are some other complexities that I don&#x27;t understand?<p>In my case the company &quot;Swisscom&quot; opened half of the sidewalk, connected my apartment building to their FTTH infrastructure, then sent me a ton of flyers etc.. to advertise their Internet, but I still decided to use a tiny provider located 100km away (being small, high customer focus etc...) =&gt; works since 7 months perfectly, latency is good (e.g. 2-8ms to ping 8.8.8.8), etc... .<p>My parents had basically nothing (half-broken copper wire), then on a random day the city&#x27;s electricity&amp;water&amp;gas company team suddenly turned up, installed the FTTH cable (old house =&gt; turned out to be super-complicated to push that tiny cable through the house&#x27;s structure =&gt; took them 4hrs), then they left, that&#x27;s it =&gt; me and my parents then had multiple discussions about providers and they finally chose &quot;Sunrise&quot; (one of the major ones in Switzerland) and everything so far has been perfect.<p>As far as I understand how things work here, the company that provides the cable earns money paid by the providers that use that cable, which in turn earn money paid by their customers =&gt; everybody earns money, everybody is happy.<p>For very small communities (e.g. the one where my parents live - ~800 inhabitants), the town&#x2F;village might have to directly finance a part of the costs needed to lay down the cables (which in turn are covered by common taxes), but that in turn makes the small community more desirable by whoever takes it into consideration when moving.')
