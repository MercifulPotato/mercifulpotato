Some of his investigations were culturally relevant, such as Popoff&#x27;s prayer cards. But also some of his work was decidedly low stakes, such as Uri Geller&#x27;s spoon bending (though Geller escalated with potentially ruinous lawsuits).<p>Ultimately the skeptic movement left us with tame establishment defenders such as Michael Shermer, and a complete disregard for the positive roles Christianity plays in our Western heritage, culture, and communities.<p>That all said, James Randi was a very impressive and entertaining man. And I love that he was an ambassador for sobriety which is rare, and I think fitting of the scientific mindset.')
