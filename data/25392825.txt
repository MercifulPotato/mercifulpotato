It means what goes into your system isn&#x27;t necessarily what has shown to be safe; not a huge risk, but a risk nonetheless.<p>It would have made me feel better if you had started out your reply by saying.. &quot;yes there are risks to this vaccine, but..&quot;.  That way I would know we&#x27;re working from the same starting point and I could trust that your views are calm and considered, and that you accept the reality that there is indeed risk to taking a foreign substance into your bloodstream.<p>Many of us know people who have had Covid, and it wasn&#x27;t a very big deal.  Even fat old Donald Trump shrugged it off in a few days; granted he had the best medical care possible.  That&#x27;s not to diminish the loss of loved ones that have surely been taken by Covid.  But it can make one question the statistical importance of Covid in the larger scheme of things.<p>Again, i&#x27;m not really arguing with your points, just that they need to be presented with honesty, we shouldn&#x27;t put a religious halo around vaccines; we should be clear about the risks too.')
