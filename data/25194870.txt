It asks “why?” and then shows the causes, with numbers for each cause.<p>Of course, there’s a deeper and more contentious kind of “why?” and it doesn’t go as deeply into that, other than to show some things that seem to correlate.<p>But I think it is useful, because one can’t defensively say the US doesn’t have a problem compared to other rich countries. The Nordic countries save early, sickly babies and nurse them along just as much as the US does, for instance.<p>The only thing I wish they’d have changed would be to indicate relative weight of the causes. Because obesity is an order of magnitude more lethal than homicide, for instance.')
