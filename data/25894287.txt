The real reason for these rules is that (as with schools in many other countries for better or worse) Japanese schools don&#x27;t want their students, who mostly have black hair, to dye their hair brown or other colors.<p>However, since the vast majority of the students naturally have black hair it&#x27;s just MUCH easier to write the rules to say that in the rare cases where a student has another hair color they have to dye it black rather than trying to argue with students who have dyed &quot;chapatsu&quot; brown hair but then claim that that&#x27;s really their natural hair color when it isn&#x27;t.<p>Some schools like high schools in Osaka have a system where students with natural colors other than black are supposed to register so the school can record their natural hair color to know that they aren&#x27;t dying it.<p>It&#x27;s pretty dumb and it sucks for the students who naturally have brown hair but it&#x27;s easy for the school to be lazy and take the approach of just requiring all the students to have black hair.')
