If I use Google for example, I can store my information and map that to their places id. But if&#x2F;when I want to move to another service, I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d do that. I could map information to the coordinates instead, but different services have different coordinates for POIs so it probably wouldn&#x27;t work too well.')
