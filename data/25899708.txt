Not ideal when accessibility is one of the language&#x27;s primary selling points.<p>One of the major problems with fixing design choices or odd behaviours in software is that all of the old threads and posts don&#x27;t just disappear, and people are now going to be lead down paths that are not only so convoluted and ridiculous that they were eventually changed, but often paths that don&#x27;t even work any more.<p>It&#x27;s very very tough to fix that problem retroactively.')
