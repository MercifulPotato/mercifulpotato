The looters she reported were blocks away from any BLM protest, and other looting bands were setting fires on nearby blocks.<p>Frederick was a vocal advocate and financial supporter of BLM and had attended protests in the past. Didn&#x27;t stop the hordes from calling her racist and threatening to ruin the careers of agents who dared to work for her literary agency, and authors represented by her.<p>Her agency was gutted. All over calling 911 to report people crashing a van into a small business to raid it.<p>(Edited to add: I worked in publishing for years. I left because of the censorship in the arena. And I&#x27;m a proud lefty.<p>It&#x27;s gotten really crazy. Authors getting death threats. Books literally ripped off the shelves and destroyed. (No, not rabid white supremacist books. Books by PoC authors.) But industry professionals insist this is NOT censorship, just business decisions. And if you disagree? You&#x27;re a dirty, filthy -ist.)<p>Another edit to add links to the incidents I was referring to:<p>Black author&#x2F;illustrator team had their book ripped off shelves and pulped: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jan&#x2F;25&#x2F;censorship-childrens-book-smiling-slave-birthday-cake-washington" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;2016&#x2F;jan&#x2F;25&#x2F;censorship-chi...</a><p>Asian author was threatened and intimidated into cancelling the publication of her novel: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vulture.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;ya-twitter-forces-rising-star-author-to-self-cancel.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vulture.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;ya-twitter-forces-rising-sta...</a><p>Black author was intimidated into cancelling publication of book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;under-review&#x2F;in-ya-where-is-the-line-between-criticism-and-cancel-culture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;under-review&#x2F;in-ya-where-is-...</a><p>I can think of 10+ more books that belong on this list.
