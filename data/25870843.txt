It&#x27;s more accurately a form of fraud, or perhaps copyright infringement.  Copyright laws allow for short snippets to be quoted as &quot;fair use&quot; (or similar) and so far the quoting by Google has been regarded as legitimate.  Perhaps that needs to change.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=squiggleblaz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=squiggleblaz</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25870909" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25870909</a>')
