Therefore, with as little as $500 (aka less than a stimulus check), you get 50-100 shares. Even as recently as ~3 weeks ago, it was $20-25&#x2F;share. It cost more to buy in but still within reach for all but the smallest investors.<p>And that&#x27;s not considering the options side.<p>As of the 19th (aka 12 days ago), you could still buy $35 calls for $12 with a Feb 19th expiration. That $1200 is worth upwards of $12-15k now.<p>Now multiply any of those by a couple hundred thousand investors, some with much more to put in.. and we still haven&#x27;t touched the medium, let alone the BIG players.')
