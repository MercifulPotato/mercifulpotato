Don&#x27;t watch movies unless they are open source?<p>There isn&#x27;t much to Pico-8 in terms of runtime. The LUA you write is yours and I&#x27;m confident if you really wanted to use it somewhere else it wouldn&#x27;t take more then a few days to repo the features. There just isn&#x27;t that much there. A few draw commands, some input, and audio functions. What&#x27;s to lose?<p>The entire package, loaders, editors, exporters, etc is a lot of work but you&#x27;re no losing anything by writing games in it.')
