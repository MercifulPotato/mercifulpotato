A classic example is a PC-relative long jump:<p><pre><code>  auipc lr, zero, .LONG_TARGET20\n  jalr  lr, lr, .LONG_TARGET12\n</code></pre>\nOnly one register (the link register) is clobbered, so the pair can be fused into a single wide jump-and-link.<p>So in parent&#x27;s example, sov might fuse with the following bnez, but it likely wouldn&#x27;t fuse with the preceding addition.')
