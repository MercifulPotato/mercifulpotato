It reminds me of the story of Warren Buffet not wanting to buy a $20K car because he said with discount to present value the opportunity cost would make it cost him $100K.<p>On the other hand all things are not equal.  Take laptops.\nYou might think that a cheap one that costs a quarter of an expensive model would mean that you change it more often for the same cost.<p>By the end of the upgrade cycle you&#x27;d probably have a faster cheap laptop than the original expensive one and that might be true but you&#x27;d also have to live with the cheap keyboard and the cheap screen and the cheap build quality of the case.<p>So you have to make the trade off I guess.')
