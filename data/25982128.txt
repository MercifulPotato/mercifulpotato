I was hoping that it could go for a couple hundred meters in urban areas (was trying this out in the outer London zones, UK) but the results were pretty bad. Reception was spotty the moment direct LOS was lost and non existent ~10m after that. Not even worth mentioning the results if one of the nodes was inside a building.<p>If anyone had any success in dense areas I&#x27;d really appreciate any links to the hardware&#x2F;antennas&#x2F;firmware&#x2F;software you used to get good results.')
