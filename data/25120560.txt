That OS is the best version of Windows ever. Unfortunately the hardware manufacturers have stopped making drivers (especially for laptops).<p>The good news is such shenanigans are forcing more and more users to move to Linux which has improved so darn much in the recent years (especially Linux Mint) that the experience is far better than Windows.<p>Unfortunately a lot of games and programs like Photoshop still require Windows so I&#x27;m stuck with it (play on linux never worked for me), otherwise I would be happily get rid of Widnows forever.')
