Thomas Aquinas), they discovered new answers within the base framework of the faith.<p>sticking to your question, IMO it must be analogous to discovering sentient beings on the New World continents here on Earth in the 1500&#x27;s. People there are turned out to be &quot;human&quot; (finally), so they are eligible for the gospel. \nso I guess if we discover extraterrassial sentient beings, even though they are not human in the sense of &quot;homo sapiens&quot; human, but they qualify to the criteria of being (in biblical terms) &quot;the heirs of the heaven&quot; (having free will, consciousness, etc. - we may figure out what really are these exactly by that time), then it&#x27;s the same procedure as in Acts 1;8 &quot;be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth^?^?^?^?^? OUTER SPACE&quot;.')
