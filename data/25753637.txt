And there&#x27;s an argument to be made that, at some point down the chain (AWS, DNS, ISP) you should have a <i>right</i> to internet access. Should Amazon be forced to offer unconditional access to Parler? Probably not. But right now there&#x27;s nothing stopping ISPs from cutting people&#x27;s internet connection just because they don&#x27;t like what the customers are doing with it, and that&#x27;s a much thornier issue.<p>Regulating ISPs like utilities would delineate a clear line in the sand for problems like this.')
