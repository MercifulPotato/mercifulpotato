It doesn&#x27;t appear in the Schroedinger Equation at all.<p>It comes in when you treat the measurement apparatus as separate from the thing being measured. When you do that, collapse flows naturally from that assumption. It&#x27;s a valid approach, and very useful, but many people find it philosophically awkward.<p>An approach that&#x27;s philosophically easier, but less pragmatic, is to treat the masurement apparatus as part of the system. Now you&#x27;ve got one single enormous quantum system. The math of that is far too complex to actually run, and more importantly, too enormous to hold itself in an unstable equilibrium. It must fall into a more stable equilibrium.<p>The tricky part is when there&#x27;s more than one stable state. The measurement apparatus exists in both of those states, and returns opposite results. The states are in local equilibria, and don&#x27;t exchange significant amounts of state with each other.<p>You can call that &quot;splitting universes&quot;, if you want, though I think that&#x27;s needlessly messianic. Like the first one, it&#x27;s perfectly valid. And pragmatically it acts just like collapse. There&#x27;s a philosophical question about whether the other states &quot;actually exist but can&#x27;t be reached&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t exist at all since we can&#x27;t prove it except by inference from the fact that this one exists and follows the Schroedinger Equation so closely&quot;. That&#x27;s &quot;philosophical&quot; in the sense that there is no physical difference between the two, but just one of your mental model.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of words; sorry about that. But the point is that you don&#x27;t need a collapse axiom, and if you choose to add one, it&#x27;s not strange.')
