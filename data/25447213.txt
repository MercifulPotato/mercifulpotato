SNES emulators include code that emulate the addon chips originally contained in the cartridges[1].<p>So, I think your test is a false one. Games run in the emulator because the emulator added emulation for the chips in the game. This game cartridge would also run on a SNES emulator if you emulated its chips.<p>[1] Code to emulate the behavior of the DSP chip in Super Mario Kart (among many others): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bsnes-emu&#x2F;bsnes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;bsnes&#x2F;sfc&#x2F;dsp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bsnes-emu&#x2F;bsnes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;bsnes&#x2F;sfc&#x2F;dsp</a>')
