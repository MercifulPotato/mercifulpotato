The title of his video is “How to make Grana Padano Style Cheese”, so it may be an overreach to claim that he&#x27;s using the trademark to describe his cheese rather than to compare it with another product. A lawyer would be able to tell him whether there&#x27;s a legitimate claim of infringement here.')
