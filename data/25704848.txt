Item(by='zo1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610227000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25704294, text='One can&#x27;t point to a definitive set of facts that proves the right was &quot;shut out&quot; completely. Because they weren&#x27;t all shut out and they weren&#x27;t (for now) supposedly singled-out and &quot;shut out&quot; because they \nrepublican&#x2F;right-leaning. They had &quot;plausible&quot; and &quot;official&quot; reasons for doing the things they did in each case.<p>What did occur was a lot of little things and disparate things that had a huge dampening effect on the mobilization of discussion and questioning of details. And this has been happening for way before the election results were even out, it&#x27;s been going on for years with a steady escalation.<p>There was also the constant repetitive narrative pushing, specific language and tone by reporters, activists and politicians that essentially gave &quot;official&quot; and &quot;quotable&quot; legitimacy to potentially-questionable election results, and gave plausible excuses&#x2F;cover to de-legitimize and conspiracy-blame any criticisms of the election results. This stuff is downright scary, and a good chunk of the people not seeing it are the ones that are (for now) in the &quot;good books&quot; of whoever is <i>overall</i> in charge of driving the narrative and controlling public discourse. Right now, the left&#x2F;Democratic party is in said good books.<p>Look how the discussion is so widely and suddenly revolving around conflating this protest with insurrection even though it was essentially a fart in the grand scheme of things, and implying that there is a huge overlap between right&#x2F;republican&#x2F;conservative individuals and &quot;racists&#x2F;white-supremacists&quot;. It&#x27;s laying the ground-work to make it legitimate and acceptable to assume&#x2F;claim that republicans are racists among other things. Next up we&#x27;ll have dehumanization, firings and overall de-platforming because said protestors were &quot;terrorists&quot; due to their participation. The event will be labelled as a &quot;coup attempt&quot; and the storming of the building was a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;. And if you question any of these accepted facts (because hey all news reports labelled it as such) you too will be de-platformed, ostracized and called a terrorist-sympathizer or a &quot;something-denier&quot; (hint look at the anti covid-lockdown protests for an example).')
