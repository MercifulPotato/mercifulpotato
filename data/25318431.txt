Write down your thoughts and observations for the day -- observing your thoughts and emotions as you do. From there, you can understand what you think, how you feel, and make changes as you see fit.<p>Books and philosophers can offer you nothing but a distraction off the path.<p>It&#x27;s Zen Koan in a way; the underlying pattern between all of them is that it&#x27;s all subjective, there is no truth. Stop looking so hard, and just live.')
