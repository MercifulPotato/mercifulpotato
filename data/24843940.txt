Item(by='phil21', descendants=None, kids=[24844081], score=None, time=1603242473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843565, text='It&#x27;s certainly both.<p>But absolutely no retail store can operate in a political climate where they are unable to enact reasonable loss prevention policies.  Walgreens and stores like it are especially hard hit because they are generally well stocked&#x2F;capitalized, and ubiquitous even in rougher areas of town.  They also are corporate owned (not franchised) and thus have exceedingly &quot;hands off&quot; loss prevention policies.  Word gets around.<p>If I were CEO of Walgreens I&#x27;d likely be making the same decision.  A single instance of an overzealous security guard getting into a fight or killing a shoplifter will erase any profits you&#x27;d make in years of keeping 100&#x27;s of marginally profitable stores open.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in such retail environments and it&#x27;s pretty discouraging to the workers trying to do the right thing and live the correct way.  When I was in such roles it was quite some time ago, and the current climate was only starting to shift - it was still completely acceptable back then to tackle a shoplifter in the parking lot and forcefully detain them until the cops came.<p>The morale hit employees took when they simply have to sit back and watch is hard to measure, and I&#x27;m certain damages these communities in ways we have not even begun to understand.  Simply saying it&#x27;s &quot;not worth your personal liability to protect corporate profits&quot; rings really hollow on a societal level as society stops working when all that binds us are rarely enforced laws.')
