It was more about people being encouraged to reskill into the wrong fields when it comes to programming (which I didn&#x27;t agree with, by the way).<p>A &quot;pull based&quot; system where companies recruit people to train based on their needs does have benefits over letting people guess and run up debt on their own (the current system, which crashes and burns when people make bad predictions). The govt does this, e.g. where the military will pay for your education in return for service. But do we really want people deeply indebted to private employers? Otherwise they&#x27;d only be willing to risk training people a limited amount, since trained employees will subsequently only stay a limited duration on average. The is how it more or less already is.')
