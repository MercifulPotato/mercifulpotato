Item(by='codygman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602357463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740717, text='&gt; There are keyboards for people who want a truly ergonomic input system and there are keyboards for fanboys<p>&gt; Kinesis advantage 2 is for the first kind and ergodox is for the fanboys<p>Maybe it&#x27;s true, but I bought the Moonlander (same brand as ergodox) for ergonomic reasons. It allowed my hands to be more in line with my shoulders and reduced shoulder pain&#x2F;tightness I would have at the end of the day.<p>I want to try the Kinesis advantage, but one thing stopping me is the fact that it&#x27;s not a split keyboard. I think it&#x27;s likely my natural arm position is wider than the Kinesis.<p>&gt; The most efficient tools are usually the most ugly and boring ones<p>I think there&#x27;s some truth to this, but speaking it as such an absolute truth seems misguided.')
