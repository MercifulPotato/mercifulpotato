If you&#x27;re just a regular person who&#x27;s not profiting from ads or something, it shouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>If I post something to the internet, I maybe send it to a few people who might want to see it and that&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t care about collecting pageviews, or likes, or follows, or upvotes, or any of these vanity metrics. It doesn&#x27;t really matter to me if something I wrote was viewed by 10 people, 1000 people, or 100,000 people. Who cares? What difference does it make? My life is not richer because thousands of random people read some blog post or forum comment.<p>The only reason I can see to promote some creative work is if you&#x27;re making a profit off of it. In that case, it&#x27;s an investment. Spend $X on discovery and make $Y in revenue from ads or conversions or whatever. But just to put up some web site about your stamp collection? Who cares how many people visit?')
