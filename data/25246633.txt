The Philosophy Department at USU was pretty small, just a 5 or 6 professors.  Back in the early 90&#x27;s we met in a converted barn.  Professor Huenemann would lead small group discussions on Wittgenstein, Hume, Heidegger, as well as a variety of topics.  Another professor in the department was a devoted scholar of Wittgenstein and this prompted some good-natured rivalry amongst the philosophers.<p>Reading this article from a beloved teacher has reminded me of the value I received from a structured education in formal Philosophy.   I quickly gave up my dreams of being a full-time philosopher and instead turned to a very rewarding career in technology.   My training in Philosophy has been critical to my successes as a developer and technologist.')
