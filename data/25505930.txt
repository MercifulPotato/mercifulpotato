The idea is that Engineers are bound by a series of standards and assume responsibility of their efforts...especially around designs where human health&#x2F;safety are concerned.  And I get that.  But, to say that engineering, as a rigorous discipline can only be practiced by engineers, seems wrong to me. Good practices are (or should be) universal and executable by <i>anyone</i>, and not the blessed few.')
