I used to love coding, owned a c64 and wrote games and other small utilities when I was only a toddler armed with the &quot;programming guide&quot; that came with the ol&#x27; breadbox.<p>After 10 years of &quot;srs coding&quot; I felt like I was burning out and I was burned out. Because the feeling of discovery, solving people&#x27;s problems and teaching the good stuff kinda disappeared in the churn. What I felt was I was adding data to a database and retrieving it when needed. The software did the required transformations that&#x27;s all. Back then I was writing Java mainly and its verbosity kinda added to it.<p>I am not an engineer, my diplomas are on philosophy (bach.), sociology (m.a.) and international relations (bach.). And I used to feel fun and joy while doing that. Now it&#x27;s all about buzzwords and creating stuff that&#x27;s not neither usable nor fun.<p>Anyway sorry for the rambling but as a person who is in his late 30ies I didn&#x27;t imagine this present, where I feel queasy from coding and think I should &quot;relearn&quot; the trade.<p>Thank you for reading!')
