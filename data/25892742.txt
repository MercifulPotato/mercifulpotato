If the community constructs a sane process for handling vulnerability reports (and WP has), then the average user of that software benefits from a robust continuous testing regime that they could never afford themselves. Testing and patching is an extremely important component of web application security in the long run, and also very expensive to do well. Most custom CMS projects do not bother to do it at all, and yet fool themselves into thinking they are secure because they wrote their own code.<p>No one can write secure software on the first try. The most well-funded and well-regarded software companies in the world spend tremendous effort on coding practices and testing, and still ship vulnerabilities.<p>Continuous testing and patching is always required. If your website is the only one running your CMS software, your first hint of a vulnerability may be when it gets exploited in production.')
