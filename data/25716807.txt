As an example, I searched for &quot;Golf&quot;.  The first two videos are Twitch clips of people playing video game mini-golf and &quot;golf bowling&quot;.  Then there&#x27;s a video about the Trump administration and coronavirus, and then a bunch of videos on topics that have low edit distance, like &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;gold&quot;.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s just a bad topic and no one is uploading golf content to PeerTube.')
