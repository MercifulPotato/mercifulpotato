Anyone not will always have a proverbial hill to climb. I would agree that continued success has diminishing returns from a degree. This is often the argument for designing interviews that reflect real world work.<p>That said, my point was really that if you can afford a house with a fig tree in Silicon Valley then in some way your stars aligned and to see people unhappy over frivolous things was an enlightening experience that taught me something. My stars didn&#x27;t align, until they did, and I had to learn to appreciate that. It doesn&#x27;t mean those people didn&#x27;t need to overcome adversity or have a story worth listening to or admiring.<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t as uncommon a path as you might believe. I was enlisted in the USAF from 2005-2010, spent months and months Iraq and Afghanistan etc.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in knowing the statistics on veterans in Silicon Valley and tech in general. I&#x27;ve met some, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it common. I might agree that it&#x27;s somewhere between common and uncommon, but who knows? If these statistics are collected they are not published or widely disseminated. When I usually meet veterans they&#x27;re not enlisted, they&#x27;re officers. The most public activity I&#x27;ve seen is a group at Google that has 2,000 members, I do not know how many of those work in engineering roles.<p>That said, I&#x27;m happy to fanboy one of my favorite authors and Silicon Valley veterans: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nathaniel_Fick" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nathaniel_Fick</a>')
