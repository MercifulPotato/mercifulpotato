I ultimately try to estimate how bad I am at assessing the veracity of arguments concerning the topic at hand, which I think is most valuable.<p>For example, I read many conflicting predictions concerning the last US election, saw that I could not distinguish bad predictions from good ones, and concluded that I have to remain unconvinced. I was vindicated by it being a very tight race. This doesn&#x27;t always happen.<p>On the other hand, I read the recent Texas filing [0] and found that I could confidently argue against it, and the best opposing arguments I could find did not convince me. To my SO, I confidently voiced the prediction that this lawsuit will fail, and articulated why the probability argument in the attached Cicchetti Declaration is misguided. This is arguably a very easy task, so this correct prediction does me little credit, but I think that&#x27;s the point: even if I only become convinced of things which are obvious, it is important to not accidentally become convinced of things which are not obvious.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;DocketPDF&#x2F;22&#x2F;22O155&#x2F;163048&#x2F;20201208132827887_TX-v-State-ExpedMot%202020-12-07%20FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supremecourt.gov&#x2F;DocketPDF&#x2F;22&#x2F;22O155&#x2F;163048&#x2F;2020...</a>')
