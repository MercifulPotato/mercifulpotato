While traveling there, he is stopped on the road by a ragged-looking person who needs help.  Monk says get out of my way, I&#x27;m important, and in a hurry to meet the head of the fancy monastery!  When the monk gets to the monastery, well, you can guess that the head of the monastery was that ragged person, and that there&#x27;s some remedial lesson in monk-ing.')
