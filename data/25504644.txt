When I was in my early 20s, I fainted when I was given a tetanus booster in hospital after getting a relatively nasty cut which needed stitches. I&#x27;m not in the slightest bit scared of needles&#x2F;etc, hadn&#x27;t lost much blood or skipped meals and was a fit and healthy young man. The nurse at the time told me it was very common and why they stayed for 5 minutes or so after giving me the injection. I&#x27;ve had a fair few other injections since then and not had it happen again.')
