It addresses discounts and grants, but there&#x27;s more to it than that.<p>&gt; On its own, that looks really bad<p>Yes, it does, and that&#x27;s <i>still</i> no accounting for differences in size. Even state schools vary widely. Eastern Michigan University is not University of Michigan by a long shot.<p>&gt; once you account for the change in ROI<p>That matters little to someone trying to figure out how they&#x27;re going to afford a house while they&#x27;re <i>still paying off student loans</i>. It mostly kicks in much later, and money later is not the same as money earlier. If you really want to consider that increased ROI, you also have to consider how it&#x27;s offset by lost opportunities for saving and compounding interest because people are <i>buried</i> when they first get out of school.<p>Also, if college is no less affordable, why <i>are</i> they so buried? Graduating with more student-loan debt than income was practically unthinkable when I went to school. It&#x27;s commonplace now. Why? This whole empathy-lacking &quot;it&#x27;s no harder than it used to be&quot; argument just doesn&#x27;t pass the smell test.')
