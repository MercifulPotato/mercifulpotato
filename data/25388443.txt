This project seems to fall into the trap that Wald’s colleagues fell into. The more popular a project the more critical it becomes when that’s not actually the case. You want to know where the bullet holes you don’t see are because that’s the thing that’s going to take you out. All the bullet holes you’re seeing and surviving are not great but survivable.<p>Critical to me means “what’s the thing I <i>have</i> to pay attention to or I’ll suffer consequences”. Having a dependency on a non-popular crate is definitely an increasing score of criticality for that dependency. I may have misread but the fatal error in the metric to me is that popularity of a project increases its criticality when it should decrease. A popular project with lots of contributors means it has lots of stake holders already and a way to successfully manage that. What you want is the small independent projects that popular projects depend on. In other words, what’s the smallest, hardest to notice malicious change I can make in the supply chain of software development to enact the most disruptive change?')
