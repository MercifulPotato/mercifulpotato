The UI library was also re-written several times as we tried different approaches (native vs custom rendering).<p>The good news is that Volt was always being updated and made compilable, and a public beta is also coming this month.<p>I&#x27;m already using Volt as my primary Discord client (and my 8 GB RAM laptop thanks me for that, since I&#x27;ve freed 2 GB of RAM).<p>Here&#x27;s a sneak peek:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.discordapp.net&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;731265552395534357&#x2F;790876897952923678&#x2F;Screenshot_2020-12-22_at_10.42.14.png?width=1666&amp;height=1067" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.discordapp.net&#x2F;attachments&#x2F;731265552395534357&#x2F;...</a><p>Some layout issues, and Chinese&#x2F;Japanese&#x2F;emoji not being rendered correctly, but the latter has been fixed on a branch.<p>The moral of the story is: if you want to deliver a software application quickly, don&#x27;t write a new language&#x2F;stdlib&#x2F;ui lib for it from scratch.<p>At least I got to create a cool language and share it with the world :)')
