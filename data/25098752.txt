I don&#x27;t see it as self-pity, or pity at all. The world is a dark place and our children are the bright lights of the future. It&#x27;s the older generation that enjoyed the bright life and the millennial&#x2F;z-gen is dealing with the world for what it is.<p>This is the cold, severe reality of the day. I can&#x27;t hand-wave away facts of my community for the tail end of the industrial revolution applied in Africa.<p>I have my optimism that in the darkness life will be conserved and born anew. We don&#x27;t need another aphorism extolling the virtues of how bright some corner of the planet is and how that is a worthy trade-off for personal or collective suffering.<p>I&#x27;d prefer to live in the &#x27;90s when you could keep a secret and have a life that was not inside a panopticon. That was safety, not this metaphysical slavery to a set of advertising megacorps that pushes our behaviour around by statistical application of recommendations. I miss going on holiday and coming back with stories of the new world, rather than being able to bring up a 4k photo of every location within 250ms. I miss being able to fight people and gentlemen&#x27;s agreements on the back of a handshake and a word. We have lost a lot, I pity those that forget so easily.<p>Living in the 50s with a stable job that can support two adults and some kids with appliances that never die and vaguely drive-able cars seems a hell of a lot easier and safer than now. There are always brighter moments in the past, it&#x27;s pointless to even make the rebuttal about living in the past, as if we could.<p>Your work depends on pulling dark information on genomes into yet another database for a client. I doubt I&#x27;m going to sway you on the damage of recent progress. GATTACA is closer than I&#x27;d (we&#x27;d?) like and you probably won&#x27;t be around to see it. The worst part is that it&#x27;s likely to be secret, no blood tests at the gate required. Just sort a database row and you have your secret candidates for the next task.<p>A two thousand year semi-respite from the naturally severe realities of life is ending and nobody seems to having anything to say about the shining beauty of a mankind that valued truth, a good handshake and gentlemanly behaviour. Is violence such a bad price to pay for freedom? I guess you can buy people off with iphones and widgets while they get slowly locked up by a system seeking absolute control over their lives.<p>C&#x27;est la vie, long live man.')
