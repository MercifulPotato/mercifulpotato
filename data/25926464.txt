If it&#x27;s not - what exactly are you saying with your comment?<p>Right now it&#x27;s not entirely clear what all the facts are. Perhaps she really was just fired for having an account, or perhaps she posted some things that were less-than-savoury. I think the chance that a Conservative publication would do <i>any</i> diligence at getting at the facts of the matter is essentially zero.<p>A few years ago a Conservative publication had an article that they had &quot;proof&quot; that Conservative accounts were banned more frequently on Twitter, based on &quot;analysis&quot; of the data. It took me a bit of effort to find the data, and it included shining examples of Conservatism such as the American Nazi Party. Yes, literally, the American fucking Nazi Party. It included a list of a whole bunch of other similarly minded people; I wrote down a list here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quillette#Banning_Neo-Nazis_is_oppressing_conservatives.E2.84.A2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quillette#Banning_Neo-Nazis_is...</a><p>This is a very marked example, but there have been many examples where all nuance or details were left out because it was more convenient.<p>This is the kind of playing field we&#x27;re dealing with.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that you should trust other publications blindly – trusting <i>anything</i> blindly would be foolish – but trust is not binary, and generally speaking I would trust other sources more on this topic. A Conservative publication on topics like these without details are, unfortunately, not proof of anything right now and carry very little trust.<p>So, do I know it&#x27;s a false story? No. Do I know it&#x27;s a true story? Also no. Essentially a story like this is useless outside of being a lead for further investigation.')
