I’m in California, but my entire family is there, and many of my younger family members are going about their lives relatively normally.<p>At least one of my cousins caught it and their whole young family (parents 30’s, kids &lt;10) were fine. My 90+ year old grandparents are obviously being kept very isolated. Their kids (my parents’ generation - 60’s) are being careful, but not cancelling their entire 2020.<p>Everybody hated on Texas because of the Lt. Governor’s over the top declaration of sacrificing grandparents for the economy, but there are definitely aspects of their approach that I prefer to what’s happened in California.')
