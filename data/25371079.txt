Continue to change the subject and present circumstantial evidence or otherwise try to convince with your own personal court of law, <i>but not one person was convicted of colluding with Russians</i>.  Let&#x27;s say that again, <i>no one was convicted of colluding with Russians</i>.  I don&#x27;t take your personal circuitous deductions, anonymous internet stranger, over a very well financed and staffed team that was still unable to find evidence or convict.<p>Also, why do you continue to mislead about him pleading guilty to Russia collusion? He didn&#x27;t - he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.  I don&#x27;t believe you are discussing in good faith with tactics like these.')
