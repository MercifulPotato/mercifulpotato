Those who want a deal go for older ones. However when there isn&#x27;t enough construction those who are willing to pay for new go for used as well driving all costs up.<p>That said, housing can be profitably built cheaper, but why would any sane developer make a low price house when there is more profit in luxury housing. SF has refused to allow enough construction to meet demand, and this has resulted in only luxury being built.<p>Cities with less growth than SF are building more than SF, and as a result all housing is cheaper.')
