(The Skylark books have a surprisingly large amount of nudity, as well.)  The characters in Princess of Mars are basically naked, except for leather harnesses to carry weapons.  It&#x27;s plausible that ERB was drawing on pre-existing notions about Native Americans, though the commercial appeal of sexy nude aliens is perhaps clear.')
