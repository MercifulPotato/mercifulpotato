They contradict the prevailing political rhetoric from some Republican lawmakers that conservative voices are censored online — indicating that instead, right-leaning talking points continue to shape the worldviews of millions of U.S. voters.&quot;<p>2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediamatters.org&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;new-study-finds-facebook-not-censoring-conservatives-despite-their-repeated-attacks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediamatters.org&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;new-study-finds-facebo...</a><p>&quot;right-leaning pages consistently earned more average weekly interactions than either left-leaning or ideologically nonaligned pages&quot;<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to me to support that &quot;Facebook and twitter do not censor conservatives&quot;;<p>The assumption seems to be that if conservatives are ultimately more influential, they mustn&#x27;t have been censored. I&#x27;m also not sure how fine-grained the distinction of right&#x2F;left leaning is.<p>If all conservatives voices are censored except for a few far-right&#x2F;extremist voices that are amplified, does this balance out? Add a few more dimensions and you might come up with a different conclusion.<p>In any case, I&#x27;ll need to see more before I agree it&#x27;s &quot;well established&quot;.')
