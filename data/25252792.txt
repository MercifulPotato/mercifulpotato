Item(by='notagoodidea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606736358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25237557, text='&gt; I used to enjoy a game of chess back in the day, although I was never very good. And I always imagined myself playing chess with a remote opponent by post when I was a dusty old man [as featured in a few period dramas].<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a shame that the advent of the internet has simultaneously increased your chances of finding someone to play with remotely but, at the same time, [for me anyway] pretty much removed all inclination to do so, as I&#x27;d never be sure my opponent wasn&#x27;t just putting the moves into a computer and playing whatever it told him to play.<p>I play on ICCF servers that are the past postal federation. Centaur games (Human + Computer help) are allowed with large time clock (50 days for the first 10 moves, and so on). I play for my fun and taking my time to dig into the problems of the position without hurry. You have to be registered at your national federation to play there but it is fun and very different of the general online chess experience which tends to be centred around blitz games.')
