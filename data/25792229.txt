Some NICs offer various offloading options but according to PFSense&#x27;s website they caution users that support is mixed at best.  Then there&#x27;s VPN acceleration: there are no AES-NI-like CPU instructions to accelerate Wireguard&#x27;s crypto choices.<p>Not to mention network speeds even at the consumer end are slowly increasing.  So having enough beef to push 1 gigabit NICs is good but planning for the future and adding 2.5 gb or higher is better.  And finally having enough compute to layer fq_codel or better on top along with some monitoring all adds up.<p>Like a lot of projects the demand will act like a gas and fill whatever volume is given to it.  Given more compute I&#x27;ll find a way to use it. :-)')
