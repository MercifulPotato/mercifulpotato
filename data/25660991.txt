Item(by='elliekelly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609960013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660827, text='&gt; My biggest gripe here is that I find it incredibly distracting when videos of string players do not sync to the video to the sound they produced. You can easily notice it when a single violinist changes bow direction and the sound doesn&#x27;t change. In a study and art piece about synchronization, syncing video to audio is pretty crucial!<p>Could this have to do with the structure of the experiment? Since they’re playing “together” (physically) but are hearing each other play on a delay I would imagine only one player in the video could sync with the audio?')
