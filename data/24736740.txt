Say a grocery store is stocking at twice the rate they did 40 years ago because they have an app. Is the guy who wrote the app responsible for all the increased productivity? Not really, writing the app was fairly trivial compared to inventing the transistor, the operating system, and the programming language. Is the guy who invented the transistor responsible? Well it would not have mattered at all if there wasn&#x27;t a store to make use of his invention. Is the store owner responsible? Well he isn&#x27;t technical at all, he didn&#x27;t invent the transistor, write the app or stock the shelf. Besides he would have no one to sell to if there wasn&#x27;t a town to sell to. Is the town responsible? Well they provided road the stocker drove on to work, the university that the programmer and transistor developer went to, the police force that protects the store, and the customers that buy the cans.')
