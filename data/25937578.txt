Each event was $700-$900 a pop.<p>I take my dog for routine full checkup that includes MRI and Ultrasound whenever I travel to south america.  They use the same machine brand as in the US, with same diagnostics.  I pay $50-$85 over there for the same tests.<p>Vets over in SA (not business owners) make about $500-$1000 USD per month.<p>It would seem the huge cost is not from the machine.  Its the labor. I think these are the 2 key differences:<p>a) Based on my understanding, getting licensed in this SA country is a nonissue. There is in fact an oversupply of vets because its easy to practice.<p>b) The price for the vet studies is on the 2k-5k year for a private U. Compare with US Colleges.<p>Regarding quality: Our vet in SA diagnosed my dog after seeing the US diagnostic test reports , over whatsapp.  She was correct on her diagnosis from the start.\nIt took 4 different US vets, 3 separate facilities, 4 days of hospital bills ($5000) to arrive at the same conclusion that I got from a whatsapp.<p>It is not the machine problem. It is a captive market with huge costs related to labor.')
