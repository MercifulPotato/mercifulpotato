They claim that by hosting it on their servers they can prefetch it from search results (they could otherwise, but it would expose details about the user and their searches to sites the user never ended up visiting) and that this would make it faster. in practice this rarely leads to more then low 2 digit MS improvements over normal because the cache servers are so overloaded dealing with all the prefetch queries. Googles CDN is not what it used to be and i&#x27;ve even taken the step of moving my google fonts off of google and on to my cloudflare&#x27;ed domain for my 70mil&#x2F;ppm website because it made things faster.')
