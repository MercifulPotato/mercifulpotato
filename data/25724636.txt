I&#x27;m confused by the contrast you&#x27;re drawing here, because the reason I believe them is the same in both cases: many participants made angry, public declarations that violence was needed and they&#x27;d like to see it happen. Questions of how many nonviolent people were involved, how long the violence took to kick off, or who made the first escalation don&#x27;t strike me as very relevant.')
