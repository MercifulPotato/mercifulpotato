I&#x27;ve lived with a chronic kidney illness since I was 14. Thankfully my illness does not manifest outwards and I am able to hide symptoms quite well. Even when my kidneys failed, I was able to schedule my life around my dialysis appointments.<p>One of the biggest things that I notice shift as I grow older is that I no longer package my illness and my life separately. I think there&#x27;s a tendency to treat chronic illnesses as acute and only focus on them when severe symptoms arise. As others have mentioned, that almost always leads to burnout. I regularly packaged my illness when I was in undergrad (worked full-time, went to school full-time, and then spent the remaining hours either sleeping or on dialysis); do not do this.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can really completely remove the stress but eventually it stops becoming the highlight. It&#x27;s almost like tinnitus, it&#x27;s there all the time but there are large swathes of times when you successfully ignore it.<p>Your world gets a bit smaller. You just don&#x27;t have the mental energy&#x2F;ability to engage the same number of people&#x2F;events. My social life definitely shrunk when I was on dialysis. It opened a bit more once I got a transplant, but not terribly. You still have a lot of concerns because after transplant, you&#x27;re immunocompromised for the life of the kidney. Going to events becomes very stressful because of the risk to your health (Covid is a nightmare).<p>At the end of the day, you have to REALLY pick what you do with your time. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re a cellphone with a broken battery that only charges up to 30%; you can still do all the things you used to, you just run out of juice a lot quicker.')
