Item(by='ntsplnkv2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608237390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457624, text='&gt; HN has a large audience with a broad range of opinions. In my opinion, Snowden and Manning are traitors and the latter should have been left in prison.<p>Just like any large audience a hive mind exists. There are more posts in favor of Snowden&#x2F;Assange on here than in favor of this google employee. In general, more come to their defense, than hers, despite doing similar things.<p>Those aren&#x27;t why you&#x27;re dismissive. You&#x27;ve made up your mind on her, and make those items &quot;dismissive&quot; to support your POV, because you can&#x27;t actually prove one way or the other. Perhaps some of the reviewers are racist. We&#x27;ve seen in the past 4 years that racism is alive and well in this country.<p>I don&#x27;t see a problem with sending an internal email to colleagues. Should everyone just fall in line and do everything asked ever and never want change?<p>If she is publicly publishing a paper, reviewers should publicly publish their reviews, especially if they&#x27;re negative. At this point, if we don&#x27;t know the reviewers, we can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re genuine reviews, or not.')
