Item(by='kllrnohj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603929684, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24925434, text='PBO basically just selects a higher TDP, too.<p>The warranty violating part of all of these would be you&#x27;re technically driving the power delivery system beyond what the spec strictly requires. For PBO that&#x27;d be your exceeding the spec that AM4 requires from motherboards, which could put you of spec for a motherboard&#x27;s VRM solution. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a handshake there between the CPU &amp; BIOS to ensure PBO doesn&#x27;t exceed a given motherboard&#x27;s specs, though. If there is it&#x27;d be hard to claim this would be an actual warranty-violating usage.<p>Rage mode almost certainly respects the vbios limits, so you&#x27;ll likely see lower-margin cards have basically no improvement from Rage mode, depending on how much they skimped on the power delivery. You&#x27;ll likely not see an actual push to void warranties as a result, too.<p>Although in both cases (PBO &amp; Rage mode) it&#x27;s going to be almost impossible for a vendor to actually reject a warranty issue unless you <i>tell them</i> you did this. Afaik nobody is doing something like a blown fuse to keep a permanent record of these feature(s) being used or enabled.')
