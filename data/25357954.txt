They do mostly commercial, but I could see it applying to residential as well, and sounds like that situation has, even with the vent hood on, the airflow &quot;upside down&quot;.<p>When I was remodeling our kitchen we went with a over range microwave because there really wasn&#x27;t anywhere else to put it.  Those are known for fairly poor airflow.  We got a KitchenAid with some of the best available airflow, 440CFM IIRC, but stand alone hoods can do much better.  I still have a todo of replacing the roof vent with a larger one, so there&#x27;s probably still some restriction in there that&#x27;s slowing us down.  You might want to look for similar.')
