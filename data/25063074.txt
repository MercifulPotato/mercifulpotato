I neglected to mention that my home uses Cat5e for phone, but as far as I can tell, there is no central point that I can access.<p>I do own, so I don&#x27;t mind running wires. Though I am being honest, back in 2003, I ran my own Ethernet in my apartment from the main room to my office.<p>I looked at thin ethernet to run under the carpet, but I am basically going from the main entrance (where the TV&#x2F;Cable Modem reside) to the opposite end of the townhome, where my office is.<p>Prior to wires, I&#x27;m going to try the wifi6 mesh system from linksys. If I can get ~500-600mb&#x2F;s to my office, that is a worth tradeoff.')
