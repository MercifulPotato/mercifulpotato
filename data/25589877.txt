Cache all searches or last 200 or so... That way, google indexes the serps page, or use amazon product api to bring in reviews from amazon, etc... Then that content would be searchable wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>Also, maybe rely less on google, more on social media. Seems lots of businesses don&#x27;t use google at all any more for growth but social nets, launch pages, ads, groups, etc...<p>Create your own subreddit and a bot to crosspost all comparisons as images, linking back to the post.<p>Edit: Also, cut back on vue&#x2F;react stuff unless you can create a static page version which search can index better. The  write some blog posts featuring some of the top products if you do want some of the organic traffic from google.<p>I use laravel&#x2F;livewire for front-facing pages that need indexed, phoenix&#x2F;liveview or just rails + turbolinks would be good enough probably.')
