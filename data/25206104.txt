I wouldn&#x27;t call it telemetry.</i><p>It&#x27;s an unencrypted network transmission of a unique identifier, at the time of an app launch, that maps to a single app for 99% of cases (due to the fact that almost all developers publish only a single app).  That&#x27;s objectively telemetry no matter what you call it, irrespective of the intent of the designers.<p>Approximately 0% of all users of macOS will change this setting, so Apple adding a preference toggle (that defaults to &quot;send my local app launches to Apple via the network&quot;) is irrelevant from a privacy perspective.')
