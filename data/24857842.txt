Item(by='leftyted', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603374029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857788, text='All of Pevear and Volokhonsky&#x27;s translations are stilted in a modernist kind of way.  They read like experimental prose.  I <i>like</i> experimental prose and I find P&amp;V readable but I have a very hard time believing that Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov <i>all</i> wrote in the same stilted, modernist style.<p>As I said, the reputation that Russian literature has in the English speaking world is mostly due to Garnett&#x27;s translations.  If nothing else, her translations are beautiful.<p>From the linked article:<p>&gt; What differentiates \xadChekhov from other story writers is his fineness of perception, his ability to discern the subtlest emotional shades, and his appreciation of “the elusive beauty” of human experience. In the story “Strong \xadImpressions,” the hero learns “that the same word has thousands of shades of meaning according to the tone in which it is pronounced, and the form which is given to the sentence.” And that is why one should never read any translation by \xadRichard Pevear and \xadLarissa \xadVolokhonsky. They translate literary masterpieces word by word, with no appreciation of what the author is trying to accomplish or what makes a great work extraordinary. If \xadPevear and \xadVolokhonsky had done the King James Bible, Cain would have asked whether he was his fraternal sibling’s custodian. With Chekhov, their \xadapproach is especially unfortunate. He is all nuance, and they are all \xadbluntness.<p>&gt; Some fifty years ago, Ann \xadDunnigan did the best versions of Chekhov’s plays and of some of his stories. For the rest, the versions of Constance Garnett, all thirteen volumes of which were reprinted in 1986, remain, despite some lapses, impressive in their sensitivity to tone. I have cited their translations in this essay. Just as there is no point in reading a translation of a comic novel that loses the humor, so \xadChekhov can be appreciated in English only when a translator can catch the fine shades of his stories’ elusive beauty.')
