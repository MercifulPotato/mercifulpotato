Those need to be trapped in an active carbon filter. An alternative is to destroy them with ozone (also called &quot;activated air&quot;, &quot;ionized air&quot;), but to do so one needs ozone concentrations that are unhealthy for living beings. Ozone is very unhealthy! Ozone is generated electrically or via UVC lamps. An especially common and harmful VOC, formaldehyde, can be destroyed by the extremely overpriced dyson air filters via their cryptomic technology.')
