In a world where people &quot;vote with their wallets&quot; companies like Amazon, Google and Apple would prefer to avoid giving people a reason to do just that.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the shock and surprise. No US company is going to choose anything over their own bottom line. Certainly not for a site as small and niche and literally riddled with hate speech as Parler.<p>Parler and it&#x27;s customers can say whatever they want to whoever they want. Can they force Amazon to take their money? Absolutely not. Should they be able to? No: forcing Amazon to host Parler would be a violation of Amazon&#x27;s own right to free speech.[0]<p>From Parler&#x27;s point-of-view it would be unfortunate if they tied themselves to AWS specific infrastructure. There&#x27;s absolutely no way that they now have some kind of &quot;right&quot; to be hosted by Amazon. Also, it&#x27;s just poor planning on their part.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corporate_personhood" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corporate_personhood</a>')
