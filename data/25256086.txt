A clear &quot;take the time you need&quot; or &quot;focus on bits that look critical&quot; might answer that. (Certainly many places would be fine with someone new taking time to understand what&#x27;s going on, but if you are worried it might be good to get clarification on that)<p>b) similar, what kind of focus do they expect from code review? E.g. I know places that take stylistic things very seriously, and others don&#x27;t at all. Stylistic stuff is on one hand more to think about, but also an easy place to show &quot;yes, I&#x27;m reviewing this&quot;.<p>c) Asking people to change their workflow is always a bit tricky, but if you think it helps maybe you could ask for more smaller MRs - that makes changes easier to think through properly IMHO.<p>d) are the changes missing context for you to understand? &quot;I don&#x27;t get why this is correct, can you please expand the comments&#x2F;commit message&quot; is IMHO valid feedback.<p>e) hopefully as you learn more about the structure you can prioritize yourself better, e.g. by recognizing that changes fit established patterns and don&#x27;t need as much attention.')
