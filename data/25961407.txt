Yes that 400 figure is foundational to my argument and yes, we should lift the restrictions.<p>But if you are really sick, you&#x27;d be at home, in your bed taking it easy anyway especially if your symptoms are as severe as some of the COVID reports suggest.<p>And it&#x27;s not balanced reporting I want either, it&#x27;s accurate reporting with facts that can be challenged or verified: most articles are incredibly vague when it comes to COVID and some have incredibly low numbers that, at first glance, look damning but are still tiny numbers.<p>Edit: deleted the 100,000 sentece - In response to that number, yes it may be a large number but there is no breakdown of the cases. For all you know, they were all 90+ years old with previous underlying conditions. All the figures we see have very little behind them that can substantiate the measures taken, while at the same time trigger responses in all of us that make them hard to argue against without coming across as callous but the numbers are not there to justify the lockdowns.')
