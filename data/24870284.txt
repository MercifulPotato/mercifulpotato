It &quot;flies&quot; too low for air search radar to pick up due to algorithms and methods used to eliminate false targets from ground clutter.  It moves too fast for a surface search radar to register, again because of false target mitigation techniques.  It occupies the same blind spot that sea-skimming cruise missiles were designed to exploit, except with much longer range and the ability to spring a half-dozen supersonic Sunburn missiles at the last minute.  In a hectic theater it could have been a very effective coastal defense platform and a good complement to the Tu-16&#x2F;Tu-22 long range missile carriers.')
