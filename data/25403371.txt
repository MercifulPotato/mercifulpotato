It&#x27;s still true that the expected number of photons per second drops by a factor of 4, but it can drop so far as to render the source dark for an appreciable amount of time.<p>The paradox claims that the sky should appear bright, which I take to mean that a detector should be receiving light from each point in the sky at each moment in time. It does not say that the detector will receive light from each part of the sky at some point, but that you may need to wait a million years before a particular point flickers and that, even then, there&#x27;s nothing that guarantees that all points will flicker at the same time.')
