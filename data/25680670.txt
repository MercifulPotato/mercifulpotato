The problem becomes when schedule overrides good judgement regarding safety. My personal opinion is this is largely rooted in human cognitive biases that make us bad at objectively assessing risk. We just arenâ€™t wired to think statistically and then we have multitudes of biases that undermine our ability to make judgement, especially about low probability events.')
