FreeBSD was by far and away the winner on that thing. Had 20 megs of RAM and a 2.2 gig hard drive. Ran X and WordPerfect and Netscape in Linux compatibility better than natively in Slackware. Got me through high school with no problems (had to buy an external modem as the one it came with was a winmodem)\n No clue the current state of things though.')
