If you plug values for an iPhone into the &#x27;x =&#x27; equation, you&#x27;ll see that an iPhone camera is not really close to being limited by diffraction. The minimum separation distance at 500nm wavelength at f1.6 comes out to 976nm. Along an 8mm sensor dimension that&#x27;s 8188 line pairs. Now sure, that&#x27;s by the Rayleigh criterion, so you&#x27;re not resolving 8188 perfectly sharp line pairs. But that&#x27;s a still a good margin over the sensor resolution, and it&#x27;s an open question how good sharpening algorithms can get.')
