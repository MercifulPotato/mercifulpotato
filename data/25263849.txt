We love it. Teams usually want their own private channel so they can discuss things more openly with us, post screenshots that may have stuff they don&#x27;t want spread around publicly (we&#x27;re a product management tool&#x2F;issue track so teams has sensitive stuff stored with us). The only issue we have is some people have a lot of slack workspaces already and don&#x27;t want to add yet another (which is totally understandable coming from a guy with 10 or so Slack workspaces right now).<p>Does Everchat have ambitions to be this kind of private community where companies can interact with their users, etc or is the target something else?<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co</a>, the super fast, hotkey-driven product management tool&#x2F;issue tracker that has deep integrations to GitHub, Figma, Slack, etc.')
