Not every program is available on every store. I can&#x27;t get Halo on my PlayStation. I can&#x27;t get certain video editing tools on my PC. I can&#x27;t get certain productivity software on my Mac.<p>Disjointed app stores are annoying at worst, but I don&#x27;t really see why there&#x27;s any legal problem with that.')
