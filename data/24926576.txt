I was part of a consulting engineering competition at school which was sponsored by a large oil and gas company. Their representatives (judges) gave us a real map of a “fictional” area, which we had to analyze for a feasibility study of water sourcing.<p>There was a unique shaped lake on the map. With access to GIS maps we found the actual location. It was very improbable, a tiny lake in a gigantic land area. We found all the wells in the area and who owned them. We found a town nearby.<p>Instead of a fictional study we went ahead and used real data, real examples, and we called real people in the town for their perspectives on the matter.<p>The O&amp;G representatives judging our competition were nearly fired. They were terrified when they learned we talked to locals, and repeatedly asked if we mentioned O&amp;G-CO’s brand name on the calls.')
