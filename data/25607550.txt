Yes, there are instances of him being abrasive, but he led some very successful tech development efforts which involved getting people to come together around difficult goals.  Remember that for most of his second period of management Apple stock went for around 12-25 a share and it was hard to hire good engineers because it was common knowledge that Apple was doomed.<p>An example of how direct, involved management clashes with traditional corporate style came up right after Steve Jobs returned.  He would walk around the offices, knock on doors and introduce himself, and ask what people were working on.  Those who were fully engaged were kind of jealous that others had a chance to talk with the top manager directly in such a way.  Oddly enough, most of the long term Apple corporate types reacted very badly to this.  They stuttered and could not summarize what they were actually doing.  In every case I was aware of these employees left the next day in absolute shock and horror, sharing with everyone just how mean Steve Jobs was.  But I was there and observed some of these encounters myself and all he did was drop by, casually introduce himself, and ask about what people were working on.  For some and those who stayed at that time that was actually pretty cool hierarchy flattening behavior but for corporate climbers it was an inconceivable breach of protocol.')
