We need more thoughtful, and more creative humans.<p>Money line, but I strenuously disagree.<p>We need both, but thankfully, we have that. Games like Breath of the Wild, Death Stranding, and Kingdom Hearts III; and services like YouTube, TikTok, Twitch, Stadia and Steam wouldn&#x27;t exist without both. You would have games, you would have services, but you wouldn&#x27;t have <i>these</i> games and <i>these</i> services without both massive computational power and massive creativity.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more incentive to get more out of a piece of equipment that will likely never be serviceable by humans again but is still serving a valuable role than there is to get more out of a piece of equipment only ten years old, taking up space and easily replaceable by something that is a capabilities upgrade and quality of life improvement in every measurable way.<p>There&#x27;s sentimental value to be had in old hardware and a lot of great games that are 30 or 40 years old; and it&#x27;s entirely possible there&#x27;s a fair amount of hardware we never exploited to its full potential before replacing it with something much more capable, but that&#x27;s life, tech and economics.')
