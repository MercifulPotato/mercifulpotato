The transition period is definitely rough, but eventually the cultural norms adapt.<p>Divorce rates are down, but so are marriage and birth rates. The &quot;cultural norms&quot; are &quot;adapting,&quot; but don&#x27;t appear to be adapting in a direction that combines modernity with population stability in a steady state.<p>Much of &quot;the west&quot; is now dependent on people from more traditional cultures (in Europe, Muslims, in the United States, Latinos). That&#x27;s not an anti-immigration rant (I&#x27;m a Bangladeshi immigrant to the United States). My point is that anything we call a &quot;successful culture&quot; should probably be self-sustaining in the steady state. If divorce rates in the west are declining mainly because nobody is getting married (and nobody is having kids) then you don&#x27;t actually have a successful culture. It might be great for all the freedoms it provides, but on its own it will cease to exist eventually.<p>In a way it&#x27;s a sort of arbitrage. If everyone in the world acted like Germans, it would be nice for a while, but humanity would cease to exist. There is an illusion of sustainability that is being provided by people from traditional cultures--with their traditional views on marriage and child-rearing, etc.')
