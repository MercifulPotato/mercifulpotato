This is not a failure of the marketplace (aka price discovery), this is the U.S. deciding that cheap milk and overproduction is in the nation&#x27;s best interest and we should socialize some of the production costs.<p>There are logical (milk as a staple product and avoidance of shortages), and illogical (milk lobby takes too much effort to oppose) reasons for it, but it is not a marketplace failure.  Remove the subsidies and the market would quickly find the higher price at which dairy farmers could produce milk profitably and consumers would purchase it.')
