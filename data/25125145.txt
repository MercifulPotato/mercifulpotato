I get that its powerful but why does it seem so convoluted?<p>I&#x27;m not a git expert. Just a developer who likes to get things done with the least amount of effort. I use a combination of git cli, vscode git extension and SourceTree to do everything I need to do. I hate that I have to use SourceTree given its many flaws. Yet, the way that it lets me visualize branches-merges history and do interactive rebase is just unmatchable.<p>Also, never understood why Github Desktop exists or what people use it for.')
