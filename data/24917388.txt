Includes ambiguous reports on how encryption effects ssd wear&#x2F;trim&#x2F;etc.<p>I recently upgraded my laptop and stuck a new nmve ssd with hardware encryption features. It does have some security trade-offs but does protect decently against common theft and is hella convenient that it&#x27;s all mostly managed in hardware beyond a pre-boot unlocker and a suspend-state kernel hack. Still had to dig deeeep into github issues to get it going in Linux. Works out of the box with Bitlocker allegedly.')
