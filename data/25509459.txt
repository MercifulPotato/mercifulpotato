Genuinely curious, because I don&#x27;t really see what they would be, or why there would be any. At least not compared to something like e.g. creating an actual artificial intelligence, and then needing to decide if it has rights, and what kind and so on. Creating a novel type of microorganism out of non-living components doesn&#x27;t really seem to come with the same kind of can of worms, but maybe I&#x27;m overlooking something?')
