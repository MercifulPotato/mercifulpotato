Ripping people off with high prices is actually very rare nowadays, mostly thanks to the big online marketplaces.<p>These large price differentials are purely due to the insane economies of scale we&#x27;re able to create. It&#x27;s not a wonder that there&#x27;s a 128GB USB stick as expensive as $1675, it&#x27;s a wonder there&#x27;s a 128GB USB stick as cheap as $27.<p>Imagine it took 1 million dollars to develop the tech and implement the manufacturing process of a 128GB stick. Assume they cost $5 to manufacture, and $20 to market and ship. Then when you sell a million you&#x27;ve recuperated your R&amp;D and made a million profit that warrants the 6 million upfront investment you had to do.<p>Same story but now with the expensive 128GB sticks, of which you&#x27;re only going to sell 1000. Even though the stick is 1675, you only make 1.650.000, so your effective budget to develop the fancy encryption scheme and make a profit is 650.000.')
