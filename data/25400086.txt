Beyond that, claiming that &quot;there is widespread fraud&quot; is &quot;my&quot; position, when I&#x27;ve stated otherwise clearly, shows more bias on your part. What makes you think I think there was widespread fraud? Perhaps you&#x27;re projecting: if you defend people who are being suppressed and ridiculed, this doesn&#x27;t mean you agree with them. Perhaps you are only able to imagine defending people you agree with?<p>I realize how what I wrote could be construed saying D&#x27;s support the claim, especially if you presume I&#x27;m some kind of partisan hack trying to troll you. In fact, what I was emphasizing (poorly) was that the population sampled from which has one third of support includes Democrats and Independents, since I would have found one third of just Republicans believing there was widespread fraud to be somewhat surprising. I should have written &quot;sampled from a population that includes Democrats and Independents&quot; - I&#x27;d like to assume everything else I&#x27;ve written in this thread is evidence I&#x27;m not trying to trick anyone or score points. I am genuinely concerned at the level of dismissal, ridicule, and suppression of skeptics of the election, since the floor on this is a third of the country and history tells us what to expect when you leave that many feeling powerless to overcome a presumed deep injustice via speech, voting, and the legal system.')
