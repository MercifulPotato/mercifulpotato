They weren&#x27;t a total nobody, but they certainly weren&#x27;t interesting enough to any big fish that there was any push to put pressure on them to act like a more &quot;traditional&quot; company. And Jobs kept doing things his way for the next 15 years, until his medical retirement and untimely death, and those things increased Apple&#x27;s stock price fairly steadily. Until the iPhone came out, of course, at which point it increased dramatically.<p>But by then, people were already used to the idea that Apple would do things Apple&#x27;s way. (And some people were so used to the idea that Apple was Doomed that they <i>still</i> preach it every time there&#x27;s any new Apple news.) And it&#x27;s so utterly clear that Apple doing things Apple&#x27;s way <i>works</i>—for Apple.<p>Any other company trying to do things Apple&#x27;s way—or even its own unique way, rather than the way the markets want—would be fighting an incredibly strong current.')
