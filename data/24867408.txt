Old(er) versions don&#x27;t even support B frames.<p>But I guess you can call it &quot;firmware&quot; or &quot;software&quot; dependant too, because they don&#x27;t really use&#x2F;support the same version of NVENC to begin with.<p>And I doubt the result is significantly different, if any, for software encoders like x264 - of course assuming you use the exactly same version and parameter.')
