I think it&#x27;s unfair to count time when I&#x27;m asleep as time when I could possibly be using something (other than my bed!).<p>I think all of this debate points to one thing: the article is written from, and generalising from, a very myopic perspective, and shouldn&#x27;t in any way be given serious consideration by many people for whom it doesn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t apply.')
