This is part 6 of my Python behind the scenes series. Each part of the series covers how some aspect of the language is implemented in the interpreter, CPython. This time we&#x27;ll focus on the Python object system. You&#x27;ll learn:<p><pre><code>  - What Python objects and types are and how they are implemented.\n  - What slots are and how they determine the behavior of objects.\n  - How slots are related to special methods.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d be glad to get your feedback and answer your questions.<p>Thanks!')
