They have a moral value system, and they adhere to it. Just like (say) Roman Catholicism.<p>The FSF&#x27;s point of view is that by providing repositories (which make installing a program a single command-line or a few GUI-clicks away) that&#x27;s not functionally different from that being a part of the operating system. So providing repositories of nonfree software is functionally equivalent to including that software in the OS itself.<p>And to have software freedom, then all the software on a machine must respect the user&#x27;s freedom; i.e. be free software.')
