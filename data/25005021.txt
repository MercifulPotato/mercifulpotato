Some are more specialized than others. Many SSGs have standardized around the format of `YAML: Metadata\\n\\n---\\n\\nContent`, and expose a query interface over the YAML metadata. But, most static site generators don&#x27;t generally have create&#x2F;update API - just a read API.<p>A reason you don&#x27;t see much in the &quot;tree of simple files as my DB&quot; space is that the whole point of it is to be trivially simple to understand, and thus, to implement.<p>Now, with file DBs, it&#x27;s actually quite important to use atomic writes, so that a crash or concurrent operations don&#x27;t produce errors. For example, the package posted above can corrupt data   if there&#x27;s concurrent writers to the same data file, because all the writes are non-atomic fs.writeFileSync(). What this database should do instead is write to a tempfile, and then rename the tempfile to replace the destination. That way, you get simple last-write-wins semantics with no possibility of creating invalid JSONs.')
