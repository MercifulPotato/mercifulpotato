Well-deserved success!<p>I do wonder whether the title of the article accidentally (and ironically) reveals a subtle racial bias.  McDonald&#x27;s is a typical shorthand for a lowly job, staffed by the nation&#x27;s underclass.  But tons of successful people in tech flipped burgers in high school (I did!) and it&#x27;s never worth highlighting in press articles.  Their public story usually starts at college or their first job or their first big break.  But this article specifically highlights a traditionally menial position as his starting point.<p>Unconscious bias?')
