But the second article is false on its face a self claimed hard left antifa associate killed someone in portland less than a month ago. So the claim that there has been no death puts the whole article in the making stuff up as they go along camp.<p>As for the first article I would agree with the DHS&#x27;s assessment and it gets to the heart of why each side commits violence. The radical left tends to see violence as a means to get what they want (think a child throwing a temper tantrum). The radical right tends to see violence as a declaration of war (think the OK city bombing). When the left commits violence it tends to be against the populus that they believe disagrees with them and that violence tends to stem from a &quot;how dare you disagree with me mentality&quot;. When the right commits violence it is generally against the government and is generally a mentality more akin to a suicide bomber. I can certainly see where the government would find one form of violence more concerning that the other even if the touch points of one side are more frequent than the other. Make no mistake about it, right leaning violence intent is to be more deadly and more violent than left leaning as they are not intent on getting what they want, they are intent on revenge whatever the cost.')
