How are you going to write an operating system?&quot;</i><p><i>This points out the obvious density advantage of text. This barrier has become known as the &quot;Deutsch Limit,&quot; stated as:</i><p>&gt; <i>The problem with visual programming is that you can&#x27;t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.</i><p>...<p><i>This is clearly a problem with visual representations.  However, it is not immediately clear to me that a similar limit does not also exist in textual languages.</i><p><i>When textually programming I frequently use an Emacs window with about 50 lines of text on my 19&quot; monitor.  Anyone older than about 35 complains that they cannot read the text because the font is too small.  I use a lot of whitespace in my programs, so we might assume that the 50 lines in the editor contain 40 meaningful lines.  Most common programming styles dictate limiting the number of &quot;primitives&quot; or statements to one or two per line, giving my textual screen at most 80 primitives.</i><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faqs.org&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;visual-lang&#x2F;faq" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faqs.org&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;visual-lang&#x2F;faq</a>')
