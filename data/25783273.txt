Also took a non-traditional route (creative writing major -&gt; 10 years in industry -&gt; phd).<p>It&#x27;s interesting so far. Research feels very open ended compared to industry. While I was in industry (AI fintech startup), even though goals were rapidly changing, I had a good idea of what problems to work on and how to gauge progress.<p>In contrast, research is far more undefined. There are days I feel lost and other where I&#x27;m chasing rabbits down deep holes. It&#x27;s been hard for me to figure out if the problems I&#x27;m trying to solve are worth exploring (are they good research question? and more importantly are they publishable).<p>But that being said, it&#x27;s only about 6 months in and I feel like I&#x27;m still learning what it means to do research. I&#x27;ve definitely enjoyed having the space to explore problems at my own pace and think deeply about them.')
