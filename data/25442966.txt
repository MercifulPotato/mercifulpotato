There are influence teams hired by VIPs who use Wikipedia as simply an extension of cable news&#x2F;social media. To &quot;get out in front of stories&quot;, or if they&#x27;re late to the game, to scrub&#x2F;&quot;memoryhole&quot; undesired ones. Wikipedia editing as an amusing hobby for niche nerds is an outdated concept for many topics.<p>Wikipedia is far too powerful a Persuasion tool to let fail. Its essay-long donation plea&#x27;s are designed to garner credibility towards innocence. How nefarious could the site be? They&#x27;re scrounging around for scraps each year!')
