I don&#x27;t remember why but I assume that GM contained some significant improvements. I remember my enthusiasm for the maps API that let me put markers on a map embedded in my website (2005.) Maybe also satellite view. Street View later. So Google did do something substantial with their implementation of mapping.<p>Satellite and Street view are the main reasons I keep using GM now, plus checking addresses, some car directions and navigation and sharing links to locations with friends. I&#x27;m using OpenStreetMap based software for discovering and recording cycling tracks.')
