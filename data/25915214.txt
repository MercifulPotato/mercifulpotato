Seems like Israel negotiated better than the EU despite the EU constantly self proclaiming to be the best negotiator with the best bargaining power in the world. So far Israel has negotiated and the EU resorts to threatening vaccine nationalism. From the downvotes I can only imply that truth does hurt sometimes.')
