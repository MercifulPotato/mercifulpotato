They hide from you the query complexity — and perhaps also the number of queries — that your ORM query produces. There are situations where a different ORM approach would yield similarly shaped data yet consumes orders of magnitude more or fewer resources. And this is without adding any new indices.<p>In general I don’t like giving anyone the ability to write queries unless I trust they understand the performance ramifications. This can be difficult to enforce because someone “on the outside” can always abuse your thoughtfully constructed set of access points you’ve provided by sticking them in nested loops.<p>Perhaps an answer is strict allocation of quotas outside the realm of assumed competence and good will.')
