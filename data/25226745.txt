It could be that white-M + tan-F is species #1, and white-F + tan-M is species #2. Sure, it sounds weird, but not nearly as weird as the idea of 4 sexes, IMO.<p>&gt; <i>(And the offspring are about half white-striped and half tan-striped.)</i><p>Now, this is the important part. As I understand it, the offspring of &quot;species #1&quot; could be &quot;species #2&quot; or the other way round. This indicates that #1 and #2 are the same species after all.')
