In my opinion first of all the host should be secured (Firewall &amp; Fail2ban etc...).<p>To distribute security to the single images&#x2F;VMs increases complexity and the likeliness that some image&#x2F;VM will miss some security filter, and leaves the host itself unprotected (e.g. network time sync &amp; ssh &amp; other stuff will probably be running, any update to the host&#x27;s SW might result in unexpected services running, etc...).<p>An additional (dedicated) layer of security in the images&#x2F;VMs would of course still be ok.')
