I willingly took a 50% paycut this year and left my $big_company job to invert the 80% meeting &#x2F; 20% tech ratio, and it was the best decision professional decision I&#x27;ve ever made.<p>On a day-to-day basis, there&#x27;s always going to be a cyclical element -- I just spent two weeks writing code nine hours a day to push through a big feature, and now I expect to spend a week or two on less focused work, catching up on all the things I ignored while I was heads down.<p>I also try to turn non-code work into coding work. In lieu of doing a BUFD, I&#x27;ll try to throw together a proof-of-concept or do a spike. Whenever there&#x27;s a production issue, I try to turn that into a project to eliminate that class of issue. If there&#x27;s some repetitive administration to do, I try to automate it.')
