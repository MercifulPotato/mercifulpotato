Item(by='tomp', descendants=None, kids=[25528346, 25528291], score=None, time=1608823661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25528114, text='Ah right, I might have missed your point, if &quot;subscription&quot; is the only thing you&#x27;re objecting to.<p>First, it&#x27;s obviously a scam. I&#x27;m not getting extra value in exchange for money, the product is done. It&#x27;s even worse than various software subscriptions - at least there your code is continuously being improved and updated to the latest version. Therefore, literally the only reason the company is doing that, is to scam me out of more money.<p>Second is the trust issue - and I&#x27;m not just talking about legal scams - e.g. changing terms and conditions in the future - which could <i>in theory</i> be solved via courts &#x2F; customer protection laws (but in practice, won&#x27;t be) but more about the fact that the car company <i>has the ability to disable (parts of) my car</i>! So I wouldn&#x27;t be buying such a car (asterisk) <i>even if</i> they gave me a &quot;special offer&quot; of $0-forever subscription! They can <i>still</i> change the terms at any point in the future, and it would require massive effort on my part to fix that.<p><i>Edit:</i> Having said that, paying $2k up front for CarPlay is also a scam - but at least it makes it easier to estimate the total cost&#x2F;value of the feature, hence reducing the risk (and mental drag) of owning it...<p><i>Edit2:</i> Btw, I have this objection with any &quot;subscription&quot; service... e.g. buying <i>leasehold</i> (subscription) house (although even buying <i>freehold</i> (ownership) house isn&#x27;t without risk in the UK, you never know who has a preexisting claim on the property...)<p>(asterisk): assuming other options are available... which is the whole reason we must fight against this, sooner or later... in M$ Office and non-smart TVs, this train has already left the station!')
