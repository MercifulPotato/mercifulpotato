Item(by='Blikkentrekker', descendants=None, kids=[25717764], score=None, time=1610301973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717232, text='&gt; Because it is forced?<p>Obviously so is forced foreskin removal and forced tooth correction, so I fail to see that point.<p>&gt; In general, actions done to children by their parents (or with their parents&#x27; expressed, unequivocal consent) are not considered &quot;forced&quot; except in cases where the harm is large. So, male circumcision or teeth corrections or vaccinations are not &quot;forced&quot; on the children, because they are acts that their parents consider are beneficial to the child.<p>I see, so it would be fine of the parents were the ones forcibly sterilizing them rather than the government.<p>I find that absurd: I for one am in favor of government-mandated vaccinations and find this to be a very desirable thing opposed to letting parents be the ones to decide.<p>&gt; However, if the state were to force children to be circumcised or have their teeth aligned regardless of their parents&#x27; desires, then most people would object to that.<p>Yes, which I find absurd.<p>It matters not to the man whose body was irreparably altered whence the order to do so came — it&#x27;s a rather shallow comfort to then be told that it was fine because it was the will of one&#x27;s parents rather than the government&#x27;s.<p>&gt; Even more importantly, any actions which affect someone&#x27;s ability to use their body in a normal way are generally considered abhorrent. That is why male circumcision is usually tolerated, while female circumcision is an abomination, even if done by one&#x27;s parents. Forced sterilization is obviously in the second case, since it is terminally preventing someone from performing one of the 3 fundamental components of life.<p>Yes, you call it fundamental which goes right back to that it only holders water if one considers reproduction a higher goal that all must aspire to.<p>And with “all”, one can argue roughly half of all; I&#x27;ve noticed that he moral queasiness of sterilization of the male seems to be quite a bit lower than with sterilization of the female — as if that not be rooted in some belief that a female&#x27;s primary function is to be a reproductive engine: <i>close your eyes and think of England</i>.')
