Also, it&#x27;s all too easy to raise a troll&#x27;s profile and turn them into an anti-hero or martyr by dunking on them. This is what happened with the POTUS. It&#x27;s precisely the reaction he gets, the vehement criticism he gets, that makes him popular. His followers think, if he&#x27;s pissing off a lot of people, he must be doing something right. The worst possible thing that could happen to him, from his perspective, is to be ignored. &quot;All press is good press&quot;, as they say. In attempting to refute the message, you inadvertently make the messenger more prominent than they ought to be. You give them more public influence than they ought to have. This is how trolls rise to prominence, not only in politics, but in all areas. Look at the sports shows, where the loudest blowhards with the dumbest opinions — which they spout on purpose! — have the biggest audience. Dumb opinions make an inviting target to dunk on, and everyone takes the bait. The trolls want to be dunked on, time and time again. They want to be the go-to person for getting dunked on. If I make make a very bad Star Wars analogy, it&#x27;s like when Obi Wan says &quot;You can&#x27;t win, Vader. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.&quot; (Except Obi Wan is the bad guy in this analogy. Which he kind of is anyway, because he lied to Luke about his father.)')
