(It&#x27;s faster than rush-hour driving, but that&#x27;s about it.)<p>Making fast-enough rail that connects useful places, and upgrading the speed of existing rail that meets the same criteria, is a much better strategy IMO than trying to do &quot;better than flying&quot; rail based on unproven technology. Moonshots have their place, but America should try to catch up to the rest of the world in rail transport instead of pretending we&#x27;re on the bleeding edge of innovation.')
