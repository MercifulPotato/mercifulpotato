But back then we also didn&#x27;t spend all our days in the office. My dad used to be back at 18:00 and home-offices were unheard of for most jobs.<p>The argument is now to break open what has been until now a private comms channel in order to catch a few crooks, pedos and nutters. Guess we should all be prepared for a stronger presence of people wearing uniforms in our lives. A shame that since my early childhood every memory of a cop was a bad one and I even have one in my own family. They never let an opportunity pass to help out their friends with making speeding tickets disappear, to brag about how they roughed up somebody poor, or somebody who isn&#x27;t a native speaker. And these are the harmless cases. I know a German girl who has dated a cop and who struggled for nearly a decade to make her ex stalk her and threaten her potential dates ... I will never forget when I sat in a cop car as a kid because the guy wanted to leave an impression on me and I watched him beat the shit out of 2 brown people. Also shout out to my cop friends in Zagreb who offered me a smoke while bragging that they took the weed from a bunch of &quot;junkies&quot;. The weed was nice but the racism and bigotry never is. If it wears a uniform my reaction is automatic distrust.<p>And these are the people we are now handing over encryption keys to? I&#x27;m for defunding these simpleton f<i></i>ks (globally) and invest in education and reducing inequality instead. We need neither cops nor responsible encryption - these are the tools of fascism.')
