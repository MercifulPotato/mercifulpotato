A large sports streaming event might (easily!) do 10Tbps across a country, even more, but each GB served may only represent ~5k requests - 10e3&#x2F;8 * 5e3 = 6.25M RPS, with each request being a single packet (small GET requests). That&#x27;s big, but workable across enough machines for a big provider.<p>500M Pps is 80x that figure - you&#x27;re basically DoS&#x27;ing header processing filters in your networking hardware.')
