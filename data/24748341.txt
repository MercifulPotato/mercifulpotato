Tom Kennedy, who became National Geographic’s Director of Photography after the incident, stated: “We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterwards as a mistake, and we wouldn’t repeat that mistake today.”<p>[<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alteredimagesbdc.org&#x2F;national-geographic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alteredimagesbdc.org&#x2F;national-geographic&#x2F;</a>]<p>In any case, I was certain it had happened but this isn&#x27;t exactly compelling evidence that it&#x27;s a widespread problem. A much more recent example would help your case.  Also, (as you mentioned) this is a case of an outlet fooling people with their own fakes, not an outlet getting fooled by a fake which is more what I was referring to.')
