Remove that and we are just a normal mammal. Add that to other mammals and we could integrate them in society as full citizens.<p>For example, we aren&#x27;t using millions of mammals to sit and label machine learning models all day. It is not because they can&#x27;t create those labels, mammals are really good at a lot of tasks, it is because we can&#x27;t make mammals sit and repeatedly do a task all day even when rewarded. They just lack the reasoning capacity to override their intuition to do it.')
