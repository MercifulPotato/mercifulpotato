Given what&#x27;s happened in the US with the emergence of the alt right I&#x27;ve been wracking my brain over ways we could safely accomplish free expression of ideas and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible.<p>Either you allow for hate speech to be empowered and gain a megaphone or <i>someone</i> needs to be the decider on what is false.  You don&#x27;t actually need to kill off misinformed reporting or slanted reporting - you just need to censor reporting that is knowingly false and presenting non-facts as if they are facts - if you can kill that sort of information dead then I think society is able to sort out and prevent bubbles from forming around publications that choose to focus on certain stories - or that consistently frame stories to suit their agenda.<p>I think that the stars aligned from about 95-2010 where all the news outlets were still afraid enough of the government that they mostly kept in line but the government didn&#x27;t really have the resources to actually police things.<p>Oh also, the Age of Reason was pretty darn irrational compared to today - don&#x27;t let a fancy name and rose tinted glasses blind you to the faults of yesterday.')
