TSMC has lead in development <i>right now</i>. Intel isn&#x27;t dead and it can catch up, I am hoping just as TSMC caught upto Intel. There is no guarantee that TSMC might get stuck at a node in future for Intel to catch up. Neither is there any guarantee for Intel to find a technology breakthrough and make progress in leaps and bounds.<p>Remember, there was no tick-tock cycle before Intel invented the 2 year cadence back in ~2008. It was a business strategy to push alternate cycles of architecture changes and process node changes. It was <i>conceived and invented</i> by Intel. The point is that the cadence the entire industry judges itself was coined by the leader of the industry at the time. Now, the leader&#x27;s podium position isn&#x27;t at the top.')
