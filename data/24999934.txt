Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25001378], score=None, time=1604596533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998982, text='&gt; To the point that veganism requires industrialized farming: this may be true, I don&#x27;t know.<p>It&#x27;s a fact. You can&#x27;t even be a vegan on a family farm. Try it and find out. How is an innuit in siberia or alaska going to survive on veganism when native tribes in the amazon or lush jungles can&#x27;t even survive on veganism?<p>&gt; <i>A lot of currently cultivated farmland produces feed for livestock (Vox estimates 36% [0]);<p>Don&#x27;t link to vox garbage. They know as much about farming as they do about [fill in the blank]. A lot more farmland would need to be created for human consumption.<p>&gt; </i> This paper [1] estimates that switching land currently used for animals to plants would lead to a manifold increase in nutrient output per acre;<p>But it&#x27;s not 1 to 1. Most of that nutrient output won&#x27;t be any good for humans. And secondly, most of those nutrients can&#x27;t be grown in the places you grow grain to feed animals. Meaning you can&#x27;t grow avocado&#x27;s, almonds and all the other virtue signaling vegan products in nebraska or iowa. Okay?<p>&gt; * The BBC [2] estimates that &quot;A meat-eater’s diet requires 17 times more land, 14 times more water and 10 times more energy than a vegetarian’s;&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t link to BBC garbage. Also,we were talking about vegans, not vegetarians. Nice try. That&#x27;s another debate altogether.<p>&gt; but I think overall, environmentally and ethically, it would be an improvement.<p>Nope. The most immoral ( both to humans and animals and plants ) is the vegan diet. Veganism is environmental catastrophe. It&#x27;s mostly naive children who think a perfect utopia is possible. The kind of lunatics that try to force veganism on their infants&#x2F;pets and starve them to death. Go ask any farmer or any person who has experience with life. It&#x27;s like as a child wondering why we don&#x27;t just send out garbage to the sun.<p>&gt; I think the answer is to eat oysters, clams and mussels, which are high in iron, protein, and fish oil, but don&#x27;t have capacity for pain&#x2F;experience, as far as we know.<p>So, eat meat? I&#x27;m glad you finally came around.<p>&gt; This is called ostroveganism and I picked up the idea from Michael Huemer<p>It&#x27;s called pathetic rationalization.<p>1. If eating meat is wrong because of &quot;pain&#x2F;experience&quot;, then we shouldn&#x27;t eat plants either.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;earth&#x2F;story&#x2F;20170109-plants-can-see-hear-and-smell-and-respond" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;earth&#x2F;story&#x2F;20170109-plants-can-see-hear-...</a><p>Plants actually scream.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;smart-news&#x2F;scientists-record-stressed-out-plants-emitting-ultrasonic-squeals-180973716&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;smart-news&#x2F;scientists-record-...</a><p>Plants actually communicate and warn their neighbors about danger.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;secret-language-of-plants&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;12&#x2F;secret-language-of-plants&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;ll make it simple for you.<p>1. Science shows that plants can experience&#x2F;feel pain&#x2F;communicate, then should virtue signalers abstain from eating plants?<p>2. If it is immoral to kill an animal for meat, then is it okay to eat roadkill?<p>3. If it is immoral for animals to be killed, then is it immoral to own pets ( dogs, cats, snakes, etc ) that eat meat?<p>4. If it is immoral for animals to be killed for meat, then must we protect animals from other animals? Should we stop wolves, bears, etc from killing other animals?<p>Or have the privileged pathetic few gotten so rich and lazy that their want to feel superior over nonsense?<p>Like I said, we can end industrialized farming and go back to an omnivore diet like our ancestors. But we can&#x27;t end industrialized farming and go to a vegan diet because everyone would starve to death. I wish all the self-righteous and hypocritical vegans in the world would get together and buy a large farm and practice what they preach. Veganism would disappear within a season.')
