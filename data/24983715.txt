Item(by='FooHentai', descendants=None, kids=[24983796], score=None, time=1604435962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24983395, text='I agree, but with the caveats that <i>indescriminate</i> use of landfills (as we have today) is not good, and they are not maintenance-free in future although considering them &#x27;dump and forget&#x27; is very attractive. I expect historical landfills being compromised, especially due to increased sea levels and extreme weather events, to become an increasingly common topic in the next few decades.<p>Sequestration of plastic in landfills seems to be the best option we have right now for plastic waste disposal. Even then, more focus on proper encapsulation before it goes in is needed. Even simple initiatives like EcoBricks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecobricks.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecobricks.org&#x2F;</a>) helps ensure more permanent sequestration in ways that look likely to reduce the risk of eventual environmental damage.<p>We also need more focus on diversion of materials before landfill. Right now an enourmous amount of compostible organic waste, e-waste, and metals are sent to landfill because nobody is willing to bear the cost of diversion. IMO material disposal cost should be borne by the original producer (see the EU WEEE regulations for a good starter on how this can work). This incentivises sustainable choices from the very start of a goods life cycle, rather than how it currently sits as an afterthought.')
