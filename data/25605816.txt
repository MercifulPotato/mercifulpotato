Thus that service would be useless for me and for everyone I know.<p>Where I&#x27;m from, it&#x27;s the law that cabs should accept credit and debit, not only does it reduce tax fraud, but it also allow people like me to pay. Transaction fees are not that expensive, but believe me, companies that provide it to cabs drivers, does charge much more for it. Still it&#x27;s less than 30%.<p>Again where I&#x27;m from, dispatcher does charge the drivers, and from what I read, it was not too far from 30% (which makes sense, they have to account for advertising, wage for dispatch by phone, and since Uber, for the development of a badly made app).')
