I can just upload my arbitrarily large hdf5 file to your ftp server and you can just open it in matlab&#x2F;jupyter and start playing around with it. Doing the same with a database (other than sqlite) is really hard and requires that our database versions align and you&#x27;ll probably need help from someone from your IT dept. to get the right version installed and so on.')
