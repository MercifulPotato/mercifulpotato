Natural language is imprecise, ambiguous and heavily contextual in both its structure and semantic meaning. All those qualities are sources of bugs or undefined behaviour in programming.<p>As others have said in this thread: programming &quot;languages&quot; are not like natural languages for a reason, and conciseness is a big part of that. The two fill a completely different role, and it should be obvious that the brain structures involved are different too.<p>To illustrate that: the only reason people are surprised that programming languages and natural languages are dissimilar is because our natural language is ambiguous: it calls them both &quot;languages&quot; even though they serve entirely different functions.')
