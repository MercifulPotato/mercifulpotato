Item(by='freehunter', descendants=None, kids=[25403060], score=None, time=1607724519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390807, text='People struggle with the idea of any luxury brand that also makes mid-range or mass-market products in addition to their unaffordable luxury items.<p>Anecdote: I drive a newer BMW 328i. I live in the northern US where it snows, and it&#x27;s a rear-wheel drive car so it sat on the lot because no one around here wants to buy an expensive car they have to park half of the year. I bought it certified pre-owned for under $30k, but the MSRP brand new was more like $50k with the package&#x2F;options mine has. And yet I get so many comments about how it&#x27;s an impractical car (It&#x27;s a four door with a full size trunk and gets 30mpg...) and I must be rich for driving a BMW. Oftentimes I get this comment from people who drive pickup trucks that cost $60k-$70k, but that&#x27;s apparently okay because Ford isn&#x27;t a &quot;luxury brand&quot;.<p>I got my &quot;luxury car&quot; for less than the average purchase price of a new car in the US, and I still get comments about how it&#x27;s so expensive and I must be rich and I&#x27;ve had family tell me not to drive it to family events because it makes people feel like I&#x27;m showing off. Because when they think BMW, they think &quot;fuck that&#x27;s an expensive car&quot; but it&#x27;s not. BMW makes expensive cars, yes, but mine was not. Heck I was looking at replacing my SUV and the base-model Chevy Blazer costs more than my BMW.<p>But also yes, I&#x27;ve frequented some Toyota forums for my SUV and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of comments when someone wants to discuss their Lexus because &quot;it&#x27;s just a Toyota that costs $10k more!&quot;.')
