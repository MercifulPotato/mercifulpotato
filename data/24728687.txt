Not so long ago.<p>It was fun at first, it soon became the most boring thing to do.<p>The first Mc Donald&#x27;s in Italy was opened in Piazza di Spagna (Spanish steps) in 1987, 40 years after their first opening in the US.<p>The first Mc Donald&#x27;s in Russia opened in 1990, not a lot of difference there.<p>Ironically, probably thanks to the strong US military presence, Germany had its first Mc Donald&#x27;s in 1971.<p>There were people that saw one in Germany (probably agents from East Germany as well) 16 years before us.<p>Of course the difference is we could travel to US, there was no restriction for us to go there.<p>But on average people didn&#x27;t know much about US culture up until the middle 80s.<p>We actually knew USSR a lot better than the US of A, just as an example see the story of Togliattigrad <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tolyatti" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tolyatti</a><p>They mainly knew stories about their grandfathers who went to America between the two wars.<p>Most of them never came back, the only read about it from letters.<p>But what brought USSR down wasn&#x27;t the discovery of the supermarkets, it was the war in Afghanistan that left the once powerful Eastern Block with no money and forced them to declare bankruptcy.')
