My case came with four pre-installed fans, which was great until they turned on and blinded me with blazing blue light. And since my motherboard only has one 4-pin PWM port, I couldn&#x27;t control the LEDs independent of the fans. They were either at full brightness at all times, or fluctuated based on the fan speed.<p>I ended up cutting the LED leads on all the fans. It wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue in the first place if LED&#x2F;RGB stuff was an optional add-on instead of the default.')
