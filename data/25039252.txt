Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned that President Trump should not concede defeat in the 2020 presidential election in part because Republicans will &quot;never&quot; be able to elect another president from their party again.<p>&quot;If Republicans don&#x27;t challenge and change the U.S. election system, there will never be another Republican president elected again,&quot; Graham said Sunday on Fox News. &quot;President Trump should not concede. We&#x27;re down to less — 10,000 votes in Georgia. He&#x27;s going to win North Carolina. We have gone from 93,000 votes to less than 20,000 votes in Arizona, where more — more votes to be counted.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;homenews&#x2F;525063-lindsey-graham-if-trump-concedes-election-republicans-will-never-elect-another" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;homenews&#x2F;525063-lindsey-graham-if-trump-...</a>')
