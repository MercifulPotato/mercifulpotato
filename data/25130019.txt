At the very least you have transmission loss (to compensate for renewables intermittency you have to transfer energy farther), round-trip energy storage efficiency, EV efficiency. Also during cold weather you would have to spend electricity to heat car interior, while for gasoline cars this heat is &quot;free&quot;. And don&#x27;t forget that maintenance of renewable plants requires more energy, due to the low density of the exploited energy sources.<p>In the very best scenario for vehicles you would get somewhere around 1:2 ratio, not even close to an order of magnitude.')
