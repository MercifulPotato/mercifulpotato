I think part of it is that using MS Teams other people are a lot more accessible, just drop into the chat and leave a message.  If they are busy no probs, if they aren&#x27;t then they will reply and we talk about whatever.  Sick of typing, drop into a voice or video chat. Want to talk work, then it&#x27;s easy to share a screen.  A lot easier than looking at a screen over somebodies shoulder.<p>Whilst I do miss going out for a coffee or some such, I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m actually enjoying the social side of working remotely a lot more than the forced socialisation that was occurring physically in the office.')
