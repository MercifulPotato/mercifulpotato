Item(by='jmwilson', descendants=None, kids=[25817252], score=None, time=1610929760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813760, text='&gt; ACEP achieves a full color gamut, including all eight primary colors<p>Last I checked there are three primary colors, and what is a full color gamut? There are several standard choices of gamut.<p>What confuses me about color e-ink products is that it is a reflective display, yet none of them use a reflective color model (CMY) - all of them talk about RGB pigmented subpixels. Either what I learned about color reproduction for print media is wrong, or these devices are probably incapable of showing a large number of colors. Given the washed-out appearance of several photos of real products, I&#x27;m leaning toward the latter conclusion. I&#x27;d love to see magazine-quality color in a reflective display some day, but they don&#x27;t seem to be starting from the right fundamentals. Has anyone benchmarked the color reproduction of these products?')
