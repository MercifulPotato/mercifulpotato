Item(by='failedsides', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610666446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783152, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;categorybooks.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;categorybooks.com</a><p>A way to find books by different categories (by prizes their authors have won).<p>I gave up on the site after a month or two (and a lot of work), but I&#x27;m putting some more effort into it again. It&#x27;s the first website I&#x27;ve ever built, so any feedback is appreciated!<p>For example, browsing through the books by &quot;people&quot; and by &quot;books&quot;, the format is inconsistent and I&#x27;m not sure which is considered better design (hovering over the card vs the name to activate). Also apologies ahead for it loading all of the images and having no pagination.. Like I said, first website!')
