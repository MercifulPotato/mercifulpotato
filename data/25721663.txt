Unfortunately, all the options suck.<p>Both nVidia and the AMD have buggy Linux drivers, especially regarding suspend issues.<p>After experiencing suspend issues with the closed-source nVidia drivers, I bought an all AMD laptop (Dell G5 SE), only to deal with even buggier open-source AMD drivers.<p>The Intel drivers just work, but Intel integrated GPUs are painfully slow, and using the integrated GPU makes the CPU run noticeably hotter.<p>That said, AMD drivers are getting more stable over time, and buying AMD is probably our best chance of improving the driver situation long-term.')
