Even if there are 500 standards, that&#x27;s much better than an unbounded number.<p>Regulation would certainly force the issue, but one way or another the consumer packaged goods industry (and other industries) need to get their heads around focusing competition around everything BUT packaging.<p>When packaging has become standard, no one competes there any more. If everyone has the mindset that this is expected and OK, just focus competitive efforts elsewhere -- product quality, branding, better ingredients&#x2F;parts, lower price, whatever. Your packaging design&#x2F;pollution budget is now free for other opportunities.<p>There is some advantage in selecting the right standard size, but you either know what your industry is doing or you pay a consultant to tell you which one to try next.<p>What you <i></i>don&#x27;t do<i></i> is spend lots more money designing your own custom packaging that may or may not help sales and will never be recycled.<p>And then there is the entire packaging design industry, not a small one, who will not like this at all. Anyone want to play devil&#x27;s advocate and guess what they might say?')
