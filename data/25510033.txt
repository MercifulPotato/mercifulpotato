I used to spend my time being frustrated I didn&#x27;t have what I wanted when it seemed many of my friends and peers were given things I had zero chance of getting. Now? I don&#x27;t exactly work hard for the sake of working hard, but the work I do for my goals (family, retirement, home, stress, health) has paid off in spades.')
