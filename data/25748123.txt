Item(by='stronglikedan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610465498, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25740895, text='I missed a mortgage payment, because my mortgage company launched their &quot;new&quot; website as a subdomain on a primary domain that wasn&#x27;t registered to them. They sent an email from that same domain, directing people to the new site. I tried to verify the authenticity of the email with their customer service team, but, crickets. No one bothered contacting me until they wanted to chase me down for the payment, at which point, I told them what a horrible practice it was, and insisted they remove the late fee. They did remove the fee, but the site and all related emails <i>still</i> look like phishing attempts. Not surprising really, given that the majority of companies double-down on stupid when called out for their blunders.')
