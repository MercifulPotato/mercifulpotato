I understand the system of <i>not</i> believing something. But Trump world is full of things that those people <i>do</i> believe, and I&#x27;m trying to understand why people who claim to believe so little actually believe so much, what they base their belief on, and why they think skepticism is their brand. It&#x27;s like a bunch of people who&#x27;d walk around wearing five layers of clothes and identifying as nudists.<p>For example, there are thousands of people in that world who are self-proclaimed skeptics, yet believe predictions made by an anonymous person, whose only reputation is of having a perfect score of total misses. So if those people see doubting those who lie to them as central to their identity, why do they make a point of believing someone who so very clearly has done nothing other than lie to them? It&#x27;s not even a matter of distrusting faceless institutions and trusting only acquaintances, because they&#x27;re all too happy to trust people they don&#x27;t even know exist.')
