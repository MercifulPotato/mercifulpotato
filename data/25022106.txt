I understand the system of <i>not</i> believing something. But Trump world is full of things that those people <i>do</i> believe, and I&#x27;m trying to understand why people who claim to believe so little actually believe so much, and what they base their belief on. For example, there are thousands of people in that world who believe predictions made by an anonymous person, whose only reputation is of having made dozens of predictions, none of which has materialized. So if those people see doubting those who lie to them as central to their identity, why do they make a point of believing someone who so very clearly has done nothing other than lie to them? They&#x27;re not saying, I don&#x27;t trust anyone. They&#x27;re saying, I don&#x27;t trust scientists, historians and the legal system, but I <i>do</i> trust stuff I read from anonymous people on some social network.')
