America is a capitalist nation. We should just run it like a corporation. Pay politicians on the basis of nation’s user experience.<p>I am stunned that Trump got over 72 million votes. I did not expect that. Even if he loses, we know that at least close to 50% of the country wasn’t embarrassed by Trump. That changes everything. Everything.<p>That wasn’t the narrative we heard in CA. In California&#x2F;Silicon Valley, we seem to be living in a bubble without a clue as to how the rest of the country feels.<p>I think dividing the country into two halves politically is a bad idea. We need multiple parties and coalition govts. That might make more sense.')
