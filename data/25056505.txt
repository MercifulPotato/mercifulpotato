Item(by='berryworm', descendants=None, kids=[25056527], score=None, time=1605082826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25055659, text='It&#x27;s not difficult to &quot;succeed&quot; as a woman. Sure if you want a fancy career and so on, it is difficult. But you can always fall back to simply having children and letting somebody else take care of you. Even if you flunk all your exams and job interviews, you can still find somebody to get you pregnant.<p>Men, on the other hand, have to succeed. Nobody else will take care of them if they fail, and they won&#x27;t have the option for children or a family as easily (some chaos monkeys exist, but still). Even if they succeed at having a career or family, both can be taken away from them at a whim, no matter what they do.<p>That&#x27;s mostly a result of biology (and feminist laws), to the point that daughters are more likely to be born in times of crisis (nature playing it safe). I&#x27;m surprised the article even speculates about complicated reasons for why people might worry more about their sons than their daughters.')
