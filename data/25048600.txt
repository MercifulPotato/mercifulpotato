The US was founded on the idea that a king across the ocean can&#x27;t tell us we can&#x27;t expand beyond the appalachian mountains.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;event&#x2F;Proclamation-of-1763" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;event&#x2F;Proclamation-of-1763</a><p>The revolutionary war started because we wanted to take more land from the natives and the king forbade that because he wanted good trade relations with the native peoples. That&#x27;s it. Everything else is just propaganda.<p>&gt; I am Chinese-American, so if China were to displace the US as world hegemon and put Han people at the top of society, that would personally benefit me.<p>China will never be world hegemon due to geographical, racial, historical, etc issues. China vs the US, Europe, Russia, Australia, Canada, etc isn&#x27;t even a fair contest. Not to mention western aligned nations like india, japan, etc wouldn&#x27;t allow china to be a hegemon. Also, how would it benefit you if the chinese government view you as a traitor?<p>&gt; However, I do not want that, as I support racial equality.<p>If you equate hegemony with racial supremacy, why would you support US hegemony? How about &quot;no hegemony&quot;?<p>Don&#x27;t you think the world would be better if the US didn&#x27;t have to maintain a world empire? The world wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about invasions and we can finally start investing in american infrastructure. When I see the amount of infrastructure china has built the last few decades ( heck just the last 10 years alone ), I have to say I&#x27;m a bit envious. Instead of sinking trillions in foreign wars, imagine all those trillions were invested in new railways, new airports, nuclear energy, green energy, reviving inner cities, etc.')
