You&#x27;d only need to test positive before to rule out infection. It&#x27;s not like your HIV status is known to anyone else, so it&#x27;s a matter of information management, not risk inherently.<p>If we get an HIV vaccine it may also be therapeutic for HIV+ people. So far vaccine development wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere because we&#x27;re at loss with the nature of the virus. _If we find a persistent target, HIV may burn out in those infected and vaccinated. Seroconversion may then be something to look forward to.')
