This won&#x27;t be monitized, and will remain my little hobby.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nullitics.com&#x2F;stats&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nullitics.com&#x2F;stats&#x2F;</a> - a zero-effort web analytics, easy to embed or self-host; much lighter and smaller than the alternatives, and as a result - much cheaper (I plan to charge 1â‚¬&#x2F;month and that would still be profitable).')
