Item(by='ashtonbaker', descendants=None, kids=[25259728], score=None, time=1606772564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258889, text='&gt; but experimental methods have not solved protein folding either.<p>I might be missing something here, but isn&#x27;t &quot;experimental methods&quot; just shorthand for &quot;our best knowledge of a protein&#x27;s structure, obtained via NMR or X-ray crystallography&quot;? In that case, I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;solving&quot; protein folding even means - literally zero mean error? We can&#x27;t know&#x2F;solve anything beyond our best knowledge, that&#x27;s tautological.<p>&gt; What would be informatively useful would be to know how much accuracy is needed on average for drug engineers.<p>Yeah that would be interesting, but:<p>&gt; I&#x27;d say that 99% is more likely to be the minimum to make solid inferences<p>...what are you basing this on?')
