Songs I used to be able to find by describing vaguely it can now no longer find at all, and it gives me random indie artists for songs I actually know the title og unless I literally spell it out (and even then, it often fails). Woe be to you whose desired song only exists as a Youtube (but not Youtube Music) video. Something behind the scenes has changed, and it&#x27;s just another reason never to trust Google to maintain their services.')
