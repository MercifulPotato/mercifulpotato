Item(by='klmadfejno', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605810755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25152014, text='&gt; Yes, but you don&#x27;t really build &quot;communities&quot; on reddit.<p>Reflecting on my forum days, I don&#x27;t think this is true. It&#x27;s plain and simple to see subreddit members have STRONGLY held convictions that their subreddit is a unique and important community, just as they used to. I grew up on forums of &lt; 100 people had made similar stupid arguments about the norms and salience of the forum to whatever topic it was aligned to. Yes, now there&#x27;s karma farming, but it&#x27;s not like people didn&#x27;t make zounds of forum posts for the intended or subconsiously intended purpose of accruing social credit by demonstrating in group mentalities.')
