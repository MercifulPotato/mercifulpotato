It&#x27;s reasonable for a company to care about how many views a product page, how to, or topic page gets. And it&#x27;s a proxy for a lot of other things that are really hard to suss out. (Though you can measure things like how far people read&#x2F;watch, time they spend, etc.)<p>But for me personally, I mostly go by what I want to read and I don&#x27;t really care if an SEO plug-in is telling me I should be writing at a sixth grade level--which is the level a lot of these tools work at. (And I&#x27;m often working with experienced editors who have a pretty good sense of what their audience&#x2F;desired audience is looking for.) They&#x27;re also not mostly ad-supported so there isn&#x27;t a lot of incentive to go for pageviews for the sake of pageviews.')
