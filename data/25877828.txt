The creator of React said he thought moving to functional components would make it harder for people to learn.<p>I&#x27;ve found that sometimes hooks can make things less flexible, more verbose, more error prone, and harder to reason about. Sometimes a class might have made things easier to understand.<p>I loved the fact that `useEffect` could modularize code that was otherwise split between `componentDidMount&#x2F;Unmount&#x2F;Update`...but couldn&#x27;t a new class API also have solved this.<p>Maybe I just need to read the docs again to remind me. I&#x27;m all in for hooks, but it&#x27;s rare that I think about what life could have been like if we kept class components.')
