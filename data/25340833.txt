(basically random tiles that have paths connecting to any random tiles next to it, with hexagons as tiles instead of squares)<p>I ended up having to figure out some of that stuff again, in particular the coordinate system inside each tile so that I could deal with integer coordinates and translate them into the right fraction of the radius.<p>It was fun to figure out what I needed, so I don&#x27;t regret it :)<p>And I am also planning on doing something with cubes, so this page will come in handy.<p>Thanks for sharing! I love how it covers all aspects of the problem.<p>Result of the tiling: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_timothee&#x2F;status&#x2F;1330315929641570304" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_timothee&#x2F;status&#x2F;1330315929641570304</a><p>Diagram of my coordinate system: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_timothee&#x2F;status&#x2F;1327859098642046976" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_timothee&#x2F;status&#x2F;1327859098642046976</a>')
