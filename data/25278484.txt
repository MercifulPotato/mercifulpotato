I currently pay $80, but on nonpromotional pricing, its about $100 for internet only.  Reliability has been great, but it&#x27;s important to note that this is the only high speed internet option in my area.  Basically, most of America is split between Comcast(xfinity) or Charter(spectrum), and some lucky places have real competition.  I _could_ get worse internet via satellite or w&#x2F;e, but if I want over ~20mps (last time I checked), I have to use Charter. I&#x27;ve used Comcast when living elsewhere, with similar pricing, but anecdotally worse reliability.')
