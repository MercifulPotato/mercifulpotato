I can&#x27;t blame Capitol Police--at least for the actions after it already got out of hand.<p>If federal security at Court House shoots BLM protestors who are entering a federal court house, those security people would probably get charged with murder.<p>It&#x27;s unreasonable to expect Capitol Police to make that sort of moral choice in the moment.
