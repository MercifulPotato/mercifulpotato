Item(by='intellirogue', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609276322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574867, text='Yes, lack of local knowledge in Google Maps is often problematic, and Google aren&#x27;t receptive to local governments requesting changes.<p>I lived near a gorge where there was a nice modern road alongside an old horse track that was only intended for use by the residents connected to it. It was technically two-way (as making it one way would annoy the residents who might want to go either up or down) but barely wide enough for one car. If you met another car halfway, you had to reverse until you got to a driveway you could go into and let the other car past.<p>At some point Google Maps&#x27; algorithm changed and started suggesting that everyone use the old road. There were multiple crashes, and the local government begged Google to deprioritise it, but their answer was basically &quot;our algorithm is always right&quot;. Five years on, Google Maps will still suggest it, so the local government added big signs at each end advising drivers to ignore Google Maps and to use the main road.<p>Although they already weren&#x27;t suggesting that route, the other map providers (Apple, Here, TomTom etc) contacted by the local government were happy to proactively add a flag to the road saying that it is for residents only - so it will only route using it if the source&#x2F;destination is that road.')
