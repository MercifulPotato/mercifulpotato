I remember taking a selfie of myself on two different phones to compare their forward-facing cameras. The image quality on both was roughly the same, but one had subtle skin smoothing and lighting adjustments, the other one didn&#x27;t. The one with &quot;beauty filters&quot; generally matched what I assumed I looked like to other people. The one without the &quot;beauty filters&quot; made me look much worse than my own mental picture of myself. \nI&#x27;m sure the one without beauty filters was more accurate, but it made me more self-conscious about my appearance and kinda made me realize &quot;shoot, I&#x27;m actually uglier than I thought&quot;, and that bummed me out. It certainly didn&#x27;t help my self-esteem or self-confidence! I rather suspect that subtle automatic retouching would actually be good for one&#x27;s mental health.')
