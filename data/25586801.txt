Another example of just how nonsensical their conclusions are, under the sections &#x27;WIV disassociation&#x27; and &#x27;Chinese response&#x27; they again rely on news articles to conclude China&#x27;s response merits suspicion and therefor must be covering up the source of COVID. This assertion is just illogical and fatally flawed. While China may have motivation to cover it up if that were the case, scientists in other countries who have obviously spent a great deal of time examining COVID and concluded it&#x27;s zoonotic wouldn&#x27;t have motivation to cover it up. Yet this obvious logical deduction is not factored into their conclusions or even merits a mention.')
