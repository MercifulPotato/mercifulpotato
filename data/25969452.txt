However, this <i>is</i> a noticable trend with macOS. Their pace with modern Unix is severely behind, and I often get bug reports from macOS users lacking some API that&#x27;s been available on open source Unicies for 5+ years. Plus, even if Linux in 2007 didn&#x27;t support what you need, it&#x27;s open source so backporting the required functionality is feasible, and impossible on macOS.<p>MoltenVK is a good workaround, but open standards &gt; workarounds.')
