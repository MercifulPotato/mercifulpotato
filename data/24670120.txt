Why not make the best of it and get a job?<p>Quoting from the article:<p>&quot;In middle school children have dreams to become a Pilot in the airforce, or maybe a Police officer, or maybe a Opera Singer ! But by the time of high school, everyone is just either on road to become an Engineer, a Doctor, a Lawyer, a Chartered Accountant …. or a failure. This may seem harsh but that’s how most of the society operates here in India.&quot;<p>The problem here is that students are forced by their parents into a field of education they don&#x27;t even like. How do you expect someone to understand the intricacies of fluid dynamics when they don&#x27;t give a rat&#x27;s ass about it. When you give exams on topics you are not even remotely interested in? Therein lies the <i>privilege</i> of being <i>American</i>. When you&#x27;re a common Indian student, you don&#x27;t have a choice in choosing your field of study<p>&gt;&gt; Any Indian with access to a computer can potentially be a (much) better hire than the one from the most desired engineering college.<p>This only works well for computer science. What about students who want to become doctors? Do you know that to get a seat in an Indian medical college, a common Indian student will most likely have to pay a &quot;donation&quot; just to get their foot in the door.')
