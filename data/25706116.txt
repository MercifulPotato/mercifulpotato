I&#x27;m arguing specifically that &quot;hang Mike Pence&quot; is coming from the far right, and only from the far part of the far right.<p>If you find this odd, you should read some far-right forums. I read these social media circles (as well as far-left ones of various sorts), not because I agree with them, but because I think it&#x27;s useful to understand what the &quot;other side&quot; thinks. The one I was reading today had <i>multiple</i> memes of him as a traitor - one had him photoshopped as Brutus assassinating Trump-as-Caesar surrounded by Romney and others, one had him next to Benedict Arnold, etc.<p>Meanwhile, at some point in the NYC Women&#x27;s March four years ago, when folks were chanting &quot;Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,&quot; I tried to lead a &quot;Michael Pence has got to go.&quot; Nobody really joined in.<p>And in any case, my original point is that there is a <i>large</i> number of folks, Democrat and Republican and everything in between, who do not agree with &quot;hang Mike Pence,&quot; and it is on those people&#x27;s beliefs that we can build common ground. I don&#x27;t deny that there are protestors with megaphones who shout extreme positions, but my exact point was that you should not extrapolate based on who shouts the loudest.')
