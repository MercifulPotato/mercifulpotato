It&#x27;s not a great job. It&#x27;s a high-volume job, like an assembly line. The highly compensated Twitter and Facebook software engineers are not doing the content moderation. They don&#x27;t have the time, and they would run away screaming if they had to do it for an hour. It&#x27;s likely that a lot of this work is even outsourced.')
