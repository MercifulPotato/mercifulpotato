But don’t think that would be a problem since everyone has a national id card.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ch.ch&#x2F;en&#x2F;demokratie&#x2F;votes&#x2F;how-to-complete-a-ballot-paper-correctly&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ch.ch&#x2F;en&#x2F;demokratie&#x2F;votes&#x2F;how-to-complete-a-ball...</a>')
