The potential consequences were more grave here, but the actual conduct itself seems much more orderly.<p>But I agree that as the Democrats and social media companies still continue to poke and poke and poke already angry people that the consequences can get worse. I wish someone reasonable would try to de-escalate the situation instead of continuing to add gasoline to the fire with further suppression, insults, and contempt for Trump and his supporters--but Silcion Vally and Democratic leadership can&#x27;t seem to help themselves and would prefer to further insult and alienate the 74 million people who voted for Trump just 2 months ago.')
