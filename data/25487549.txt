I&#x27;m a freelance python developer in Brussels, Belgium with just over 10 years exp and 32 years of age. The jump from employee to freelance wasn&#x27;t easy but I sure wish I&#x27;d done it sooner. Short term and urgent contracts are worth a lot more than long term (2weeks versus 6months). You need to know your worth. I always calculate &quot;how much time&#x2F;costs&quot; will you save as a result of my software: I want a fair piece of that. I focus on those shorter contracts. This year brought me almost twice what you&#x27;re looking for (before tax). And a good accountant friend helps me keep as much as I legally can. Next year, I&#x27;m hoping to finally hit the 250k mark. As an employee just 2 years ago, I was amongst the &quot;high paid employees&quot;, bringing in 55k net a year as a comparison. I suggest you look into doing the same with either becoming independent or starting a 1 person company. Contact an accountant ASAP to get the best advice on which structures best fit for you.')
