Just because of the amount of people that seem to use and like voice assistants it&#x27;s great to see some work on the open source, non-proprietary cloud side of things.<p>I also have to admit, I find most of thr current voice assistant technology vaguely creepy knowing every command is possibly stored and saved somewhere outside my control. The fact the systems that do this are constantly listening for phrases and of course the inevitable use of your data for marketing that these services are based on.<p>I understand the choices seem to be either pay for it or pay with your privacy and data, but I still hold out the naive hope for a technology based future focused on empowering individuals and not service providers and large corporations, sadly it seems this mostly comes from the open source world, which as many articles on hn have touched on, don&#x27;t tend to get the support they need or they get picked up by large entities who take what they need and surround them by proprietary blobs.<p>Sorry this got a bit rambling, but anyway, this is a cool project, I hope to see it grow and gain support and adoption.')
