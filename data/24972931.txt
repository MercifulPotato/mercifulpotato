I know about this because I was involved in a lawsuit that involved contract law.  In order for a contract to be valid it is not enough to have a document with a valid signature on it.  There has to be an actual &quot;meeting of the minds&quot;.  Both parties have to actually <i>intend</i> to abide by the terms of the contract at the time it was signed, which logically implies that both parties have to know the contract&#x27;s actual content.<p>The real underlying strategy here is to leverage people&#x27;s general ignorance of contract law in order to intimidate them into <i>thinking</i> that they are contractually bound when in fact they are not, at least not legally.  As a practical matter, the need to pay a lawyer often trumps the actual law (another lesson I learned the hard way).')
