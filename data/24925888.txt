They&#x27;re still beating Azure. Because they were first, of course -- but the point is that true competition is all about playing to your advantages and mitigating your disadvantages. Google had enormous advantages and squandered them. Maybe Microsoft&#x27;s advantages were genuinely stronger, but from where I&#x27;m standing it looks like Google didn&#x27;t even try.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the AWS vs Azure vs GCP drama play out a few times, once on a team with significant Microsoft legacy and twice without. In my judgement, the MS legacy, even at its most potent, was a smaller consideration than Google&#x27;s unmitigated weakness, every manager&#x27;s worst nightmare: the concrete risk that Google would cancel something and the manager would get blamed for not seeing it coming. Maybe I&#x27;ve just been blessed to work at non-dysfunctional companies where non-technical management asks the opinion of technical management on technical matters, but technical management is highly cognizant of this risk and has been for a decade.<p>My recommendation would have been to go on offense. Make AWS&#x27;s constant over-promising and under-delivering a meme. Make Microsoft&#x27;s we-have-altered-the-deal-pray-we-dont-alter-it-further enterprise pricing a meme (compare to: google and gmail are still free). Build counterveiling fears in that technical manager&#x27;s mind, no lying required, because Amazon and MS earned those criticisms and they earned them hard.<p>Now it&#x27;s probably too late. Too bad. So it goes.')
