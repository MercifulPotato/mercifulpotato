Her reply was “It’s shit. But it worked.”<p>This is particularly high praise for simple HTML as the <i>shit</i> part is likely the PSP&#x27;s UI, which is of course out of the control of the website, whereas the <i>it worked</i> part is due to the PSP&#x27;s browser and the website both working adequately.<p>Good on GOV.UK for doing it properly.')
