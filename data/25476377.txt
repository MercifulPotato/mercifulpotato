If the patient has a history&#x2F;examination which could indicate a need for surgery, and the patient has given informed consent, the surgeon is very unlikely to be succcessfully sued for operating. I&#x27;m not implying this is a consious decision on their part, rather a subconscious influence of their training, anecdotes from other surgeons etc.')
