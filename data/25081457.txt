Brookfield&#x27;s books are considered canonical, and everyone who is anyone (I&#x27;m not anyone) in grip is on grip board[0]. I was first made aware of it looking at this dude&#x27;s geoshitties website[1], which is mercifully still around and a great beginners resource.<p>To sell you on it a bit: if you&#x27;ve lifted for ~10 years you&#x27;ve probably hit your biological peak on the big exercises, and you&#x27;ve gone into some kind of maintenance mode, or are concentrating more on strength endurance, or rotating through peak efforts on different kinds of strength, or working around inevitable injuries or whatever. Either way, a man gets bored, and a large part of the appeal of strength training is the feeling of making progress. Various forms of hand strength; there&#x27;s basically infinite potential there. Leonardo used to bend horseshoes, and it&#x27;s a seemingly impossible feat I think most men are capable of with some training. It&#x27;s also something available to old people who might not be able or willing to pull 5 wheels on the deadlift any more. You can, of course, injure your hands or forearms, but your chances of being crippled by it are fairly low. The other thing about it; you can train a fair amount (unlike big lifts) without blowing out your cortisol, but you get that intense triumphant grrrrrrr ogre nerve energy from doing it that you do after a max effort lift. Also it looks cool and chicks and small children dig it when you do seemingly impossible feats.<p>Anyway, peasants who hoed their crops and lifted bricks all day were fucking STRONG in the hands. Probably stronger than most nobles in that regard.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gripboard.com&#x2F;index.php?&#x2F;forum&#x2F;7-workout-reports-and-training-routines&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gripboard.com&#x2F;index.php?&#x2F;forum&#x2F;7-workout-reports...</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geocities.ws&#x2F;ltgodfrey&#x2F;lever.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geocities.ws&#x2F;ltgodfrey&#x2F;lever.html</a>')
