I understand that this confusion could have arisen because &quot;Romani people&quot; and &quot;Romanian people&quot; sound similar in Finnish and some of them are from Romania. However, many of them come from Bulgaria as well â€“ a very large community comes from the Bulgarian town of Pleven seasonally each year.<p>FWIW, the ethnicity names &quot;Romani&quot; and &quot;Romanian&quot; are not actually etymologically related, it is only a coincidence that they sound similar. You would think that after a decade-plus now of having Romani migrants very visible in the Helsinki city center, people could have learned a little more about who they are, and what drives them to make the long journey to Finland.')
