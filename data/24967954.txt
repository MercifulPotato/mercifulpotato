There&#x27;s no agency given to the people who break off relationships based on political disagreement.  It&#x27;s all Trump&#x27;s fault for being the most polarizing figure in the world today.<p>There&#x27;s no question he&#x27;s polarizing, but you can&#x27;t blame him for every disagreement.<p>My suggestion - don&#x27;t disown your family over Trump.')
