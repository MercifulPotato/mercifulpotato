Loblaws groceries were selling powder. But I don&#x27;t see it much anymore. I&#x27;m not sure, with such a psycho-socio-cultural change requirement, that a company can go this alone without help. There would have to be something akin to our dairy, egg or wheat boards. I suspect a big chunk of cash would have to be dedicated just to marketing. I think there are many that would love to include these products in their diet - people abstain from meat for a variety of reasons and this might fill that gap. Especially if it can really be shown to be a sustainable product.')
