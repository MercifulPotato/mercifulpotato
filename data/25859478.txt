If people don&#x27;t want to catch the thing, then they take the vaccine.  However, taking the vaccine does little to prevent others catching the vaccine unless you go for a draconian &#x27;everyone must vaccinate&#x27; measure.  But then we are back to &#x27;if you don&#x27;t want the thing then vaccinate&#x27;.  The logic doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me.<p>Note: I am not an antivaxer.  I think vaccines are great, and it is a good idea for people to take them, just like working out and eating healthy.  I just don&#x27;t understand the logic behind mandatory vaccinations to protect other people.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me when people believe others not taking a vaccine is somehow a significant threat to them. \nAnd I am not saying the logic is incorrect, merely that I do not understand the logic.')
