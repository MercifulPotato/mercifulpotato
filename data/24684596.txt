And it&#x27;s the only scenario where I feel it&#x27;s justified working 60-80 hr weeks: you&#x27;re building your company&#x2F;product. It&#x27;s a position with a risk&#x2F;reward ratio that you can&#x27;t find in academia or industry, and I think most of us here know that you learn a lot when you&#x27;re free to deep dive into ideas you love.')
