Depending on the answer to this question a call to action can be constructive or not. Imagine the topic becoming a partisan issue...<p>Especially if the latter is the more likely scenario and the pandemic is used to introduce politically opportunistic measures the resistance would increase noticeably.<p>I think the the reason is that scientific explanations don&#x27;t seem to work is that the topic isn&#x27;t the viability of vaccination.<p>The article suggest that people should be converted by a targeted information campaign, or manipulation how detractors will call it. I believe that would fail and not improve the situation.<p>If you demand trust for something, you need to be ready to give some as well.<p>Some smart politicians were better at this. They plainly made sure people had a choice by excluding mandatory vaccination. And with a choice quotas above 95% were already reached and even very common.<p>I agree that plain scientific info isn&#x27;t enough, but I don&#x27;t think the strategy will work.')
