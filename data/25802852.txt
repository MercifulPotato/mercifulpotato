Computation and storage amounts could have their own payout per action, or per time on storage.<p>Most people have their computers on all the time anyways, so if they&#x27;re working in the background for them to earn some side income, while helping create a better internet.<p>Would need some centralization I&#x27;d imagine though, I think the problem with de-centralization is the goal is ALL or nothing.<p>Like one or two big servers that maybe tie everything to the rest, and push &#x27;updates&#x27; on algorithms, contracts,etc... to end users. Maybe a segregation index, knowing all airplane related searches are indexed on cluster c which has nodes 1-8, so you know where to go to get the info being searched.<p>I&#x27;m a mainly full-stack but &#x27;dumb&#x27; developer, not an algorithms wiz, mostly focused on crud apps. But this would be fun to build.')
