CCC says they&#x27;re using asr. Both articles also say asr currently won&#x27;t make a bootable copy of an M1-based Mac.<p>Both articles seem to imply Apple is dropping the ball on supporting tools for the partition&#x2F;system changes they&#x27;re making. The CCC seems more like a rallying cry:<p>&gt; If Apple ships macOS Big Sur without fixing the underlying utilities that facilitate creating a bootable backup, you can choose to defer the upgrade. There is no urgency, no impetus to upgrade to macOS Big Sur. If we defer the upgrade choice, that sends a clear message that we&#x27;re willing to wait for Apple to deliver quality software, rather than hitting an artificial deadline with an OS that&#x27;s not ready.')
