Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605594439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25120648, text='&gt; It skipped 1:08, instead holding 1:07 for two minutes than going to 1:09.<p>Haha, love that story. Reminds me of another student who was going to build a digital clock that only displayed the time, very accurately, in 15 minute intervals. Because, he reasoned, nobody should need time more accurate than that!<p>I, too, built a CMOS digital clock for a freshman lab project out of about 40 chips. It did not work, it just blinked the display LEDs erratically. I still have it, it still does not work and I still don&#x27;t know why.<p>My senior EE91 lab project (single board computer) did work, though, but I misplaced it somewhere in the last 40 years :-(')
