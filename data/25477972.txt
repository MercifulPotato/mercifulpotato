This in spite of the fact that the percentage of women and minorities in academia and pharmaceutical industry has greatly increased. It follows that, in a social equilibrium, preferrential treatment of one group leads to disadvantages for another. New ideologies have appeared and influenced hiring practices, promotion, funding, and recognition of certain groups. Each candidate should have an equal opportunity to secure a position, regardless of personal identification&#x2F;categorization. The rise and emphasis on hiring practices that suggest or even mandate equality in terms of absolute numbers of people in specific subgroups is counter-productive if it results in discrimination against the most meritorious candidates. Such practice affects the format of interviews and has led to the emergence of mandatory “training workshops” on gender equity, inclusion, diversity, and discrimination.<p>I apologize for my naivety on this topic, but: Isn&#x27;t this basically saying that if A and B have the same qualifications, but B is a member of a discriminated group, B should be preferred. If A has better qualifications, A should be preferred. I can see that this might be controversial, but what exactly is offensive here (or &quot;appalling&quot; [0])? Am I misunderstanding the section above?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CIC_ChemInst&#x2F;status&#x2F;1269003560357773312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1269003560357773312%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fretractionwatch.com%2F2020%2F06%2F05%2Ffollowing-outrage-chemistry-journal-makes-a-paper-decrying-diversity-efforts-disappear%2F" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;CIC_ChemInst&#x2F;status&#x2F;1269003560357773312?...</a>')
