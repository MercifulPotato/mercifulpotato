Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[25240915, 25241072], score=None, time=1606599749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25237356, text='Nice article, there is an even easier interpretation though:<p>The mathematics of probability defines a bunch of objects that do not exist, anywhere. Random variables, expectations, probabilities, maybe a few others. Then there are situations in the real world that look a lot like those objects from certain perspectives.<p>It is a bit like Escher&#x27;s <i>Ascending and Descending</i> - sometimes people make things in the real world that look like the infinite staircase when viewed from the right spot.  Similarly, sometimes we find things that look probabilistic (dice rolls, coin flips) when viewed in ignorance of the sum totality of the entire universe. That is why there are a bunch of statistical tests that determine if outcomes are distinguishable from a hypothetical process generating that outcome.<p>tl; dr; I like the article, but it seems to answer it&#x27;s own headline with &quot;yes&quot; and it is much easier to answer it with &quot;no&quot;. There is, philosophically speaking, nothing that we can guarantee looks random from all perspectives.')
