I commented here a few times about how I grew up with my parents who are avid listeners to RFA, VOA, DVB, and BBC (channel specific to my country). Since we have military dictatorship back then, we trusted RFA, VOA more than our government&#x27;s TV channels. I left for college in the US and learned who are feeding the news for VOA, RFA, DVB and where they are getting funding from, then I realized they are not that reliable news sources (and can be regarded as propaganda machines for people with vested interests).<p>If one listens to VOA&#x2F;RFA in my country, one would think that the US is a shining utopia and did nothing wrong in Iraq&#x2F;Afghan invasions (9&#x2F;11 just happened a few years before I left the country).<p>The truth is that there is no objective news outlet in the world (even &#x27;facts&#x27; fed to the unsuspecting reporters&#x2F;journalists are dubitable).')
