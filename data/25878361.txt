Like I said, I&#x27;m guessing that they decided it was a static page on a public CDN first, so now it&#x27;s hard to add an authenticating proxy on each CDN node.  If they wanted auth from the start, then it wouldn&#x27;t be a static page sitting on a CDN node, and it would be easy to add.  (But harder to scale to a CDN, and thus we&#x27;d see a lot of Github Pages sites slashdotted or whatever.)<p>I could easily be completely wrong about this.  But it&#x27;s interesting, to me, to consider the order that features were requested, and how that affects future feature requests.  Sometimes you paint yourself in a corner and make easy things hard.  Something to think about as you plan your own software!')
