The first shooting came after an argument between leftists escalated. No vehicle involved.<p>&gt;The second shooting does not have a clear connection to the protest occupants. The Police chose not to help the shooting victim (and the reason for the shooting is unknown).<p>Wrong again, it is directly linked because it happened when the protest occupants were marching back from a protest around city hall. Protestors blocked the police and firefighters from entering the area, and once the police made headway, the victim was already moved.<p>&gt;The third shooting (which occurred outside of the zone) appears to be racially motivated, and according to the victim was allegedly at the hands of a white supremacist. It&#x27;s unclear if this is related to the second shooting.<p>Wrong, it was a Black leftist&#x2F;anarchist that shot himself.<p>&gt;The sixth and seventh shootings were of two teens who had reportedly driven an SUV through the crowds overnight, including through the park.<p>Driving a vehicle that was a different make and model, but similar color, and they were killed for it. Two Black teens died because CHOP security extra-judicially shot and killed them because they were misidentified.<p>Two teens, killed in a no-cop-zone, by &quot;community security&quot;, during a protest that was started due to the extra-judicial killings of Blacks... May have been the most ironic moment of 2020.<p>So, on my counting there were seven shootings:<p>None of them were racially motivated.<p>All have direct links to the protest.')
