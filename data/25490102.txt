While I&#x27;m bullish on cryptocurrency in general, Bitcoin itself seems to have proven it self a very poor as banking system.<p>- There&#x27;s high transaction fees, making small transactions unrealistic<p>- It takes quite a while for transactions to be verified. If I&#x27;m paying for something on a site I don&#x27;t want to wait 10 minutes for the payment to be confirmed.<p>- There&#x27;s inherent scalability limits with the design of bitcoin, that can&#x27;t be overcome without forking the network to use a different algorithm.<p>While I think the idea of cryptographically secured, decentralized banking is immensely useful, it seems like Bitcoin itself will inevitably trail to zero as better, more scalable networks are created.<p>Are the Bitcoin rallies simply driven by investors with short term goals? Are investors investing in Bitcoin the brand, banking on network forks to fix the scalability problems? Or is there another reason I&#x27;m missing?')
