Another true story to add to this one. I (like many Sun cohorts) loved the burritos at La Coste√±a market, and we had adopted the FAX trick from Adobe.<p>Then along came the &quot;Distributed Objects Everywhere&quot; project (which invented CORBA) and they wanted an example application so they created &quot;BurritoTool&quot; which used CORBA to find the server that was connected to the fax line, and a nice WYSIWYG window to select your burrito condiments. Everyone loved it, it was a great tool and we all used it.<p>Then one day we show up and they tell us they have turned off their fax machine. We asked why, and they show us faxes for burrito orders that started coming in at 6AM and went non-stop until they turned it off. Some seemed legit but many were clearly not from someone who knew the place.<p>We go back to the office and do some snooping and see a bunch of requests to the burrito server in the wee hours before anyone is at work. We trace the IP address to a hotel in New York city. We call the Hotel and as it turns out Sun Sales is hosting an event and one of the things they are showing off at the &quot;pavilion&quot; is our cool distributed object technology. And using Burritotool! But CORBA has done its job and when it hadn&#x27;t been told there was a local burrito server it sent packets back to HQ and found the one in the systems group lab. Starting at 9AM eastern and going all morning long, people had been making random burrito orders as part of the demo code!')
