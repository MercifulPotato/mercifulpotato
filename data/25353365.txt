Corporate surveillance can, should, and <i>must</i> be resisted.<p>It is perhaps worth considering carefully if exposing most people to surveillance they are not equipped to defend against from lots of entities (such as with typical DNS) is an improvement over something like Oblivious DoH. It might even offer some protection against some totalitarian governments in some cases.<p>Again, you&#x27;re completely right. Protecting people from corporate surveillance is very important!
