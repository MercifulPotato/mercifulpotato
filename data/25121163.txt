I started programming with QBasic in my teens and so I just would do so fun with the random generator.\nWhen you set the SCREEN 16 (640x480 16colors) use the first random number for the X position, the second for Y, the third random number just generate, but don&#x27;t use and random number 4 is for the color 0-16. Then just draw a point and loop. The result is a picture with just diagonal lines. The line borders are a bit blurry, but else really straight, no curves or other artefacts.\nThe third random numer was for circle size, as I said, I learnd programming with it.')
