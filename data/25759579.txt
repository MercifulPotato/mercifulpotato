Otherwise, what&#x27;s the alternative?<p>&gt; Do these people have social problems<p>I have a theory split in two parts:<p>1) Because it&#x27;s online&#x2F;remote and anonymous: I think that in 99% of the cases, when face-to-face, the toxic persons wouldn&#x27;t even dare to say what they say online.<p>2) I learnt that most of the times toxic persons are in the 15-25 years olds range. They are just kids that do not know any better. If a 15 years old kid starts to insult me in the street, I&#x27;ll just ignore him. It&#x27;s just a kid.')
