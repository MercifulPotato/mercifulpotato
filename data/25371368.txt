In that same presentation Yusaku Maezawa later seems to confirm that he is paying 5% of the Starship development costs [1], but it could be something lost in translation.<p>5% of $5 billion is $250 million (and of $10 billion is $500 million). Maezawaâ€™s contributions are all going directly toward [developing Starship into an operational system] [2]<p>Given he&#x27;s taking himself and 6-8 artists plus 1-2 crew members. It&#x27;s hard to believe he&#x27;s paid just $250 million. That would probably make NASA very angry given they&#x27;re paying $400 million per launch for Crew Dragon to carry 4 people.<p>I know its not a direct source, but the above analysis suggests he&#x27;s paying several hundred million dollars for the Dear Moon project. $500 million is a reasonable estimate. Though I suspect that&#x27;s on the low side.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0q2gUWTcLRI?t=4313" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0q2gUWTcLRI?t=4313</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com.au&#x2F;yusaku-maezawa-zozo-ceo-resigns-sells-yahoo-spacex-starship-flight-2019-9?r=US&amp;IR=T" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com.au&#x2F;yusaku-maezawa-zozo-ceo-r...</a>')
