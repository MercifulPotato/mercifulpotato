But other than its “elegance”, I don’t hold reactive programming in particularly high regard, especially when implemented on top of non-pure languages. I consider FRP a “clever” technique - and while “clever” techniques make programming a fun puzzle, they can be detrimental to performance and end-user experience.<p>We have a finite cleverness budget; if you spend it on your code, then your product will suffer. If you build cleverness into the platform SDKs (hello SwiftUI! hello J2EE design pattern hell!), then <i>every product</i> on your platform will suffer.')
