You didn&#x27;t know?<p>I think your 5% number is right on point. There are almost 4 million software developers in the US. Company-specific numbers are hard to come by, but estimating, Facebook only has a few thousand developers - Goldman Sachs has approximately 9000 and several sources say FB has &quot;less.&quot; Netflix has less than 9,000 employees <i>total</i> and I think it&#x27;s unlikely a huge percentage of those are developers. Google has less than 30k (and that&#x27;s assuming 100% of R&amp;D and Ops groups are engineers). Microsoft has about 40k. Even adding a bit to each of these estimates, you&#x27;re looking at <i>maybe</i> 110,000 developers at FAANG companies themselves. Let&#x27;s double that to account for other companies (mostly finance) that will pay comparably - it&#x27;s certainly less. That&#x27;s about 5.5%.<p>And you touch on stock price which I think is super important. This isn&#x27;t cash compensation. It&#x27;s massive stock grants which are subject to losses. If some black swan event happens and one of the FAANGs goes out of business there are going to be a lot of bankrupt principal and staff engineers. Doctors don&#x27;t have that problem because their $500k is W2 cash compensation.<p>The median software engineer salary is somewhere around $100-110k. Half the developers in the US don&#x27;t even make six figures.')
