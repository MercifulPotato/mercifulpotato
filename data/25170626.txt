The one that Graviton2 is going up against is the 64-core Epyc 7742 (or any of the other Zen 2 7nm Epycs).<p>And you can&#x27;t call Graviton2 110W when you need 50% more of them vs. everyone else, and you can&#x27;t ignore the power from the rest of the system. You need 50% more machines. That&#x27;s going to be equivalent if not more total power usage for Graviton2 than Epyc 7742 for equivalent compute performance. Baseline power usage of a server is fairly high. It&#x27;s not the rounding error it is on a laptop or even desktop.<p>EDIT: also as far as comforting thoughts go, manufacturing 50% more machines is <i>vastly</i> more environmental impactful than the power difference.<p>&gt; I am not sure what your point is, anyway. As a business customer, if it is going to cost me 30% less money to run the same workload regardless of the ISA, I will take it.<p>I&#x27;m saying that 30% less cost is a temporary fantasy since all signs point to the Graviton2 being more expensive to manufacturer &amp; deploy vs. the competition. If you&#x27;re not coupled to ISA, sure take it while it lasts. Why not be subsidized by Amazon for a bit? But if you&#x27;re talking long-term trends, which we are, it&#x27;s not a pretty picture. Pace of improvement isn&#x27;t compelling, either. The CPU core in the N1 is basically a Cortex A76. ARM claims a 20% increase in IPC going from an A76 to an A77. Not bad. But AMD just delivered a 20% IPC increase going from Zen 2 to Zen 3, too. So... the gap ain&#x27;t shrinking.<p>Although 30% less per instance but you need 50% more instances also doesn&#x27;t work out. That ends up being overall more expensive. Depending on your workload that it might be even less close. In things like PostgreSQL &amp; OpenSSL graviton2 gets absolutely slaughtered.')
