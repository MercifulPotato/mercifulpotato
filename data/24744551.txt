It was slower on all speed benchmarks.</i><p>Chrome when released on September 2008 had the faster Javascript v8 engine. (Built by Lars Bak team in Denmark.)  The improved performance was very noticeable on js heavy websites like Google Maps when scrolling the map and zooming in and out.<p>A paper[1] showing Chrome winning on various performance benchmarks matches my recollection of performance differences.<p>Also, Chrome&#x27;s per-process isolation for each tab also made it more stable when dealing with buggy websites (bad javascript code leaking memory).  Firefox would crash more often.  The tradeoff was that Chrome used a lot more RAM than Firefox.<p>[I didn&#x27;t downvote your comment.]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peerj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cs-28.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peerj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cs-28.pdf</a>')
