However, DSPD is characterized as delayed sleep...not less sleep. As long as you&#x27;re getting sufficient sleep and feel rested when you do sleep, I don&#x27;t think it matters when you do it as it relates to this issue.<p>As someone who&#x27;s dealt with DSPD in his 20s, I&#x27;ll refrain from advice. I got no end of people telling me to exercise more, drink less caffeine, or any number of things like I hadn&#x27;t desperately tried everything. My personal experience was that it naturally got easier in my late 30s, but the less I fought it and the more I worked around it the better I felt.
