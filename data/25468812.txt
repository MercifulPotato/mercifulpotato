The forest I live by has, even at peak occupancy, more people sized animals than people.  It makes thermal imaging through a dense canopy difficult at best.  A good friend spent 2 years as a coast guard pilot stationed near me, and he spent the majority of his time doing SAR training.  He was the one to describe the issues with thermal imaging above the canopy.  We discussed using drones at length, and his main issue was the risk that they might randomly enter his flight path and damage a rotor.  Operating below the canopy would eliminate this risk.')
