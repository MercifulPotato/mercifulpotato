It must be the default, else the non-technically inclined will often end up not using e2ee.<p>&gt;As much as I dislike to admit it, this leaves Matrix, and nothing else.<p>I&#x27;m in the same position. Never been a fan, but I have to support it, because that&#x27;s really the only option, even if bloated.<p>I also tried running a server (synapse) with similar results. I have hopes for dendrite, but they&#x27;ve just been dampened by your report.<p>Fortunately, the client side is far more important, and there&#x27;s some options there. Particularly, the web-based hydrogen is massively less resource-hungry than the web-based element, and nearly there featureset-wise.<p>&gt;XMPP<p>I didn&#x27;t even list that one, because e2ee is not the default, and support was added way too late in the protocol&#x27;s trajectory.<p>&gt;Signal<p>I mentioned it, but I&#x27;m actually not about to use it. The reason is that accounts are tied to phone lines. That&#x27;s a non-starter for me.')
