Item(by='lordgrenville', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602671706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774739, text='Tangentially, there&#x27;s a great bit in Patti Smith&#x27;s book <i>M Train</i> about joining a society dedicated to Wegener&#x27;s memory:<p>&gt; Formed in the early 1980s by a Danish meteorologist, the Continental Drift Club is an obscure society serving as an independent branch of the earth-science community. Twenty-seven members, scattered across the hemispheres, have pledged their dedication to the perpetuation of remembrance, specifically in regard to Alfred Wegener, who pioneered the theory of continental drift. The bylaws require discretion, attendance at the biannual conferences, a certain amount of applicable fieldwork, and a reasonable passion for the club’s reading list. All are expected to keep abreast of the activities of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, in the city of Bremerhaven in Lower Saxony.<p>&gt; I was granted membership of the CDC quite by accident. On the whole, members are primarily mathematicians, geologists, and theologians and are identified not by name but by a given number. I had written several letters to the Alfred Wegener Institute searching for a living heir in hopes of obtaining permission to photograph the great explorer’s boots. One of my letters was forwarded to the secretary of the Continental Drift Club, and after a flurry of correspondence I was invited to attend their 2005 conference in Bremen, which coincided with the 125th anniversary of the great geoscientist’s birth and thus the 75th of his death. I attended their panel discussions, a special screening at City 46 of Research and Adventure on the Ice, a documentary series containing rare footage of Wegener’s 1929 and 1930 expeditions, and joined them for a private tour of the AWI facilities in nearby Bremerhaven. I am certain I didn’t quite meet their criteria, but I suspect that after some deliberation they welcomed me due to my abundance of romantic enthusiasm. I became an official member in 2006, and was given the number 23.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;music&#x2F;2015&#x2F;sep&#x2F;27&#x2F;patti-smith-m-train-extract-its-not-so-easy-writing-about-nothing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;music&#x2F;2015&#x2F;sep&#x2F;27&#x2F;patti-smith-m-...</a>')
