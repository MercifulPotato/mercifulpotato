Hundreds of thousands of people are dead because of those lies, and they were broadcast from coast to coast by every credible news media organisation in existence. The same organisations now being lauded as the bearers of ultimate truth.<p>What &quot;lie&quot; led us into the Gulf War?  Are you claiming that Iraq did not in fact invade and conquer Kuwait?<p>And what about the stuff about Iraqi WMDs?  I&#x27;m obviously not claiming that lying was invented in the last few years, so pointing out some lie that gained traction in the past doesn&#x27;t really challenge anything I said.<p>&gt; When the next set of lies is rolled out to land us in another unending conflict, I would quite like the internet to be a place where information can freely flow. My fear of governments is far greater than my fear of kooky people on the internet.<p>There&#x27;s a good chance that the kind of freely flowing information I&#x27;m talking about will likely just lead you to a <i>different lie</i>.  If the truth (or interpretations approaching the truth) is a needle in a haystack, it&#x27;s unlikely that many people will actually ever find it.  That&#x27;s a problem.')
