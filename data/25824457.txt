Prices can vary widely procedure to procedure because they are associated with over or under representation of certain factors within that pool. For example, grossly simplified, I might have a particular service line, hip replacements (an ortho program). The insurer whose patient population is going to &#x27;keep the lights on&#x27; in that service line is going to see a very different rate per service than a different insurer who rarely has patients that need it. Nothing about these prices shown are really reflective of the costs of doing the procedure such as pricing in a retail store.<p>I do think this transparency initiative will result in more consistent costs but not necessarily net lower costs.<p>Comparisons to other countries that are smaller than the united states are somewhat apples to oranges. There are a lot of factors that are glossed over when someone says &quot;costs are 5x higher in the US than my country&quot; including real estate, energy subsidy, and so on. Its a deep well.')
