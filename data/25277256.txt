This form of document doesn&#x27;t seem to be very useful for people who want to use the language.<p>Both WASM and javascript docs do this, and it is also the same here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c9x.me&#x2F;compile&#x2F;doc&#x2F;il.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c9x.me&#x2F;compile&#x2F;doc&#x2F;il.html</a><p>I think LLVM&#x27;s IR document is not easy to read, this one is not better.<p>I don&#x27;t want to reimplement a compiler for the IR language, I want to know how to use it, how to generate code using it. I need to see examples, i.e. how to implement threading, coroutine, weakly typed variables, reflection ... not the BNF.')
