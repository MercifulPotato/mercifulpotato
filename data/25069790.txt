But the options I can think of are not great.<p>Uploading an entire list of cached resources probably isn&#x27;t feasible (and probably not possible or a privacy concern).<p>You could maybe do a bloom filter but probably still have privacy concerns.<p>There is a solution that mostly works. You can use cookies! A simple solution might be setting a cookie for the app version when you respond. On the next request you can avoid pushing resources that haven&#x27;t changed between the client&#x27;s last version and the current one. Or you can even try to set cookies for each asset, however I&#x27;m not sure that is a good strategy.<p>But this is still not perfect. The presence of the cookie doesn&#x27;t mean the resource was ever downloaded (maybe it was aborted partway though?) and things can get purged from the cache and the cookie has no way of knowing.<p>You can also try to do out-of-band info. For example storing in a database which resources the client has downloaded before and a bunch of heuristics to determine if they are likely still in the cache. But at the end of the day only the client knows that.<p>So the TL;DR is I&#x27;m not sure this is possible. You are looking for `required resources - cached resources` and since `cached resources` is sensitive and probably much larger it is way easier to do this computation on the client.<p>So TL;DR it might be possible but is very tricky. The current state-of-the art isn&#x27;t anywhere near a perfect solution.')
