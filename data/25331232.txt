I&#x27;m very open so I examined several so-called proofs of alternative history. Unfortunately, in all cases they can be explained in more traditional ways, or were a fabrication like the crystal skulls. This doesn&#x27;t mean that we haven&#x27;t been visited by alien civilizations, but as far as I can tell we don&#x27;t really have any definitive proof. Unless we equate aliens with gods - but even then the only artifacts we have are just scriptures.')
