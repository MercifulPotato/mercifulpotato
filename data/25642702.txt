Item(by='krackers', descendants=None, kids=[25642729, 25642732], score=None, time=1609827128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25642554, text='Related to this, but why do people claim that the memristor is a &quot;fundamental&quot; circuit element? It seems to me that it&#x27;s just a generalization of a resistor where the resistance depends on the integral of the current. There are already all sorts of circuit components that have the property where the resistance is a function of X, so why is the memristor particularly deserving of its own class?<p>Unless I&#x27;m missing something the flux-charge equation that &quot;dPhi = M dq&quot; seems to be the same as that of the resistor as well (since dPhi = vdt we have vdt = Mdq =&gt; v = M*i which is just ohm&#x27;s law assuming a constant M).')
