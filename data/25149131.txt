However, for the last few months i&#x27;ve been using Geany [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geany.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geany.org&#x2F;</a>], based on many positive comments i had read elswhere that it comes closest to notepad++. So, I&#x27;m running Geany on my work machine (windows), and any&#x2F;all of my personal linux machines. While Geany is amazing, it is not as good as notepad++ (in only a few small ways); though it really does comes the closest that i&#x27;ve seen compared to other text editors.  Plus, it runs natively across windows, linux, and mac!  I have no wish to persuade you to switch if you&#x27;ve already found a notepad++ alternative. But, if it helps you, i&#x27;ve grown to really love geany.  And, as much as i still love notepad++, i yanked out notepad++ from my work windows machine and only run geany.  I do this because i now have a consistent, unified experience (for my text editor) regardless of the OS, which is important to me.  So, again, not trying to persuade, but if you haven&#x27;t, give Geany a look-see.  Good luck!<p>EDIT: I failed to add that...i&#x27;ve heard folks suggest running some sort of emulation layer or maybe Wine on linux in order to run notepad++...but for me, needing to run some extra layer for a text editor just didn&#x27;t sit right with me.  YMMV')
