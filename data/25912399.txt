Well done.<p>But don&#x27;t pretend that that means everyone can do it, because patently they can&#x27;t: you won your bets, a bunch of other people lost theirs. No value that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have been created got made, you just shifted the balance of how the rewards are distributed in your favor, and away from someone else.<p>As a system for distributing the benefits of economic production, allocating it to the winners of a complex iterated social game seems suboptimal. Like if we used &#x27;Among Us&#x27; tournaments to distribute food.<p>But hey, glad it&#x27;s working out for you.')
