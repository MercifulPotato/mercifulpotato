I&#x27;m supposed to own an API at work, but I never really understood how to learn an API. Do you type out the functionality in text? Do you draw a flow diagram? Do you keep things at a class level or dive down into functions and variables? The bright side is that this API isn&#x27;t very big, so I do want to use this as an opportunity to really learn it and also learn how to approach studying API&#x27;s in general.')
