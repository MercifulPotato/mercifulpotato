You can write down the recurrence relation:<p><pre><code>  a_(n+2) = a_(n+1) + a_n\n</code></pre>\nObserve that there is a linear solution space (I.e. if you add solutions point wise or multiply each value by the same scalar, you get solutions), and the values a_0 and a_1 are sufficient to determine the sequence. Now guess that a_n = k^n is a solution:<p><pre><code>  k^2 = k + 1\n  (k - 1&#x2F;2)^2 = 5&#x2F;4\n  k = (1 +&#x2F;- sqrt(5))&#x2F;2\n  k = φ or -1&#x2F;φ, where φ is the golden ratio\n</code></pre>\nDue to linearity, there are a family of solutions a_n = Rφ^n + S(-1&#x2F;φ)^n for any values of R and S. Because this family provides a solution for any choices of a_0 and a_1, it contains all the solutions.<p>Because |1&#x2F;φ|&lt;1, we find that asymptotically a_n ~ Rφ^n as n grows. Therefore the ratio of terms tends to φ in the limit.')
