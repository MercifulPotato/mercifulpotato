I suspect that in most cases companies will see that as cheaper than having to pay an open source library developer, who is not an employee, to maintain an open source library that is not under the company&#x27;s control. So if the open source developer isn&#x27;t donating their work for free, the companies probably won&#x27;t end up using it at all.')
