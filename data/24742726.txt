The first time was Keto+OMAD, after reading Michael Mosley&#x27;s Fast 800 book (which advocates a less restrictive diet but in the same vein). Result: -8 kg in 8 weeks. Also my weight was mostly stable after that, eventually trending up as my discipline waned. I have also seen up close two people suffering type 2 diabetes get it under control with the rapid weight loss afforded by this method.<p>Now, a year later, I am doing 8 hour eating window (not Keto) and am sticking to it for the long-term. I simply don&#x27;t enjoy breakfast. Never have really. Not eating it appears to give me more stable energy and concentration for both intellectual and physical tasks, both before and after &quot;lunch&quot;: a raw oats &amp; berries breakfast anywhere between midday and 4 PM depending. I also run 5 km every second day, heavy weights once a week. Reuslt: -0.75 kg&#x2F;week averaged over many months. Now my weight is somewhat stable at a healthy weight.<p>I wholly accept that this is most likely de-facto calorie restriction and not the wonders of TRE per se. Early in Fast 800 Dr Mosley addresses diet adherence and it is widely believed that this is the single biggest factor impacting diet for weight (fat) loss success.<p>With respect to cellular regeneration, I like the story but the only sources I&#x27;ve found (and they&#x27;re not scientific so do your own searching) is that this process <i>starts</i> at about 16 hours of fasting. It really peaks around 3-4 days of fasting, which is a whole different thing. I have started doing occasional 2 day fasts and want to say it&#x27;s do-able by normal people, but so far it appears TRE won&#x27;t get you anything like it.')
