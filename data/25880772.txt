If you can put a big telescope on Moon, you can put several in Earth orbit or put one much bigger one.<p>Having capability to stage on the Moon would be interesting, especially if fuel can be made on the moon. It would be easier on human bodies and you have access to lot of resources. If you can find water and decent metals, that&#x27;s a pretty good spot to fuel your rockets.')
