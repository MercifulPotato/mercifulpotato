A swappable battery means that you can just take off the cover and change the battery, without needing any tool.  That&#x27;s not the case here (at least it&#x27;s not marked as having that feature). Instead an iFixit guide is linked with &#x27;moderate&#x27; difficulty (unlike others that are very difficult, then I wouldn&#x27;t even try). Maybe that definition of a swappable battery is not universal and should be explained on the page?')
