If their website&#x2F;service disappeared off the face of the earth tomorrow, would I still have access to my passwords locally?<p>I&#x27;m still hesitant to use any form of password management that relies on cloud services.  I still like Keepass (with auto-updates disabled for security because their updater uses HTTP, of course), for my purposes.  I can Sync my keepass file any number of secure ways that don&#x27;t rely on a single provider.')
