Sometimes I wonder if that&#x27;s the natural incidence or if it is in fact a cancer cluster caused by remnants of Cobalt-60.<p>That is such an interesting and scary thing about it. It is really hard, and takes a lot of careful data collection, to figure out how much cancer is &quot;normal&quot; everyday cancer from smoking, genetics, voodoo curses; and how much is actually &quot;extra&quot; cancer from possible radiation exposure. It would be especially difficult on something as small scale as a neighborhood block, since random variation of even one or two extra or fewer people unlucky enough to get “natural” cancer could completely skew an analysis attempt.')
