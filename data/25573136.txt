Item(by='memetherapy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609266961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25572838, text='I&#x27;m afraid you have it backwards if you think the UK government were &quot;desperate to negotiate everything in one go&quot;. &quot;Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed&quot; was a core principle of the EU negotiating guidelines[1] on the withdrawal agreement and was precisely what the UK were trying to avoid. The UK strategy was to try and cherry pick, or in the words of Boris, have our cake and eat it. This tendency was so strong among the British negotiators that &quot;cakeism&quot; is now a genuine term used across the continent to describe the tactics of an unreasonable negotiating partner who doesn&#x27;t understand the need to make trade offs. I&#x27;d say it was amusing watching the Rupert&#x27;s and their admirers screw up so badly and then pretend they&#x27;ve won a glorious victory except I actually have to live in this country.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consilium.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;press&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;29&#x2F;euco-brexit-guidelines&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consilium.europa.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;press&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2017...</a>')
