It isn&#x27;t something I look at one line at a time, I read it in structural blocks, almost a breadth-first reading. I see the if&#x2F;else statement and structure before I see any of the details of each branch. It&#x27;s a deeply non-linear process of going up and down levels of abstraction where necessary, and ignoring details at lower levels that are irrelevant to the task at hand.')
