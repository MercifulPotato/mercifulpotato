The Mac Mini is basically a G4 Cube, just smaller. If you&#x27;re looking for the same dimensions as a Cube, the trashcan Mac Pro had nearly identical dimensions as a Cube, but as a cylinder.<p>I think it&#x27;s likely that we&#x27;ll see something similar to a Cube or trashcan Mac Pro in the future with M series chips. Apple was able to pack 130W Xeon chips into the trashcan Mac Pro. Seems reasonable to think that a Pro-class M series chip could fit within that power&#x2F;thermal range.  The new Mac Pros are 205W which probably necessitated moving away from the trashcan size. Given that the highest-end Mac Pro is around 2.5x faster than a Mac Mini while the Mac Mini is only around 10 watts, it seems like there&#x27;s a lot of room for Apple to create a Mac Pro without dialing up the heat too much.<p>I guess I&#x27;m wondering: did you like the cube, but not the trashcan?')
