I managed to buy a <i>barely</i> used Aeron for less than $600.  It was pretty easy, although I already knew about the sizing issue.<p>Have you been able to compare the Leap V2 side by side with the Aeron?  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m quite ready to trade in my Aeron yet, but, if there&#x27;s a chair out there that&#x27;s actually better than the Aeron, then I want to know about it. :-)')
