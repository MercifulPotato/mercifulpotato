I actually was about to suggest that the Java Hello World should work, but a quick perusal dismisses that.<p>Why <i>would</i> Google bother keeping the JVM class hierarchy if they were implementing a different VM to run against anyway? That just seems to be asking for trouble. I can sort of see some merit to Oracle&#x27;s argument now. It would be one thing if JVM byte code was treated as an Intermediary representation that then compiled to Dalvik... but it isn&#x27;t even really that.<p>Damn, Google stepped in it. Hard.<p>Edit: Further research indicates Java Byte code is an intermediate representation compiled to Dalvik; so technically the Java Hello World would work coming out in Dalvik (or Android Runtime). So... Back to being confused again, because clearly, even if Google did copy pasta the Java APIs the end machine they are driving is drastically different; I.e., System.out.println() would generate no visible output on Android.<p>So I&#x27;m really back in Google&#x27;s camp, Oracle is trying to copyright a steering wheel.')
