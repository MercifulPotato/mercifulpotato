It&#x27;s not like they say it&#x27;s flat and stick their fingers in their ears. They respond with plausible-sounding retorts that, while obviously untrue, often make sense in isolation. For everyone else, the explanation of &quot;the earth is round and gravity goes brr&quot; is far less cognitively intensive than all the mental gymnastics flat earthers engage in.')
