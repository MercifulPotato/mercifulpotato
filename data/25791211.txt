Sure I will start with the manufacture recommended placement if my room allows, but at the end of the day <i>I</i> have to hear the speakers so if it sounds good it is good rules for me. There really is no wrong if you like what you hear. Sure a rear port placed an inch from the wall will alter the response and likely cause chuffing as the air rushes in and out, but that falls under common sense to some degree. I guess one of the core tenets of “hifi” used to be flat frequency response from 20hz-20khz and no added coloration from the reproduction system. That’s fine but often times today’s music sounds crappy under those parameters. People like hyped bass and treble with a scooped midrange. That’s okay. \nThe parameters shift slightly when using studio monitoring to create a mix for music that needs to translate to other playback environments but even then a perfectly flat response is not necessary. If you know that your monitors are bass shy and increasing the bass will make it sound muddy on the majority of other systems then that is a data point you keep in mind. Learning the quirks of your monitoring setup is very important in this scenario. The point being that the guidelines are a starting point, not the rule.')
