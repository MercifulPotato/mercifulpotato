I agree that daily practice changes everything in terms of progress — one trick (suggested by my teacher) is to always have the instrument out of its box&#x2F;carrying bag and ready to play. You will tend to pick it up (even randomly during the day) much more.<p>As for teaching, I found an amazingly kind, patient and talented sax teacher before the pandemic and went to her studio once a week. We’ve since transitioned to online teaching and although there are of course things that you need to adapt to (switching from facetime to skype to another device mid class because it’s echo cancelling the song you’re trying to play over), it’s really great.<p>Her academic &#x2F; professionaly trained ear picks up all of the problems I’m not aware of. And her guidance and praise keeps me motivated. She comes up with new exercises knowing what will interest me (I’m learning almost exclusively by ear), suggests great new songs, etc.<p>I highly recommend reaching out to your teacher and asking if lessons are offered online.<p>And anyone looking for an amazing sax teacher, contact me. (No affiliation ha. Just lots of praise for this amazing person)')
