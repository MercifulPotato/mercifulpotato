Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607569292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368795, text='It is a cliche that conservatives, who fare poorly both in urban areas and among the minorities who disproportionately live in those areas, accuse Detroit, Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Philadelphia of voter fraud. Nevertheless, no real evidence of fraud is produced; in fact, the rare cases we do see of actual voter fraud tend to be committed by older Republican voters.<p>The reason for this is simple: voter fraud is a stupid crime. It&#x27;s hard enough to convince people that it&#x27;s worth their time to add their real voice to the cacophony of voices being recorded on election day. To risk imprisonment to add a couple more voices makes no sense.<p>This has been a conservative trope for decades. If there was any substance to it, you should have no trouble coming up with concrete examples within the last 20 years of material voter fraud being detected in Detroit, Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. You can&#x27;t, because there isn&#x27;t any.<p>What the affidavits attached to these ludicrous but high-profile lawsuits instead provide is suppositions, like &quot;suspicious&quot; swings from certain levels of Clinton support to different levels of Biden support (it&#x27;s almost like they&#x27;re... different people!), or worse, batshit conspiracy theories, like the guy named &quot;Spyder&quot; who ran a SpiderFoot scan on Dominion Voting Systems and got dunked on by the author of SpiderFoot for not understanding the results. Or the woman who testified in Michigan, with the President&#x27;s personal lawyer sitting next to her, who believes the Obamas funded the secret Wuhan lab where Coronavirus was created.<p>Liberals have their own problems and blind spots. But conservatives own this, and the travesty of the administration&#x27;s handling of its predictable loss in the 2020 general election, completely and absolutely.')
