Evidence of this is so easy to find, even partisan hacks can do it. It&#x27;s just that under Trump illegal border crossings became criminal, rather than civil, offences. You can&#x27;t take your kids to jail with you even if you aren&#x27;t Mexican, hence the &quot;separations&quot;. This is super easy to avoid: don&#x27;t cross the border illegally. The much publicized &quot;cages&quot;, however, were built under Obama. Nobody gave a shit back then. About 1K people were deported daily. I predict that more people will be deported under Biden as well, because it&#x27;s not &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;xenophobic&quot; for a democrat to deport 400K people a year.<p>The whole issue of crossing the border being a &quot;misdemeanor&quot; is idiotic IMO. I grew up in a country where it&#x27;s a felony, and you&#x27;d be lucky to not get shot if you cross the border illegally in either direction. If a country is to maintain its sovereignty, that&#x27;s how it has to be.')
