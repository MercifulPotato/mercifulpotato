But I think the downvotes are because it apprently isn&#x27;t possible on HN to have a discussion about any language without Rust evangelists appearing. We get it, it&#x27;s great and deserves it&#x27;s praise but doesn&#x27;t need to be mentioned everywhere. The topic also had nothing to do with language design.')
