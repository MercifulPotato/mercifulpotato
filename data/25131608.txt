Item(by='pgwhalen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605658247, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25131222, text='&gt; This is lacks a strong causal analysis.<p>FWIW I am also unconvinced by the article&#x27;s thesis that prediction markets &quot;beat&quot; polls.  But I&#x27;m not sure I agree with your premise that we need to ascribe causality if markets beat polls.  The &quot;point&quot; of markets is that they work in mysterious ways: the combination of financial incentives and the wisdom of the crowd coalesce to price things correctly.  You might be able to point out why a specific market participant has a specific opinion and makes a specific bet, but doing so for the entire market is a fool&#x27;s errand.')
