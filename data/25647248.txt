Think of it as a hybrid between HQ trivia and lootcrates. Once a month, people will compete in a live action concurrent game show using their cell phones. A portion will be phone input related challenges and another will be a live action portion recorded via phone using the items that were shipped to them. They will not know what items they are using and or how they will be used until the night of the event.<p>I have an MVP for the application in TestFlight and have done some video work in premiere&#x2F;after effects to try and create a video to be pitched on kickstarter. Just looking for someone who is passionate about the idea and thinks they could positively contribute.<p>If this interests you feel free to reply or dm on twitter in bio')
