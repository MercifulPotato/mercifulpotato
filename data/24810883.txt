The only link on that domain that matters is this one:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stallman.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2003-may-aug.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stallman.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2003-may-aug.html</a><p>And the only text on that page that matters is the disgusting text where Stallman says possession of child pornography should be legal:<p>&#x27;The nominee is quoted as saying that if the choice of a sexual partner were protected by the Constitution, &quot;prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia&quot; also would be. He is probably mistaken, legally--but that is unfortunate. All of these acts should be legal as long as no one is coerced. They are illegal only because of prejudice and narrowmindedness.&#x27;')
