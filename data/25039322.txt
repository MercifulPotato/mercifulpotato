But if you think of yourself as a builder, then you really ought to know better than to accept the world as it is.<p>Are there probably choices available to a skilled software developer where they could make more money than just working on something that they love and that provides value to the world? Sure. But why is that an acceptable world to live in?<p>If a work adds value to the world, shouldn&#x27;t the worker rightly feel entitled to just compensation? Sure, not everything in the world is as it should be, and as a responsible adult the worker may have to deal with that, they can&#x27;t just sit around whining about not getting their fair share and expect everyone else to solve their problems for them.<p>But are <i>YOU</i> someone who sees problems in the world and says &quot;yep, that&#x27;s how it is, deal with it, not my problem&quot;? Or are you someone who sees problems in the world as something to be fixed?')
