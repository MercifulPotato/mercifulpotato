Its just that I’ve come to recognize there are cases when downvotes are appropriate, and won’t lead to escalation, as well as cases where downvotes send the right signal and lead to overall constructive behavior. The downvotes I’ve received have helped me introspect and learn. Even if my immediate reaction wasn’t constructive, it has helped me become more constructive in the long run. I think I’ve seen this happen with others here. Without downvotes feeling harsh, I might not have worked as hard to see the positive in other comments and to say the positive in my own.')
