But at the same time, it&#x27;s almost useless for the time traveller. Imagine a man that suffered a terrible accident when we was 10 years old, and had a miserable life from that point on. When he is 60 time travel is possible, so he decides to travel 50 years back to prevent the accident. He succeeds, but this new timeline doesn&#x27;t mean the previous timeline won&#x27;t&#x2F;didn&#x27;t happen. This new him will have a better life but the other him will still be miserable.')
