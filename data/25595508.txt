Yes, it&#x27;s doable, and yes the video quality is much better. But the logistics of mounting a full sized camera, or even most mirrorless cameras, to a desk somewhere close to your monitor is surprisingly annoying.<p>While a separate webcam perched on top of your monitor produces lower quality, it comes with fewer tradeoffs when you&#x27;re not actively using it. I suspect that you need to be a professional streamer&#x2F;youtuber before the tradeoffs make it make sense.')
