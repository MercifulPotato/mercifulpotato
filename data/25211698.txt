Did he really think that GPT-3 was even capable of providing any sort of &quot;considered&quot; response?<p>&gt; Conclusion\n&gt; \n&gt; We can only speculate as to GPT-3&#x27;s internal states. \n&gt; Perhaps it knows the question perfectly well, but considers \n&gt; humans as too immature and spoiled to tell: In its opinion, \n&gt; we shouldn’t even bother to find questions to answers we \n&gt; can’t possible understand. Or, more likely, it doesn’t know \n&gt; either. Anyway, it comes across as a jerk.')
