The Capitol mob was a portion of the most hard-core who travelled to D.C. this late after the election to show support for what exactly?<p>This is wholly independent of the issue of persistently casting doubt on the quality of the election since before the election, which obviously isn&#x27;t right.<p>Also the double-standard with more than 100 days of BLM protests -- that were often protests but also were often riots -- is kinda funny. Trump is involved so suddenly it&#x27;s domestic terrorism even though very little property was damaged, certainly not buildings burnt to the ground and people murdered in the street like we saw before.<p>The hyperbole on both sides really needs to be dialed down to 1. Noone has behaved themselves well throughout this presidency.')
