You are a public company who wants to increase the cost of development to your competitors so you can increase your market share. That&#x27;s it .<p>Maybe that is too cynical, but I recently went through a license shift (GPL to Apache) with TerminusDB and we were clear that honesty about motivation was the best formula for comms.')
