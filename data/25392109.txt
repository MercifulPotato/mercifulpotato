BUT the entity selling to a reseller needs to request and maintain a reseller license to prove that the sold goods went to a reseller with the intent of reselling. If you simply claim exemption from sales tax because you know you&#x27;re selling to resellers, and don&#x27;t manage reseller licenses, then you could be in for a world of hurt when audited (which happens much more frequently than it does with income taxes).')
