You are ascribing tone in your mind. Text is language and does not bring along gestures, facial expressions, or eye contact.. things your brain uses to detect tone and subtleties in the words<p>For instance based on this text your “tone” is combative, but I bet you are reading it in your mind with eye brows raised and hearing a different accent on syllables.  Maybe you would say that first sentence a little bit quieter to show compassion, but I’m reading it as if you had an attitude on the words “your tone is”')
