I just had a manager on my team bring up migrating away from them and our management chain was generally supportive.<p>I thought it was slightly ridiculous until I saw the suggested alternatives of &quot;allowlist&quot; and &quot;denylist&quot;.  These really are better terms: they&#x27;re completely self-describing and match the verbs that you&#x27;d usually be using when referencing a denylist.  Only downside is they don&#x27;t have the same number of letters (and so don&#x27;t line up if you put them one after another in code), but that can be worked around.')
