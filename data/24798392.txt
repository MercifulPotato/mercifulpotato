If you are using it as a metric I feel you are a poor judge.<p>In my experience, I have been unable to comply with the fizzbuzz questions in interviews - which has generally ended with me or the interviewer slowly closing the interview.<p>At the same time I was one of 2 people who built a major airlines checkin system within a couple of months.<p>The interview for this role? A phone call, after looking through my CV.<p>The roles which asked me fizz buzz? generic roles in companies that since went nowhere, I even got a callback telling me the technical hiring manager had since been fired ( or left ) and if I would re consider interviewing, which I then had to turn down.<p>I am not saying you are wrong, I am probably wrong to judge a person if they are assessing my years of experience with a test aimed at an 18 year old.<p>But be aware of how fizzbuzz makes some developers react.')
