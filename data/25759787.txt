Ignore them, ban them, etc. Don’t let ANY of that bit of animated shit pukes that mumble like they’re semi conscious bags of bird shit bother you.<p>2nd point. It’s ok to say no. Proof in point, I’ve been running jsonip.com for 11 years. Service supports many many millions of requests a month. Completely free.<p>I’m lucky, I don’t frequently get any hate mail or “add this new thing asshole” for the service. But any time I have over the last 11 years, I’ve directly told those people to shove it if they’ve been rude or demanding.<p>They’re using my service for free. I’m paying for this out of pocket. Fuck you if you think you can abuse me.<p>Just to round out, since I’m obviously very suave about language and what not, stop being nice. Stop letting a lot of free loaders ruin your day and kill your mood and passion by treating you badly.<p>There is an equivalent to the no shoes, no shirt, no mask policy and retail store has for online stores and OSS projects. If the user&#x2F;customer can’t adhere to extremely basic human decency norms, they don’t get to play. You tell them to fuck off and go away, then move on with helping people that actually give a shit and are nice.')
