If it&#x27;s a speed bump - I&#x27;m not interested in paying for someone else&#x27;s luxury. If you want luxury - go ahead and purchase it.<p>Also, if we&#x27;re going to government sponsor access to High-speed internet, we should convert internet service providers to a government service as well.<p>How does it make sense for tax payers to pay for internet service hardware and have corporations come in and make profit off of it?')
