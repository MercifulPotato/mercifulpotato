Copyright is not like an AGPL software license that claims&#x2F;poisons everything it touches.<p>The NN is not an artistic work and probably should not be considered a derivative work any more than your brain or memory of a copyrighted work should be considered a derivative work. Likewise, the outputted work of a NN is not automatically a derivative work any more than the work of an artist that has been inspired by other artists&#x27; copyrighted content is. That&#x27;s just not how copyright works.')
