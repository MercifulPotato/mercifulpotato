I strongly disagree. Even when the public health types corrected course, their behavior left a bad taste in my mouth. There was no acknowledgement of having been wrong, no introspection on how their errors came to be, no discussion how they could be avoided in the future. Just aggressive enforcement of the new party line couched in appeals to authority. The whole enterprise reeks of blind dogmatism.')
