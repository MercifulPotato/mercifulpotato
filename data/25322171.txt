I learned eventually that the goal of a philosophy degree was not to find &quot;truth&quot;, but to learn about the myriad arguments and models people had for &quot;truth&quot;, and how to critique and understand truth.<p>If you&#x27;re on your journey to developing your personal philosophy, then a basic understanding of philosophy will help you escape pitfalls and traps a lot of annoying armchair philosophizers fall into. A lot of people read a single philosopher and think they understand everything.<p>What is your goal for developing your personal philosophy? It might be faster and more meaningful for most people to start with theology&#x2F;spirituality, books on justice (Rawls, Nozick, feminist literature), or carefully selected business books than to start from the basics because that road is long and full of fallacies.<p>I think it&#x27;s very important that for every philosophy you learn about, learn the critiques of those arguments. You kan&#x27;t learn about all the great critiques of Kant from reading Kant. This is where professors and peers are really useful with discussions to tease out nuances of particular arguments and models.<p>My personal favorite philosopher is Iris Marion Young. I think her work on intersecting democracy and feminism is wonderful.')
