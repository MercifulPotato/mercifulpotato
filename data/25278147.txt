You lower the energy barrier, the probability of crossing the barrier increases exponentially. Think about how GAA works. Makes no sense from the electrostatic perspective, right? All it’s doing is lowering the tunneling barrier from source to drain. The issue with size is the ratio of energy states in the interfaces between materials versus bulk crystal.')
