Unfortunately you still have to decode the instructions at least once first and that bottleneck is the one being discussed here.  This is all transparent to the OS and not visible outside a low level instruction cache though, which means you donâ€™t need a major OS change, but arguably if you were willing to take that hit you could go further here.')
