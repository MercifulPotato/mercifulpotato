There are other possible changes that might help, like removing the winner take all situation. But just basing on popular vote alone creates the same problem we&#x27;re in but from the other direction. We need cities but we also need the rural areas (like our farm lands) and we need to represent both. But rural areas will never have the population size&#x2F;density of cities. We shouldn&#x27;t let fly over states decide the elections just the same way we shouldn&#x27;t let California and New York decide them. There&#x27;s got to be a better solution here that provides good equity.')
