After taxes I could buy a really nice house for cash and have enough money left over to drive a new car for the rest of my life.<p>One option is life changing and the “ethical” side might not pay enough to buy a gaming PC.  Meanwhile the executives at the companies that claim security research needs ethics are making millions of dollars selling insecure apps.  It’s like a church asking poor people to tithe IMO.<p>I actually think it would be better if there were no laws regarding the sale of security exploits.  Everything should go onto an anonymous marketplace and the companies that have affected products should have to pair fair market value for bug discoveries.<p>Skimping on security and guilting researchers into being ethical is a total scam.')
