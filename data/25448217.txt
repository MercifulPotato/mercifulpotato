It is much easier to grind in a VR game for an hour than it is to grind on a treadmill for the same amount of time.<p>I have a Quest, the games suck, but the fitness experience is paradigm changing. Beat Saber was and still is the Quest&#x27;s killer app, but there are lot of similar games that keep the experience somewhat fresh (not to mention new beat saber music packs, I also use FitXR more than Beat Saber).<p>I bought my Quest back in May 2019, it died around June 2020, but I was already using it a couple of hours a day by then so had to get a new one from a scalper (during the Pandemic, Quest units were hard to get). I really don&#x27;t want to go back to life without it.')
