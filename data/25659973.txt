I don&#x27;t need stuff constantly moving. I guess the difference is that if its an in-person situation, then stuff moving around me is normal, but on screen it localizes everything to a small area: the screen. I also find animated stuff annoying in Discord channels and such, something I don&#x27;t use for work, only for fun.<p>I dunno. I haven&#x27;t tried it. For me, when I&#x27;m in a social situation (virtual or in person), I&#x27;m there for the people and want to focus on them, not some animated emoji. I can do those on my own.')
