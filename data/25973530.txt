Currently in South America (working at an ayahuasca retreat...my opinion on “drugs” may differ a bit :)) and enjoying coca tea almost daily. It’s allegedly a fairly nutrient-dense plant in its non-freebase form. I think it’s a huge misuse&#x2F;abuse of it as cocaine, and unfortunately I don’t know where that leaves us. People should be allowed the freedom to use any plant as they wish, it should all be decriminalized at the minimum. It’s a dangerous and slippery slope and I feel blessed never to have used it as cocaine personally.')
