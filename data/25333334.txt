He usually gets salient facts straight, then mixes those with useless and sometimes subtly wrong (or just wrong) filler, and occasionally paints the wrong picture from the facts he was told. Fortunately it’s usually not hard to pick out the facts that were leaked to him, and ignore whatever conclusions he drew personally.')
