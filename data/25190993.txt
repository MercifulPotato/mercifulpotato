It might be one of those mistakes you can only <i>truly</i> learn from by making it yourself, but honestly, while DIY is awesome for learning its only place in a business is at the core of what your business value is.<p>One way I think about it is anything DIY is surface area for either innovation, or mistakes. To mitigate the risk of making mistakes doing things DIY you&#x27;d better do it only in areas where innovation could actually benefit your core business value and give you magnified upside. If you innovate outside these areas, I guess it&#x27;s nice, but you&#x27;ve taken the risk of mistakes for no significant upside. Not to mention a whole load of work invested.')
