Especially true for IDE like features, such as auto-indent, auto-brackets stuff etc.<p>Another issue I run into, also due to a overly complex config, is that my hotkeys don&#x27;t work across OSes. I mostly work on a mac and use for instance crtl+shift and the arrow to move between tabs in vim. Those keys do different stuff on my linux machine and I can&#x27;t use them.')
