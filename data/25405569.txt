Facebook is always being grilled by politicians and the &quot;news&quot; because Wallstreet doesn&#x27;t control Facebook, while they control politicians and the &quot;news&quot;.<p>Look at this story for example. Are there scammers in the ads? Yes, all ad platforms will have some scammers. It&#x27;s always been the case and it will continue to happen because there&#x27;s benefit to scamming. Does FB take down scammers? Yes, constantly.<p>So, what is the news story? There is no news story. It&#x27;s just a negative hit piece to try to devalue the company so that Zuckerberg may be forced to sell more of his shares giving away his veto rights. When that happens, all of this will magically go away.')
