An iPhone 7 can still be updated to iOS 14 today, and assuming the battery has been replaced recently (which would be required for a long-lasting android phone as well) it&#x27;ll work extremely well as a daily driver for everything short of 3d gaming (and even then, games will just turn down graphics settings to achieve acceptable performance). As far as I could find, the earliest phone that has Android 11 is the pixel 2 from 2017 (rip pixel 1) and outside of the pixel lineup, you&#x27;re only guaranteed 2 years of OS updates <i>if</i> a phone is part of the Android One program[0].
