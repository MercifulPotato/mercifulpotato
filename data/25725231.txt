It has some encoding in law because it is such a valuable ideal, but no one should conflate the two and think that the ideal of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply unless the law says so. The law is not an ideal.<p>Access to legal representation is similarly an ideal that can&#x27;t be reduced to its partial encoding in a very flawed legal system.')
