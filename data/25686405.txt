And also I have worked elections before so I understand the basics of how they work. I am also not an American.<p>You are mostly referring to actual nonsense which was discussed and debunked in great detail in the over 100 post-election lawsuits that these doofuses lost. States (red and blue) and state officials responded to all of the criticisms in clear and convincing detail. Most of these boil down to the Republican party encouraging unqualified people to serve as poll watchers without training, and then whenever they didn&#x27;t understand routine election processes they jumped to the conclusion there was a vast conspiracy against them. You obviously were able to internalize the criticisms via osmosis or via your choice of media diet, but somehow were able to avoid either being able to refute the criticisms from first principles or actually seeking evidence for them.<p>One special note: Most of the observers removed were violating obvious and reasonable rules -- many of them were COVID deniers who felt if they couldn&#x27;t breathe maskless on poll workers their first amendment rights were being suppressed. At the time, many were yelling &quot;STOP THE COUNT&quot;, because the message of the night from the president on down was that it was illegal to count votes after polls closed.<p>I used ZERO hyperbole in my original comment. I didn&#x27;t even add any new information. All the stuff I said is documented in great detail in the lawsuit itself. It&#x27;s not hyperbole to say the people being sued believe any of this. If there is something you believe is not literally true, let me know and I&#x27;ll provide a source, but again the vast majority of this is directly documented in the suit that is the subject of this thread.')
