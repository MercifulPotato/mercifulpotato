The truth is the international political system is designed to be adversarial and fueled by lack of trust. To expect China or any country to suddenly &quot;de-rogue&quot; is naive.<p>There are countries that have done quite well with Covid. Taiwan comes to mind. Others could have done similar. But instead those others  put trust in a system of distrust; an unstable system that they actively contributed to and participated in. That&#x27;s not on China&#x27;s shoulders.<p>Furthermore. There were previous respiratory virus pandemics. Where were the lessons learned from that? The stockpile of masks? The stock pile of PPE?<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting China is innocent. But as governments go, it&#x27;s not alone in its guilt.')
