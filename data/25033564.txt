This is the point I believe we should be arguing.<p>Your representaiton of the article as a &#x27;declaration against encryption&#x27; somewhat undermines this argument, and polarises it into an &#x27;us vs them&#x27; debate.<p>For accuracy, this document is titled:<p>&quot;Draft Council Declaration on Encryption\n- Security through encryption and security despite encryption&quot;<p>Its pretty handwavy, overly general, and seems to call for some sort of &#x27;back door&#x27; from the tech companies. Missing the point really, anybody wishing to use strong encryption for criminal purpoes can do so so with very few resources, and quite independently.')
