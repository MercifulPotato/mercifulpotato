And even moving towards a &quot;single payer&quot; system, this dynamic is still going to exist for many kinds of care.<p>If by &quot;new horrors around access&quot; you just mean the poor not being able to pay for care, I see that as orthogonal and have no problem with subsidies. Of course I acknowledge the realpolitik would be different.')
