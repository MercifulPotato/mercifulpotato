This is clearly a deceptive practice, and now GrubHub influences the customer&#x27;s perception of the restaurant. Examples of conclusion(cause):<p>* That place is expensive (GrubHub sets the price which can be higher than the restaurant)\n* That place screwed up my order (GrubHub&#x27;s game of telephone made an error)\n* That place is so slow (The now multi-step transaction slowed down the process)<p>&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re saying you&#x27;ll get food from restaurant X.<p>They&#x27;re actually <i>failing</i> to say this, so the reasonable interpretation is &quot;We ARE restaurant X&quot; which is the fraudulent representation at the heart of the case here.')
