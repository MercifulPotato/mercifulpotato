PG already has a mechanic to disagree with Hitler&#x27;s decisions e.g. Kiev and Gibraltar. You can easily imagine quandaries such as:<p>- &quot;Hitler has asked you to detach units for cooperation with Einsatzgruppen operating behind the front. Refuse: lose 500 prestige Accept: gain 1000 prestige, reduced deployment area in the next scenario&quot;<p>- &quot;Hitler has ordered all captured commissars to be shot. Enforce: enemies no longer retreat or surrender. Disregard: lose 500 prestige&quot;<p>There&#x27;s also an end-of-campaign message that can easily be changed.')
