Other benchmarks seem to confirm this.<p>I&#x27;m very impressed. My Quadro P600 is around 5 times slower than the M1, all while using more power by itself than the entire system.<p>Granted, that&#x27;s a very slow (and generation old) discrete mobile GPU, but for what it is, I think the M1 makes a fine showing. It greatly outperforms my 8th gen Intel brick that weighs 5 pounds and needs a 110 watt power supply, so I&#x27;ll probably cave and upgrade.')
