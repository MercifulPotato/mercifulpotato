Are the unmarked helicopters circling the area black? Probably World Government. Not a good area for play that day.<p>Are they blue? That’s the Sheriff’s Secret Police. They’ll keep a good eye on your kids, and hardly ever take one.<p>Are they painted with complex murals depicting birds of prey diving? No one knows what those helicopters are, or what they want. Do not play in the area. Return to your home and lock the doors until a Sheriff’s Secret Policeman leaves a carnation on your porch to indicate that the danger has passed. Cover your ears to blot out the screams.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nightvalepresents.com&#x2F;welcome-to-night-vale-transcripts&#x2F;2012&#x2F;6&#x2F;15&#x2F;1-pilot" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nightvalepresents.com&#x2F;welcome-to-night-vale-trans...</a>')
