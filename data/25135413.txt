It seems to require more dimensions for causal events to &#x27;propagate&#x27; in time. I was thinking that events can&#x27;t change the future instantly, because information can&#x27;t travel faster than speed of light (which is the normal passing of time). So if I travel from million years from the future, it should take million years for the change to propagate to my original future.')
