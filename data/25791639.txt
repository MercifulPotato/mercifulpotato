You&#x27;re also faced with duplicating logic on both front and backends in many scenarios (though of course this can be mitigated with a node backend?  I don&#x27;t know... I&#x27;ve never used node).<p>As for latency, this is over websockets.  It becomes a problem if you are connecting to a server across the ocean but otherwise, it&#x27;s incredibly fast and feels just as snappy as JS.  I actually also haven&#x27;t used Stimulus Reflex, just Phoenix LiveView so I&#x27;m not sure if they are exactly the same, but the TL;DR is that they are sending VERY tiny payloads over websockets.  This video explains it well (though it&#x27;s also a demo of LiveView): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MZvmYaFkNJI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MZvmYaFkNJI</a>')
