Item(by='hedora', descendants=None, kids=[25043265], score=None, time=1604978524, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25042465, text='I worked on a large extremely high performance system (dozens of developers) that’s almost entirely lock free, and constantly mutates shared state.  Concurrency issues weren’t really a big problem in that code base.  Developers took a long time to ramp up, but that’s an OK tradeoff in my book.<p>None of this would have been possible without lead developers that designed and continuously refined the guard rails that our internal “standard library” implemented.<p>Oddly, I now find it easier to reason about lock free algorithms than mutex based code (and I wrote the latter for 15 years before working on the lock free system)')
