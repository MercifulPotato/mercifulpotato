Merely the presence of something like multiple plastic bags can tip the scales into &quot;intent&quot;, even if the quantity of the drug is below the decriminalization threshold. And because this isn&#x27;t full legalization, possession of any amount can still be sufficient grounds to get a warrant for further investigation.')
