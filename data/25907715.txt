Online People databases will still be reporting pieces of your older SSN while you have been primarily giving services a different number.<p>retirement time isnt a problem. if your business is getting paid and the person that pays needs your tin&#x2F;ein then thats what they get instead of your ssn. You are still paying self employment taxes contributing to retirement.')
