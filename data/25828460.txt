And there wasn&#x27;t constitutional breakdown - nothing broke down. The electoral college was delayed by several hours. That&#x27;s it. Surely it&#x27;s a huge egg on the face of security apparatus to let that happen, but pretending it somehow broken the constitutional government is nonsense.<p>&gt; There seems to be a lack of willingness to acknowledge an attempted coup as a coup<p>Because there was no coup. There was a large act of hooliganism - which is despicable, but nobody tried to change the constitutional government of the US, and nobody of the rioters could, how do you envision it - the horned guy sits behind Pelosi&#x27;s desk, or steals Pelosi&#x27;s podium, and now he&#x27;s the king of the USA and we are all his loyal subjects? There&#x27;s literally no imaginable way one could perform an actual coup - i.e. take the power into one&#x27;s own hands - this way. So let&#x27;s stop talking nonsense.<p>&gt;  It&#x27;s uncomfortable to realize how close we came to really bad things<p>You mean like being shown a picture of the horned guy in the Capitol, as opposed to actual war, starvation, disease, torture and death, which nobody really cared about ever? Again, the priorities are way askew here - which I can only attribute to unprecedented safety of US civilization and the citizens being so accustomed to this hyper-safety that they react to minuscule events as if their very existence were threatened.<p>&gt; Erm, Russians are 100% implicated in stoking civil unrest<p>Whatever Russians &quot;stoked&quot;, it didn&#x27;t make anyone to give up on the concept of free speech. But most of actual (as opposed to imagined and murkily) Russian propaganda targeted at the US that we&#x27;ve seen is so incredibly idiotic that the only thing it could &quot;stoke&quot; is an uproarious laughter. it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s hard to find - they posted it on Facebook. It is hilariously idiotic.
