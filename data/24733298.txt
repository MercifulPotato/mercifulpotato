If the CEO can make more money selling 200 million whatever than 100 million whatever, they&#x27;re still going to hire enough to make 200 million, even if they&#x27;re taking home less than they would in the hypothetical world where they were making 200 million whatever and their bottom-tier employees were on government subsidized housing.<p>But in the longer term, I think you raise a great point---it&#x27;s a huge incentive for the CEO to figure out how to automate making 200 million whatever so that they can pay $0. Which is good for the economy in general (automation means more free human time), but societies have to adapt to a lack of labor-intensive jobs to go around.<p>They already need to be adapting to that, because we&#x27;re already in the middle of the automation revolution.')
