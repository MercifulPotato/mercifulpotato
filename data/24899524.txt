He was great at politics.  He was great at taping into things that workers cared about.<p>But his actual economics that he laid out, in Das Kapital?  The actual mathmatical equations in it, and falsifiable predictions in that book?  The labor theory of value?<p>All pretty worthless.  Basically no serious academic takes the labor theory of value seriously.  It is non-sense.<p>Heterodox economic theories are heterodox for a reason.  That reason being that they are not reflective of reality.')
