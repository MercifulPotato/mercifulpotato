Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25466867], score=None, time=1608278973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459268, text='&gt; Coinbase is more about the ecosystem<p>And making it worse for people who simply don&#x27;t know any better and catering to high-net worth people? Amazing business model.<p>&gt; Ideally (from the perspective of Coinbase) they end up offering an absurdly broad range of services to consumers in the entire sphere of cryptocurrency, similar to how some banks don&#x27;t just let you hold money with them, but may offer 10 different services as well, from exchange to lending to credit to trading and so on.<p>So, they&#x27;re a bank? The very incarnation of Bitcoin&#x27;s <i>persona non grata</i> ever there ever was one.<p>The apologists around here trying to suck off YC and VC money teet may be more complaint, but I hope this new wave of customers goes to Square&#x2F;CASH (an easier transition since so many already have it on their phones) in order to steer them to companies that do actual meaningful work in this ecosystem, instead of act as a parasite as Armstrong and Coinbase do.')
