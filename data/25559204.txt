I keep my skills current and have pivoted my career many times when things got less interesting or I could tell the market was falling off. I went sysadmin&gt;neteng&gt;syseng&gt;SRE and will have to pivot in 4-5 years again, probably, once some other culture-breaker has hit distributed systems for the 3rd time in my career.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t have kids so you might go &quot;hey you&#x27;ve got so much free time&quot; - I&#x27;m also a 36yo engineer with 10+ years of experience. Most of the positions I take nowadays allow me <i>AMPLE</i> time (as in months) to do research and learn new systems before deploying them to production. I almost never study or work at home these days. A LOT less than in my 20s when I worked in startups.<p>I just went through a few months of interviewing, what did every company want out of me at this &quot;age&quot; (experience)? They wanted a strong desire to mentor and cultivate teams. I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of older engineers who aren&#x27;t happy to do this, and that&#x27;s a huge problem and something majorly wrong and undesirable in tech.<p>FWIW I will not ever consider the 30s or 40s old. I am working with a lot more 23-25yo developers now and feel like half of my skillset is bridging communication between zoomers and gen-x bosses. They love learning and its incredibly rewarding helping them grow their careers - something that I never got help with when I started in the toxic tech world of ~2008.<p>I&#x27;m a lead&#x2F;staff IC, not a manager, fwiw.')
