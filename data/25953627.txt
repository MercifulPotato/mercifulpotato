This period allows fractional trading to work (they pool orders and execute on day 2).  Those same restrictions also appear to restrict a broker&#x2F;dealer from using customer funds to cover this float.  From there it&#x27;s pretty easy to interpret the end results - risk rises, fees rise, and suddenly RH has to pony up massive amounts of liquidity to cover the DTC float.<p>Fuckery is certainly possible.  This explanation still begs the question; at what point can a business decide not to cover the &#x27;cost of doing business&#x27; and instead, create explicit downward pricing pressure.')
