Why don&#x27;t you feel the burden to back that up, rather than just blindly asserting it as fact? And you should ask yourself where you learned this &quot;fact&quot; from. I suspect that it came from the PR departments of the fraudsters themselves.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to disprove in any specific instance that there aren&#x27;t U.S. programmers available to fill a role. Take a look at the H1B openings and see if you can&#x27;t find some people in your LinkedIn connections that could fill those roles and don&#x27;t yet work for FAANG. I certainly could for almost any role because they&#x27;re almost all very generic tech jobs.<p>It also seems likely to be false just based on the number of U.S. programmers and the number of programmers employed by FAANG. They are very big employers but not nearly big enough to employ even a majority of U.S. programmers.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone in FAANG leadership believes this claim to be true at all. They all know why they&#x27;re committing fraud, which is to compete against the others that are doing it too. The same reason restaurants and farms hire people that are in the country illegally.<p>You probably fell for the same propaganda about Americans not wanting to work in restaurants or in farms. When in reality, they don&#x27;t want to compete with people being exploited.<p>Some companies exploit &quot;unskilled&quot; illegal immigration.<p>Some companies exploit &quot;skilled&quot; fraudulent immigration.<p>In both cases, it&#x27;s the unethical theft of wealth from the population.')
