Item(by='crpatino', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604702526, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010458, text='&gt; no one would open a staffed lending library with a collection so small that the staff could keep everything in their head<p>Yes, no one would. Yet the same people pile up technical debt like there&#x27;s no tomorrow.<p>The reason for this is double fold. The people in charge either do not understand programming at all, or have fallen out of touch with programming. It is like the library owner is blind and cannot see the utter mess of books in their storage area. But as long as they keep hearing the cha-ching of customer paying for their service, it means everything must be fine, right. After all, the librarians are in charge of keeping everything tiddy, right?<p>The other side of the coin is, programmers are not professionals. Our trade is still very very young, and those traits have not evolved yet. In the metaphor, the librarians may not have any librarian training at all; they were hired mostly because they loved books and knew how to help customers find what they may like to read. Some of the librarians may have heard of the Dewey system, but most of them just came up with their own idiosyncratic (and mutually incompatible) &quot;systems&quot; of organization. Which work pretty well in their well stocked bookshelves at home, but completely falls apart once they have to keep track of thousands or tens of thousands of books.')
