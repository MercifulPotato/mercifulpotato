There is a ton of information on the web (viewed 191k times) [1], [2], etc. Acting like it is intuitive is disingenuous.<p>No, that&#x27;s you who don&#x27;t understand. I&#x27;ve shown particular code that is error prone in JS but is ok in other languages. That is the issue. It is not solved. Every novice gets it. It is simple to solve. Instead you claim &quot;you should not need this&quot;, tell it 191k viewers. Yes, you know what&#x27;s going on, still you claim &quot;you don&#x27;t need this&quot;.<p><pre><code>    class Foo\n    end\n    foo = Foo.new\n    foo.class == Foo &#x2F;&#x2F; metaprogramming! *You shouldn&#x27;t even be futzing with these things in _any_ file*\n</code></pre>\nSure I know about method definition in class.

It is useful technique.<p>And please don&#x27;t post twice same if you can&#x27;t read response.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;9959727&#x2F;proto-vs-prototype-in-javascript" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;9959727&#x2F;proto-vs-prototy...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;javascript.info&#x2F;class-inheritance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;javascript.info&#x2F;class-inheritance</a>')
