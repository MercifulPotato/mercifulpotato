FAANMG+ companies pay very well, but salaries for the vast majority of engineers are determined by black box formulas, and in cases where blocs of employees think there&#x27;s something unfair about their compensation (for instance, people in one location being paid more than people in another) there&#x27;s absolutely nothing they can do about it. The scale of these companies is such that even senior engineers have an essentially nonexistent negotiating position.')
