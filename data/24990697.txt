I&#x27;m agreeing that the existing system doesn&#x27;t work. I acknowledge addiction as a sickness and see how the current process fails to address it.<p>I&#x27;m saying that decriminalization isn&#x27;t the the best option in my opinion either - essentially you have a system ignoring people&#x27;s drug use rather than offering help. My suggestion was to have a low level summary offense which only punishes the person with education on rehab options. This would require users to recieve information on treatment options that they might otherwise not be aware of. It would also track the offense so that if an addict resorts to crime to pay for their habit, they would not be legally allowed to buy a weapon.')
