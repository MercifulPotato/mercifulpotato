Some of the &quot;Assault in progress&quot; can be done in &lt;5 seconds late game.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about the gigs that you get from the fixers in the different regions.  Those are interesting, they are mostly the same concept, but you can choose to go in stealth or rambo, and for many, if you scope the place well enough and have the right build, you can b-line to the objective.')
