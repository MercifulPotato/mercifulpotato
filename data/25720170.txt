That&#x27;s the American way of voicing political dissent.<p>If a politician organizes a peaceful rally and violent people show up and do violent things, and you blame the politician for the violence, then I&#x27;m curious about something.... Do you hold the Democrats responsible for all the violence of 2020 when we had cities burning down, and the MSM saying things like &quot;Who ever said protests had to be peaceful&quot;<p>The Democrats calling the capitol mob a &quot;coup de tat attempt&quot; is absolutely hilarious and just shows their complete lunacy in their attempt to vilify the other side, even when they&#x27;re clearly just being absurd. It was a mob who were let into a building. Hell they didn&#x27;t even damage any of the priceless paintings. If anyone&#x27;s to blame is was the security who let the doors get breached when their job was to guard the building with machine guns.')
