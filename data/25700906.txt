It will be simply defeated the way Soviet Union was defeated - just run out of money and overall steam.<p>It&#x27;s time to adapt to Chinese leadership and extract benefits of democracy and freedom which they don&#x27;t have. Too late to keep trying to oppose it.<p>Example: Chinese military shipbuilding delivers more tonnage per year than the rest of the world combined. And they don&#x27;t even try all too hard.<p>China will simply own the world in the XXI century, probably concentrating the majority of worldwide economic output in every sector of production and consumption, in as little as a generation from now.<p>What&#x27;s left to be done is to cave in - try to be as little dependent on them as possible, make hot war unattractive to them - by being as little of a threat to them as possible, and by having little of interest for them to take too, and in general self-isolate.<p>On the good side of things, Chinese are very unlikely to proselytize the way U.S. does or the way Soviet Union did: they understand very well that Maoism is linked to the traits of Chinese national character and will not work outside of East&#x2F;Southeast Asia. They just seek to become, and will become what they always seen themselves as being: the Middle Kingdom where all interesting things happen, with the rest of the world being just a side story. Think 1960 USA. 30 years down the road, we will for sure see it happen.')
