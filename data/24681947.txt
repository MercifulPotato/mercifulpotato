If the idea is that academic papers should have a more general audience, then I feel that’s a different statement, because I agree that academic papers are often less accessible to non-target audience members due to word choice.<p>In the case you mentioned there is a bit of redundancy which makes the word “ameliorate” easy to substitute. Terms like “therapeutic” and “misfolding” make it easy to derive that we’re going from a bad to good state.<p>“Activated protein X ameliorates biofilm formation” has more content than if we swapped to “target” in this case, because it has the added effect of indicating that the interaction was “good”.<p>As a continued aside, I think you’d enjoy the talk I originally posted.  It dives into the difference between using writing to think vs persuade or educate, and how not recognizing that difference can cause poor scientific communication.')
