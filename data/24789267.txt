Item(by='arc776', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602773898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24788971, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve had my share of burnouts because of its lack of types and difficulties in refactoring big code-bases.<p>Nim is strongly, statically typed. Also, I agree and aside from performance it&#x27;s why I started using Nim instead of Python for my gamedev hobby. Dynamic typing isn&#x27;t good for large projects. Nim has great type inference though, so you get the readability of Python but with strong compile time type guarantees.<p>Eg;<p><pre><code>    type SpecialId = distinct int # This int is now type incompatible with other ints\n    proc handleId(id: SpecialId) =\n      # ... do something with id.</code></pre>')
