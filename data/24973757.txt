I still watch Mr. Hankey&#x27;s Christmas Classics every year when I decorate the tree, and I still love what they did up until around season 12.  After that it gets hit-or-miss and after a few more seasons just didn&#x27;t seem worth watching anymore.  I&#x27;d chalk it up to getting older and not smoking pot anymore, but I still love their old stuff.')
