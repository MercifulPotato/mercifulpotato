Really I did it to teach myself Redux, and it was a pretty fun way to learn.<p>Totally agree with the article: sometimes functional is the right tool for the job, sometimes OOP.<p>A more recent example: parsing USB descriptors in Rust. The parser would have been trivial and easy to understand if I could have multiple mutable references to nodes, but alas I kept fighting the borrow checker.<p>I talked with a friend about why it was so hard, and he said &quot;do it in a functional style&quot;. That made my borrow checker worries go away, but instead I have multiple &quot;tree pivoters&quot; that recursively descend through input trees while building output trees. It practically broke my brain and although it is pure, it&#x27;s not nearly as readable or maintainable as one with mutation would have been.')
