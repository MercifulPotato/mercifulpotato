Rather, I think it whether the manipulation separates out the manipulated into an echo-chamber of similarly-minded outrage or not.<p>For example, a government statement based on scientific investigation, such as &quot;Covid-19 is a dangerous disease, but it helps if you wear a mask&quot; is state-backed manipulation, but it doesn&#x27;t try to isolate the manipulated into an echo-chamber, and it is intending to be stabilising.<p>Conversely, some of the worst parts of social media can whip up a storm of outrage and hatred because the algorithm (which is intended to maximise the advertising profits of a commercial company) recommends outrageous stories that make you angry, but that you are likely to agree with. This is lots-of-money-backed manipulation, but it does isolate people into echo-chambers, and it is destabilising.<p>Regarding having two large political movements that have become enemies, I think this is an emergent property of a complex interaction between politics and the tendency of people to get sucked into echo-chambers that (as an emergent property, not an intended outcome) steer people towards thinking that the other side is the devil incarnate. Political parties will always disagree with each other. I admire politicians who can say to each other that they disagree strongly with the other&#x27;s point of view, but they respect them as a person and get on with them well.<p>I think it will be very hard to destroy the natural tendency of social media to form echo-chambers, but it should be attempted. Regarding politics, I think it&#x27;s interesting that countries that have election systems that discourage two-party politics in favour of multiple parties having to make compromises with each other tend to be more stable and friendly about it.')
