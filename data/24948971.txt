Some thoughts...<p>I&#x27;m a heavy Otter user and find it well worth the subscription - I used it a lot even in person, and have used it more since we all started working from home. We use Teams for most of our meetings and I always switch the captions on there; one or the other sometimes lags, but usually not both at once. For family video chats, we use Google Meet, and it&#x27;s usually on par with Otter and Teams.<p>I have read a lot of positive comments of Google&#x27;s Live Transcribe and Recorder apps, but can&#x27;t evaluate them since I&#x27;m an iPhone user. Between this and the other hearing a11y features in recent Pixel phones, and me having one foot out of the Apple ecosystem anyway, I give serious thought to switching to a Pixel almost every year and one of these days I&#x27;ll actually do it.<p>Worth mentioning: Google added the Pixel&#x27;s Live Captions feature to Chrome and it&#x27;s in the beta and main channels, but it&#x27;s hidden behind a flag AND a setting, so you have to enable the flag, restart Chrome, and then confirm in settings that captions are turned on. I believe this is entirely on-device and it does work astonishingly well; I&#x27;ve used it on programming streams on Twitch and it handled the technical vocabulary better than I expected , if not flawlessly.<p>A US-centric point I should mention: for companies above a certain size, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires that they make reasonable accommodations for you. I have done this in the past to have a professional captioner. They&#x27;re more accurate, but inconvenient to schedule, usually have a bit more lag, and very expensive ($125 an hour was about average when I last had to get quotes for this). Not everyone wants to make the accuracy tradeoff and that&#x27;s fine - I understand their position - though I&#x27;m personally willing to because it makes it very easy to jump on a call with a coworker whenever I need to.<p>Quick notes on my setup: I have a 3.5mm splitter hanging off my work laptop&#x27;s headphone jack. One side goes to a ReSound Multi-Mic (which includes a 3.5mm jack) to stream the audio to my hearing aid. The other side has a TRS-to-TRRS cable going into my iPhone (via the audio to lightning adapter) or iPad to provide an audio stream for Otter to work on. USB webcam provides the microphone. I typically use my iPad since I can set it up under the monitor my video call is running on and then I don&#x27;t have to use screen space on my monitors to display the captions.<p>I really should write up a blog post about all of this, with photos.')
