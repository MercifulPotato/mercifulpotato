So you gotta take into account who you can convince first. But also consider that Signal hasn&#x27;t been fully featured until about last month. So it isn&#x27;t a good idea to just try to convert random non-techy people. For them you&#x27;d need to use current events that highlight how important privacy is (which there have been quite a few this year). But also focus on generating a critical mass. Now it isn&#x27;t hard for me to convert people because we&#x27;ll be planning things and 4&#x2F;5 people have Signal so you just strong arm the fifth person and then they start using it more because they realize a fair amount of their friends are already there. It takes time though and let&#x27;s be real about that Signal hasn&#x27;t been fully featured. Until recently it has been more a geeky app.<p>So tldr target the people you want to convert to develop a critical mass.')
