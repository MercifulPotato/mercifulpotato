The built in ad blocker is not as advanced as uBlock Origin and that&#x27;s why I installed the latter as an extension (I turned off the built in one). Anyway IMHO the biggest limitation currently is the lack of containers, because it needs to be built into the browser, there is no 3rd party extension that can give you that.')
