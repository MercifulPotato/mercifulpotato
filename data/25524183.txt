It is being used to mean two different things in this subthread.<p>Judging whether a candidate is coachable, their thought processes relevant to the job, understands the ideas etc is what the interview is for, you&#x27;re right.<p>But &quot;I&#x27;m not judging&quot; doesn&#x27;t refer to that.  It refers instead to the concept in the word &quot;judgemental&quot;.  Some definitions of that are &quot;having or displaying an overly critical point of view&quot; and &quot;thinking, speaking, or behaving in a manner that reflects a critical and condemnatory point of view&quot;.')
