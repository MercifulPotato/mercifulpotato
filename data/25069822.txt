When all I&#x27;m trying to do is make sure musicians get fairly paid for their work. So yeah, I&#x27;m not super concerned about playing music loud in my car as you sarcastically suggested I should be.<p>I am concerned about joining a music platform where something I purchased can be shared for free to millions of people with the musician getting nothing.<p>If there is a service that pays musicians directly and cuts out ASCAP and RIAA, then even better.')
