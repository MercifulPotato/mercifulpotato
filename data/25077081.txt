Mine would be: AT ALL COST AVOID. (I mean it...ALL COST).<p>This gets at the heart of existential risk.  Should we abandon all technology to avoid the possibility of nuclear war and just wait for an asteroid or climate change or resource exhaustion to kill us?  Nuclear destruction only gets <i>easier</i> over time as technology progresses.  My cell phone is faster than the supercomputers of the 80&#x27;s used to model nuclear explosions.  Even North Korea can refine uranium.  Guided rockets are cheap enough to launch high school science projects.  Hypersonic cruise missiles are on the horizon.<p>Generally I would propose we avoid nuclear war being an existential risk by going to the stars as soon as possible.  That has other costs that, yes, should be balanced against the costs of nuclear war.<p>AGI is another path to a post-existential-threat future for humanity but probably has the greatest risks because it accelerates virtually all of the existing risky technology and climate trends, balanced only by the hope that its intelligence grows far faster than the risks and that it&#x27;s value-aligned with humanity.')
