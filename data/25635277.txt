There&#x27;s also another visualizer program by the same person to do custom visualizers that works on the RGB stuff in your case, connecting to RGB over a network port.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;CalcProgrammer1&#x2F;KeyboardVisualizer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;CalcProgrammer1&#x2F;KeyboardVisualizer</a><p>I had a great time pointing my camera at my computer for a meeting, and letting everyone realize their voice was controlling the RGB (with a slight delay for zoom of course).<p>I&#x27;m even thinking about making my own visualizer to do things like show me my kubernetes cluster health on my RGB :)<p>One thing to note, the corsair RGB fans and strips can be tricky - you have to tell it how many LEDs are on each strip manually, and otherwise it will just look all black and won&#x27;t warn you.
