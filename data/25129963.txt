And with email I can check my spam folder and see exactly what has been rejected. So unless the search engine has a list of sites that aren&#x27;t deemed worthy included with every search (which probably wouldn&#x27;t happen), I think this solution has some pretty big flaws.  It should be noted that the current system also has these flaws, as Google and DDG can show you whatever they want base don whatever criteria they see fit.')
