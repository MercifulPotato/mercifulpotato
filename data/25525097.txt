If you check their history, all 153 submissions of theirs are dead.<p>This includes submissions from such publications as the Washington Post, USA Today, Popular Science, Fortune, Slate, a whole bunch of newspapers from fairly major cities, and much more. Most of them seem to be reasonable submissions, too.<p>They were all within about a month or so of each other, starting right after the account was created, and mostly happened in large batches. It seems highly likely they tripped some anti-spam or anti-flooding detector and the user was perma-banned and all their submissions instantly killed.')
