Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608936931, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25538092, text='&gt; Absolutely, why on earth would you think I wouldn&#x27;t?<p>Because in this very sub-thread, you&#x27;re making statements like:<p>&gt; China&#x27;s response was, as now, to only briefly close these <i>horrific places of animal torture</i>.<p>In contrast to what? The horrific places of animal torture from where our supermarket meat comes from?<p>Pardon my skepticism, but I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re applying the same standards to their barbarism, as you are to our barbarism. You don&#x27;t seem to be applying the same standards to their ineptitude and malfeasance as you are to our ineptitude and malfeasance.<p>It comes off as nationalistic baiting, which is incredibly frustrating, because it&#x27;s happening in the context of lordnacho&#x27;s post. There&#x27;s a prevailing zeitgheist in the US that all our problems are the fault of other, bad countries - which is used as a diversion from finding actual solutions to these problems. We&#x27;ve seen this play out over the past year, to the tune of 250,000 dead.<p>You&#x27;re surely familiar with the meme of a an incompetent authoritarian regime that&#x27;s busy blaming everyone around them for their domestic problems, while their people starve. Over the past year, we&#x27;ve been living this meme. We should be looking back at it with self-reflection, as opposed to cheerleading it.')
