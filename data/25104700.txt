It varies wildly jumper to jumper based on the types of jumps done (cliffs are more deadly than bridges) and how often.  Most people jump for a period of 3-6 years and quit.<p>My wife and I were pretty active jumping in the era of wingsuit videos on YouTube.  In her first year we had one good friend die and 9 people we&#x27;d met or hung out with a short time.  It is basically comparable in danger to spaceflight.')
