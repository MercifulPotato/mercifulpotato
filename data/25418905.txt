That implies a high increase relative to the current case count, which really isn&#x27;t the case any more once you have a population case rate of 5%.<p>I would be cautious about estimating countries that are only now having their first major outbreak (for example Czechia) for exactly the reason that you cite, but not every country is in that state.<p>Put another way, we are no longer living with preliminary data in much of the world.')
