I suspect it won&#x27;t assuage customer fears because said fears appear before they use your product and the solution only appears once they&#x27;ve singed up and used it.  That said, that&#x27;s the sort of hypothesis I could well be wrong about you&#x27;d only prove or refute by talking to customers and&#x2F;or testing it out so ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯   Anyway, best of luck!')
