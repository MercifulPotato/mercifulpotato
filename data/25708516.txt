I&#x27;m sure there is, but there is also violent content on reddit, tik tok, twitter, facebook, and every other social media site that has ever existed.<p>My point is just: it seems like people are claiming that parler exists <i>only</i> for this content, or that they&#x27;re somehow encouraging it or something.  But I&#x27;m just curious how people came to this conclusion if none of us even have accounts there.  I have seen some interviews with staff members there and they just seem like normal business-type people.')
