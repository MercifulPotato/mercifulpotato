If we go deeper into philosophy and explore the concept of &quot;free will&quot;, another question arises:  Are we &quot;real&quot; if all of our choices and actions are preordained?<p>Of course this is way off topic, so I&#x27;ll try to steer us back.<p>The NSA has a choice between improving domestic security by helping to improve standards and protocols, or choosing to deliberately weaken them so they can collect more.  (As an aside, it is nonsensical to collect any  more since they cannot even process what they are collecting now.)
