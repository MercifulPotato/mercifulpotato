He has been working 10+-hour days for the last two weeks, on top of a bicycle commute (which will sometimes turn into an hour-long walk if the winds are bad), picking up groceries, etc..  They have as many employees as they are allowed to have (given the store size), and right now the work is never-ending.<p>&gt; I would love to try this one day as long as the Benny Hill song can play in the background as I make trips from my van into a retail UPS store.<p>Please don&#x27;t do this, or even joke about it.')
