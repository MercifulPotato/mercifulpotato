Are there any investigative tools that <i>are</i> perfect or is there a reason why facial recognition should be held to a higher standard?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s no better than fnger printing which often leads to unjust arrests.<p>You need to be more specific. Why is it no better?

It&#x27;s just another investigative method, like looking up a license plate or asking people at the crime scene what they saw.<p>&gt; The best it can do is narrow down suspects.<p>It can also help find suspects when you don&#x27;t have any other leads.
