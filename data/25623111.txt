But, on the other hand, I have been using 2 non-ECC desktops for a workstation&#x2F;server for the past ~6 years.. and I would be hard pressed to come up with a single situation where either of the machines randomly crashed or applications did anything &#x27;unexpected&#x27; (to my knowledge, of course).<p>My point is, when you say there is a &quot;96% chance of having an error in THREE DAYS&quot;, one would EXPECT to be having issues like.. all the time?  So I&#x27;m not disagreeing with you, but with the amount of non-ECC machines all over the world and how insanely stable modern machines are, it still seems like a very low risk.<p>Now of course I agree that if you want to take every precaution, go ECC, but simple observation prove that this &quot;problem&quot; can&#x27;t be as bad as the numbers are saying.')
