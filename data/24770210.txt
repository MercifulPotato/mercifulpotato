Notably, though, first order theories are not sufficient to define the natural numbers, for every set of first-order axioms about the natural numbers, there are &quot;non-standard models&quot; that can look quite weird. You need second-order logic or something equivalent in power to prevent that (the difficult axiom here is the axiom of induction which needs to be able to quantify over predicates).')
