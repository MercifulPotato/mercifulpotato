Item(by='michaelt', descendants=None, kids=[24661704], score=None, time=1601637882, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24661126, text='<i>&gt; Almost all popular apps on Flathub still come with filesystem=host or filesystem=home permissions, in other words, write access to the user home directory</i><p>I agree it&#x27;s absurd to have a sandbox system that doesn&#x27;t protect the home directory [1]<p>Browsers and smartphones have an advantage here, because every app uses their file-open and file-save dialogs. If the user wants to open &#x2F;home&#x2F;user&#x2F;pictures&#x2F;whatever.jpg the sandboxed code gets access to that file and that file only, with the user&#x27;s explicit consent. And if the app&#x27;s file formats and suchlike don&#x27;t match that way of working, tough luck because there&#x27;s no alternative.<p>Whereas on Linux, where there are already 6+ other ways of packaging and distributing your app, a new entrant doesn&#x27;t have the power to dictate terms or force developers to change their programs. And distributing a version of Gimp that couldn&#x27;t open files in the user&#x27;s home directory would be absurd.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1200&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1200&#x2F;</a>')
