That way, the business will be incentivized to optimize down the cost because otherwise they&#x27;ll have to bake the cost into the product, which disincentivizes consumers from buying it through higher prices. It also gets rid of the information asymmetry because the company definitely knows and is incentivized to know their overall quality so they can account for it.')
