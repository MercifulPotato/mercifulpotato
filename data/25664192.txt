Thankfully election security officials do work on that! But the people standing up to claim massive fraud are not claiming that because they have evidence, it&#x27;s because they lost and they are pissed off about it. What they are proposing for remedies is to just throw the whole process out and declare Donald Trump won. Interestingly, they are not challenging any Senate results (Georgia TBD), House results, or even local results.<p>People are claiming massive fraud because of complete <i>lies</i>. They aren&#x27;t claiming &quot;something <i>might</i> be fishy here, let&#x27;s check, recount, etc.&quot; Because we did that. <i>All</i> of the swing states recounted their votes, some twice, by hand. They went into the signature verification, observation process, the whole show. No, instead, the crazies go right to the rails and the people who yell the loudest are out there right now showing us exactly what they think of the US Constitution, the law, and this whole process.')
