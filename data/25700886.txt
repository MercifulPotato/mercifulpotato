In many cases the virus reproduces and spreads without any symptoms.</i><p>We know that asymptomatic people who are not immune can possibly spread the virus. But that’s a slightly different question.<p>We know that it’s very rare for someone with antibodies to be symptomatically reinfected with COVID. That’s also a slightly different question.<p>The specific question on the likelihood of someone with natural immunity to be able to later <i>spread</i> COVID without a symptomatic infection;<p>I’ve never heard of a single confirmed case of this happening. And the point is not that it <i>never</i> happens, the point is it’s a negligible risk. Smaller than, for example, someone who isn’t immune who is wearing a mask.<p>But from a public policy perspective, we’ll never actually admit this, just because the second order effects — where some people can rightfully walk around without a mask and are rightfully not subject to mitigations and lockdowns - are political untenable.')
