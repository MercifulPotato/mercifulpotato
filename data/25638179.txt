And the idea that BTC = money (&quot;coin&quot; is in the name and &quot;currency&quot; is in &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;) has stuck in many people&#x27;s minds, so this stuff is unfortunately necessary since the general public&#x27;s understanding of Bitcoin is &quot;obscure digital money that goes from cheap to expensive and back real quick&quot;.<p>And the media, being generally too lazy to do critical investigative work into obscure tech stuff, have actually reported on BTC as if it is a real currency in the past.<p>Futures, stocks, etc never had the public image of a potential future currency, which is why you don&#x27;t see blog posts about how &quot;High-yield debt will Replace Fiat in a few years&quot; or other such nonsense. The same cannot be said for Bitcoin.')
