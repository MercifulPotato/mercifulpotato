This is really something you always get when there are multiple non-reference implementations of something and one has significantly larger market share.<p>But, I think a more relevant example might be people who write code prefixed with comments like &quot;Destructure this manually. At -O2 on GCC this allows the first field to be placed in a register&quot; which is putting waaay too much dependence on the internals of a specific implementation, beyond even whatever extensions a particular compiler claims to support.')
