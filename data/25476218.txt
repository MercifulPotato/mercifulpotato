Item(by='oarabbus_', descendants=None, kids=[25476505, 25476303], score=None, time=1608368721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475903, text='I completely agree with your poignant &quot;getting to know an album&quot; statement, but I fundamentally disagree with your general point of your issues with streaming; I think it&#x27;s a boon to have such a wide selection of music at your fingertips. An asymptotically infinite, for practical purposes, amount of music.<p>That being said, I really appreciate your perspective, and everything you said about physical media, the radio, torrent services, and ultimately limitations to music selection, is all absolutely true and completely resonates, even if I prefer the modern &quot;more music than you could care about&quot; availability.<p>It somewhat saddens me that anyone under the age of 25 (this is arbitrary, maybe a few years younger) never experienced the sensation of really getting to know every song of an album by an artist who&#x27;s album you purchased, _even the songs you didn&#x27;t like_. This really can&#x27;t be emphasized enough. The younger generation has no concept of listening to a song you &quot;don&#x27;t like&quot; 50 times, simply because you listened to the album you purchased 100 times.<p>It&#x27;s like actually getting to know a friend extremely well that you&#x27;ve spent countless days with, vs. an acquaintance whom you always have a blast with but only meet at parties once every couple months.')
