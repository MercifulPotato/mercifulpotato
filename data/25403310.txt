Although I still have a huge mass of unimplemented features on my to-do list, I finally took the courage to release a minimum viable product. Compared to similar software, it does three things quite well: it copes with Gregorian as well as Julian calendar dates, it allows to use date (and time) values of different magnitudes (from the second up to billions of years) in one chronology, and it does a decent job when using LaTeX as an output format. Apart from that, it lacks many of the features and ease of use that other applications offer. However, it is difficult for me to decide what to focus on next. I would especially appreciate feedback from people who find the Julian&#x2F;Gregorian feature useful, about what else matters for them most. You may reach me via the email adress in my HN profile or on the Factonaut Web-site.')
