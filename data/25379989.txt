To use the largest and most brutal example, the UK rape gangs are 97% Pakistani. It isn&#x27;t because of race, but because of religion and culture. A religion that doesn&#x27;t respect women and a culture that doesn&#x27;t respect the law.<p>The two people I know who got banned from FB for pointing this out are a Pakistani expat and a Qatari Arab. It&#x27;s not a racial thing. They both very persuasively show that it&#x27;s structural issues in both the country and in Islam  that make this almost expected behavior. Much like how the thin-blue-line might seem noble to police but obviously just leads to abuse. So these people trying to criticize their culture to improve it, much like everyone calling out the USA, christians, police, etc, were shut down by the white people who assumed they were being racist - towards themselves... Much doublethink.<p>When you come along and call out reasonable issues as &#x27;coded racism&#x27; you&#x27;re never going to stop the rape, and at best you&#x27;re just going to <i>cause</i> racism. &quot;No,&quot; they may think, &quot;I didn&#x27;t say that person was X race, but you are, and you&#x27;re really defensive about it. Maybe you&#x27;re on to something.&quot; But it almost feels like that&#x27;s the goal these days. Accelerationists picking fights in everyone else&#x27;s name, trying to burn down the system at all costs.')
