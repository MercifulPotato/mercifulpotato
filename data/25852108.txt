That isnâ€™t going to change because the companies writing web specs have a strategic interest in reserving access to coveted operating system features and APIs for their native app platforms, e.g. push notifications, fast graphics, media capture. Local storage is also being crippled under the guise of privacy - Safari now deletes local data after 7 days unless you add the website to your home screen.')
