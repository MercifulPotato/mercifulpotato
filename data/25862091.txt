In my business, web applications, that is mostly server side and it came as either running the app in multiple processes (Rails, Django) or with a runtime that natively use all cores (BEAM &#x2F; Elixir).<p>The front end is mostly single threaded (JavaScript) but browsers can use multiple threads to speed up the UI and we can also use web workers to do some real multithreading in JavaScript. Maybe some frontend framework uses them to speedup managing its DOM model. I hope I gave the idea, the terms are probably all wrong, I&#x27;m definitely more about the backend.')
