They&#x27;re not as reliable as buttons. A single failure breaks everything. They&#x27;re not particularly robust to temperature extremes. I can&#x27;t use them by touch alone. They don&#x27;t work with gloves.<p>In fact, the reliance on a touch screen is why I&#x27;ve stricken Tesla off the list while shopping for an EV. I currently drive an old BMW and I love the interface. There are physical buttons for everything and there&#x27;s no unnecessary fluffy stuff.<p>The most-modern vehicle I&#x27;ve driven whose interface I&#x27;ve liked was a Skoda Fabia.')
