They have no academic standards, no standardization, and they promise the world. I took the more traditional CS degree route but understand it&#x27;s not the best path for everyone. However, bootcamps aren&#x27;t the new way and probably never will be (I expect them to take their place next to DeVry and other university level scams advertising on daytime television).<p>Entry level programmers are told that there is a huge demand. There is a huge demand, but everyone wants at least some experience. Some will do personal projects, maybe work at a chop shop for a few months and work their way in. Others won&#x27;t or never get past the project phase. Coding bootcamps come in and claim to bridge that gap for an exorbitant price. The attitude is so often &quot;just pay for this piece of paper and get a job.&quot; Students pay up front and are left out on their ass when they realize it was a scam.<p>Unfortunately by the time I see people get desperate enough to buy a piece of paper from a bootcamp I think they should either work on their soft skills or reconsider this industry altogether. I personally know a few people who either have gone or are considering such programs and they all lack passion. They only want to program because they see it as a stable line of employment. Hiring managers can see this from a mile away and lose interest. If it&#x27;s just a lack of soft skills then learn how to sell yourself and communicate your interest. But if you don&#x27;t really want this and can&#x27;t bridge the gap then I&#x27;d find something else to do.')
