I remember the drive from Riga to Lithuania or travelling by train there, and I don&#x27;t remember seeing a flatter place in my life (and I&#x27;ve been to most European + American countries). When her parents visited they were surprised with how much we go &#x27;up and down&#x27; in just my city alone.<p>I can see this working in some flatter areas of the country (same as I see bike adoption in those areas), but find the e-scooters at least too slow&#x2F;battery hogs in this scenario (not sure about e-bikes though)<p>In any case, this is a right move for them, but I think pegging this usage to some kind of license is also important.')
