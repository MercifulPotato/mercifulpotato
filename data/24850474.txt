That would be weird. AFAIK, the GPL does not demand that. It suffices to send the source code on demand. Besides that, what would happen if your link would stop working?<p>Where I work, we use a lot of free software to build our product (various licenses) and I am happy to hand over the sources of these libraries to anyone asking. So far, no one has asked, though.')
