Until very recently, the expectation for ACH was that a transaction would clear after days (sometimes weeks). The end user of that product (at scale) is banks, not individuals. Bitcoin&#x2F;crypto solves the problem of being able to essentially do a &quot;briefcase full of cash&quot; transaction over the internet, a use case that obviously only matters to a tiny sliver of people. The remaining majority would simply use more trust-based institutions (like the Lightning network) to facilitate convenient&#x2F;instant transactions. The fact that you can run an hour long transaction in a trust-less way on the blockchain is just an option, but realistically not the use-case for most people.')
