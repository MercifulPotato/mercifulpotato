I find it interesting that you do not explain why the Robert Lee statue is important to remain standing. And why “very fine people” think it’s so important that it’s worth protesting with neo nazis and members of the kkk. Which again, if you protest with members of the kkk, people carrying nazi flags and people chanting blood and soil, you’re not a good person.<p>To your other argument, Dachau was never a monument to the Nazis. It was left standing as a testament to the horror of the Nazi regime and is a historical place.<p>The Robert Lee statue was erected sixty years after the end of the civil war. And this statue was erected as part of the historical revisionist “lost cause” movement, that has tried to frame the south’s decision to secede from the union as just. So, the origin of the statue is racism, the man the statue represents is also racism. And this is entirely consistent with the kkk and Nazis protesting the statues removal.<p>To compare this to a person of color who has reclaimed a symbol of hate, such as the confederate flag. Makes no sense. In order to make your argument you need to explain what the statue means to these people. And how that can possibly be worth it, given what this statue represents to people of color and the fact that they’re supporting Nazis and the kkk while protesting this.')
