I&#x27;ve been experimenting with how to improve the User Experience of using the git CLI (based on my experience over years). Bit provides interactive suggestions, organizes branches by most recent, automatically fetches and fast-forwards (when possible) from origin and much more. Furthermore, its functionally can continue to be extended using Go instead of bash :).<p>For those of you who are interested. Please take a look at the README. Bit is very much plug &amp; play so you should be able to simply run the installation command and be ready to go.')
