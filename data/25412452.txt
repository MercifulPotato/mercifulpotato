Go car shopping today and you quickly realize Toyota has some of the most sophisticated technology on the road already.<p>Their entire product line is available in hybrids with a low speed EV mode. Most of their competitors don&#x27;t seem to be offering hybrids of larger vehicles like SUVs. But if you need a third row seat car that gets 50% better gas mileage than anything else in it&#x27;s class... Toyota can sell you one.<p>I suspect the only reason they aren&#x27;t selling full EVs is that the number of people willing to shell out for them is still so small.')
