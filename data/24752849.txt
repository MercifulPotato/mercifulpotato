BlueCross organizations HAVE NO FACILITY to receive insurance claims directly whether electronically or otherwise. They must rely on a third-party called a &quot;clearinghouse&quot;, which as far as I can tell is an Excel Macro posing as a C level corporation.<p>in conclusion:<p>the total package of QEMU + OS9 + Medical Housecall is about 1.5gb and it runs off a usbdrive.<p>Our health is our most basic of needs, Any systemic improvements would benefit us all.\n26 years of human progress later; how far back have we fallen?')
