Item(by='barumi', descendants=None, kids=[25007835], score=None, time=1604672128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007218, text='&gt; Can jq do what gron does?<p>It really depends on what you want to do, and thus what think gron does.<p>If all you want to do is search for properties with a given value then yes, jq does that very well.<p>Unlike gron, jq even allows users to output search results as valid json docs. Hell, jq allows users to transform entire JSON docs.<p>However, if all you want to do is expand the JSON path at each symbol then I don&#x27;t know if jq supports that usecase. But then again, why would anyone want to do that?')
