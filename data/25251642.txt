This way, the author&#x27;s new diet will seem more exciting and interesting than if they jumped straight from steak and ice cream to rice and beans.<p>A diet of pure potatoes is obviously unsustainable and unhealthy, but this is only temporary. (IMO the keto diet that I&#x27;ve seen other commenters pushing is also unsustainable, but whatever works for people.)')
