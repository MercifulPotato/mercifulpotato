Other than assembly, Forth (similar to assembly in many ways), and esolangs such as Befunge (also quite similar to assembly), languages that see widespread use always check types <i>eventually</i>. Checking types <i>eventually</i> is table stakes. Checking types at compile time, before what you wrote has a chance to explode on you in an unpredictable manner when that one branch for an edge case finally gets taken after a few days of uptime, that&#x27;s the truly desirable feature that not all languages manage to provide.')
