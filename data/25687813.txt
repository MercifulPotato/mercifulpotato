It tells me we don&#x27;t have a functioning chain of command and our government is currently responding to a hard coup attempt with a soft coup which is also pretty scary.  Trump should either be removed through the 25th amendment or he should be president with all its power and responsibility.  Putting &quot;safeguards&quot; in place so no one really knows who is in charge can be dangerous.  Hopefully nothing too serious happens in the next week and a half.<p>EDIT: To be clear and to address the multiple replies, I am not a Trump fan or a supporter of nuclear weapons or anything along those lines.  The problem here is that there needs to be a clear chain of command in case of an actual emergency.  People being insubordinate to the president and taking on power that they do not constitutionally could be extremely dangerous in an emergency.  The unelected bureaucrats of the government shouldn&#x27;t be the ones making these decisions.')
