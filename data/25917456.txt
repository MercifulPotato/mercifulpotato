I can buy bread for roughly the same amount of dollars I bought it for last year.<p>&gt; <i>You can&#x27;t &quot;print up&quot; a few trillion Bitcoins. You can&#x27;t add more. You can&#x27;t magically make them go away (unless of course your throw away your hard drive with the wallet data on it...).</i><p>You can do plenty other funny things if you have equivalent amount of power.<p>&gt; <i>And unlike any other type of currency, where some shady deal can take place and there&#x27;s absolutely no record of it... there&#x27;s a ledger of every single transaction ever made on the Bitcoin network. You may not know who that address belongs to, but the transaction is there.</i><p>Sure. But instead, you can just... give someone the key to your address. Roughly equivalent to how shady deals happen with fiat - you give someone a briefcase full of cash.<p>All of that is irrelevant to the point here, though: the point is that if you tried to imagine an evil mastermind hell-bent on accelerating climate change, Bitcoin is what they would come up with - an engine of unlimited energy waste, fueled by naivety and unadulterated greed.')
