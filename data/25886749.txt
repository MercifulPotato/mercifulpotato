Not all of them are created equal. The ways in which they behave as the system changes can be wildly different. Well-written code will be able to handle those changes gracefully. Poorly-written code may end up proving brittle and bug-prone. Generated code will be completely unpredictable.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re trying to build a street network for a city. Some designs are much more predictable than others. If you&#x27;ve played Factorio, the distinction between a spaghetti base and one that has some design is abundant. Even if they currently fulfill the same requirements now, the ability to improve upon and reason about how it will behave after changes is vastly different.')
