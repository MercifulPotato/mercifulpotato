We&#x27;ve been using a similar feature for several years now in APIs at my work and haven&#x27;t run into any issues, though we do only use it very sparingly for fields that logically can never be missing. At some point a client has to make the call for what they consider essential, so pushing it in the schema makes this less ambiguous from what I&#x27;ve seen. Maybe it&#x27;s fine for our use-case (mostly static APIs), whereas what you&#x27;re saying is good advice in general.')
