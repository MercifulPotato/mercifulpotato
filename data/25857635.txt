You arrive at the island and among unfinished buildings you see - a giant ventilator the size of a building, an air balloon ready to fly, and a room completely filled with a floor mops. After some head scratching you remove all this junk and complete the laboratory. But right after the scientists start their work you hear an alert - &quot;ALARM, TOXIC GAS LEAK DETECTED!&quot;.<p>- What is going on?! - you are crying, and call the previous foreman.<p>- Hi Alex, we have a toxic gas leak in the lab, what can we do now?<p>- Hmm, I dunno, did you change anything in the project?<p>- Well, I&#x27;ve thrown away floor mops...<p>- They were holding the ceiling.<p>- I&#x27;M SORRY WHAT? HOLDING WHAT AGAIN?!<p>- There are gas tanks on the floor above, very heavy, so I had to to fill the room below with mops to hold them.<p>- You could have wrote some note, you know. What should I do now?<p>- Turn on ventilator, it will blow the gas away from the island.<p>- I&#x27;ve removed it a long time ago.<p>- Why?<p>- Why did you built 100 ton ventilator in the first place? You could have just prepare a box of gas masks.<p>- I would have need to search for gas masks and ventilator was a leftover from my previous project, so I&#x27;ve used it.<p>- Alex, we are suffocating here and there is no ventilator! We need help!<p>- The fuck are you doing there then? Get on the air balloon and fly away.')
