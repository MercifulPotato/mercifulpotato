If 99% of driving is EV and 1% is ICE then we have a much smaller problem to deal with.<p>Not long ago, people predicted EVs would never get to the point they are now. The picture will be entirely different in 10 more years. By the time we&#x27;ve replaced the first 90% of ICE vehicles, the solutions to the last 10% will become more obvious than they are now.')
