Whether with the default audio device picker (which doesn&#x27;t work correctly once you&#x27;ve installed PulseAudio) or PA&#x27;s own &quot;pavucontrol&quot; selecting output device is snap.  Sometimes you have to restart the audio-producing program to use the new selection, which is a feature, not a bug - you could have different programs use different audio devices at the same time.<p>So to get the usual 3.5mm jacks, just buy a cheap USB&#x2F;analog headset adapter; about $3 from Ali Express.  Select as input and output, and done.  Microphone is usually not an issue if you&#x27;re using a webcam since most have an adequate one built in.')
