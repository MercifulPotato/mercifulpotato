So they typically blow through stop signs and such. Now it&#x27;s been quite some time that I&#x27;ve biked in the Bay but when I did I remember in Berkeley they solved this by putting blocks at intersections so cars had to stay on the main road.<p>But honestly where I feel safest, as both a driver and a cyclist, is in protected bike lanes. I&#x27;m much more scared of someone dooring me than I typically am of a car hitting me. I&#x27;ve adopted strategies to avoid moving vehicles but parked ones I&#x27;m typically forced to stay pretty close to and my avoidance options are usually 1) swerve into traffic and hope that the car next to me is paying attention and also avoids or 2) hope my brakes work super well and I can do a turn slide and hit the car door sideways. But natural reaction it to go with option 1 and 2 still sucks.<p>The issue is that cyclists aren&#x27;t motor vehicles <i>or</i> pedestrians but we typically classify them as both (hell, one of the most recent Simpsons made this joke). If we&#x27;re going to be encouraging cycling, and I think we should, we really need to rethink this classification conundrum.')
