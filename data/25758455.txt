Of course the north wasnt interested in war over slavery.</i><p>That&#x27;s kind of my whole point. The North wasn&#x27;t interested in war over slavery, and the war wasn&#x27;t about emancipating slaves rhetoric. It was about the North conflicting with the South over economic operation, interests, and state control.<p>Slavery just happened to be the way that was expressed in the South, so it became the contentiuous issue, but as a second order effect.')
