The Mac-faithful of HN have been angered with your peasant  tales! You will be flagged and must never speak of this again!<p>Well... that ain’t gonna happen, hate to break it to ya. I switched to Manjaro years ago and never looked back. I’m still excited about it and glad to talk about any and all aspects of my multiple workstations that all run perfectly. I’m really happy with them because unlike my Mac, an update has never bricked any of my machines or stopped me from running apps with their “safety” measures.<p>Sorry Mac users that your passion for computing has withered away at altar of Apple and now you want to stop others from discussing their own kits. It’s to be expected though - Apple gives you no freedom, so you want to take it away from everyone else... Good lick with that!')
