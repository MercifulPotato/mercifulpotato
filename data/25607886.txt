I don&#x27;t see how we can let this continue.<p>I originally decided not to, even though this personal attack was so awful, and so low. (I&#x27;ve left my earlier post intact below this one, for those who want the gory details.) But I changed my mind after doing something that I should have done in the first place: I looked at your account&#x27;s recent history. I hadn&#x27;t done that in a while, and much to my dismay, it had gotten considerably worse.<p>Obviously my efforts to persuade you have failed. That fucking sucks, because I have admired your technical comments; sympathy for APL&#x2F;array languages is my Achilles&#x27; heel for one thing, and when you post substantively, your posts often contain information that doesn&#x27;t otherwise appear here. But it seems the only way we can get that is with poison, and the poison levels have been going up not down. We simply can&#x27;t have that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
