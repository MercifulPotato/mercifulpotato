While your elaboration on Bridgegate is creative, as the poster above mine mentioned, other conspiracies involving multiple domains have been found to be true or at least partially true. Epstein island, MkUltra, etc.<p>So the approach I would take would be to isolate each claim in a conspiracy and assign some weighted value to each claim. Connecting aliens to Bridgegate would be obviously a tiny fraction of a percentage of likely to be true. But if someone were to make the claim that Bridgegate was connected to payouts from a lobbyist firm or that Chris Christie was associated with Jeffrey Epstein, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily dismiss that claim outright. It would remain an unverified but reasonably possible claim that would need further info or investigation.')
