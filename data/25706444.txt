They wanted to learn to do something but were waiting to take a class when there were all sorts of good free learning resources available for that skill.  Sometimes your mind doesn&#x27;t want to do something and you rationalize &quot;okay I&#x27;ll do it when I have X Y and Z&quot; but really you&#x27;re trying to ignore the fact that the only thing holding you back is that you really don&#x27;t feel like putting that work in, and having the perfect workout or starting a class won&#x27;t necessarily change that.  Sometimes we need to tell our brains to shut up and just do the thing.')
