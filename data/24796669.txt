All reviews are added as pull requests (the site could have a form that creates a PR in the background) so every change to the site is audited.<p>This way the site can&#x27;t just delete bad reviews or change ratings at will.<p>For sites like glassdoor ID verification could be done with a group of people in which 2-3 of them check the ID and approve the PR.<p>This model makes sense for any site which could be improved with a public log of why changes were made, a category most review sites fall into.<p>The site also gets free hosting so can be run as a community project with donations without needing a profit model.')
