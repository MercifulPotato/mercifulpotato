India has a ridiculous bureaucracy, and South East Asia cannot simply scale to Chinese manufacturing levels.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s still a critical step in making sure the CCP understand their are consequences for their actions, specifically with its horrible practices in covering up COVID and lying about its susceptibility with Human to Human transmission and its censoring and dissapearing of it&#x27;s citizens and its crimes agianst Humanity in Xianjing, and Hong Kong.<p>What consequences? Disney launched Mulan right during the HK protests. Everyone&#x27;s still doing business with China.<p>If you want business to stop with China, you&#x27;ll have to swallow the bullet and let the stock market fall. Let companies like Disney, Apple and Tesla suffer from a total embargo against China, and sanction countries from doing business with China, else they get sanctioned. Cool, now the US just tanked their stock market, sanctioned everyone on the planet including the EU, LatAm, Middle East, India and SEA, which in turn leads to everyone sanctioning the US back, while China establishes trade relations with them. Suddenly everyone in the Old World is using Sina Weibo and Baidu and Alipay and Wechat Pay.<p>China is too integrated to the world economy now, in some way or the other. Cutting it off is going to be too self damaging for the US. Blame Kissinger, Apple, etc.')
