People graduate CS programs with little to no coding ability in many cases. There is no certification program like there is for, say, accountants or CPAs. Companies set the hiring bar all over the place. At a lot of companies, bad hires stick around for years.<p>Other industries have higher and more consistent standards, and certification processes. The software industry is the wild west, and that is partly why it has succeeded and why so many self-taught programmers have found success in it. The other side of the coin is that the quality of candidates varies more widely than in other industries.')
