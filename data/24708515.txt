There should be a reallybuyforyourwholelife.com :) I mean cast iron skillets are spot on, but I don&#x27;t see most fridges, shoes or socks last a lifetime (though obviously there&#x27;s going to be huge differences between brands and types in durability). Then realized it&#x27;s hard to come up with a mechanism forcing users to really post only this particular &#x27;last a lifetime&#x27; category. Except goodwill. Though on the other hand if the site gets used enough, the reviews sort it out automatically.')
