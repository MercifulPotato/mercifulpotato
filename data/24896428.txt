Some differences:<p>(0) The Olimex board files are in Autodesk&#x27;s Eagle schematic editor, which is not free software, and Autodesk keeps making it harder to get and to use. Yours is built in KiCad, which is much more OSHW friendly.<p>(1) USB connector and integrated CH340 RS232 driver. The Olimex requires you to configure an external serial device to program it.<p>(2) The genuine Omron relay, neither board has great high-voltage isolation, but I&#x27;d be a lot more trusting of Omron than the import relay that&#x27;s not even available at any of the main US&#x2F;EU distributors.<p>(3) 5V TTL UART with Max232 driver - the Olimex has 3.3V UART, which is available, and is usually going to be functional with a 5V input, but most of the cheap USB-RS232 drivers and other sensors and devices you&#x27;d connect to this send 5V by default.<p>(4) 16 MB SPI Flash vs 2 MB (aka 128 Mb vs 16 Mb). Modern web pages are resource heavy!<p>(5) Micro-USB and screw terminals vs barrel jack for 5V input (or 0.1&quot; pin header) - I have USB chargers up to my ears, no thanks to Apple, but not as many barrel jack connectors.<p>(6) IR sender&#x2F;receiver and general-purpose red and green T1 LEDs - the Olimex has a single red 0603 SMD power LED and a green activity LED on the TX pin, but the Malouf board has MOSFET-driven large indicators on the GPIO and has IR functionality built-in.<p>(7) Single-board vs daughtercard - The Olimex is two boards in one, a slightly weird choice.<p>(8) Availability - The Malouf board is available on Amazon Prime, the Olimex ships from Turkey for $15 via DHL.<p>With shipping, the Olimex is more expensive; not that it really matters at this price point - users will be spending time worth far more than the cost of the board to get it to do anything interesting.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a customer of the Malouf board, bought it after seeing the previous discussion a month ago and am a happy customer. I&#x27;m still at the &quot;Hello World&quot; stage, flicking the relay and LEDs on and off with a socket connection; I&#x27;m working on assembling a 3D printer to control&#x2F;adjust remotely with the board.')
