There are metals with even more favorable properties that are even scarcer, yet they are valued less.<p>Platinum for instance was at one point considered the level &quot;above gold&quot;, but it has since been overtaken. Gold simply is the better brand. It&#x27;s the same for Bitcoin versus all other digital currencies.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s not really useful for now, people buy it only for speculation.<p>Speculation itself is useful. Bypassing the financial system is useful.<p>A price of $18,000 per unit of Bitcoin might sound ridiculous, but it needs to be considered that the market cap of Bitcoin, representing most of the world&#x27;s cryptocurrency market, is only $200 billion. That is comparable to the assets of a medium-sized US bank.')
