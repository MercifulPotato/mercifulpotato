How exactly was Parler, a social media site, a competitor to Amazon, Google, or Apple? It would be different if this were Facebook, but we&#x27;re talking about ecosystems&#x2F;infrastructure vs a single app&#x2F;website.<p>Also how can the power of three separate companies be a monopoly? The argument seems to be that Silicon Valley is itself a monopoly, except Silicon Valley is only a geographic location.')
