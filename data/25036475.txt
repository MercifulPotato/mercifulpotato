It&#x27;s no different than walking into an artists shop and asking if you can just have a painting. It doesn&#x27;t make you a terrible person, but I think it&#x27;s a problematic norm.<p>Now there&#x27;s no requirement that the developer actually take the compensation (whatever it is). If you don&#x27;t want it, add that to your README and never think of it again.')
