Making it cheaper for vertically integrated businesses to make money kind of forces bigger businesses to buy smaller ones.<p>This same idea also means that smaller businesses aren&#x27;t on the same playing field as bigger businesses, because they can&#x27;t afford to vertically integrate as much. They don&#x27;t have as much cash to spend. This means that small businesses naturally have a harder time growing.<p>And this becomes an oligopoly problem. The big businesses get bigger and the small businesses either get bought or get put of business.<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound like a healthy market to me. I would much prefer a market with many competitive small businesses that work with other small businesses to build products.<p>Better products and choice of products are guaranteed this way.')
