I have spoken of <i>behaviors</i> that I believe are unethical, and necessarily if someone in this thread is doing these behaviors then they may be offended by this. If we are unwilling to talk about ethics for the risk of offending someone who doesn&#x27;t meet them, then we are inevitably going to fail to uphold our ethics at all.<p>Some of the stuff megacorps are doing is so unethical that we would use it as a grandiose example for the purpose of debate. If there is a point at which it&#x27;s acceptable to call behavior out as unethical, and we aren&#x27;t there yet, then I don&#x27;t know where it is.')
