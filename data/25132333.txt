Twitter is more public facing and basically ephemeral status updates.  That and you can follow almost anyone and ignore the trolls, retweets.<p>Facebook has more personal information, pictures and friend relationships.  You don&#x27;t really want trolls spamming your FB visible to everyone.  In fact that&#x27;s what makes FB unattractive.')
