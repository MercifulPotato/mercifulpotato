Item(by='masklinn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609003938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544848, text='&gt; In the past, I&#x27;ve also used a different technique- if you simply concatenate a PNG onto a JAR (which is really just a ZIP archive) you end up with a file that acts like a PNG unless you change the extension to JAR, in which case it acts like a Java executable. This works because the PNG header is at the beginning of the file, while the ZIP header is at the end. Nowadays, though, desktop Java is pretty much dead, so it&#x27;s a less exciting party trick.<p>It was a common party trick for the reasons you outlined on image boards: you could smuggle small-ish zip files as long as the board made the original file available as-is somehow by concatenating the image (usually jpeg) and zip.')
