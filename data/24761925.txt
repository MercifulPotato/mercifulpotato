Couldn&#x27;t one create separate training sets such as plants in varying biomes, unique architectural styles, and divergent cultural artwork, and then apply these sets to create new textures and primitives for decorating levels? This would keep different levels&#x2F;environments&#x2F;dungeons&#x2F;whatever feeling fresh while saving on the laborious work of drawing &quot;stone texture #43&quot; or having the same painting in every tavern in the land.<p>Obviously I&#x27;m thinking of graphical rogue-lites like One Must Fall or In Death, or RPGs with procedurally-generated elements, not classic text-based games like Rogue or Hack.')
