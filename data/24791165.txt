This inevitably creates problematic situations that allows for market position abuse such as:<p>* Apple is Spotify&#x27;s biggest competitor.<p>* Spotify has to pay Apple 30% of it&#x27;s revenue purchased through iOS to Apple.<p>* Apple has to pay 0% of it&#x27;s revenue purchased through iOS to Spotify, and can use Spotify&#x27;s profits to subsidize their own offering.<p>* Spotify is explicitly not allowed to suggest alternative payment methods, and will be removed from user devices if this happens.<p>* Apple owns the payment method, and uses iOS to further cement its market position with Apple Pay.<p>* Spotify has limited platform control, and can&#x27;t be pre-installed on the device.<p>* Apple uses it&#x27;s market domination of iOS to default to, and encourage users to, sign up for Apple Music during the device installation process.<p>Is this a fair marketplace?')
