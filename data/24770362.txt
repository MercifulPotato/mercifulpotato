Imagine a world in which buses replace cars as the primary mode of transportation. You&#x27;ve now got many, many more buses on the road. So, if there is a collision, rather than probably being car-on-car or car-on-bus, it&#x27;s most likely to be bus-on-bus. That will raise the fatalities per billion passenger miles in two ways: (1) The amount of energy in a bus-on-bus collision will be quite a bit larger than when a car hits a bus or a car hits a car. (2) When there is a fatal collision, the number of fatalities is likely to be higher. (It takes no stretch of the imagination to imagine if one person on a bus dies in a collision, his fellow passengers are more likely to also die.)<p>You also have second-order effects, like vastly reduced visibility for bus-drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists...<p>&gt; Forcing manufacturers to deal with the externalities we&#x27;re discussing would also incentivize them to encourage safe driving, no?<p>No. Not if they don&#x27;t actually have any control or responsibility over the externality, like in the case of drunk driving, which was my original point. The only things a manufacturer could do in that case is fight for prohibition or install a breathalyzer in every car. The former was tried and turned out to be pretty bad for society. The latter probably would destroy the industry and&#x2F;or be trivially worked around by the dedicated drunk.')
