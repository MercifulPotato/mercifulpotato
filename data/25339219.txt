Part of the road is now used as the Crater Rim Trail, and if you pan around a little bit, you can see just how close the trail is to the current rim of the crater. I don&#x27;t know how long ago those pictures were taken, but my recollection of the road&#x27;s condition circa 2005 when I hiked the trail wasn&#x27;t all that much better.<p>While the parts of the ex-road that are now used as a trail are in decent enough condition, the parts that are not are not in any condition to be used as a path. Admittedly, this is the windward side of Hawaii (and hence <i>very</i> conducive to fast growth), but the usable lifespan of an unused, unmaintained asphalt road should generally be figured in the region of a few decades at most.')
