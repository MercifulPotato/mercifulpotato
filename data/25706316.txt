I&#x27;d be most worried about India and Pakistan.<p>They both heavily depend on Himalayan glaciers for fresh water, and that supply will be heavily affected by climate change if the world does not act. They could easily end up at war over water rights.<p>Neither of them has the really big nukes the big players have, but it turns out that you don&#x27;t need big nukes to cause serious worldwide problems.<p>This paper [1], summarized in this article [2], looked at a scenario where India and Pakistan have a nuclear war involving 100 nukes of the size as the one used on Hiroshima (15 kiloton blast), directed at the most populated areas. That&#x27;s about 1&#x2F;3 of the total number of nukes those two countries have.<p>They estimated based on the amount of combustible material in the target areas that the resulting firestorms would put about 1.5 Tg of soot aerosol into the upper atmosphere. They then apply climate models to predict the effect of that.<p>The result is a 1.8 C temperature reduction and 8% precipitation reduction for several years, which would have a serious effect on food crops. They used state of the art crop models to estimate food loss over time. They found the strongest effects would be in temperate regions of the US, Europe, and China for 10 to 15 years.<p>It&#x27;s not an end of humanity scenario at that point, but would result in widespread world hunger for a long time, and not just in the poor countries. That could trigger wars involving more of the world&#x27;s nuclear powers, including ones with much bigger bombs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;117&#x2F;13&#x2F;7071" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;117&#x2F;13&#x2F;7071</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.ei.columbia.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;even-limited-india-pakistan-nuclear-war-would-bring-global-famine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.ei.columbia.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;even-limited-india-...</a>')
