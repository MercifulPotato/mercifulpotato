IPv4 only hosts are not reachable on the IPv6 net. It replaces rather than extends IP, and I can’t figure out why they did that.<p>IPv6 cannot be an extension of IPv4 since IPv4 is not forward-compatible.\nIt has nothing in it that would allow stuffing more address bits into it.\nAnd since you cannot encode more than 32bit in 32bit you will never be able to have a IPv4 successor that can just interoperate with IPv4 - you will always end up in exactly the same situation as IPv6 is right now.<p>And if you just want to route your IPv4-ng over IPv4 in the core or something (which is what your idea is more or less).\nYou can do that with IPv6 as well: Use 6in4 tunneling.<p>But you are still at the same problem that a IPv4-only cannot communicate with an IPv4-ng-only host, since it is unaware of IPv4-ng.')
