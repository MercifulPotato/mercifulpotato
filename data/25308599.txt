If Google can&#x27;t compete people move on.<p>This is an odd phrasing: Apple&#x27;s pricing isn&#x27;t higher than the competition — flagship Android phones frequently cost noticeably more — and when it comes to performance it&#x27;s very hard to beat the $400 iPhone SE2 at any price.<p>Vertical integration is what allows Apple to be ahead on both price and performance. The only way Google is matching that is with a strong long-term commitment to make similar investments. Apple will falter at some point but after years of ignoring the basics Google won&#x27;t be able to take advantage of that — especially since at this point they&#x27;re chasing Apple&#x27;s previous generation so it&#x27;d take an extended sag for Google to catch up much less surpass with their current half-hearted strategy.')
