Shock sites were huge (goatse, tubgirl, etc), and I remember watching a beheading with a chainsaw by a Mexican cartel. And of course porn was around too.<p>The difference with social media is the &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; except now it&#x27;s your entire life, not just your literal neighbor. Way more damaging long term, since you actually know these people and can relate to them. Yeah the beheading was shocking, but I&#x27;m not hanging out with cartels regularly. Just a completely different thing.')
