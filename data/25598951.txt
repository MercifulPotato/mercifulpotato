The idea of Bitcoin as a digital gold has always made the most sense to me. While the initial goal may have been to use it as a literal form of digital cash, what it&#x27;s evolved into isn&#x27;t exactly a failure imo.<p>It seems that instead of wiping the slate clean, it&#x27;d be better to more actively promote Bitcoin as just that, gold, not cash. Then, on the technical side, focus on making the conversion of that &quot;gold&quot; to a more cash-like cryptocurrency as easy as possible.<p>I&#x27;m not terrible well-versed on the technical side of Bitcoin (just a high-level understanding), but this post seems kind of fatalist. Bitcoin is a success purely on the basis that over a decade later, after countless claims on its death, it&#x27;s still chugging along. That resiliency deserves credit.')
