The best comparison is that it is like a picture (static sampling) versus a movie (dynamic sampling). It makes a huge difference: you can actually prevent blood glucose fluctuations, blood glucose lows&#x2F;highs, with a continuous glucose monitor. With a blood glucose meter, at least with type 1 diabetes, you really only can take action after the blood glucose (static sample) is taken, and you really cannot use informed insight moment to moment to prevent things.<p>The continuous glucose monitors tend to be pretty accurate. The Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) for the ascribed devices:<p>Freestyle Libre 3: 9.2% (in adults)<p>Freestyle Libre 2: 9.2% (in adults)<p>Dexcom G6: 9.0% (in adults)<p>Also, I regularly test my blood glucose using finger sticks whenever I need to take a fairly large insulin dose and there is a large amount uncertainty of where I may possibly be (such as when my two sensors have a big discrepancy, and especially when my blood glucose is fluctuating). For that, I use Freestyle Lite blood glucose test strips.<p>About 1 in 25 to 1 in 30 Freestyle Lite test strips I use is about 50 mg&#x2F;dL off, despite me using proper testing technique, which is quite significant, since my blood glucose values are very tightly managed. It is obvious when it happens, looking at the Freestyle Libre 3 graph, and the Freestyle Libre 3 in this case keeps me from overdosing and causing a serious low.')
