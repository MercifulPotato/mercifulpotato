They will insert executable code into a HTTP reply.<p>In other words, preventing HTTPS might support the subjugation of your users by others.<p>Sounds silly but once RMS said &quot;proprietary software subjugates people&quot; and it sounded like weird over-the-top political rhetoric when I heard it.
