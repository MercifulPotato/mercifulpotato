I have been told that a highly skilled tech can splice a single strand in a matter of minutes. Looking it up, I find figures of an average of 30 minutes per joint for 4-strand bundles, and slowing down from there. So if you have a 144-strand bundle to repair, or multiple 144-strand bundles, it&#x27;s going to take several hours to effect the repair, and you&#x27;re probably going to have to rotate through techs to avoid fatigue-induced errors slowing things down even more.')
