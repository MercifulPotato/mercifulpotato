I could make a freelance software guild, but no one would want to join that (I wouldn&#x27;t due to sketchiness&#x2F;no-pay) ,maybe I could have a low retainer for developers to be on standby (like lawyers)  and save a certain number of hours per month for when work floods in. Retaining developers would be a bit of fun -like a club of sorts or a guild. I&#x27;m not sure what the rates or sustaining would go (I&#x27;ll pay you X money to do nothing until I need you). \nit would certainly build communication to an extent if it was a 2 week check in.')
