I&#x27;ve heard people at Bloomberg in London complain about this in the past; people have said to me they&#x27;ve found good candidates but because one person on the team said no, it&#x27;s a no hire, and they ended up hiring someone whose distinguishing feature is &quot;nobody actively disliked them as a candidate&quot;.<p>I guess it&#x27;s a good thing if nobody has an individual veto; I understand in the case above anyone on the team could individually veto.')
