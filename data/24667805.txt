I&#x27;d specifically warn against going to a Meetup thinking that you&#x27;re going to get anything out of it aside from just enjoying the Meetup itself.<p>With that in mind, I happen to meet a nice girl last year after asking if she was there for the meetup. She wasn&#x27;t , but she took my number down and we enjoyed each other&#x27;s company.<p>But if you&#x27;re looking at meetups in your area, and you&#x27;re imagining which one&#x27;s going to be the best, to meet someone you&#x27;re not going to have a good time . You&#x27;ll be so focused on that, you won&#x27;t enjoy yourself.')
