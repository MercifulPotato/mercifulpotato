I don&#x27;t see why it would be any different for something like Ebola. You&#x27;d still have the same viral Facebook videos calling it a hoax and a conspiracy. You&#x27;d have the same toothless, unenforced &quot;orders&quot; from the government to quarantine. You&#x27;d have the same people refusing to cooperate Because Freedom. I don&#x27;t see why anything would be different except for the number of deaths.')
