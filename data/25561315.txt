For a while (before Thinkpad X200), it was the go-to choice if one wanted a laptop with 100% free boot firmware and zero binary blob (the original boot firmware codebase is buggy and ancient, but with source, later GNU developers made it run GRUB 2). I got it just because it was an interesting non-x86 machine.<p>It&#x27;s a bit disappointing that a would-be Russian equivalent couldn&#x27;t do the same (an understandable problem, the designers of the board have no control over it), otherwise it&#x27;ll also be a more hackable and interesting platform, at least for those who are fans of exotic non-x86 systems and don&#x27;t care about price or performance.')
