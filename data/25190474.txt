It started as a PR effort to get government help for the CleanTech industry which was emerging in the U.S., primarily for developing better solar and wind. The PR effort along with the regulatory systems to retard oil extraction was so well done that many other industries and nations piggy-backed on it later.<p>When China copied the CleanTech technologies and started mass manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines, they kept fueling the same PR agencies to keep pushing the same ideas. Similarly, the same PR infrastructure was used by the middle eastern and European powers to stop shale oil extraction in the U.S. because they saw U.S. energy independence as a threat.<p>Some U.S. interests, specially the shale oil front, don&#x27;t want to associate with the CleanTech green stuff anymore, so they have started developing another narrative. You can see current draft of it as a Michael Moore documentary released earlier this year... where he talks about how green energy efforts actually harm the environment... but since there is not much money in nuclear, he conveniently omits any discussion of nuclear in it.<p>Some other U.S. interests still heavily rely too much on &quot;climate change&quot; to let it go. So, it&#x27;ll be interesting to see how this develops.')
