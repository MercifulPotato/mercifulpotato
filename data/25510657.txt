Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[25513295], score=None, time=1608668071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501156, text='&gt; My basic premise, is, as I said: &quot;it&#x27;s worth asking both questions: Is racism really at play? And given America&#x27;s lasting, endemic racism, is there reason to think something makes it absent in a given case?&quot;<p>Yes, and this premise is flawed. You’re thinking of “racism” as one phenomenon weaving together the enslavement of Black people and skepticism about Chinese food. My point is that this is not a useful way to understand what’s happening.<p>Look at it this way. In Bangladesh, where I’m from, we also have many negative stereotypes of Chinese food. My impression is that such sentiments are common across the sub-continent. But obviously we don’t share what you’re calling “America’s lasting, endemic racism.” What you’re calling anti-Chinese racism is an expression of the xenophobia that exists in nearly every human society.<p>Anti-Black racism in America is completely different. It didn’t <i>cause</i> slavery. It was constructed <i>to justify</i> slavery and colonization: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2015&#x2F;sep&#x2F;08&#x2F;european-racism-africa-slavery" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2015&#x2F;sep&#x2F;08&#x2F;europe...</a>. There is a superficial similarity, insofar both involves in-group versus out-group antagonism. But anti-Black racism isn’t just one expression of the ordinary out-group antagonism that exists all over the world. It’s something quite distinct.')
