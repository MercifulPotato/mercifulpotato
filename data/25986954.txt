Not every tower is shared. &amp; private property damaged by any mob is I think never paid by government (that would take like million years). Most of this is insured.<p>I still believe that this was just a blackout ordered by Government. Same way it has ordered porn sites ban, &amp; many other blackouts. I remember in 2018 my district in Punjab was blacked out of any network for 3 days, &amp; when we drove across Satluj to Ludhiana, all networks were fine.')
