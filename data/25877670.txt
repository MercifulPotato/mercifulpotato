And I see why you&#x27;d think that, it&#x27;s not completely unreasonable, but it&#x27;s just not how the license is worded.<p>It&#x27;s either GPL with all the rights that entails, or you can&#x27;t (legally) redistribute it at all.<p>Now, <i>if</i> you own the copyright you can give out as many parallel licenses as you want. But pidgin &amp; libpurple have been around for 20 or more years and have had many, many contributors, and they have to explicitly give up their copyright or consent to the license change to do what you propose. That&#x27;s theoretically not impossible, but it&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> of work.<p>This is why some projects require you to sign copyright-assignment agreement before they will take your patchesâ€”it gives the project more flexibility to change the license in the future.')
