So yes, you can deduct a lot of your state taxes - provided you&#x27;re spending even more on an expensive home.<p>And yes, the tax rate is progressive, but the average rate is still around 9% at that income level (~36k). Marginal rate is just over 11%.<p>My overall point is just that almost all of the cost of living delta in CA is from taxes and housing. Didn&#x27;t mean to get too deep into the numbers.')
