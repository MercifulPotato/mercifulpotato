The WORST is when failures are time correlated.  Let&#x27;s say the same one capacitor dies on a particular model of drive after precisely 6 months of being powered up.  So everything is all calm and happy and smooth in operations, and then our world starts going sideways 1,200 drives at a time (one &quot;vault&quot; - our minimum unit of deployment).<p>Internally we&#x27;ve talked some about staggering drive models and drive ages to make these moments less impactful.  But at any one moment one drive model usually stands out at a good price point, and buying in bulk we get a little discount, so this hasn&#x27;t come to be.')
