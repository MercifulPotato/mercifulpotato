The furries aren’t quite literally and openly calling for people to execute sitting members of government. No one wants to ban the furries. Or the save the whales guys. Or the church of satan. No one cares what any of those guys do or say. It’s just the nazis. We have decided as a society that nazis shouldn’t be allowed to speak. No, we’re not going to listen to them because they have nothing to add. Their opinions do not matter. Pretending like they do and wrapping it up in a free speech argument is how we got trump in the first place.')
