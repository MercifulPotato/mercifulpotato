It&#x27;s a little unfair, given the standards of early eighties television, but still.<p>To the original point that you seem to disagree with - I think the person making that comparison will agree that the show is built around Guinness in a way the film is not built around Oldman. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s wrong, and which is &quot;better&quot; must be a point of personal preference. One could not make a show with Alec Guinness any other way, and the result is certainly worthwhile.<p>It really is a great show and of course I&#x27;d encourage anyone to watch both. A person reading your comment might end up being a little disappointed, though. The most eminent name on that list, and the one people outside the UK are likely to recognize, does not even have a speaking part.')
