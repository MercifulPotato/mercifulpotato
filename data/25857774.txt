The idea is moreso to have everyday people to talk with each other whereas with volunteer based model&#x2F;free therapy model you cannot scale, the use-case is purely medical and people often don&#x27;t take the plunge.<p>My assumption is that, if you are aware that the other person who you are talking is no different than you and is not trained person you are more likely to share.<p>The idea is not to have counseling based model. Further Talk therapy does not require professional training. Basically you can talk to anyone. I am moreso proposing this to those set of people who really find it to hard to make friends online or in-their social circles, or want to share something very deep secret about them which they cannot tell it to anyone expect a stranger. This like a having dedicated friend with whom you can talk and for sure the friend will get paid to talk with you.')
