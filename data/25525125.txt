It may sound weird but I do think Agnosticism or at least similar thoughts help on fear towards death.  Occam&#x27;s Razor is for better theories and models, but not for actual truth and the essence of existence.  Accepting agnosticism-like thinking means that you don&#x27;t have to worry about the existence of God or after life anymore, because you just have no way to confirm the truth.<p>So now life will be more like a game.  The fact that you don&#x27;t know if the judge is there indicates that you are somewhat freed from any known rules (I don&#x27;t recommend you breaking any social rules or laws though).  It is you and only you can decide what direction to go.  Therefore death, well, any game always ends no matter what it is.<p>A never-ending game will probably end in some unexpected and unwilling ways.  If there is no natural death anymore, then everyone can only die by accident.  Other answer mentions reverse aging techniques which I feel quite skeptical of because I don&#x27;t think you would want to live on a planet where inter-planet transportation is not ready but nobody dies anymore.<p>Regarding the cloud solution, Gmail outage can happen, why will Gbrain never be?  Says 500 hundred years later no physical person can claim your brain are still in use online, why don&#x27;t they remove you from the database silently?  Too many uncertainties there.<p>Dalai Lama once said, to find joyfulness is to take care of others and be empathy about others&#x27; pain.  Such imagination helps you to realize that there are painful things and miseries happening and they are far more worse than death.<p>Anyway, devote yourself to something you passionate about, keep seeking mortality and don&#x27;t blame yourself for it.  You either succeed and last to the end of all the universes, or you do something meaningful to people and die like all others.  Both are good.')
