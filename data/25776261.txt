We had a mature product which was a communication handset and it worked well and was stable. Our software engineers had pressed every button they could think of in every menu and there weren&#x27;t any problems.<p>Then we hired Kevin.<p>Kevin had the handset for 40 minutes before piping up &quot;crashed it&quot;. The lead comes over to have the sequence explained to her, and says &quot;huh, nice edge case&quot;. Half an hour later &quot;crashed it again&quot; (in a completely different way). Explains the sequence to the lead again. An hour later this happens again and he explains the sequence and she finally bursts out &quot;Why would you even do that?! How did you think of pressing those buttons like that with that timing?!!&quot;.<p>Good testers just think differently than software engineers.')
