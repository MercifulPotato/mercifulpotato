(or just phish them). That’s a good thing. A new standalone browser should be a separate case. Hopefully.<p>In an ideal world the Android&#x2F;iOS framework would enforce that an insecure embedded webview has a distinguishing User-Agent or some other tell that Google can check. A standalone browser wouldn’t have that and in theory wouldn’t be caught up by Google’s enforcement of this. That’s how it should work, but it unclear to me if that’ll actually happen.')
