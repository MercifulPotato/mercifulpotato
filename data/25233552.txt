They wondered why their employees, the &quot;babysitters&quot;, didn&#x27;t give the same effort and attention to their baby as we did. That is, no weeks significantly past 40 hours, no responding to email after hours, etc.<p>If you think of it in terms of babies and babysitters, it&#x27;s clearly absurd to expect the babysitter to bend over backwards to help your child outside their paid duty.
