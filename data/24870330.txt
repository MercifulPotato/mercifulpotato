Even if you live in an apartment, there should be either some shared courtyard space or a balcony. Even just going out into the hall. That&#x27;s basically what students did when I was in the dorms at college. Put some physical space between you and your work environment.<p>I live in a house, so I can just take a seat on the patio out back (as long as it&#x27;s not cold or raining like it is today), but there should be some equivalent. Do that for an hour then go back into your apartment and sign in for work.')
