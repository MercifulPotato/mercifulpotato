(However, Facebook Messenger dominates there, so it&#x27;s not as if the privacy situation is any better, Facebook Messenger is just a better app&#x2F;website to use).<p>Here in the UK I am literally <i>required</i> to be on WhatsApp to live in the building I currently live in. I have no choice in this matter. It&#x27;s just the default messaging service for everyone.<p>If you join any kind of club? WhatsApp group. If you want to talk to someone about renting a room or apartment? WhatsApp chat. Live with housemates? WhatsApp group.<p>Plus the whole fact that if I deleted facebook, I would cut off contact with my friends and family (I can&#x27;t expect like 25 people all to switch messaging services just for me). I would lose access to my thousand-dollar Oculus VR headset (I hate them so much for buying and linking facebook and Oculus, and hope a better competing standalone headset comes out).<p>And don&#x27;t forget, you can&#x27;t use an Oculus Quest with a blank facebook account you made just for that - they actually check that you&#x27;re really using the account and force you to verify with photos and ID.<p>They are the absolute epitome of evil. Facebook, in many ways, but particularly in regard to Oculus, is a moustache-twirlingly, cartoonishly evil organization.<p>Could I just never buy an Oculus? Hopefully one day. But when not just your hobbies, but also your study and skillset and career prospects are right in that industry, you swallow your pride and make a damn facebook account.<p>I was also required to be in facebook groups for university classes back when I was a student. I HAD to be on facebook to get a degree. And for an amateur theatre group I joined.<p>Not to mention everything going on with misinformation about elections, vaccines, etcetera etcetera.<p>Some of this stuff is now moving to Discord, which is probably <i>better</i> than anything owned by facebook, but being better than facebook is a damn low bar, and Discord is still ultimately a for-profit corporation that would sell your soul if it made them a dollar.<p>This &quot;just stop using it&quot; attitude you always get on Hacker News and reddit about facebook and their various messaging platforms baffles me. Do you people not have lives? Jobs? Friends? Family? If you (in or out of a pandemic lockdown) want to do just about anything outside your house, or a whole bunch of things inside it, you need to use Facebook services.<p>It sucks and I&#x27;ve love to stop supporting them but it&#x27;s not like most of us have a realistic choice.')
