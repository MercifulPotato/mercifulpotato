If you play a game that doesn&#x27;t have finger tracking, that just means you don&#x27;t get finger tracking. But the controllers themselves work just fine.<p>There are some games that might not have a good set of bindings for the index controllers by default (something might be bound to &quot;squeeze the grip&quot; when it should be bound to the trigger, for example), but you just open the settings menu (inside VR), click &quot;custom bindings&quot;, and then pick the most upvoted community made set of bindings and it just works. Takes a few seconds.')
