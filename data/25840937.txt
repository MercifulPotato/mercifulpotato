In the future, Brave plans to verify content retrieved through gateways by using its CID.<p>Does anyone know why this was omitted?  Verifying a hash is straightforward.  Both the old simple MerkleDAG format [0] and the new complicated IPLD format [1] allow fetching and verifying individual files inside a CID-addressed bundle.<p>&gt; Both requests you make and content you serve are observable by network peers.<p>That is a deceptive way to say, &quot;if you click the &#x27;Enable IPFS&#x27; button then your computer will continually publish your browsing history to the world.&quot;  And they make it too easy to enable.  It&#x27;s just a button below the address bar [0].  And the button has a deceptive name, &quot;Enable IPFS&quot;.  The browser can use IPFS through a gateway, so IPFS is already enabled.<p>There are many important projects to improve privacy and reduce tracking and monitoring of user behavior on the network: DNS over HTTPS, TLS Encrypted SNI, blocking third-party cookies, proxy services (incorrectly called VPNs), anti-fingerprinting work in browsers, and mobile privacy features.  Is there any work on making IPFS resistant to tracking?  Right now, IPFS seems like a step backward for privacy.<p>&gt; By default, Brave will load the URI being requested via a public HTTP gateway<p>&gt; If IPFS is not yet configured, the user will have the IPFS page loaded through the gateway <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dweb.link" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dweb.link</a>. [2]<p>Fortunately, Brave shows the gateway URL in the browser address bar.  This lets users know which company is tracking them.  For Brave users (dweb.link users), this is Protocol Labs <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protocol.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protocol.ai</a> , a VC-funded company in California.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ipfs-inactive&#x2F;papers&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ipfs-cap2pfs&#x2F;ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ipfs-inactive&#x2F;papers&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ipfs-cap...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ipld&#x2F;specs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ipld&#x2F;specs&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;brave-browser&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10220" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brave&#x2F;brave-browser&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10220</a>')
