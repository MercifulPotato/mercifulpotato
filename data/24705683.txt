He was hounded by the all kinds of shadowy enemies..and some say, the church.. he was always on the run from one threat or another. His paintings showed the violence and torment of his inner world. It is almost borderline erotic because he slapped on homoeroticism over religious iconography. I cant really articulate why i feel that way...even though I am neither gay nor male.<p>Having said that, noone does shadows as well as Caravaggio. Everything about his use of light and shadows is stark and raw...really sad and violent at the same time. I consider myself lucky to have seen his paintings first hand when it came up for a exhibit in London. I loved Caravaggio even more after that.')
