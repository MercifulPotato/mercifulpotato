Being raised in a Commie country, this brings back memories... but it&#x27;s even worse! People back then openly shared thoughts only in circles of trust. Personally, I&#x27;d rather allow people to say their hatred openly so that I know what they think rather than policing only their verbal output and disguise their thought process, which I only care about as that could lead to actions and harm! In fact, this censorship can only make people who have those destructive thoughts and ideas to do real harm more united as they now feel persecuted!<p>P.S. I didn&#x27;t know there are so many censorships fans on HN!')
