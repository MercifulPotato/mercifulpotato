And the hard stuff is boring---it&#x27;s always boring.  It&#x27;s the nitty gritty details that only a passionate specialist loves.<p>That being said, it sounds like what you&#x27;re missing is a group to work on projects with.  You don&#x27;t have to take the lead on programming, instead you can lead a small group of people in the right direction while taking the lead on a product and learn a lot there, or take on sales and marketing.  That&#x27;s exactly how I work on side projects, I have a group of 2-3 great engineers with a diverse set of interests, and I work more on the business side and get brought in for architecture&#x2F;stuck-on-a-hard-problem types of things.<p>Beyond even changing, it&#x27;s incredibly hard to be motivated and push a project forward alone.  Having a group makes it a lot easier, and I&#x27;d imagine that&#x27;s a big part of why there are almost no VC backed solo founders.')
