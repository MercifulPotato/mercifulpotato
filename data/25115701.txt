Buy a lot of ads on google. Then I&#x27;ll redirect customers that go there to whoever pays me the most money.<p>It&#x27;s literally the same business model that grubhub&#x2F;yelp have- misrepresenting myself as another company in order to make money- but turned around on them.<p>And maybe to make it more fun, if nobody pays then I&#x27;ll just redirect the user to 4chan or some other ugly corner of the internet.')
