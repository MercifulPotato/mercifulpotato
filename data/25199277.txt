The estimated reading time is 15.62 minutes. Later, when Marietta does her end-of-day statistical roundup, sitting in her private office at 9:00 P.M., she will see the name of each employee and next to it, the amount of time spent reading this memo...</i><p><i>Y.T.&#x27;s mom decides to spend between fourteen and fifteen minutes reading the memo. It&#x27;s better for younger workers to spend too long, to show that they&#x27;re careful, not cocky. It&#x27;s better for older workers to go a little fast, to show good management potential. She&#x27;s pushing forty. She scans through the memo, hitting the Page Down button at reasonably regular intervals, occasionally paging back up to pretend to reread some earlier section. The computer is going to notice all this. It approves of rereading. It&#x27;s a small thing, but over a decade or so this stuff really shows up on your work-habits summary.</i>')
