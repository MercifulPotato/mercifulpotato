Though, i&#x27;ve not looked into it. My hope was to make (as i mentioned) a Git-like layer for my data that was in the way i wanted <i>(wheels reinvented hah)</i>, which would work over SSH&#x2F;Email&#x2F;etc, and then plug it into a mature P2P setup. Matrix is definitely on the list of P2P impls i want to look into.<p>Though so far i&#x27;ve never heard of anyone actually using Matrix for a generic P2P backend. I&#x27;m curious what you&#x27;ve found on Matrix for this use case?')
