My new phone feels basically identical to my old phone, and despite 5 years of innovation I think it was a waste of money. Most of the improvements in iphones in the last 5 years has been in software, and the 6s (for now) still gets all the updates anyway.<p>There&#x27;s some differences - low light photography is much better. My new phone is also physically smaller with the same screen size and much snappier. But its also missing a headphone jack, force touch and it can&#x27;t be unlocked with a face mask.<p>I think next time I&#x27;ll keep my phone until it dies - which I&#x27;m hoping will be ~6-7 years. Given that sort of longevity, the price seems pretty reasonable.')
