It looks great when it&#x27;s a small flat object, but when you&#x27;re returning hundreds of unique fields and structures, lots of enums, etc - the result is an automated mess.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is strictly a fault of the spec, but of the UI. They seem to design it around the pet shop example, which doesn&#x27;t seem beneficial to any of our internal, large API responses.<p>Thoughts?')
