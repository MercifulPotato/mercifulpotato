There are also valid reasons to remove your own question, the most common is that you discovered a mistake that makes the entire question irrelevant. In that case you don&#x27;t want a bad answer stopping the cleanup. Deleting good content without a reason is against the rules, it just isn&#x27;t enforced by technical means in all cases. This is where moderators come into it to handle those cases, but you have to know to flag them for this.')
