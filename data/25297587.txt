Not necessarily as a race to the bottom (as we&#x27;ve seen in the airline industry, but that&#x27;s another topic), but in providing Visa&#x27;s <i>customers</i> with viable, more cost-effective alternatives.<p>And that&#x27;s been a problem (at least in the US) for a long time.  Big corporations buying up potential competitors in order to maintain both their market share <i>and</i> their overpriced offerings.')
