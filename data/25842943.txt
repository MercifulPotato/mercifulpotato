Mathematics treats 0 as special and can have all sorts of side effects if dropped into a formula, code doesn’t have this side effect (unless running formula as an algorithm, which is math).<p>To save yourself from headaches, I believe 0-based indexes are preferred in almost every modern language for the simple reason of optimization. I have no evidence to back this. NULL=Nothing=0 is a thing though.')
