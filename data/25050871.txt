Item(by='gknoy', descendants=None, kids=[25051682], score=None, time=1605037910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25049595, text='I only use it for brightness and volume controls (and TIL about the Emoji picker thanks to a sibling comment). I <i>LOVE</i> the analog-feeling controls on brightness and volume. Even though I know it&#x27;s the same under the hood as an incrementation button, the UX of it makes me feel substantially happier.  I absolutely miss the volume and brightness sliders when I go to use my Chromebook or my wife&#x27;s laptop.<p>I normally keep the touchbar configured to only show the ~4 most used buttons (night mode, brightness, volume, and mute), and find that I use the other buttons rarely enough that I forgot what else was on there -- mainly because I use touchpad gestures instead.<p>I rarely  (never?) used F-keys in my IDE (Jetbrains) or other apps, so I don&#x27;t miss them. I have a physical Esc key (which is nice), though I used it rarely enough on my previous generation touchbar mac that it wasn&#x27;t very infuriating.  Having the physical escape + power keys removed any complaints I previously had about it.')
