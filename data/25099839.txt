Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605434957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095194, text='&gt; So you just dismiss many of epidemiological or public health experts and accused them selling out.<p>Yes, there is no reason to listen to propaganda funded by obviously biased sources, when unbiased sources like the WHO and all major national health agencies say otherwise.<p>&gt; So you only agree the experts that fit your view.<p>I agree with unbiased experts, not experts who participate in privately funded propaganda. Show me a national health agency which opposes lockdowns and I&#x27;ll listen (though there are many more that do).<p>The only one I know of is Sweden&#x27;s, and there (1) a lockdown would be unconstitutional anyway, and (2) people have voluntarily locked down just as much if not more than in surrounding countries.<p>This is an important aspect you&#x27;re completely missing: the majority of the population understands the huge risks posed by this virus, and will lockdown anyway. The majority of people don&#x27;t want to go to work in crowded places, they don&#x27;t want to go to restaurants, they don&#x27;t want to spread disease among their employees.<p>Most multinational companies were in fact ahead of government lockdowns, as they also did simple math: lost productivity from employees working from home or in shifts &lt; lost productivity from employees sick or dead or permanently impaired from a disease, at least for employees who are not easily replaceable. So most if not all big companies started observing a lockdown as much as they could in February, regardless of any local regulations.')
