So it really has little to do with the time of day.  Right now it&#x27;s early in the afternoon for me; the sun is still up but it&#x27;s overcast, my window blinds closed, and my lights aren&#x27;t turned on because there is no reason for them to be on.  Dark mode works great in these sort of dim conditions.  It&#x27;s really a matter of comfort, not fashion.<p>As for &#x27;at work&#x27;, it&#x27;s been my experience that offices <i>generally</i> aren&#x27;t very bright.  Not even remotely as bright as daylight, nor even as bright as electric lighting <i>could</i> be.  Those overhead florescent bulbs produce a harsh shade of light.. but not all that much of it.  That&#x27;s why people squint or put on sunglasses when they walk out of office buildings during the day.')
