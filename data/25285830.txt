If we could have self replicating factories, then all we&#x27;d need to do is to import such a factory to a poor country and let it run. Of course automation is just half the problem, the other is raw materials. Presumably we could recycle almost everything and not need an unlimited quantity.<p>I bet we&#x27;ll reach technological self replication singularity before AGI, and the impact is going to be huge. Robotics, 3D printers, IoT, sensors, computer assisted manufacturing and logistics are going to be interesting in the next decades. I just hope they will be open source and not restricted by patents.')
