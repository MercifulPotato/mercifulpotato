In the case of a US-based office where such state-mandated supports are absent, and the employees have put together a body to enable collective bargaining, the supports—while less official and state-supported—may be of more immediate material benefit as they practically address current grievances.<p>&gt; <i>some EU countries mandate also union members into those</i><p>Do you have a reference for this? I&#x27;m curious to know which do and which don&#x27;t (it&#x27;s certainly not anything that&#x27;s been brought in at a Directive level).')
