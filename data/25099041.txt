I&#x27;m selling the right to direct your own life, commit to the good on your own terms and live a life of privacy. You know, freedom. There&#x27;s more to life than money, we used to kill for these outcomes. The violence stopped not because we improved but because there was no more freedom to be had. Now we just end lives over economic contrivances. I&#x27;m a dinosaur, I see the meteor hitting in 2140 and so does bitcoin and many others. The only answer is ghe unknown and darkness. I don&#x27;t sell out for power.')
