They created a business with basically only one source of income.<p>More importantly, they also then decided to scam their source of income by getting money from other sources (e.g. Patreon) and are now acting surprised when their own data host isn&#x27;t happy about not getting their cut of the revenue.<p>Reminds of a scam that cinemas attempted in my state - because the distributor wanted a % cut from movie tickets, they sold cheap tickets and then charged rent for 3D glasses required for a movie (e.g. 2EUR for ticket and 12EUR for the glasses). The distributors took their distribution rights because of that at all.<p>Trying to scam your most important source of revenue is just a really bad business decision.')
