So I have to supplement significantly more than what is normal.<p>After doing so, my colds have been far less severe then in the past. What made me go to such lengths testing myself was that I thought I was doing everything right and yet got pneumonia two years in a row.<p>So aside from testing your blood serum levels you should consider a genetic test to see  how well you absorb vitamin d.  You may benefit from above average dosage (consult your dr. Ymmv)')
