I realise that&#x27;s not a brilliant reason but that&#x27;s why.<p>I don&#x27;t want a numpad because getting my mouse closer to the center of my desk really helps with RSI for me. There weren&#x27;t many options left at that point, especially since I wanted a UK layout and no unstandard key sizes (limits your options with keycaps).<p>But yeah, if I could get something that looked as nice and had F+arrow keys I&#x27;d probably go for it.<p>Fwiw I got used to the chords you need to access those pretty fast.')
