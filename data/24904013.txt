Item(by='kortex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603766214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901502, text='&gt; In an era of fakes and deepfakes, we need tools like youtube-dl more than ever.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on deepfake detection for the past two years. I use pytube3 and youtube-dl to scrape hours and hours of footage, not just youtube, but cspan, news sites, anything I can get my hands on. I have ~100 hours pulled so far, at multiple encoding rates.<p>Facebook recently changed their API and now the best I can scrape easily is 240p. That&#x27;s insufficient to detect the artifacts the models need to train on. I can only pull 1&#x2F;3rd of cspan videos I can watch through the viewer because again, api changes. It&#x27;s a constant cat and mouse.<p>I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that if I don&#x27;t have those wonderful folks out there keeping these tools and test suites up-to-date, this project is <i>massively</i> disadvantaged.<p>I don&#x27;t have any public release assets at the moment, but you can read about Siwei Lyu and Hany Farid, who are leading the charge in deepfake detection.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.albany.edu&#x2F;~lsw&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.albany.edu&#x2F;~lsw&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurism.com&#x2F;expert-online-disinfo-covid-black-lives-matter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futurism.com&#x2F;expert-online-disinfo-covid-black-lives...</a>')
