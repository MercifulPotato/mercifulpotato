Consulting the local hosts file <i>isn&#x27;t</i> contacting the configured caching DNS server, so there is no SHOULD or SHOULD NOT violated by consulting hosts and then defaulting 127.0.0.1 if a more specific address in the loopback address range is not provided.<p>(Relying on a system-level name resolution API also isn&#x27;t contacting the caching DNS server, and if that API behaves according to spec, including potentially relying on local resources loke hosts but not remote DNS servers for localhost domains, that would also work.)')
