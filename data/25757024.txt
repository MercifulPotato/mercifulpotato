His post is to get the State to divest of equity and debt positions in any of the listed companies, not stopping them from operating or from him using it to communicate.  His point is they can choose who they do business with and so can the State of Florida, which if large States back out of buying bonds and prevent state retirement plans from investing in those companies it is a significant impact to the company, especially the more that do it.<p>2. Twitter, Facebook, Google et al have all advertised in Newspapers, on TV etc to tell people to use their platforms and to pull eyes away from the place they put the ad.  Hence they &quot;posted&quot; on the &quot;competitions&quot; platform to get peoples attention cause that is where they were at that point, the same for this politician.<p>3. Last point, no where did I see him say people shouldn&#x27;t use the platforms, just that the state &amp; local governments shouldn&#x27;t spend tax dollars on ads or allow state equity purchases etc.<p>His point is each of those companies have a right to choose who they do business with and so does the State government.')
