I’m voicing my surprise that a forum that is primarily members of the tech community would find it appropriate or necessary to aggressively censor comments that aren’t off topic or outright personal attacks or obvious trolling.<p>I don’t think comments from random individuals that aren’t publishers or people of interest, say a politician, should be censored just because others believe they are saying something that can’t be verified, in bad taste, speculative, or not backed by evidence. Take comments like that with a grain of salt. Don’t upvote it. Let people decide for themselves how much weight to put into a comment like that. To flag it so it can’t be read is to make that decision for others.')
