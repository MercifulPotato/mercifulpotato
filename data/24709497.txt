They&#x27;re 99% garbage.<p>Yes, in order to re-start, but what then?\nThe whole user reviews concept is bonkers, I would add that there are - besides &quot;fake&quot; reviews - &quot;real&quot; ones BUT written by clueless people (in good faith, but completely disconnected from an objective rating), and in this it is also way off the &quot;5 star&quot; rating where 4 stars are already &quot;not so good&quot;.')
