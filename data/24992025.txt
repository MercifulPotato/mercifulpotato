Item(by='DonaldPShimoda', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604517111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24987469, text='&gt; I also have the impression that CS papers all too often recapitulate the topic&#x27;s history.<p>It&#x27;s not really about history so much as context. Usually, you want to set up a paper with &quot;This is the state of X as it exists right now, but there exists this problem Y. We solve Y by starting from X and making Z advancement.&quot;<p>I think part of the issue is CS is exceptionally young (less than 100 years total, really), and the other part is how rapidly it&#x27;s advanced and diversified in that time (in terms of individual disciplines even within subfields). Without the context, I can&#x27;t readily jump to a paper from an adjacent-but-not-directly-relevant subfield without needing to look up a bunch of other stuff. And it&#x27;s not as straightforward to know where to look to find the relevant information. A paper 10 years old might be state-of-the-art or it might be completely outdated, and it&#x27;s hard to know which if you&#x27;re not immersed in that discipline. Having the context in the paper itself is a big help to ameliorating this.')
