I mean I know for a fact that it happens but in my experience this is rare. I very much doubt that it&#x27;s enough to make any real difference to the total size of the Windows folder.<p>I PowerShell&#x27;ed through all exe-files and DLLs in C:\\Windows and C:\\Windows\\System32 on my private computer (&quot;188 programs installed&quot; according to Control Panel) and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that didn&#x27;t look like Windows defaults (i.e. Microsoft stuff basically) or drivers (found lots of Intel, Logitech, etc. Some Apple).')
