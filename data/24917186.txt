My personal reference example is Amazon.<p>I&#x27;m consistenly amazed how the simple act of finding and buying a single product can become increasing unpleasant and difficult over time. Of course, I don&#x27;t subscribe to Prime, have one-click purchasing activated, use their credit card, etc, etc. These completely artificial UX hurdles are just there to push further engagement with their ecosystem.<p>It&#x27;s reached the point that even a monstrosity like Aliexpress feels like a clear, organised, efficient shopping experience by comparison.')
