The length of an interval must inherently include 0 as a unit to describe taking no units.<p>A 0 starting index is likewise also required to indicate skipping no storage cells.<p>Therefore an absolute index start must be zero based, and the Addition of duration must also include the option of zero as a means of describing a point at which to begin, but having not yet used any length.<p>The subtle trick is that is a point, an array of zero size; this is why the length, or alternately absolute stop point, for an array storing anything is one higher.  It isn&#x27;t actually zero indexed, it&#x27;s a different property of measure (the size or stopping address).<p>A centimeter is also a wonderful example since it should graphically contain eight additional ticks for millimeter marks, and naught else, among it&#x27;s inner span.  This aligns wonderfully with explaining that there are targets spots for 8 bits of an octet within that single byte of indexed storage.')
