Item(by='specialist', descendants=None, kids=[25673327], score=None, time=1610032889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661226, text='If I was a curious noob, how would I tackle this?<p>My provisional answer is that I&#x27;d host a conversation between experts.<p>For example, I&#x27;m now very curious about Apple Silicon M1 wrt to Java&#x27;s Memory Model and Project Loom (structured concurrency). But I don&#x27;t know nearly enough to even ask smart questions, much less understand the answers.<p>So my dream future perfect interview would have Ron Pressler, Doug Lea, and one or two people really smart about M1 (the only name I know is Dan Luu) sit around and chat it up.<p>I&#x27;d ask them open ended questions, like &quot;What&#x27;s new and different?&quot; &quot;What happens next?&quot; &quot;What are you excited about?&quot;<p>The conversations would likely happen over multiple sessions and different mediums. Because the experts would share and ask each other stuff which would prompt followups.<p>As podcast host, I&#x27;d try to be catalyst, try to remove myself from the convo as much as possible. I can&#x27;t think of any examples, role models. While I&#x27;m a huge fan of Ezra Klein and Adam Gordon Bell (Corecursive), I&#x27;m not confident I could lean in like they do.<p>One tactic both Lex and AGB do really well is prompt their guests to explicitly define jargon. I suspect that some of the perceptions of Lex&#x27;s ignorance are him trying to make topics more accessible. eg Working close to the metal with AI, I&#x27;m quite confident Lex knows about branch prediction.')
