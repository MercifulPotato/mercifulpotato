I know you probably tried everything, but it might be worth trying the random thing that ended up getting rid of my headaches completely. 30mg of melatonin every night. Yes, this is 10x the recommended dosage of 2-3mg. But it turns out there&#x27;s some random chemical imbalance in my brain causing these headaches. It&#x27;s not that documented but there are studies.<p>This worked for me almost immediately after the 2nd night. The euphoria of not being in pain lasted months. From one person who lived in constant pain to another, don&#x27;t give up!!')
