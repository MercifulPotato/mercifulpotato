Item(by='rz2k', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609263634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569130, text='Boyle&#x27;s Law describes a behavior without positing the mechanism.<p>What does it mean for a gas to heat up? Is the quantity of heat energy increasing, or the temperature?<p>A thermometer generally  measures the temperature of molecules adjacent to the thermometer, which is a function of the amplitude of those molecules&#x27; vibration. More molecules within a given space increases the heat capacity, and the total heat energy represented by a temperature of the total quantity of molecules, but the temperature is a function of the average heat energy per individual molecule.<p>The temperature increase described by Boyle&#x27;s law is a consequence of the work required to compress a gas—somewhere there has to be a compressor imparting kinetic energy to individual atoms.<p>Think of it this way, you have two containers of heat energy represented by 1L of an ideal gas at 1 atmosphere and 20°C. If you magically transported the contents of both containers into a single 1L container, and they continued to express a temperature of 20°C, you would have twice as much stuff, and contain twice as much heat energy in 1L. If on the other hand you had twice as much stuff <i>and</i> a higher temperature, then you would have increased the total amount of energy present in the universe.<p>The temperature comes from the extra energy put into the system to compress the gas rather than expressly from the density of the heat energy.')
