That&#x27;s just trading one dangerous footgun for another. Glad to see they finally found a better tool. I can&#x27;t function in JavaScript without Typescript...I constantly have to be looking up docs cause I don&#x27;t have intellisense, and once something works I&#x27;m terrified to ever touch it again. Typescript made front end development reasonable again...not perfect, but not so pathetically bad that I want to rage quit like I did before.')
