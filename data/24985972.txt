I’ve had my current Brother business class printer for over six years now. It’s huge but it prints on ledger size 11x17 paper (nice for flowcharts).  It works great with cheap Amazon generic ink cartridges as well.  Even the scanner is reliable. Half the printers I’ve used require all sorts of incantations to get the computer to recognize the scanner but not the Brother.')
