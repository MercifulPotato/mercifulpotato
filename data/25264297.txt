The old web didn&#x27;t have that property - if you used a colocation provider and wanted to switch, you drove down, picked up your hard drives, and left.<p>Same now, easier in fact. If I want to migrate from linode to digital ocean I simply restore my backup image. Indeed I do this automatically -- I have a site running on an AWS lightsail instance, which is backed up nightly to a linode server, and that backup is restored automatically onto linode with a minor script that changes the URLs from my production site to my test site.<p>It&#x27;s far more accessible than running my own server in a colocation.')
