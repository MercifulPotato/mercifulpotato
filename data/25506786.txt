Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=[25506923], score=None, time=1608648970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25505817, text='They really aren&#x27;t that small.  A single wide is 500-1200 sqft, which is fairly competitive with apartments in major cities.  A double wide is 1000-2000 sqft, which is competitive with most homes.  High rises are basically just bespoke stacks of trailers; the units are just planned by an architect and custom-created, rather than being pre-fabricated and stacked.<p>I would probably live in a trailer if they were priced cheaper than other options and not in a terrible area.  The latter is usually what kills it, as most cities have zoning laws that relegate mobile home parks to areas far from any kind of development.<p>Another complication is that in hot areas (the dense urban areas), most of your rent is going towards location, not to recoup the cost of building the thing.  I have no doubt that in SF&#x27;s financial district, they can probably recoup the costs of the building in a small number of years.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the land they&#x27;re built on is worth more than the building on top of it.  It doesn&#x27;t make any sense to put up a building that&#x27;s 10% cheaper, but ugly, when it only makes the whole project 0.1% cheaper.')
