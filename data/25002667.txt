We used MATLAB&#x2F;Simulink for signal processing and control systems. Octave, too (because our sensor technology teacher was more comfortable with that). x86 and Microship Assembly, C, and Pascal. Used LTSpice and NI Multisim for circuit design and simulation. Cadsoft EAGLE for printed circuit board (PCB) work. Played a bit with LabVIEW.<p>However, I started coding as a child with BASIC&#x2F;x86 Assembly&#x2F;C&#x2F;Pascal&#x2F;VB&#x2F;Delphi. Doing mostly Python for the past several years. I suppose one could find reasons to &quot;love&quot; or &quot;hate&quot; anything, but I always found that nuance keeps sanity.')
