But if the immunity really is strain-specific, the warnings about Covid becoming endemic in the global population should now carry a lot more weight. The virus will mutate. In a likely scenario, previous immunisations are likely to be less useful, and we all need annual shots against the <i>newly</i> emerging strains.<p>On the upside, if Covid strains become just another aspect of the flu jab, then we at least already have an existing infrastructure to manage it in the future. Production capacity of vaccines will take some time to ramp up, though. Maybe now would be a good time to invest in drug manufacturing and logistics?<p>Planet Money did an episode on Covid vaccine logistics and one data point stuck with me. The global production of vaccines is between 3.5B and 5B doses a year. That&#x27;s for <i>ALL</i> vaccines, across the entire spectrum of diseases and treatments. Adding another 12B to 16B doses on top of that is going to require a lot of new infrastructure, from production facilities to all the materials needed in the logistics chain.')
