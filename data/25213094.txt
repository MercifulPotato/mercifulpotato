Resource publishers pay blockchain fees to advertise their data for pinning.<p>We also found it necessary to build a kind of &quot;overlay&quot; to the p2p network (how each peer selects its peers) because the default algorithm produced too sparse a network. The probability of one node ever being connected to another node that holds content it would like to sync approaches zero. The topology for the overlay network is also fetched from said blockchain.')
