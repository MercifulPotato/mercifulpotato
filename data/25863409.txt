Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611259131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862779, text='I have a motherboard from 2012 and I just put 2x 8TB NVMe SSDs on it, on a PCIe 2.0 x16 slot<p>Works great. The PCIe card itself has 2 more slots for SSDs<p>The GPU is on the 2.0 x8 slot because they don&#x27;t really transfer that much data over the lanes.<p>I honestly didn&#x27;t realize PCIe was up to 4.0 now, and I am pushing up against the limits of PCIe 2.0 but it still works! And I’m “only” at the limits, and its only a limit when I want faster than 3,000 megabytes per second, which is amazing.<p>Granted, this would have been considered a good enthusiast motherboard in 2012. Buying new but cheap is the mistake.')
