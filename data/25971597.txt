There is no reason to give equal votes to all states. Why should citizes have unequal voting power ?. It is undemocratic in the U.S, The amount of power conservatives is disproportionate to the actual percentage of the population that wants them.<p>7. Jury system is not without its flaws. You talk about colonial era policy reformation. Juries are a commonwealth tradition! Mostly colonial countries have them.  india had them till the 50-60s, it was intentionally removed as part of justice reformation.<p>5. In a federal or union government the state should have this power. The integrity of the state requires this power. This excerise of this power needs strong checks and balances in place , but lack of adequate controls is not a reason not to remove it entirely.<p>6. Elected officials always have final decision making power. Civil servants are career professionals  sure have the ability to influence the decision making in what and how they present information to elected officials, abolishing civil service is basically like having a company with only senior management and no middle management. Who will execute the policy decisions?<p>4. Governor&#x27;s power in states (not union territories or ncr) is actually pretty limited and largely ceremonial. The president and governors are artefacts of transforming from a colony. They don&#x27;t have much power constitutionally by design. Electing them won&#x27;t solve the problems of the office, they will just influenced by corruption by needing votes as before .')
