But wlroots has pointers that have a <i>dynamic</i> invalidation mechanism. There have been a few big attempts in systems like this to try and validate everything as statically as possible, and just like you&#x27;d imagine, the mis-match leads to pain. Rust absolutely has ways of doing dynamic validation, some including unsafe, as you&#x27;ve noticed. But some folks will try to push the boundaries. And that can often be really good! That&#x27;s how progress is made. But like any experiment, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work out well.')
