I admit that I just don&#x27;t understand why people would be so up in arms about a $5 subscription. Like, just don&#x27;t read it? But also, many of us are professional programmers and $5 to get the answer we&#x27;re looking for is completely trivial. If you keep getting sent to Medium then that&#x27;s a sign.<p>In any case, the reality of Medium is that it&#x27;s a very big platform and some of what&#x27;s on it is shit and some is great. And that&#x27;s just the nature of platforms.<p>But as a publisher there, I do know that they are giving more money than they&#x27;ve ever announced publicly to authors and that  every month their investment in quality goes up. Essentially, every new subscriber puts more money in their budget which draws in a higher caliber of author. And on top of that, there&#x27;s more and more editorial work going on there which is what is necessary to bring articles up to the standard you might find in books.')
