Game designers across the industry may or may not have the ability to strongly influence or control many of those factors that you mentioned (dependent on the scale and organization of the job and game). However, designing the core gameplay loop and player incentives is nearly always a core responsibility of a game designer.<p>They are also often not mentioned because many of them are a different type of problem solving. High frame rate, stability, good quality animations are all effectively engineering and resource  challenges. No one seeks out to not achieve those things, everyone knows that they&#x27;re important. But the success of achieving those are typically driven by aspects completely out of control of a game designer (unless they are caused by gameplay mechanics or features that are just too technically taxing).<p>I mean really, it&#x27;s right in the title isn&#x27;t it? This is a game _DESIGN_ perspective, not a game implementation, or game marketing, or game post-launch community support retrospective.')
