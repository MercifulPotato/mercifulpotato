You have to admit that the election was unlike any other on recent memory.<p>The losing side, given this unorthodox election, wanted some validation of results, as well as to legally challenge the way they were done (PA&#x27;s changes).<p>The response was one of derision and essentially shutting out the right from discourse. No effort was made a conciliation. This had the predictable effect of galvanizing people that there was indeed fraud.<p>If you think that these people had no reason to be angry, you aren&#x27;t paying attention. If you can understand the frustrations and lead up to the BLM movement, but don&#x27;t even want to pay lip service to this, you are either a horrible person or stupid. Take your pick: evil, ignorant, or both?')
