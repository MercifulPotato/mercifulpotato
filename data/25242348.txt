And very few cases are even as clean as the coin case.<p>A more typical example is using polls to predict elections. 538&#x27;s model ended with Biden around 90% to win. Andrew Gelman&#x27;s model at the Economist ended with Biden around 95%. Do either of those represent objective probabilities?<p>Or take weather predictions.

Is either of those an objective probability?<p>I would say no, and I think that just because two people happen to agree on a number in a particular case doesn&#x27;t make it objective. If you want to use the word objective, I don&#x27;t have any particular objection. I&#x27;m not here to fight over words, and none of these words are really well defined enough to be worth fighting over. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>useful</i> to think of probabilities as &quot;real&quot; in any sense.')
