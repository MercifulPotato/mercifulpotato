Item(by='bowaggoner', descendants=None, kids=[25186779, 25183842], score=None, time=1606101763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181828, text='Very nice article!<p>Last year I was part of a working group on a data dividend proposal for the state of California, which you can read about at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datadividends.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datadividends.org&#x2F;</a> .<p>Our conclusions led us much closer to the spirit of this EFF article than the term &quot;data dividends&quot; might suggest. We recommended against any kind of personalized payments. We considered a small universal basic income funded by a &quot;data tax&quot;, but because of the small amount (as mentioned by the EFF), we focused on use of a data tax to fund public projects and initiatives aimed at redistributing the benefits of data more equitably.<p>We mostly stayed away from recommending privacy or data ownership regulation because (a) California had recently passed the CCPA and (b) this question seemed outside of our mandate, but I agree that the two should be considered together.')
