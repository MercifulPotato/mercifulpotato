They take a healthy company, have it take out a huge loan, use that to buy out the current owners, and then hope to make money every way that they can.  First, the private equity company gets paid for the deal.  Next, they get paid to manage the company.  Next, they look for every way to cut expenses to make the company&#x27;s financials look better (even if only temporarily).  And if they succeed, they flip it.<p>If it implodes, the debt goes away with the company and they don&#x27;t get to flip it.  But the private equity company already made a profit.  So &quot;the company survives&quot; is a nice to have and not part of their business model.<p>The people who lend money for this are the ones at real risk.  But if there is enough money looking for places to be lent, some of it will go to risky bonds.<p>Moving on, his definition of a zombie company is one whose earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) has not been sufficient to cover interest for the last 3 years.  Such a company might actually be viable, but only if it has prospects of future earnings that are massively better than current ones.  There are some companies for whom that is true, and no all zombies are actually going to fail long-term.  Certainly Tesla and Moderna seem to have decent futures.<p>But most of them won&#x27;t hit those dreams.  Particularly not the ones that private equity got involved with.  And the longer they last, the bigger the crater when they implode.  But if you have extra rescue money that has to go somewhere, the zombies will be happy to take it to stave off disaster for a little while longer.  And apparently they took a trillion dollars in debt in the last year.<p>How much of that trillion do you think that they will collectively manage to pay back?  I mean, without taking on more debt down the road...')
