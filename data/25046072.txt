Comparing an emacs&#x2F;vim user and a dog that does not want to walk on grass seems gross. Even calling them stubborn, well... The authors claim that &quot;Modern IDEs are magic&quot;. As a freelance devops, i don&#x27;t code-for-a-living being a magician, all i want to do is editing text, most of the time there&#x27;s no magic involved.<p>&quot;Why are so many coders still using a keyboard?&quot; Answer for yourself.<p>I have been using emacs for a decade, and finally settled on vi&#x2F;vim because of its broader availability. Both are excellent editors. I have also used dozens of graphical user interfaces for development, but as a devops i sometimes find myself in an environment that does not support graphics.<p>Not having graphics at your fingertips may sound like a restriction, but it allows me to focus on my code rather than being distracted by color, hints, hovers, help, type ahead, code completion and the like. I do not need all that, i can freely speak my favourite programming language same as i can write a text without referring to the encyclopedia britannica every other word.<p>Final rant: i consider the bio &quot;He&#x27;s spend over 15 years as a technical writer&quot; as sloppy as the whole article.')
