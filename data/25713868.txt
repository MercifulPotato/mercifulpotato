Since then other avenues (Twitch, Patreon, merch, ad placements) have become their primary sources of income.<p>For mid-size creators Youtube ads are not enough to make a living from it and for big creators with low production expenses (e.g. gaming videos) that _could_ make a living from it, it&#x27;s not a significant portion of their income if they diversified (and most creators that haven&#x27;t are not on the platform anymore).')
