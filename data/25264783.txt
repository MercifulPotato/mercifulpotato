Item(by='Jedd', descendants=None, kids=[25265134, 25264829], score=None, time=1606828225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25264741, text='&gt; I&#x27;d be curious to see the results of a trial involving thousands of employees.<p>Perhaps you could run one at your company?<p>Absent that experiment, this is the one that Unilever is running for everyone in their offices within one country for a full year.<p>Consider the wonderful Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics [1] and how it applies to any kind of experiment or well-intentioned initiative, when presented to &#x27;people that know better&#x27;.<p>&gt; The five-day is locked in pretty firmly in the developed world, and a company that tries to change that risks getting out of synch with suppliers, subcontractors, and partners. &quot;Today&#x27;s Thursday. Our office is closed on Fridays, so we&#x27;ll have to schedule that call for Tuesday, because one of our suppliers is closed on Mondays.&quot;<p>Well, a) just because it&#x27;s common doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good, or that it&#x27;s still relevant, or that it&#x27;s healthy, or that it&#x27;s ineluctable.<p>b) there&#x27;s no suggestion with ANY of these trials, or any organisation already offering part-time work for their staff, that they shutdown entirely for one or two days per week - rather, their workforce is spread over the (for now, common in the west) five weekdays, with varying personnel engaged.
