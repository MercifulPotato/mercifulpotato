It is totally normal for them to have clients which (unwillingly or, in this case, willingly) have lost money - their customer support should handle this just fine. A lawsuit for allowing normal trading is going to be laughed out of court; this, on the other hand, will not be good for them, no matter how the lawsuit turns out. Not to mention that the SEC will take a nice long look at what happened here.<p>If customer support overhead would be their actual worry, they could&#x27;ve simply implemented a large checkbox saying &quot;THIS STOCK IS HIGHLY VOLATILE. YOU _WILL_ MOST LIKELY LOOSE YOUR MONEY. Continue at your VERY OWN risk&quot; and be done with it (you might argue this is still somewhat manipulation, but that could&#x27;ve easily been done in good faith).')
