Item(by='raverbashing', descendants=None, kids=[25833411], score=None, time=1611061696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832582, text='&gt; Do you think it&#x27;s possible that Air Force One Pilots are instructed to land at unconventional spots on the runway to foil potential threats?<p>No. It&#x27;s hard enough to nail a landing to pick the &quot;right spot&quot; especially when you don&#x27;t need it<p>If there&#x27;s a threat on ground the best thing you can do is stay on air, not try to land on a different spot of the same runway (but yes, given some types of obstructions you can try to use only part of the runway, I&#x27;m not sure if they prefer you landing after it or in front of it, but I think the latter makes more sense - depending on the type and position of obstruction of course)')
