My understanding is that it is quite good at accomplishing its intended purpose (ie transcribing western music in a dense manner that can be rapidly understood by a professional with only a glance).<p>I don&#x27;t know much about music theory myself but the topic of alternative &quot;improved&quot; musical notations came up on HN regarding a music related Show HN that made the front page. Frustratingly I can&#x27;t seem to dig it up right now. In that discussion many points were made regarding a number of tasks including simultaneously sight reading rhythms and chords, on the fly transposition (I think this was somehow related to symmetry?), and notational density.')
