As such, the block was more equivalent to block a specific to TOFU key.<p>Of course, blocking the MITM CA won&#x27;t magically turn off the ISP&#x27;s MITM proxy. It will simply make it so that kazhakh citizens can&#x27;t access any web sites at all until the government hopefully caves and turns off the proxy.')
