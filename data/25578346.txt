Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25578964], score=None, time=1609300861, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578106, text='Well,<p>&quot;I have different idea about essential complexity and accidental complexity&quot;<p>might mean:<p>(a) I think we should think of essential complexity and accidental complexity differently (legit, but can be confusing, and overloads the terms).<p>(b) I think essential complexity and accidental complexity mean something different (in general), and TFA got them wrong (e.g. because the parent doesn&#x27;t know the traditional definitions of the terms, and thinks they&#x27;re open to personal interpretation).<p>&gt;<i>Everyone seems to be just reverting back to the text book and rejecting the difference not on merits, but for simply not matching.</i><p>Yes, and I think those people are right. Whether the new idea has merit or not, it should use new terminology, to not obscure things. Then, we can discuss it on its own merit.<p>Even so, considering it on its merit alone, I don&#x27;t think it has that much (more on that below). Because it essentially amounts &quot;if you&#x27;re programming in X, you have to deal with X (e.g. bash&#x2F;html&#x2F;etc.) and that has some complexity&quot;. Well, duh. That&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s something we already know.<p>Whereas the accidenal&#x2F;essential complexity in Brook&#x27;s sense, is an important philosophical&#x2F;logical distinction.<p>&gt;<i>But complexity is complexity. If we really want to talk about complexity and where the unavoidable part is coming from, then it&#x27;s from the layer underneath also</i><p>Well, the original formulation is more useful though, because having to use bash or html is not &quot;unavoidable&quot;. It might just be &quot;unavoidable&quot; because of one&#x27;s employee insistence, or something like that, but that&#x27;s not a computer science concern.<p>Whereas essential complexity in Brook&#x27;s sense is completely unavoidable (in the logical sense).<p>A better and non-confusing term for what the parent describes would be, I think, &quot;imposed complexity&quot; or &quot;circumstancial complexity&quot;.')
