I believe it is chosen instead of income primarily because:<p>1. It&#x27;s perhaps easier to determine than income (especially for the ultra-wealthy, who often have negative-income in certain years).<p>2. The wealth-gap is much greater than the income gap, so leads to more dramatic-sounding statements.<p>But <i>really</i> what we care about is income--especially when one considers that wealth is just unspent income. And income is actually what determines lifestyle.')
