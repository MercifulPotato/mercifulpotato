Foils are a form of dynamic lift, where the weight of the vessel is critical. Those AC75s are full carbon, made a great expense. They weigh around 8 tons crewed up. The average container ship today weighs 100,000 tons. That&#x27;s a whole lotta dynamic lift needed.<p>Additionally the AC75s are only usable in relatively flat seas, and even then face extreme hazards if they fall off the foils. The foiling cats some years ago killed someone due to this.<p>Fully flying hulls on cargo ships are a non starter.<p>However, wing sails may be practical as an assist, and there&#x27;ve been a few startups attempting that in recent years. The best design for cargo ships is a bit different than the AC boats, and uses a fully rotating and self trimming wingsail. See saildrone for an example of that technology at small scale.')
