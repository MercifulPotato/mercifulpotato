Item(by='indymike', descendants=None, kids=[25748813], score=None, time=1610467336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25748282, text='&quot;Through my lifetime I&#x27;ve only heard about tax cuts, I find this mysterious as presumably the taxes must have once risen to now be cut. Why have we seemingly lost the ability to say that we need new taxes?&quot;<p>At the local level, we see pretty regular tax increases here in the midwest. There&#x27;s a lot of resistance to increases in federal and state-wide taxes largely because federal and state spending is really hard to directly connect to a benefit to the payer (i.e. home value increases, better commutes, a fun local park). On the other hand, a ballot initiative to fund an improvement in roads or sewers is pretty easy to get through.')
