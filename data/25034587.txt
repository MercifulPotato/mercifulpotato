Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25037500, 25036082], score=None, time=1604928755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031712, text='16,000 votes is only a half a percentage of people in AZ committing voter fraud, and that&#x27;s assuming they each only submit one fraudulent ballot. Apparently people have been caught submitting dozens of ballots in the names of people they didn&#x27;t have any right to. If 0.02% of people did that, it flips the state.<p>You can also make the &quot;doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot; argument about voting itself, since exactly zero of the states will be decided by a single vote with extremely high probability, but lots of people still voted.<p>It&#x27;s not much of a stretch to expect that a fraction of people smaller than the lizardman constant are not doing a diligent cost benefit analysis.')
