Everything they do is one step forward and like 3-30 steps back.<p>For example, I recently bought a low-end Samsung TV running Tizen, which meant I could return my set-top-box (ISP has a Tizen app), get rid of my barely-functioning miracast stick, bluetooth transmitter (native features) and media PC (apps for YouTube, Netflix and Spotify).<p>But then, the thing has so many dumb design choices that it constantly makes me want to go back my horrible old setup.  \n - Turning on the sleep timer takes 21 clicks and avg. 47 seconds if you know exactly how to do it (instead of having it in the quick menu).  \n - I have to manually switch between the speakers and my surround system, which takes 6 or so clicks and 30 seconds (instead of just always outputting to toslink).  \n - The TV can only boot to an input, not an app, so I have to manually open the TV app every time I turn it on.   \n - Even though the remote has like a billion buttons, only 30% of them actually do things in any given context.    \n - WHYYY is there a dedicated RokutenTV button on the remote that I can&#x27;t remap??\n - I can&#x27;t use my phone to type text into text inputs (LGs can do this, badly) and why does it make me use arrow keys on an on-screen keyboard when I have a full number pad on the remote to do multi-tap&#x2F;T9??<p>It looks like the entire industry seems to be entirely incompetent at creating software and is too stubborn to admit it and give us the tools to fix it for them.')
