For some reason, I see so many people reach for CSS Grid like it&#x27;s the de facto solution for responsive design.<p>This is a bad design because you&#x27;re tying the child elements to the grid layout of the parent. If you added an extra column in the grid, you&#x27;d have to go and adjust it for the full bleed elements.<p>IMO a better solution would&#x27;ve been to just use a column layout with flex box, where the children are containers at standard sizes (e.g. full-bleed, 80-characters, etc.).<p>Yes it adds like another tag or two, but it&#x27;s semantically more sound. And from that extra markup we get a lot more flexibility, e.g. going from column layout to a slide show or something if someone wanted.<p>CSS Grids are good for grids i.e. layouts where you want control over flow in both axes. This is not a grid. You have one column of data where you are controlling whitespace.<p>This has become a real pet peeve of mine because it seems like so many people love css grid when it&#x27;s actual use case is fairly rare.<p>Edit: I also want to add that this creates an uglier layout if you have variable width children. Because you&#x27;d essentially create a full-bleed container element just to add a non-full bleed child to it.<p>And I am sorry that this came across as kind of aggressive, this is something that&#x27;s really been irking me with recent web dev trends. And I feel like a crazy person confused over why the world suddenly decided on Css Grid all day every day.')
