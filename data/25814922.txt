At the start of every week it sets everything for you, which you can then go modify if you want. It announces any changes it makes in an email so that you’re never surprised, and includes nice-to-haves like projected statistics and the probability that you will win the matchup. If folks like the tool, I plan to build out more AI assistant features for use-cases such as the draft, trades and waivers.<p>Note: You’ll need a Yahoo fantasy team to try it (they’re the only provider with a fully-featured API).<p>In designing this, I really wanted to build something that was useful and respects the user above all else. I require an email address because I want to make sure you know whenever the AI acts on your behalf, but include a big “Delete Account” button right on the main page once you’re logged in. This will fully and permanently delete all of your information. I also went with a privacy-respecting analytics tool (plausible.io) and will not spam or sell any information whatsoever. You should feel comfortable trying this tool and then deleting your account if it’s not for you.<p>Background: I’ve always been interested in building AI tools that directly interact with humans. My previous work (data scientist with the Philadelphia 76ers and research scientist at Uber AI Labs) sort of naturally led me to this idea of trying to win at fantasy sports using a pure AI approach. This tool is really just the very first step toward that long-term dream, solving the most basic decision problem in the game.<p>Would love any feedback or ideas! Also plan to write a blog post or two detailing both the statistical approach as well as the tech stack. I’m not a SWE so particularly appreciate any tips there.')
