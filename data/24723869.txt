I&#x27;m happy to dive deeper if you want. Below is a basic summary.<p>I have 5x140mm intake fans, with a Noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3 cooler. That runs with push-pull 140mm fans, 2000RPM in&#x2F;1500RPM out.<p>This reaches steady state within a few minutes under load. With an open case, it will clock down to ~4.2GHz after 5-10 minutes. With a closed case, that is faster. For fun, I ducted the A&#x2F;C vent in the room into the case and cranked it. It stayed reliably up around 4.4GHz all core. Technically, I think it would reach a lower steady state clock&#x2F;higher temp if I left it for days, as it does noticeably warm the room.<p>I don&#x27;t recall idle power, but yeah, it&#x27;s warm.')
