The situation looks like it&#x27;s getting better, according to Wikipedia.<p>&quot;As of 17 December 2020, a part of the iceberg was just 50 km (31 mi) from South Georgia, but the concern seemed to have lessened. National Geographic reported that &quot;[s]cientists expect the iceberg ... to either anchor in the shallow waters around the island or move past it in the coming days.&quot; On this date it was also reported that a corner had been knocked off A-68A, most likely due to impact with the seabed. The new free floating iceberg has been designated A-68D.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iceberg_A-68" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Iceberg_A-68</a>')
