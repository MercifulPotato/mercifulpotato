This doesn&#x27;t help the QAnon folks, since they&#x27;re still mad they&#x27;re being censored (that&#x27;s part of the thing, they&#x27;re always censored, and there&#x27;s a thousand videos they can show you to prove it). And it exposes people who otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be to their views, as if they were accepted. I don&#x27;t anticipate a fairness doctrine making people less prone to conspiracy -- it worked in 1987 because TV was the main source of news, but most &quot;news&quot; is not on TV or in print, it&#x27;s on YouTube.')
