To my values most or all of Europe has better internet.  A few things I care about:<p>- No bandwidth caps.<p>- ISPs competing to offer the best service in a system similar to how health care is done in Japan.<p>- Being able to switch ISPs without issue.<p>- Being able to run my own hardware instead of being required to use their routers.<p>- Net neutrality.  I pay for gigabit duplex but if I&#x27;m not uploading to a fast lane I&#x27;m limited to 10mbps, or 1% of what I pay for.  This is terrible for VPNing for work, and other work related tasks.')
