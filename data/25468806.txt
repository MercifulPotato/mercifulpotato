Hyperfocus is not something that can be turned on and off, and the subject of hyperfocus is not chosen at will. It&#x27;s a symptom that demonstrates that &quot;attention deficit&quot; is an unfortunate misnomer. The problem in ADHD is not a <i>lack</i> of attention, it is <i>reduced ability to govern attention</i>.')
