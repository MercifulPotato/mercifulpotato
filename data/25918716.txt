The Saudis seemed to act like it was their right to kill Khashoggi, else they would have planned better to avoid getting caught.<p>This is even more evident in reactions to the Russian governments assassinations, attempted and successful. It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d try to kill people, but the way they don&#x27;t really even bother to cover it up is what is really shocking. It&#x27;s a slap in the face of the idea of law and order - murderers are at least supposed to do their best to hide their actions.')
