And many are of a certain political leaning, they are not representative of that population.<p>This while comment chain was built on an event &quot;banning a significant portion of the population population&quot; that doesn&#x27;t exist. End of story.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in discussing doomsaying based on made up events.<p>Nothing said in this thread is a novel thing, it&#x27;s the same tired what-ifs that ignore the &quot;what-happened&quot;. When your argument doesn&#x27;t even stand without leaning on made up events and slipper slopes, it&#x27;s not worth much.')
