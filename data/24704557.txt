Is it a fundamentally better idea that we have de facto restrictions on free speech because our communication channels happen to be controlled by private companies?<p>What happens when your preferred political party is no longer in charge of those private communication channels? You&#x27;ve already established the norm that these private channels will censor speech that they don&#x27;t agree with. Imagine in the future Facebook, and the vast censorship apparatus they&#x27;re now building at everyone&#x27;s insistence, is now in the hands of Rupert Murdoch, or the Koch Brothers or someone else you all hate even more than Mark Zuckerberg.')
