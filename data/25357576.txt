Musicans nowadays get their money through fans, not casual listeners. Music is released for free (Soundcloud) or semi-free (Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, whatever) and the real money is moved through concerts and sometimes merch.<p>This isn&#x27;t always enough to pay everything, indeed many of the musicans I listen to have day jobs to pay the rent and the revenue through music is a bonus at best.<p>Has it been different for unsigned artists at any point in time? After all you basically had no distribution channel before the internet, now you have one that doesn&#x27;t make much money, but also doesn&#x27;t cost anything. That sounds like a mild win for getting an audience to me. People do it because they like making music, not because they want to make money.<p>One of my favorite artists, Professor Kliq, offers his music for free and under a Creative Commons license. He makes money through his day job as a web developer, licensing it on music portals and selling music on Bandcamp. I personally like that model a lot (along with the music itself), which makes me much more likely to send over some money for an album on Bandcamp.')
