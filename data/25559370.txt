I&#x27;ve practiced TDD and written automated tests (and frameworks) for desktop, web and mobile apps. Some of those have been in the medical industry where the testing is crucial. I say this to make it clear that I&#x27;m familiar with solid software engineering practices.<p>Did you work in the game industry before the other stuff or after ? Because I went that way game dev -&gt; application development - and frankly a lot of the SW engineering practices from game dev were terrible in the transition - not because I couldn&#x27;t apply them in game dev - but because I didn&#x27;t know about them - and nobody around me told me - and I haven&#x27;t seen it in code from others.<p>&gt;With that in mind, games are the hardest software I&#x27;ve encountered for writing automated tests. It&#x27;s just notoriously difficult to do in an effective manner. It&#x27;s not impossible, but it&#x27;s incredibly difficult.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of low hanging fruit - running recorded controllers, partial scenario tests, gold copy rendering tests, smoke tests, regression testing - frankly it&#x27;s not that hard to raise the bar from 0. I&#x27;m not up to date in the industry so maybe they aren&#x27;t at 0 anymore but from occasionally keeping tabs and playing games occasionally I would say it hasn&#x27;t moved far.<p>Just the number of regressions in MMOs for example where you could easily code tests for the stuff that was fixed is an obvious example that nobody was doing regression testing or adding tests after fixes. And this is for MMOs that have an incentive to keep a healthy codebase (not just ship and forget)')
