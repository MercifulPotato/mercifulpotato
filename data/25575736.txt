Thus it’s more a question of dispersal not duration.<p>Let’s say 10 tanker cars so 350,000 gallons or 560,000kg are spread down a water channel at the side of a street at 15mph.  At 4 minutes their already covering 1 mile which easily takes them out of most towns making longer durations largely meaningless.  If the channel is V shaped with a depth of 2 feet and a width of 10 feet. That only adds up to ~4,5000 square meters, and by your calculations most of it should still be there.<p>It doesn’t last as long if it’s on fire, but there’s going to be an air gap of unmixed natural gas over a likely several feel thick channel of LNG.  So even then it’s going to take a while to burn off meanwhile the wave of fire is destroying everything around it.')
