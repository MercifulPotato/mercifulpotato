I manage a team of 12 people and thought it would be great to create serendipitous connections. It was fun the first couple of days. Lot of improptu conversations happened. Within 4 days, novelty effect wore off and I was all alone there.<p>I think the main problem around adopting such tech is that, existing workflows and habit  loops are pretty mature (though not ideal). Zoom &#x2F; hangout meetings, chat on slack etc. Because of that, it&#x27;s hard to &#x27;remember&#x27; to login to such virtual office spaces that would enable those convos.<p>I want to hear if there are teams that were able to adopt successfully and what level of early enforcement was required to create that habit loop (i personally hate such enforcement, but might not avoidable).')
