That’s a chunk of change at at international level, but is relatively lightweight as a layer of government. Much of its spending is investment into shared projects that are intended to encourage development, trade and collaboration between member states.<p>What are the specific EU programmes or endeavours that represent “globalist excess” and should be cut?
