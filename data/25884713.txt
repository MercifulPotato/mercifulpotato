MyClass has 10 private fields, each with a trivial getter and setter.<p>2. YourClass has 10 private fields, of which 9 have a trivial getter and setter.  The last one has a trivial getter but the setter is non-trivial.<p>If you use your IDE to write your getters and setters, than the two classes above will look the same at glance.<p>If you use Lombok, the &quot;special&quot; field will stick out at once.<p>Personally, I prefer to avoid Lombok and just use public fields.  That way, the field with a nontrivial setter will also stick out, and no need for bytecode magic.')
