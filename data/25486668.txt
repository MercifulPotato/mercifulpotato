It optimizes for the &quot;local maximum&quot;, the &quot;today&#x27;s maximum&quot;.<p>Yes, if today you don&#x27;t choose the best candidate based purely on their results, you are technically losing, because you could do better. But here&#x27;s the thing, if you choose a candidate that is not the best, but that can have a more meaningful impact in the long term, you are optimizing for the future.<p>For example, candidates who are coming from underrepresented groups can have a huge impact on kids who will find it easier to believe they can repeat such success, because someone who looks like them did it. That can unlock a huge pool of candidates who can outperform others in the future, but who would not be available if we didn&#x27;t choose the n-th best candidate instead of the best one in the first place.')
