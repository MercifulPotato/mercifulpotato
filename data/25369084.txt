To be fair you lead with saying you don’t understand it if course, but where you’re landing isn’t anywhere close to what interests me about it.<p>For me the excitement is in the try, in the front row seat in failure and success.  It’s not that it couldn’t be done, or that it hasn’t been done, but that somebody is doing it and we get to see it warts and all.  The flight today is a perfect example.  It was a lot of fun to watch.  I’m sure there’s lots of amazing innovation happening at Blue Origin, but there’s nothing to really talk about because they don’t share it.  If Bezos started some mad max bullshit and it felt like a legit race with giant explosions the whole damn world would be tuning into these things.<p>SpaceX has lots of new fans, but there are lots of old fans that have been around for a decade and are still excited.  Elon time is what it is, two years or five it’s still progress.  They nailed their first barge landing five years ago.  If the first time we see the giant streak of a white hot Starship re-entering the atmosphere is 2025, it’ll still be worth the wait.')
