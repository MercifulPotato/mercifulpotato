What I find frustrating about Slack is that it gives certain people the ability to say &quot;i didn&#x27;t see that&quot; regarding important work information. I regard properly reading your email part of your job, and if you&#x27;re missing important emails, you&#x27;re failing at it. I find that unless you send an email alongside whatever Slack notification, many people will just ignore it.')
