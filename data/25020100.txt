Zoning licensing, etc.<p>The elephant in the room is that for most people the majority of their net worth is tied up in housing (property) and as interest rates drop the nominal value of this property increases way faster than the nominal wages of labor. This property can then be used to create information insensitive debt that ignores any notion of liquidity at an artificially higher nominal value. This debt is then used to pay wage-labor who increasingly cannot acquire property themselves. At the end of the day, only real property is wealth (land, ip rights, equity, collectibles, and machinery) and labor is denied the opportunity to earn a larger share of property themselves. Any solution is politically difficult.')
