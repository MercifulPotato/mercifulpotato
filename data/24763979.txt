The latter works with function barriers works to maintain codebases that are impossible to achieve with just one or the other.<p>There&#x27;s no resolving trade-off because when Julia knows types and call time (or a union of them ) it can inline function calls.<p>Anyway, neither numba nor cython has the combin of features that allows for one to define a fast custom abstract array and have another package seamlessly define a subtype that works fast and with other data structures, overloading only the necessary functions. Then a third package can come and build on top using traits from the first and some weird solver.')
