I did almost no music as a kid.<p>Sometimes you just picked the wrong instrument.. The day I officially gave up piano (with RSIs from piano even) I bought a guitar as a consolation &quot;I didn&#x27;t really give up&quot; thing.<p>That was about 6 years ago.. I&#x27;ve taken guitar lessons the last 4 years and have had great success compared to piano.  I would say my guitar teacher is a much superior teacher than the piano teachers I had though.<p>Sometimes you just picked the wrong instrument.   I don&#x27;t miss piano at all really.  I still love the piano but it wasn&#x27;t for me.. and guitars are far more affordable which is very nice.')
