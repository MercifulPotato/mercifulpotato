It was a lot of fun.<p>Second time I took it, a full dose, I had a bad trip. But I was with my girlfriend, so it was never too bad. I also learned that I trust her completely emotionally. I relied on her a lot.<p>Third time I took it with a very close friend (15+ years of knowing, inspired each other to study psychology), a full dose again (I thought it would be fine by now), my trip was so bad that I had strong feelings of ending it all. Luckily enough my intelligence was waning fast as well, so I locked myself in a room. 10 minutes later I didn&#x27;t know what was what, but I cried for 30 minutes and I didn&#x27;t know why I cried. When I got out of the trip it did spur a soul search questioning myself, looking inward more deeply and <i>that</i> was beneficial but I was flying a bit too close to the sun for it to be worth it.<p>I should&#x27;ve gotten a trip sitter. I was naive at the time.')
