I didn&#x27;t work on anything that would be considered remotely classified to any other companies. Apple treats EVERYTHING as super secret. It sort of worked for me, because when my current company asked what I worked on I just said &quot;sorry I can&#x27;t talk about it ;)&quot; instead of &quot;I was paid almost 200k a year to make one spreadsheet look like another&quot;')
