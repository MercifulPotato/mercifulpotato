I definitely still have hundreds (maybe into the thousands?) of bookmarks of sites that store information I care about.<p>But I don&#x27;t think this tool deserves the same sort of mixed feelings. I don&#x27;t think this replaces structure -- there&#x27;s still value to having a conceptual mapping of where documents are stored, and for grouping sets of documents together. It&#x27;s just that having a structure doesn&#x27;t help if you don&#x27;t know where in the structure something is stored. This sort of tool is a bottom-up approach for the times when the top-down approach doesn&#x27;t work very well.<p>Do you have similarly mixed feelings if sometimes, even with my carefully-crafted set of bookmarks with all their nested folders, I use the search tool to find the bookmark I&#x27;m looking for? It&#x27;s the same idea. Sometimes a top-down structure is beneficial. But sometimes things get misclassified, or you forget about some piece of the structure, or you aren&#x27;t familiar with some new structure, and in those cases, having bottom-up tools are immensely useful. There&#x27;s no risk of vendor lock-in here. It&#x27;s just a difference of approach in information retrieval.')
