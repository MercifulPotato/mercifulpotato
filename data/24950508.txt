I&#x27;d rather be \n    rude than explain I&#x27;m in pain\n</code></pre>\nI learned this lesson with ADHD as well. Most people will roll their eyes and think it&#x27;s a simple lack of discipline. The rest give you advice, which is even worse.<p>I learned to communicate my <i>needs</i> to people, instead of my diagnosis. Example: &quot;I have trouble focusing on my work in crowded areas - could I work in [some other location] when I&#x27;m not pairing?&quot; instead of &quot;I can&#x27;t work here, I have ADHD.&quot;  (Not that I ever put it that way, but you know what I mean)<p>But pain is a different story. I don&#x27;t know how you would even explain that to people without getting all of the unwanted and unhelpful advice...')
