If it&#x27;s just a two liner that takes the parameters and writes them to disk, then that&#x27;s a LGTM from me. You would not test every getter&#x2F;setter method in any of your classes, would you?<p>If it&#x27;s more complex than this, you can absolutely write tests for your fakes. In many cases fake data-stores use tested backends, and tested client libraries. If the client wrapper is complex enough then you can&#x2F;should test it as well.')
