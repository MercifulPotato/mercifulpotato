Instead they would invest a surplus into social capital by &quot;banqueting the neighbours&quot;, which could save their lives in case of a bad harvest.<p>And this is exactly what we see in places like Africa today and tend to belittle: people have little incentive to save and invest because there is a strong expectation that they&#x27;ll share any &quot;riches&quot; with their friends, family and neighbours.<p>But this is entirely rational when you live in a society not far removed from subsistence farming, threatened by civil wars and with relatively weak civic institutions: social capital is simply more reliable than material capital.')
