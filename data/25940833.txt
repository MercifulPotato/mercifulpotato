Technical is harder to follow. That means fewer people will read it, even people who do have the skill to. Publishing is a medium, not entirely unlike HN or pop science books and has a media dynamic.  I think history of X tends to go &quot;accessible&quot; in every field, with the counterexamples (eg mathematics) being exceptions. A HN article with lots of code is harder to read, digest and comment than an article about the business&#x2F;societal implications of facebook&#x27;s new policy on squirrels. Even people who do read the former, can read more of the latter more easily... so they do.<p>Also, generalities tend to be more evocative than specifics. If there is a message to the &quot;story&quot; about small teams, outsiders, or other cultural element... that&#x27;s engaging. Technical is necessarily specific, and a lot of actual invention is somewhat random... without a wider implication.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical that &quot;history of X&quot; fields can really focus on what he wants them to focus on. The types of insights that he&#x27;s looking for are, as he says himself, best found in primary sources. There will always be a limited supply of these, since people who write books and people who invent things overlap irregularly.<p>On the positive side, since he seems to mostly want inspiration, a little can go a long way.<p>Totally tangential... Military historians used to play a lot of &quot;tactics,&quot; trying to recreate battles with board game pieces or whatnot. There are endless generations of such commentary on Roman vs Etruscan spear formations. The evolution of helmets or whatnot. I don&#x27;t think we learn much from this.')
