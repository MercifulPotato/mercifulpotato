It is precisely that which results in accusations of VS: Even immoral corps benefit from social-cause PR, and the difference is in the details. e.g. you judge a person not by how they treat their friends (or boss), but by how they treat their waiter.<p>&gt; The idea that professing some sort of belief which one acknowledges as &quot;good&quot; is nonetheless somehow &quot;bad&quot;<p>This is an oversimplification. Giving to charity is good, even if done for ingenuine reasons, but a corp should not be considered <i>generally</i> virtuous in that case i.e. no virtue beyond that contribution should be assumed. Chemotherapy has a devastating affect on the body, yet utilised to treat cancer; It is &quot;good&quot; because the overall context is considered, having cancer is still bad. The world is more nuanced than everything fitting into two categories, free of context.<p>&gt; It is still PR for the good cause. When it&#x27;s convincing, people will act on it.<p>I agree, Virtue-signally may still have its benefits. That doesn&#x27;t change what it is though. I think you need to look at the context to decide whether it matters or not.<p>&gt; even if they have been the most cynical liars, their statements will have the effect of setting expectations for them and their industry peers<p>It might, but it could also lead to the precedent whereby corps make hollow statements that they don&#x27;t need to live up to. The precedent is that &quot;unlimited&quot; (as in broadband, storage) doesn&#x27;t actually mean unlimited, so why can&#x27;t &quot;environmentally-friendly&quot; be expected to mean little?<p>&gt; Are we to believe they have any actual interest in, say, increased diversity<p>But they don&#x27;t have to, unless they are accusing someone&#x2F;thing of VS to imply their own virtue. If I don&#x27;t believe you care about X, I don&#x27;t need to care about X myself to make that accusation. There are, however, cases where it does matter, but again it depends on context, and <i>why</i> people think it relevant to make that accusation. The opinion I seek to counter, however Is that a persons true motivations are either <i>always</i>, or <i>never</i> relevant; or that they can always be known.<p>&gt; Instead, it&#x27;s used by these people because their real opinion just cannot be openly stated in polite company any longer<p>I could just as well make the same paranoid argument: &quot;people who complain about the phrase &#x27;virtue-signalling&#x27; do so because they are virtue signallers themselves with more sinister motivations that they cannot state upfront, or in &#x27;polite company&#x27;&quot;<p>This is just an unsupported bad-faith interpretation of your political opposites. How do you know what the motivations of the &quot;political right&quot; are? There are plenty accusative phrases used mostly by the political left - are those invalid by the same reasoning?')
