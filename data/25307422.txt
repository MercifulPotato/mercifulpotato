That doesn&#x27;t sound secure _at all_ -- if an attacker can cause you to generate a bunch of IDs very quickly, it&#x27;s likely that some of them will be sequential, and from there it should be easy to figure out what the shuffled alphabet was.<p>Indeed, from hashids.org:<p>&gt; Do you have a question or comment that involves &quot;security&quot; and &quot;hashids&quot; in the same sentence? Don&#x27;t use Hashids.<p>and then they link to a blog post with a detailed analysis (which makes it look like their characterization as just converting a number to a shuffled alphabet doesn&#x27;t capture all the details) demonstrating that it&#x27;s weak.')
