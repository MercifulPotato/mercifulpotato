Should I change my job?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='There is a man in my team who I don&#x27;t like very much and I have to work with him a lot. He is a dozen or so years older, but he has less programming experience than me and, unlike me, he did not study computer science, which can sometimes be felt. From the very beginning I have the impression that I do not fit him. Every code review looks like it criticizes my code very strongly and often makes unprofessional and unpleasant comments, e.g. &quot;I got a headache when I read it&quot;. Often these remarks have no substantive justification, but I do not have the strength to argue with this man all the time. I am non-conflicting and I am an introvert. I am very demotivated by the vision of working with him, I stop liking the work of a programmer.<p>Other team members are fine and I like them. The project is very cool (we rewrite the monolith for microservices), financial conditions in the company are great. But working with him makes me sad.<p>Should I quit?')
