PredictIt ran a large number of betting  markets (far more than a traditional bookmaker) for the 2020 US Presidential Election.<p>Of <i>course</i> the markets about Trump have lots of people spouting outrageous nonsense. You could dismiss that as just &quot;for shock value&quot;. But PredictIt is real money (albeit not the sums involved in the &quot;real&quot; international betting markets) and the actual bets placed reflect those same crazy beliefs.<p>About 24 hours ago the market for how many Electoral College votes Trump will get closed. The answer, as we&#x27;ve known for about a week now, was 232. In a normal healthy market, even if people are writing <i>comments</i> saying that the US military will force people to vote again at gun point, the price for Trump gets 232 votes would be $1 (the way PredictIt works you&#x27;re getting one dollar for each correct prediction, so if you are absolutely certain of something it&#x27;s worth precisely $1 and you wouldn&#x27;t sell it for anything less).<p>The closing price, less than 24 hours ago, was 96¢. For 96¢ you could buy a dollar, just by being sure of a well known fact about Donald Trump&#x27;s loss. Because the people &quot;trolling&quot; the comments really believe he didn&#x27;t lose.')
