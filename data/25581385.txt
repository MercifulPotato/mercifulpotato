No one was remotely interested in using it, so I eventually shuttered it. (Didn&#x27;t even have any free users to be worried about.)<p>That was a few years ago, and my conviction about what would make for a good ebook writing app have only grown stronger. There are glaring shortcomings in all of the existing solutions: Scrivener, Vellum, Sigil, iBooks Author, Calibre... they all kinda suck for writing and publishing novels in particular.<p>So I&#x27;m now working on version 4 of the idea, this time rechristened as PaperbackAuthor: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paperbackauthor.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paperbackauthor.com</a><p>(I still like the name &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; better, but it&#x27;s a nightmare SEO-wise. When you google &quot;PaperbackAuthor&quot;, my twitter handle comes up first. So I consider that an early win.)<p>I have no idea if this one will attract any users, but I&#x27;m passionate about it and need to get it out there. If only so that I can stop thinking about it.')
