I built my own version of WebPack because I couldn&#x27;t trust the huge number of maintainers in the dependency chain for that project. Docker&#x2F;Kube gives me the screaming heebie-jeebies.<p>The only time anyone will take it seriously is when they&#x27;re hacked. And then their defence will be &quot;but this is what everyone does! It&#x27;s industry-standard&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve come to accept it&#x27;s a fact of life in the industry at the moment. Hopefully it&#x27;ll change, but the only way I can see it changing is if the level of hacking increases to become intolerable. Yet there appears to be a high tolerance for hacking incidencts - it&#x27;s accepted folklore that hackers are very smart people that can&#x27;t be stopped no matter how good your system is.')
