So the money would cover the terminal cost to those customers and then full freight 8 months of service at current pricing. Alternatively&#x2F;in addition, and more similarly to traditional in-ground service, it may also simply help fun actual infrastructure in the form of more&#x2F;faster deployment of ground stations and sats. SpaceX may also (and it seems likely) have more standard service tiers for full general release, so something at 25 Mbps for $25&#x2F;month say, and then working their way up. If they use this money to cover the minimum tier and then let people choose to pay the difference for more if they desired, then that&#x27;d bump the coverage to close to 3 years.<p>For the level of service they&#x27;re offering that seems pretty reasonable honestly, and a much more efficient use of dollars than typical efforts (though WISPs might do even better in certain areas, they have different trade offs). Since it appears how the companies make use of the money is fairly flexible SpaceX will probably deploy it towards a few different metrics. The $500 upfront capex is probably the biggest impediment for a lot of people so getting that down is important, but if internally they had any issues with getting their sat shells filled out that&#x27;d be a good upfront usage too.<p>This is also spread out over 10 years, so where the most bang for buck is delivered will probably vary over time, by 2025 let alone 2030 SpaceX&#x27;s economics will certainly look quite different with Starship deployment and filled shells&#x2F;done ground stations.')
