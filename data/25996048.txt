Our science and eng lets us give farmers important information about their fields, rows, and even individual plants: e.g. are they stressed out? Are they being watered evenly? Were they overwatered?<p>The App: customers use the app to access maps, imagery, visualizations, and other information about their field and plant’s health, and order flights.\nMobile-first, and geospatial data heavy. \nCodebase is clean, terse, DRY &amp; tested.\nVueJS + MapboxGL JS frontend, Django Rest Framework + PostGIS backend.<p>You: skilled hacker, strong UX, kind, good at getting 80&#x2F;20 type wins, interested in improving the resource efficiency of agriculture, interested in maps OSGeo and data visualization, ready for a technical leadership position and most of all, motivated to make the app better for customers on things both big and small…. i.e. we’re looking for somebody who wants to take serious ownership of the app and do even more cool things with it!<p>Team Structure and Teammates: The customer facing app team is currently ~4 eng, but we’re not keeping hard team boundaries, and total technical staff is ~~20. Other teams work on physical &amp; ag science, data science, hardware eng, our CV image processing pipeline, and internal flight planning and GIS tools. You’ll also be working with talented designers, product managers, and help iterate prototype and ideas in conjunction with agronomists and farmers (both internal and with external customers).<p>More About Ceres<p>Ceres Imaging is a venture-backed agriculture technology company with a mission to drastically reduce farming’s environmental footprint while increasing farmer profitability.
