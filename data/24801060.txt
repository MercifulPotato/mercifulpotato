Both noted some evident facts about productivity that I hadn&#x27;t heard mentioned often.<p>Stuff that was simply &quot;out of theory&quot; and irrelevant to it despite seeming logically contradictory to theory. The observations about efficiency in administration in the digital age is particularly striking.<p>I do think Graeber tended to overstate conclusions. I actually think we understand inflation wrong, and that this becomes relevant over long time scales. Some productivity trends just overestimate reality. We haven&#x27;t really become as wealthy and efficient as the measures suggest.<p>Another problem is non fungibility. Not owning a smartphone in 1970 is different from not owning one in 2020 in ways that we can&#x27;t be quantified in dollars. You can&#x27;t buy a 1960 education or 1990 healthcare. It isn&#x27;t sold, and it wouldn&#x27;t have the same value even if sold. It&#x27;s way too complicated to dismiss with a &quot;our expectations have gone up.&quot;')
