Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611151945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25843925, text='&gt; I think these &quot;attacks&quot; of China aren&#x27;t that unwarranted.<p>The problem with &quot;attacks&quot; against China is not so much that they are unwarranted, but that, by the time they reach the Western public, they&#x27;ve gone through multiple layers of filtering, stripping them of relevant context. That can cause problems to appear either more widespread or more localized than they actually are.<p>Case in point:<p>&gt; invasion of Tibet<p>Missing context: the invasion of the whole rest of China, partially by means of brutal military campaigns (e.g. Changchun, Taiyuan), partially by local KMT-affiliated warlords realizing that the CCP had the upper hand and switching allegiance. Tibet was an example of the latter, with the lamas remaining in power until the Panchen Lama allied with the central government in a power struggle against the Dalai Lama, causing him to flee into exile.<p>&gt; Uighur Genocide<p>Missing context: all non-Uighur people in China who are nonetheless subjected to &quot;reeducation through labor&quot;, political indoctrination, birth control (more than 60% (!) of all Chinese women were sterilized to enforce the One Child Policy) and so on.<p>&gt; organ harvesting of political dissident groups like Falun Gong<p>Missing context: organ harvesting from non-Falun Gong, non-dissident executed prisoners.<p>&gt; social-credit system<p>Missing context: the implementation pretty much failed. The nationwide rollout was originally scheduled for 2020, but the current state is far from the original vision. Both in terms of social scores (only pilot projects in a few cities) and in terms of credit scoring (Private companies like Ant Financial preferring to use their data for their own internal credit scores instead of sharing with the central Baihang Credit). Ironically, Jack Ma claimed in his speech that his company&#x27;s credit scoring was so good that they shouldn&#x27;t be required to back their loans with as much capital, but the regulators didn&#x27;t buy it.<p>&gt; Great Firewall<p>Missing context: the large amount of cross-border communication that happens despite of it, both due to not-uncommom use of technical circumvention tools and due to some sites (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;china" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;china</a>  ) not being blocked when you&#x27;d expect them to be.<p>&gt; the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative<p>Missing context: the large amount of &quot;Belt and Road&quot; projects which are not part of any coordinated initiative, but rather an uncoordinated outpouring of Chinese capital in search of higher profits.<p>Of course the above is not a defense of China, but definitely a criticism of mainstream Western media discourse on China.<p>And concerning<p>&gt; the West doesn&#x27;t have problems <i>like this</i>.<p>The West <i>did</i> have problems like this, but a) waited them out (territories annexed a hundred years ago, minorities mostly assimilated, natural drop in birth rates) or b) adopted a different solution (organ harvesting from traffic deaths instead of prisoners, established credit scoring agencies, a political system that doesn&#x27;t totally collapse if information flows freely, impact assessments for infrastructure projects). Most likely, China will solve their problems in a similar way.')
