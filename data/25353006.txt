Some developers sell their apps on the store, others get hired to build apps that are distributed for free to make people use services they buy outside the store. Banking, business apps, etc. It&#x27;s impossible to lose interest in Android. It&#x27;s too big. Compare it with Windows phone which died for lack of users.')
