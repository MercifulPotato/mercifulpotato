Simply replacing almonds for part of the &quot;staple food&quot; (admittedly high carb) was also strange, although understandable to improve compliance.<p>- we know simply losing weight improves metabolic markers. People in the LCD lost weight. It is hard not to ascribe the improvements to that. That could say something about the potential of LCD for weight loss given the difference in calories between groups wasn&#x27;t statistically significant.')
