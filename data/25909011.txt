But nowadays if you ask someone to point to the &quot;user interface&quot; they&#x27;ll probably point at the screen.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, there seem to be a cottage industry of blog posts and infographics about the &quot;difference between UI and UX&quot; but in practice it seems that most people use them somewhat interchangeably and I&#x27;m not sure how much benefit the semantics debate provides in practice.')
