Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612023366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25970113, text='GM definitely has advantages and failings. Their advantage is actual capability in designing and building cars. They are not particularly behind in their ability to build electric cars.<p>Of course, the Bolt is neither a particularly (universally) attractive car, nor is it produced and distributed to dealerships in quantities sufficient to make a difference.<p>The charging network is obviously Tesla&#x27;s cup of tea.<p>So GM will (almost certainly) make a bunch of appealing electric cars, and they&#x27;ll get them to dealerships. That alone will make waves, but the charging network will likely need work so that reviews of their cars aren&#x27;t littered with experience complaints.<p>It&#x27;s also easy to debate items like software, updates and driver aids. GM is probably average with software (good enough) and average with updates (terrible). They have plenty of good investments with driver aids though they promise a lot less than Tesla (for now).')
