One major difference is that Nazis are more protected in the US than in many other countries. This has purely historical reasons, though. Mainland US was never occupied by Nazis, so consequently it also was never &quot;de-nazified&quot;.<p>However, if you&#x27;re a communist or an ISIS sympathizer or want to publicly display some nipples you won&#x27;t necessarily have more free speech in the US than in Germany.')
