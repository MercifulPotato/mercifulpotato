Having used PushBullet on my Pixel phone for such a long time, I’m scratching my head trying to find an alternative on iOS since it’s no longer available on the platform. I wonder if your app offers some kind of similar features, one of most prominent being sharing links and hopefully files between multiple devices, it be desktop or mobile.')
