Originally part of SQL Server Analysis Services, it got strapped into Excel about a decade ago, and more recently tons of other products[1].<p>The Web[2] connector is what you&#x27;re after. It can consume a variety of formats, including csv, xml, and json. It supports HTTP Basic Auth pretty well, but if you want to put the data source behind oauth it can get tricky (it technically supports it but depends on how novel the implementation is).<p>Credentials sit with the (Excel) client, so if the file gets shared with a new user it&#x27;ll prompt them for authentication details when they first attempt to refresh it. It&#x27;d be pretty easy to set up a template&#x2F;turnkey workbook you can just hand over to new clients with everything all set up and all they have to do is enter their credentials when prompted. Only caveat is Excel for Mac - it only gained Power Query about a year ago, and porting it over is a very involved[3] process including an entire .NET Core rewrite and factoring out Windows dependencies from legacy cruft. The Web connector is one of the many that haven&#x27;t made it over to the Mac yet, so any clients using a Mac would still need an alternative.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;power-query&#x2F;power-query-what-is-power-query#where-to-use-power-query" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;power-query&#x2F;power-query-wha...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;power-query&#x2F;connectors&#x2F;web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;power-query&#x2F;connectors&#x2F;web</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;using-net-core-to-provide-power-query-for-excel-on-mac&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devblogs.microsoft.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;using-net-core-to-prov...</a>')
