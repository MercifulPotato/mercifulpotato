Diners expect what&#x27;s offered to them in the market, and if doordash is offering me your restaurant quality food delivered to my door for $2 then that&#x27;s the value. It doesn&#x27;t matter to the customer that it&#x27;s the result of several billion dollars of venture capital with the expectation that to make that investment worth while the entire western world would need to become indentured servants.')
