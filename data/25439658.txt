They might play it to check their experience (&quot;maybe I was in a bad mood the first time&quot;). Maybe all the coverage in the media made them feel like they needed to give the game a second chance. Maybe they wanted to see if the path or play style they chose was just a bad fit. Maybe they wanted to ensure they had enough data to back up their critique.<p>As someone who has spent years in the games industry, I strongly encourage you to take your players seriously and don&#x27;t just assume you know better.')
