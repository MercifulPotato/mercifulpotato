SaaS) that it&#x27;s meaningless to talk about some of these concepts in terms that are artefacts of the 19th century. I also think that there are far more people who don&#x27;t want to do it than who want to do it but are prevented from pursuing a more entrepreneurial lifestyle by their economic circumstances.<p>Datacenters are complex and expensive, but it&#x27;s now very cheap (in some cases free) to rent resources in them, because they have been commoditized, so I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to talk about them as a &quot;means of production&quot; that the dispossessed masses have been alienated from achieving their productive desires through. Free Software is another area over the last few decades where  barriers to entry in technology have been removed. I doubt that there are too many budding entrepreneurs who are put off solely by the fees to license certain non-free codecs of private datasets in cases where these are the only codecs or datasets that could be used for their business idea.<p>Exceptions to this that I see would include regulatory moats that big incumbents are happy to help build, and a more general tendency for governments to favour regulating private enterprise and then to show partiality towards larger businesses in an attempt to simplify the resulting administration.')
