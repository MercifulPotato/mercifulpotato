If that&#x27;s standardized across languages, then you only have one language.<p>Consider a bunch of languages that all share a standard lambda syntax. If one of the languages has different capture semantics than another (e.g. move vs copy), then you only superficially understand the standard syntax. They <i>mean</i> different things. Having the same syntax doesn&#x27;t buy you very much.')
