Any large media provider (YouTube, Netflix) is <i>already</i> censoring literally <i>everything</i> you see on their sites. There is simply too much content on their sites, that being truly unbiased (chronological order) would be unusable from the perspective of a single user. Given I don’t agree that a blanket ban on certain content (lies) is acceptable, I think what the issue is here is letting this content disseminate virally to millions. This absolutely can be controlled and maybe the ability of posts to go viral should be the middle ground between censorship and total free speech anarchy. I don’t think corporations will ever do this though because viral content is what makes money.')
