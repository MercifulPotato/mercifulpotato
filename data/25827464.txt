Complaining that Pinker (one assumes especially in his <i>A Sense of Style</i>, which I recommend without reservation) writes poorly for academics by focusing on his writing for a non-academic audience.  If you desire a more &quot;academic&quot; style, Pinker is quite capable of providing it, if you look at his journal articles (the abstract to his <i>Formal Models of Abstract Learning</i> at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;0010027779900015" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;001002...</a> should provide sufficient evidence of his familiarity with the norms).  One important aspect of a writer&#x27;s style is how it is directed toward the audience, and Pinker is frequently (and Gladwell is always) not writing for an academic audience.  This post also has a fundamental begging-the-question problem: the academic writing it describes is not notable for an absence of style, but for a very specific terse style that is difficult to do well.')
