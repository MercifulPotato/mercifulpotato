That gives me the latest handset, 2 years protection against my own stupidity, the best eBay return after that period expires, the best battery life always and the happy period before iOS gets slow.<p>If I don’t do that I have to pay up full price for repairs, involve third party repairer risk or write the whole handset off if I do something stupid (which does happen). Also I would have to put up with declining battery health, slower operating systems and worn connectors etc.<p>That applies to the SE as well which has a really low total cost of ownership over two years with all risks mitigated taking resale value into account.<p>Trick is to plan and save up for things you’re going to buy while you’re using the last one.')
