The most clear headed, short form, explanation of hydrogen&#x27;s potential I&#x27;ve seen is here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;liebreich-separating-hype-from-hydrogen-part-two-the-demand-side&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.bnef.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;liebreich-separating-hype-from-h...</a><p>We will likely end up using hydrogen in three situations: chemical feedstocks, some industrial heat processes that may want some reduction too, and backup grid generation. Switching pipelines to hydrogen has huge, unsolved problems.  The energy density is far lower, meaning that even with current demand, natural gas pipelines repurposed to hydrogen would be inadequate. Already, building new pipelines for NG is so difficult that LNG storage is deployed to relieve congestion.  Hydrogen would make that far worse. And there are many small things, like making the pipelines robust to the damaging effects of hydrogen, and even coming up with some sort of odorant like the mercapten in natural gas; we don&#x27;t have any chemicals that can work at the moment.<p>There is a lot of appeal to hydrogen, and with a decade of intense industrial development we may be able to make carbon-free electrolysis derived hydrogen  economical for many use cases. But it won&#x27;t be many, IMHO.')
