Most single-author tools do not do this. It is a consequence of developing in a vacuum. Team-based development allows other eyes to look at it and say &quot;why is checkout used during branch in a different way then branches are checked out?&quot;. Git came from, essentially, one person. That&#x27;s part of it.<p>I think what&#x27;s interesting is that, in the space of programming language development, languages that tend to have a more consistent feel across the language (such as Clojure, Python to some extent) tend to have BDFLs and came from a single person.')
