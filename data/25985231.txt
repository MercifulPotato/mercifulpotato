I&#x27;ve never run a business -- what risk are you incurring by having the cash sitting in a bank? If the play is instead to take a (perhaps small) risk in order to increase your amount of money or keep up with inflation, I understand that. But then I still don&#x27;t see why options are necessary. There&#x27;s lots of ways to do that.<p>The original post described options as a way to make your stream of money both &quot;safer&quot; and &quot;steadier&quot;. I&#x27;m struggling to understand how introducing options can be safer and steadier than keeping money in a bank and creating an intelligent budget.')
