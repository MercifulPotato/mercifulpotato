I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience using my CS degree yet but the main difference between a software developer&#x2F;SWE&#x2F;programmer and a hacker is the amount of paranoia that goes into making something. If you are a good software engineer, you&#x27;ve tested and verified everything and you&#x27;ve made sure there little to no risk to your end user. If you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re a hacker.<p>Not to look down on hackers, but the main reason I think this whole question exists in the computer side of the world but doesn&#x27;t exist for mechanical engineers is that there isn&#x27;t the hacker&#x2F;engineer dichotomy in &quot;traditional&quot; engineering. Maybe makers vs mechanical engineers counts, but almost all of the makers I knew were employed as engineers.<p>A good software engineer&#x2F;developer and a good &quot;traditional&quot; engineer take the time to think through every edge case, every corner case, and any other case that might cause problems. Makers&#x2F;Hackers just get to the first thing that works, damn the consequences for anyone else. Which is fine because often the only people using their product is themselves.<p>Just my $0.02')
