Having access to a diverse information diet<p>I am fully for it, but I believe the ones who need to change the informational diet are not ones who you think they need.<p>If today&#x27;s events make any surprise to HN readers. I will tell them they spent not last 4 years, but like 20 years under a rock, and have no idea whatsoever what moves the political pendulum to the right with such force.
