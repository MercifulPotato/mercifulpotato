Think of a Wikipedia, but made of personal sites and not as rigorous, with a very &quot;personal Web 1.0 website&quot; feel, but talking to a few friends it didn&#x27;t seem like they saw much point in it.<p>Alongside this idea, would you use a browser plugin that shares your bookmarks as a stream? Almost like a cross of the github &quot;X starred Y&quot; stream and Twitter (with none of the social-y features). I favorite a lot of things from day to day and would love to know what others are favoriting&#x2F;finding as well.<p>Also, somewhat unrelated to that, would you pay for encrypted offsite joplin sync target&#x2F;backups?<p>I&#x27;d love to make it possible to also share-from-joplin for single notes but that feature isn&#x27;t there yet. The only way to make it happen otherwise would be synchronizing somewhere unencrypted (!) and then asking that somewhere to &quot;publish&quot; your notes. Unfortunately, since joplin doesn&#x27;t have multiple &quot;profiles&quot; or any way to separate encryption keys or which notes are and aren&#x27;t encrypted... it&#x27;s hard to do that as well..')
