Item(by='bogidon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611359834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874812, text='&gt; What are concrete examples of &quot;US government to take a lead on building charging infrastructure?“<p>They don’t need to take over right of ways. The DOT (or whoever) could help by aiding standardization of chargers and payments, creating a program to fund design of street-side chargers, provide incentives (in the form of taxes perhaps) for cities to meet EV infra quotas.<p>&gt; why continue to subsidize the overprovisioning of transportation capability in the form of largely unused, quickly depreciating equipment with low watt to work efficiency?<p>Oh trust me, I really feel this. Maybe you’re right that any incrementalism in reducing carbon emissions is wrong, and we should go all in on the optimal solution, ie ban cars and redesign cities. But even if the govt did radically depart from the past 50 years of stalled infrastructure, and went all in, it would <i>still</i> take a long time until an alternative to the personal vehicle is practical to all urban&#x2F;suburban dwellers. Long enough for a switch to EVs to be unjustifiable from a climate perspective, probably (I would very much like numbers)<p>But yes, I am just as tired of the mantra of lesser of two evils. But maybe that’s just how democracy is destined to unfold.')
