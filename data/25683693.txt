And how can you say the behaviors in the video is inconclusive proof of voter fraud!?! Or at least suggest voter fraud?!<p>Where&#x27;s even the thumb drive? You&#x27;ve managed to see things from a few pixels and what commentators are saying what it is. What if I tell you, that&#x27;s a bag of weed. Can you see a bag of weed? What, no? Can you see a thumbdrive? I can&#x27;t!<p>&gt; Actually lots of voting machines read the ballot and record the result onto digital media.<p>So... this lady, who looks like her job is to sit there and count mail ballots, also has access to the voting machines (which is nowhere to be seen near her in the video), and is allowed to have custody of the results for who knows how long, while she does other work? These assumptions would mean such lax security, that then sure, rampant voter fraud is possible. Next you and the entire fraud-founding Internet commenters will want to see the security procedures of the whole voting operation and that are to your satisfaction. I don&#x27;t have all the facts and can&#x27;t deny that maybe they are that mind-numbingly lax (in which case, as a supporter of a US government based on sanity rather than nutjob conspiracy theories, I would be worried that rampant and easy voter fraud benefiting Republicans happened), but don&#x27;t you think there would have been Republican party officials who have actually reviewed said procedures and who would&#x27;ve said &quot;Hey, why are you letting random people have custody of the digital results?&quot;.')
