Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610160542, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25694527, text='&quot;Rebels&quot; &quot;Revolutionaries&quot; and &quot;Freedom fighters&quot; (amongst others) also refer to political violence. What distinguishes them from terrorists?<p>Actually, I think all four of these words have the same issue: none of them refer to a specific deed. Arson can be terrorism. Assault and battery can be terrorism. Mass murder can be terrorism.<p>Maybe we need to turn it into an adjective instead. Terror-theft, terror-torture, terror-trespassing. It seems obvious to me that those things are not the same. Yet we lump them all under one label. Maybe there&#x27;s different lines where those acts cross into terrorism? It&#x27;s not terror-theft unless you&#x27;ve stolen the nuclear briefcase? Or maybe a laptop is enough. Is that what we&#x27;re arguing?')
