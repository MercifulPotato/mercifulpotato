In the UK that means 20%.<p>So a machine that&#x27;s £5k retail becomes £4167 without VAT, effectively £3333 if you take into account tax savings, which only apply if your company is in profit. A £15K machine effectively would still cost you £10k.<p>It&#x27;s a big saving, sure, but it&#x27;s still a very expensive machine.')
