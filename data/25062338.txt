Item(by='Fej', descendants=None, kids=[25062478], score=None, time=1605125032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25061290, text='YouTube allows free video uploads and ingests an incredible amount of content every day. Most of that content won&#x27;t make any money, or just pennies, and yet they&#x27;re storing it for free. They&#x27;re not running out of space.<p>In retrospect, it&#x27;s not surprising that they&#x27;re ending the unlimited free ride. Most (all?) of the major photo hosting sites ended their unlimited free plans ages ago. Clearly it is not sustainable from a business perspective.<p>(I am not referring to the meme sites like Imgur who host images at a far lower resolution with a far higher compression ratio, which is of course useless for photos.)')
