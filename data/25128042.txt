The city exemplifies all classic east coast metropolii; it&#x27;s vertical, industrial, impatient, no-nonsense and in-your-face.  Having lived here for 15 years I&#x27;ve seen Philly offer a little bit of everything, from cultured worldliness to provincial naval gazing.  And all of it happens at an urban breakneck speed the east coast is rightly famous for.<p>Philly, Boston, and NYC are kith and kin (esp. politically), and have much more in common with SF than do SC or non-urban FL.  There the tempo of life is slower and more formal, like their danse de rigueur, the gavotte.')
