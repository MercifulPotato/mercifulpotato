Some of them where directly coming for the cops directly attacking them or setting buildings on fire where they where inside. While the people who stormed the building today had zero interest in the cops. The protest was against the other people in the building not the cops. Even after the woman got shot there was no sign of revenge against cops. There is even evidence that cops where immediately given access to the victim to save her (which apparently wasn&#x27;t possible anymore).')
