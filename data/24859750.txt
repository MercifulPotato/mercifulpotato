The types of things I would memorize:<p>- Key theorems<p>- Proofs<p>- Any kind of visualizations (e.g. statistical distributions)<p>- Properties<p>- Trig identities<p>A lot of time in math or math heavy fields, there are a lot of tiny details and nuances. Using an SRS properly really solidifies those concepts in your head (See my comment below on manufacturing &#x27;aha&#x27; moments). It also helped because a lot of those key concepts were <i>immediately</i> available in my mind and I was 100% I had them correct. Memorization reduces a lot of mental friciton.')
