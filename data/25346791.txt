Item(by='sombrero_guitar', descendants=None, kids=[25349158], score=None, time=1607442565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345134, text='The Airpods Max is more comparable to something like Sony WH-1000XM4, Bose 700, or B&amp;O Beoplay H9. You can&#x27;t really compare wired openback headphones to headphones that are meant to be worn in public on the go. However, even among the wireless headphones with active noise canceling, the Airpods Max are more expensive than their competition. The closest in terms of features and price is the Beoplay H9 and that is $50-100 cheaper depending on where you buy it. To many people the extra integration with Apple products is worth paying the difference. For other people, especially those not all in on the Apple ecosystem, the cheaper competitors are a better option. However, comparing it to products in a different class is not a very good argument.')
