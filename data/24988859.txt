In our case, it also interacts with other GCP APIs, so the security model where we can just grant the Cloud Function service account granular access is extra convenient and would require extra engineering to duplicate if there were a free host somewhere that we could run the same code. GCP has a free tier and if that were the only thing we ran there, it would probably be covered. I really don&#x27;t know about what&#x27;s included in their free tier though because the other services we run on GCP put us well past whatever it might include.')
