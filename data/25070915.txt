The more you add the more loopholes pop up and the more it&#x27;s likely to piss people off.<p>Some examples where you can see reasonable people starting to take issue:<p>&gt;The only exception to sexual topics is channels&#x2F;spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity.<p>Eh, why? Why should there be any sexual topics at all? Why do sexual preferences of a certain kind give you a pass to breach an otherwise taboo subject here?<p>&gt;Making light of&#x2F;making mocking comments about trigger warnings and content warnings.<p>Why? Even people who use these can make light of them sometimes. Imagine a thread starting with &quot;TW: copyright fetishism&quot; that&#x27;s funny for a service that lets you stream your own purchased music to your friends and family!<p>&gt;Any attempt to present “reverse-ism” as examples of oppression. Examples of reverse-isms are “reverse racism”, “reverse sexism”, “heterophobia”, and “cisphobia”.<p>Again, these things can and do happen. Different groups and communities have different norms. And it&#x27;s human nature to punish&#x2F;mock deviance from the norm. That can happen to anyone. I totally get that there is a longer andore fleshed out history of racism in, say, the US against black people than against anyone else. But still, this seems unnecessary and guaranteed to cause problems...<p>&gt;Any of the above even when presented as “ironic” or “joking”.<p>They will ignore this of course when anyone jokes about how conservatives or whoever is a racist &#x2F; sexist &#x2F; etc.<p>I actually like the anti-meritocracy statement. If people take the time to read it, they&#x27;ll find it largely agreeable. I strongly dislike the code of conduct though. That&#x27;s guaranteed to stir up conflicts.')
