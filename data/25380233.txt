I&#x27;ve been able to go on several trips and stayed in some really great places that I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to without it.<p>As a college student it allowed me to attend conferences that I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to afford, take trips with friends, etc. and as a working person I would still choose it over a hotel many times.<p>Hotels are expensive, with lots of hidden fees and very little innovation.
