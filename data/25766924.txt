What about all those companies or teams out there using exclusively functional programming and succeeding? Their own experience would be evidence that avoiding OOP is good (as it has been good, demonstrably, for them). If they merely spoke from their own experience and attested to the good things that demonstrably came from avoiding OOP, you would consider that <i>dangerous</i>?<p>That’s a ridiculous perspective.<p>Again, it’s totally fine to <i>disagree</i> with them, and make solid counterpoints if you can, but calling them <i>dangerous</i> is completely ludicrous.<p>This makes you sound like a narrow OOP zealot who gets cranky when people point out the truth that any use case solvable by OOP is also solvable with at least equal quality and equal satisfaction of the constraints using functional programming.<p>Again, merely disagreeing is one thing, and raising pros vs cons of some specific OOP design. But to call it <i>dangerous</i> to suggest OOP may never be needed is just completely unreasonable. I question your understanding of the concept “dangerous” in that case, and if it were up to me, you’d lose downvote privileges treating people like that and misrepresenting their sincere, evidence based software ideas with a derogatory term like “dangerous.”')
