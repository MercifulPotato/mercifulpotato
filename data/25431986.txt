Yes, you want your code as good as possible, your docs as good as possible, your knowledge transfer as good as possible. But there is ultimately no substitute!<p>Domain knowledge matters, and takes years to develop. Familiarity with the codebase matters, and in a complex and changing codebase is a process that is never complete.  Having access to the people who wrote the things in the first place matters.<p>These facts are often neglected in a world where developers are treated like swappable commodities, and it&#x27;s considered normal to job hop frequently.<p>Organizations that treat developers well and give them paths of advancement&#x2F;reward within the organization to encourage developers to stick around for a while will reap benefits.')
