(EDIT: it appears HN is randomizing the order on each reload? That&#x27;s sometimes but not always a good idea.)<p>The most informative polls will have the least complication in wording&#x2F;answers, &amp; minimal &quot;preamble&quot; that risks priming answerers to think of things in the author&#x27;s way.')
