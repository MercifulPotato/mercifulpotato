Both of which are actually species of salmon in the genus Oncorhynchus, which are true salmon.<p>Would they be affected by the chemical?<p>How about other species of fish?<p>That&#x27;s the thing about this kind of stuff, it&#x27;s not necessarily localized. There&#x27;s a lot we don&#x27;t know about ecosystems and the long term effects of chemicals like this. Chances are though, if it affects one area in such a negative way, it&#x27;ll have other negative effects.')
