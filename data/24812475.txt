Similarly, I don&#x27;t have a problem with birds being carnivorous.<p>That said, anyone reading this post is probably not a lion or a bird, and has some level of self-reflection as a result.  Just to play devil&#x27;s advocate for a bit, couldn&#x27;t you argue that <i>if it&#x27;s possible</i> for me to live a fairly healthy life without killing any higher-minded creatures, then I should? If we are smart enough to have an entire philosophy of ethics, then shouldn&#x27;t we be using this ethical framework to minimize suffering in the world?<p>I should reemphasize, I&#x27;m not a vegan, or a vegetarian, I have a fairly typical American diet of &quot;it&#x27;s not a meal without meat&quot; sadly.
