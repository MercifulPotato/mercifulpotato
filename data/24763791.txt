Much of it consists of objectively false information that is fed to the uninformed.<p>Take, for example, the long-running Republican voter suppression tactic of using targeted messages to mislead demographics likely to vote Democratic into thinking that the election day is later than it is.[0] This is objectively false information: the date of elections is officially determined, widely published, and not subject to differences of opinion. Entities which spread this kind of information are engaging in disinformation campaigns.<p>Other trivially identifiable disinformation campaigns include claims that &#x27;urban liberals&#x27; were setting fire to rural areas in Oregon, claims that the IFR for COVID-19 is no worse than that for influenza, and conspiracy theories that push hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure for COVID-19. There&#x27;s no gray area with any of these issues; the lines they push are objectively false and are socially destructive.<p>Dealing with information gray areas is hard, but an awful lot of disinformation is trivial to identify and wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to clean up if it wasn&#x27;t beneficial to large piles of money with close ties to social media companies.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States#Voting_procedure_disinformation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voter_suppression_in_the_Unite...</a>')
