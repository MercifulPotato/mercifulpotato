Seems like we have a lot of history we could look at where gov could not print money how it pleased.<p>&gt; The enforcement of debt and the ability to track money seem, to me, like some of its most important properties. If I can’t tell how much Bitcoin someone has, how can they be made financially responsible in court?<p>Seems fairly easy to me - you ask them how much money they have, they tell you. If they lie, you throw them in jail. Its really no different than how we handle people who keep there money in the form of gold bars under the bed, or in offshore bank accounts. Sure you can sometimes get away with shinanigans, but its not a new problem.<p>&gt; I’m also interested in what a world with a fixed amount of currency really looks like. I would imagine “inflating away” debtors obligations through fiat would not really be on the table.<p>It would look like the gold standard. inflating away debt with fiat in a major way is pretty uncommon anyway and usually ends badly (Germany tried that and we ended up with WWII!)<p>&gt; 65% hashrate by china, 51%attack, etc<p>It should be noted that a 51% attack is generally something noticeable. Its not a secret attack. So that reduces risk somewhat. Also i thought 51% attacks were actually closer to only needing 33%.<p>&gt; Energy, environment<p>Yeah, i agree with author on these points. Ethereum is doing some interesting stuff here.')
