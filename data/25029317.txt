Those polls don&#x27;t distinguish between voters who really care about an issue and hardly care about an issue.  They don&#x27;t distinguish between undecided voters and card carrying party members.  Plus you also have to account for the almost obligatory attack by the opposition that somebody legalizing drugs is involved with them and&#x2F;or obsessed with trivial matters.')
