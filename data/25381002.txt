Item(by='hkdb', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1607648368, title='Ask HN: A GUI Password-Less Encryption Assistant', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I recently put together a tool to make key-based encrypted file sharing more usable for my company and decided to start working on a version for public consumption since I got some interests from friends and customers around me. There is already a substantial list of improvements and changes down the pipeline derived from our own testing and they are being actively added over time. Would love to gather some thoughts from the community here.<p>The idea is that everything happens locally via a GUI app within 3 clicks and the &quot;cloud service&quot; only stores contact names, respective public keys, and other non-sensitive information so that the app can seamlessly handle key management for the users. It&#x27;s also designed to be transport and storage agnostic so the users can keep using whatever they are already using for file sharing and chat rather than having to be forced to migrate to yet another &quot;secure chat app&quot;. Here&#x27;s the blog post with more background on it:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hkdb.medium.com&#x2F;password-less-encryption-assistant-142e31fc16e9<p>Looking forward to hear your thoughts! Thanks!')
