The YouTube videos speak for themselves. The <i>death</i> toll speaks for itself.<p>&gt; Colbert: <i>”I know there are protests still happening in major cities across the United States, I&#x27;m just not seeing the reporting on it that I had for the first few weeks,&quot;</i><p>The “protests” were violet mobs which destroyed property and killed people. The media made up a narrative of “fiery but mostly peaceful protest” while buildings (and people’s livelihoods) literally burned in the background.<p>$2 billion dollars of damage.<p>&gt; <i>This isn’t going to stop.</i><p>Police shot in the head, doused with gasoline, government buildings burned into the ground.<p>&gt; <i>This is a movement I’m telling you.</i><p>City capitol buildings invaded. Throngs calling for the removal of the elected leader of Seattle. City blocks occupied for days by an armed insurgent force.<p>&gt; <i>they&#x27;re not going to let up — and they should not. And we should not,&quot; she concluded.</i><p>Ted Wheeler seems to be finally coming around to this, god knows how it took him so long;<p>&gt; <i>“My good-faith efforts at de-escalation have been met with ongoing violence and even scorn from radical Antifa and anarchists,” Wheeler said in a New Year’s Day press conference. “In response, it will be necessary to use additional tools and to push the limits of the tools we already have to bring the criminal destruction and violence to an end.”</i><p>Like I’ve been saying for the last two days, you can either say people like Kamala are inciting violent protest that was actively ongoing when they made these statements, and you can hold Trump to the same standard yesterday. Or you can let Kamala off the hook, but then you let Trump off at the same time.<p>You can’t hold Trump to one standard and Kamala to another. You can’t call yesterday an insurrection and last year a summer of love.')
