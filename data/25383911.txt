To be clear figuring out the subtleties of exactly how this is verified and edge cases with the type system is non-trivial, but as a developer this extends the set of types that “just work” as associated types. Crucially, it allows avoiding some weird hacks to get the borrow checker happy with non-static lifetime associated types in many situations.')
