Let me start by saying that I agree the numbers would look completely different if it weren&#x27;t for the Electoral College. That is because the Republican platform has consistently failed to win over a majority of Americans: absent the EC, the Republican Party would have to recalibrate its platform in order to remain competitive. This feedback mechanism is essential to a functioning democracy, and it&#x27;s currently broken, because Republicans still have a decent shot at winning nationally thanks to the bias in the EC.<p>With respect to your argument that the EC actually overrepresents swing states, you may be correct. However, the EC bias clearly favors Republicans over Democrats. In 2020, that bias was 3.9% in favor of Republicans, although it varies from election to election[0]. When the size of the bias exceeds the margin of victory for the winner of the popular vote, the popular vote loser takes the EC, as in 2016.<p>Furthermore, you didn&#x27;t actually address the most antidemocratic institution of all: the Senate. The Senate is <i>heavily</i> biased towards small states; California (pop 39m) and Wyoming (pop &lt; 1m) each have two senators. The average state is currently much more Republican than the average American, amounting to 6.6% bias[1]. That is to say, Democrats could win by five points nationally (a huge victory given current polarization levels) and <i>still</i> not control the Senate.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m sure that you can end up with a situation wherein conservatives &quot;feel&quot; underrepresented; my whole point is that they objectively are not, so this whole persecution complex evinced by some is completely ridiculous. People are entitled to their feelings; they should also be willing to look at facts and adjust their reactions accordingly.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-11-22&#x2F;republican-electoral-college-edge-isn-t-built-in-to-the-u-s-voting-system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-11-22&#x2F;republ...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;the-senates-rural-skew-makes-it-very-hard-for-democrats-to-win-the-supreme-court&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;the-senates-rural-skew-...</a>')
