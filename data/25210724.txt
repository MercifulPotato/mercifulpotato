Item(by='WarOnPrivacy', descendants=None, kids=[25210913], score=None, time=1606320682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208359, text='&gt; Is there an example of a story on mainstream news sites that was covered without new info?<p>In this thread, you and I have brought up a couple of points. I highlighted the tendency of prominent news orgs to choose their headline articles from one small stack of stories. That should be self-evident unless you rarely see different news sites with related headlines - which would be really odd.<p>You asked about news stories that don&#x27;t add any content, which is a somewhat different issue. For that I offer news orgs parroting biz&#x2F;gov&#x2F;LEO press releases - without vetting for accuracy or without supplying relevant historical context. Though that&#x27;s a particularly pervasive problem in local &amp; state news, major news orgs tend to do it whenever they get in front of federal LEO&#x2F;IC officials (eg: James Comey + &quot;Going Dark&quot;).<p>One final example that fits both points is news sites republishing Reuters&#x2F;AP&#x2F;UPI articles verbatim.')
