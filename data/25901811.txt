Item(by='KineticLensman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611572207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901341, text='&gt; Turns out you can write a lot of very prescient-sounding scifi by taking tech that already exist but isn&#x27;t widely known, and positing a world where it is everywhere<p>I think this is one reason &#x27;Shockwave Rider&#x27; [0] from 1975 still holds up quite well today. IIRC the author (John Brunner) had people using their phones to access remote computers and didn&#x27;t go into tech details of how they actually did this. When I read it more recently, it held up much better than (say) Arthur C. Clarke novels from the same era, because Clarke as a hard-SF technologist tried e.g. to predict what future gadgets might look like and how they might work.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Shockwave_Rider" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Shockwave_Rider</a>')
