Centralized mining and existing wealth inequality really don&#x27;t allow us to escape the fundamental problems with big banks. BTC is an emergent bank where the first and wealthiest movers who own the most mining real estate act as the new big banks.<p>It seems that, asymptotically, bitcoin will just end up suffering from the very things it meant to fix. The whole idea behind proof-of-work was rooted in &quot;one cpu, one vote&quot;, but we clearly see that this does not imply &quot;one person one vote&quot;. Proof-of-stake suffers from centralization as well, albeit being a green solution.<p>Proof-of-I-am-a-unique-human does not exist yet and is an unsolved problem in the intersection between biology, physics, and engineering. Neuralink comes to mind as the closest existing thing that might be relevant here, but it&#x27;s not even close. Until you can really guarantee that a single human can only represent a single vote, blockchain doesn&#x27;t seem viable as a &quot;fix for banks&quot;, it&#x27;s just a reincarnation. Even then, nothing stops people from coming together and forming vote schemes.')
