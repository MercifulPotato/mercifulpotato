This probably stems naturally from the way the two products came into being.<p>Delphi evolved from a compiler with full access to the underlying Windows API, with a GUI builder and framework layered on top. Drag a control into a form, and it was fairly easy to see the code behind it down to the layer of the Win32 API itself.<p>In contract, VB started out as a point and click builder for custom Program Manager like tools, and then had MS Basic attached. You could drag a control into a form, but then there was a very clear delineation between  the code you could write as a VB developer and the hidden, opaque code provided by VB itself.')
