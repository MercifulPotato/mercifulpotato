I&#x27;ve been running ops teams for a long time, and eventually all teams have ended up spending some time optimising our CI tooling to involve some degree of caching - so you definitely are on to something.<p>Before I clicked your pricing I&#x27;d really wished for an affordable pricing plan to run this on BYO resources, but only your enterprise plan seems to cover this. I always get an iffy feeling when I have to build my software on external resources I have 0 control over. Your downtime will prevent teams from shipping their code - but I guess that thought is part of your upsell to the enterprise plan.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s one of these ideas I&#x27;d wish I had years ago, so congratz to you.')
