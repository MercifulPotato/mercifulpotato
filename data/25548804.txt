When you get two conflicting measurements of the dosages, the correct response is to <i>test it a third time</i>, not assume the second is correct. This failure mechanism was the same in Boeing.<p>Not that we need to be: we already have Pfizer and Moderna, that did their trials properly and showed proper results.')
