For profit. Is that really not how it looks to you?<p>Has the CEO been charged? How bad does the crime have to be before the CEO being involved in it before it happened, or becoming aware and profiting from it after without informing the police before the CEO is themselves charged for the CEO&#x27;s criminal behaviour in engaging in a criminal conspiracy with respect to that crime.<p>I&#x27;m hoping if the crime was murder, conspiring by the CEO would result in charges. Yes?<p>What level of crime is sheielded? Should any crime be sheielded like this?')
