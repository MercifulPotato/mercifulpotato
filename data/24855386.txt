Kids in school like to mock you endlessly if you even accidentally say a word in the wrong tone that means something different (especially if it sounds close to swearing words).<p>With all that pretext in mind -- having grown up there until I was 13, I had never met any native speaker in HK who couldn&#x27;t pronounce words in correct tones. Not a single person.')
