So much Javadoc.<p>10-15 years on, pretty much the same. I feel like I&#x27;ve forgotten more than the renaissance men had learned by the time they got to my age. I think it&#x27;s easy to underestimate how much you know now, compared to the romanticized 19th century fellows. And we&#x27;re fairly common people, whereas those people were often in the higher circles of society (I mean a lot seemed to spend their time taking long walks to chat or write letters to their peers, doing science and philosophy and shit without having to worry about income. That may just be the romanticized view &#x2F; biographer&#x27;s fault though)')
