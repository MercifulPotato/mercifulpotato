Apart from that I’m not sure what you mean with interoperability, because the resources can only be owned by one stack.<p>For sure stacks created with those frameworks can use resources that are created by Terraform in other stacks. Serverless for example has its own integration with the Parameter Store for encrypted variables, so that there’s no need to use environment variables in that use case. Terraform would then create the Paramter Store keys which SLS could reference.')
