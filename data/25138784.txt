You are spending all your time now on homework that is actually demanding, if not in difficultly at least in volume.\n2. You are just handed the collective knowledge of all of humanity, forget about hormones for a second which are already a struggle, you get to learn that half of america thinks there was a conspiracy to kill jfk, you get to learn about goulogs and consentration camps and you get to come to the conclusion that being creative is a struggle in a society that would pay an accountant over an artist any day and you somehow think this is the fault of the device reading the history back to her.<p>3. You add all that to the crazy changes your going through in terms of social conduct and physical appearance, along with that desire to be cool and noticed and it&#x27;s not hard to see why this is a rough time for almost everyone.<p>Just keep her away from the hard drugs and try and take her out to do things she wants to do when you can find the time and it will probably all turn out alright in the end, but running around blaming iphones is a good way to make sure when a problem really does happen she&#x27;s less inclined to bring it up for fear you will take the phone away')
