It seems reasonable to me on the basis that they are basing their actions on <i>actual</i> risk of <i>actual</i> violence occurring as a result of statements. So they have ignored everything up to now because there was not tangible evidence that violence could result. They&#x27;re now in a position where there is tangible evidence that violence is a realistic outcome from Trump&#x27;s words, and this has altered their interpretation of his statements generally.')
