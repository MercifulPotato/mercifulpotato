Item(by='usr1106', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606046607, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173701, text='Phoronix headlines are often sensational click bait. I still read them occasionally, because Linux news are not covered that well by many other news sources.<p>This article makes no exception to the sensational headline rule: The &quot;lots of&quot; changes are less than 5 that could maybe be important for a larger user base.<p>It&#x27;s still worth a news item because not many would have expected a new release at all. But &quot;lots of&quot; is certainly misleading for anybody who reads open source change logs and does not apply a Phoronix filter.<p>As said elsewhere according to HN submission guidelines this article is not a valid submission, the release mail would have been. But probably it would not have been upvoted and most of us would have missed it. Click bait works :)')
