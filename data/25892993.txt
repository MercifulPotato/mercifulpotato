Most of it is not food rated because it&#x27;s mostly useless in food production. You are taking an extremely limited risk by using it to displace air in a wine bottle especially considering you are not actually puting it inside the wine.<p>Obviously you should use food rated argon if you want to be safe. It&#x27;s just going to be more expensive and harder to source.')
