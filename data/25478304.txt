An earlier future than necessary. My beef is not with you, but I am annoyed with Apple selling devices that are not upgradeable. If they would just be reasonable and let users upgrade their ram, the laptop would continue to be useful when (not if) more than the current minimum of acceptable system memory is needed.<p>Given how overpriced the bigger memory configurations are I understand why you took that risk.<p>The earlier parts of my comment just reflect my impression that you overestimate the performance of that laptop compared to available alternatives. 10x faster is just not accurate. Remember the context: A huge group of Apple fanboys that buy everything the company produces without being aware of the alternatives and drawbacks. That&#x27;s why it feels important to point out misconceptions like that, whether they are really there or just the interpretation.')
