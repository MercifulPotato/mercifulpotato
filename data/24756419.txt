One thing I learned is that file dumps and the profile browser are kindof a trap. You discard a huge amount of information when you dump the heap summary to file. The guppy docs aren&#x27;t too great, but you can poke around the entire heap in detail if you break into a debugger after taking a heap snapshot. You can explore references and referrers, group objects by various categories, and inspect their values without the tedious ctypes cast trick.')
