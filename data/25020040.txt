Basically to allow them to open source the software for those that want to host it for their own use, but preventing the big cloud providers from taking all their business. It&#x27;s not really &#x27;copyleft&#x27; though because it takes away a users freedom (albeit a very small and limited one).<p>The GNU Affero GPL [1], adds the requirement that using the open source software in a server environment you must also provide the ability for your users to download the source code. It doesn&#x27;t address the problems through royalties because that&#x27;s kind of against the GNU philosophy, but it does stop the cloud providers from just taking the software and modifying it and using for cloud infrastructure without providing the modifications back to the community.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are other examples of this kind of this.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.timescale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.timescale.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-open-source-busines...</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;why-affero-gpl.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;why-affero-gpl.html</a>')
