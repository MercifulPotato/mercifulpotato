His stake was gifted to him in 2013 by his father, Gustav Witzoe, who founded the company in 1991.<p>- Elisabeth Furtwaengler, daughter of publishing magnate Hubert Burda and doctor and actress Maria Furtwaengler, owns 25% of Burda Media Group.<p>- Lisa and her father, Fritz Draexlmaier, preside over auto parts maker Fritz Draexlmaier Holding GmbH, of which Lisa is sole owner.<p>- Anna Kasprzak, along with her brother Andr√© and mother Hanni, owns $1.46 billion (sales) Danish shoe manufacturer, ECCO. ECCO was founded by Kasprzak&#x27;s late grandfather, Karl Toosbuy, in 1963.<p>- ...<p>This doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise or anything, but I thought it would be something curious to show.
