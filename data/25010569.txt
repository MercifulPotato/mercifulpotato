A self-signed cert could be from a man in the middle attacker.<p>An active MITM is a relatively more exotic threat than a passive observer. In the days when certificates cost money, there was a legitimate argument that you shouldn&#x27;t need the whole elaborate active-MITM defense just to get protection against passive snooping.
