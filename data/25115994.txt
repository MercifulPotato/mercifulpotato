Item(by='covercash', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605555316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115238, text='&gt; what&#x27;s to stop Seamless (for example) from winning the SEO race against a non-trivial chunk of small restaurant websites? This would mean that there are plenty of cases in which you search for a restaurant and end up on Seamless, even though that&#x27;s not the &quot;right&quot; search result.<p>This is exactly what Slice does. They create a plausible sounding url and outrank small pizza shops. They also replace the phone number so orders get routed through their call center. They end up charging more for both phone and online orders through their site. They also encourage users to install the Slice app.<p>Before I realized what was happening, I ordered through Slice twice (one online and one phone order) and both times they sent my order to a completely wrong address 15 minutes away from me. Thatâ€™s what made me dig a little bit and discover their shady practices.')
