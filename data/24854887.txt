In the future your goal should really be to power <i>those industrial plants</i> 100%. Geothermal can do that. It&#x27;s basically free energy, and you are just redirecting the heat to do something else in the process, like whatever industrial processes they&#x27;re doing, before it all gets emitted as heat anyway.<p>Harvesting an industrial plant&#x27;s own waste heat isn&#x27;t going to power the industrial plant, and thus, you still make them rely on burning some other fuel that would otherwise not have to be burned.')
