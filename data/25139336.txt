That&#x27;s market forces at play. You want it there? Accept it on salary negotiation too.<p>This is itself a bit naive. In a basic market with voluntary transactions the distribution of the gains from trade is undefined.<p>If your labor sells for $100&#x2F;hour and costs you $10&#x2F;hour to produce (basic food, water and shelter) then it is a perfectly legitimate equilibrium for the company to pay you $10.01&#x2F;hour and take the other %89.99 as profit.<p>It&#x27;s only through politics that we can make sure that the gains from trade are evenly split. The math of markets doesn&#x27;t define it.')
