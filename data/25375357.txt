The web of the 2010s feels so sterile with cookie-cutter responsive templates. The weirdness is almost entirely restricted to meme images drawn in MSPaint or videos from YT&#x27;ers or TikTokers trying to get a TV deal.<p>I&#x27;d love have a developer take a look at some the Flash website tours on the Web Design Museum YT channel and comment on whether rebuilding those in HTML, CSS and JS only is feasible. Some of those websites were built 20 years ago and look far more advanced than what we see these days.')
