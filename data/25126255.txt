I also don&#x27;t think DNS-based content blocking is really as popular as the PiHole community would say. I use client-side content blocking like uBO instead, which I imagine is overwhelmingly the more common solution, and it is also more powerful and effective (and easier to use).<p>UK ISPs having mandatory DNS blocking is a great example of why DoH is important. The user should decide what they want, not the network operator.<p>Perhaps widespread use of encryption technologies means I can&#x27;t do content blocking on proprietary appliances like the Chromecast for example. I think that&#x27;s a necessary evil and I just won&#x27;t buy such an appliance if it&#x27;s that big of a problem. Only legislation can really fix that kind of problem anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really matter whether Firefox implements DoH or not.')
