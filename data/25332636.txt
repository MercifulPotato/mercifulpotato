I ended up doing so because Nvidia dropped updates a few years back and Apple never did update the drivers.<p>I would like to see a world class GPU from Apple but again, I repeat this often, it won&#x27;t mean much more than marketing materials if they don&#x27;t get developers on board. This means more than just publishing oriented developers; video, pictures, and audio. That market is not sufficiently large to pull in other software as has been proven over the decades let alone get people to pay a premium for a system; because people do shop based on $$$ outside of gamers who wont&#x27; even look if there game isn&#x27;t supported.<p>across Black Friday there were many good windows laptops at $500 or less with SSDs, some with dGPU, and most with 16gb ram. people see that and also that they know software just works and that is what Apple still is up against, hardware superiority or not')
