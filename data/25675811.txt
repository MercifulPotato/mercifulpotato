What you described can be easily said about north korea. The elite own everything and the workers own nothing. Is north korea capitalist. NO! Cause the workers can&#x27;t built or create anything of their own.<p>In the US thats why 80% of the millionaires are self made. Because someone in a middle class or lower class can make something people want and people can choose to give them money. Working and not owning anything isn&#x27;t static in this system')
