I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with that.<p>I recently switched to integrated AMD graphics, and the only problem I had was occasional render artifacts. Yes, a bit scary, but in practice only an occasional cosmetic problem. I think those disappeared completely some time ago. This is on a stock kernel.<p>The only graphics-related problems I have these days are with Wine and some old games, where it looks like there&#x27;s a difference between what Wine emulates and what it expects to get directly from the 3D driver, e.g. with regards to old 16 bit color modes that I suppose the AMD driver simply doesn&#x27;t bother with.')
