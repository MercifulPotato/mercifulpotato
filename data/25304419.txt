Programming is very much a skill which is sensitive to practice, so I think more hours on the keyboard is a pretty good way to get better at programming.<p>However I think programming &quot;as a hobby&quot; is a poor <i>metric</i> for judging who is going to be the best programmer, in terms of a hiring process, for two reasons:<p>1. It&#x27;s already well-known that many companies will favor people who program outside of work during a hiring process, so many people will try to appear as if they are the kind of person who lives and breathes coding, and cultivating that image is much different than actually getting practice.<p>2. Raw programming skill is not always the best indicator of how good a contributor to a project someone will be.  Sure you have to be competent at coding, but beyond a certain level, assuming the project is not particularly technically challenging like HPC or computer graphics or something, things like communication skills, being able to write good documentation, and being able to produce in a consistent and predictable way play as much a part in the team&#x27;s success as being a wizard on the keyboard.<p>And I say that as someone who <i>does</i> spend a lot of my free time coding.')
