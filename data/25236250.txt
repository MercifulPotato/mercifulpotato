On the one hand it came across as a (well-tempered) rant against Bill Gates.<p>On the other hand, the author seems to want the world to produce more people like Bill Gates:<p>&gt; He looks at education from a societal point of view, while I look at the brain of an individual. He wants to move the masses to high achievement, while I want to produce more little Bill Gateses.<p>&gt; Unlike myself, Bill Gates does not focus on having more Bill Gateses. He focuses on helping the poor, in boosting qualifications of the middle class, and adds &quot;you can&#x27;t run a society on top 5%&quot;. He is right, however, that top 5% can forge a path in education that would inspire all the rest. They cannot be run through a compulsory system set on pushing through the remaining 95%.<p>I see where the author is coming from here, but I question whether &quot;the education system&quot; is at fault for the lack of excess Bill Gateses in the world. (I would attribute it more to things like genetics, money and luck).<p>My own view at the moment leans towards &quot;a rising tide lifts all boats&quot;. No, the education system doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, and it&#x27;s certainly not just the top 5% that it doesn&#x27;t work for. (Sir Ken Robinson has had some interesting things to say about this - I highly recommend his books and TED talks.)<p>The education system in every country (and state in many cases) is different, and every individual&#x27;s experience of their education is different.<p>&gt; My approach is probably more suited to well-developed nations where the industrial approach makes people sick of schooling.<p>This is a really interesting observation - let&#x27;s just talk about ways the education systems can be improved in Income-Level 4 countries then (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gapminder.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;four-income-levels&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gapminder.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;four-income-levels&#x2F;</a>), and leave Bill Gates out of it completely.')
