What I see as the biggest risk (other than from other exploits for any web service) is that an attacker could change where DNS queries are directed after Pi Hole. So instead of e.g. Cloudflare&#x27;s DNS it goes to an attacker controlled DNS.<p>Of course there are plenty of details, but my question was just broad strokes: is having your DNS changed for your network (or whatever else you think one can do with access to the admin panel) a huge risk? The scale could be 1 (say your router responds to port requests with denial rather than silently timing out) to 10 (you turned on ssh with root access and no password set).')
