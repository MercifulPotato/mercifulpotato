If so, that was literally - MY fault.  Not the ESE teams fault, but _MY_ fault.  Feel free to reply here with your flame. ;-)  I can handle it.  Really.  :)<p>In the server cloud business all the events streams (and we have several) are rolled up into optics web reports and analyzed and sifted for potential emergent issues and health metrics ... in this case, an event useful to our cloud server business leaked into the events of our Windows client business.  This is (in my biased opinion;) less about being &quot;server grade&quot;, and more about not being &quot;properly embeddable&quot; ... as generally embedded components should be quiet.<p>This is part of the challenge of making a DB engine that services two very divergent scenarios.  This is the smallest of those challenges.  How much memory we can allocate being the largest regular conflict ... Office 365 would not even notice if ESE allocated an extra 1 MB per process, but that would boost our Working Set numbers by 40% (from the last numbers I remember seeing) for each Windows Client Service using us.<p>Anyways, I have fixed the code to not log that event on Windows Client.  It should clear up once that patch gets out.<p>Cheers,\nBrett Shirley [MSFT]<p>P.S. - Oh and I am sorry if it caused you any stress.  I know it sounds concerning, but it is truly innocuous.  You can ignore it, and hopefully soon you won&#x27;t see it.')
