The community is small but getting a bit bigger. gbadev on Discord is a fun place to hang out.<p>The tooling doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed all that much from back in the day, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing: the best way to get music on the GBA is still to compose something in an old-fashioned tracker and using Maxmod to import it. Sprite conversion tools haven&#x27;t changed that much.<p>Programming it is just so lovely bare-metal: poking&#x2F;prodding registers, writing backgrounds and sprites into memory regions.. Really fun stuff.')
