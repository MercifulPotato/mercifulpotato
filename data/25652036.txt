There are a lot of people staring down a refinance on a 5 or 10 year interest-only loan in the middle of a recession.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked it up, but from what I&#x27;ve been told a lot of it also has to do with investment laws for Pillar 2 and 3 retirement accounts (a certain percentage has to go into Swiss assets). Taking 1-1.5% over LIBOR&#x2F;SARON or whatever the SNB rate is makes sense, but the fall-out in a couple of years if and when rates start to move up again isn&#x27;t going to be pretty.')
