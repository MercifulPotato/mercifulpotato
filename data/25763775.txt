The KKK, Jim Crow, lynchings, the Civil War, none of these needed social media and they grew just fine. The problem is and always has been human nature.<p>Trying to solve a social problem technologically is doomed to fail. We know from history that forcing people to think something they donâ€™t want to causes oppression, resentment, and leads to upheaval.
