Reading from a mutable datastructure is impure in the same way that reading from standard input is.<p>If the function <i>internally</i> reads from stdin, I&#x27;d agree. But if a fn takes an input stream as an arg, and if given input streams that yield the same bytes the fn always yields the same result, then why consider it an impure fn? The input stream is just a fancy data structure for bytes.<p>&gt; Two different arrays with the same members are not generally equivalent.<p>Derp, of course! And though I guess it would be possible to have the `Mut*` collections use value equality instead of reference equality, that&#x27;d probably conflict with the performance goals of the mutable variant.')
