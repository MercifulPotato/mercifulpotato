E.g. you can both safely and efficiently share memory in Clojure across multiple threads.  You can&#x27;t really do the same in Elixir that I&#x27;m aware of - it triggers a deep copy which can kill performance.  Sometimes acceptable, sometimes not.<p>Elixir&#x2F;Erlang processes serve a lot of roles.  If those roles don&#x27;t line up cleanly your code could end up a lot more complex than necessary in other languages.<p>In the past the JVM had better raw performance, but I&#x27;m not sure how much that might change with the new JIT in BEAM.')
