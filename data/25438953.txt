What say you after this? I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re aware of shadow banning&#x2F;filtering, which YouTube at least does, perhaps other large platforms.<p>Maybe a case in point. There was a referendum in Scotland about independence from the UK. There was a very prominent blog ranked in Google regarding the question of aye&#x2F;nay, but you found that the comments were moderated towards one disposition.<p>If all the funnels point to that information source, the comments are almost useless, especially so if they&#x27;re curated towards one conclusion. We&#x27;re relying on a middle man (or many middle men) offering a variety of conclusions which we should reach ourselves, rather than one hand delivered to us by one or two algorithms and&#x2F;or social engineering.<p>Diversity, basically, not just in results, but opinions and conclusions.')
