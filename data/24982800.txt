Everything else is nitpicking and blame shifting. If someone&#x27;s willing to do the job &quot;but they have too many other things to do&quot; then they&#x27;re not willing to do the job. If someone&#x27;s boss or with authority over them is unwilling to prioritize the work then they&#x27;re unwilling to do the work as well.')
