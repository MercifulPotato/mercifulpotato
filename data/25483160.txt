There are no settings for you to play with on an ONU.  It gets fully configured remotely.  A fibre ONU is not remotely in the same class as DSL or cable modem - there is no complex signal processing going on, and there are no wires for you to fiddle with.  More importantly, virtually nobody has the required tools to work on fibre.  You&#x27;ll probably just break it.')
