There’s a guilty pleasure I derive from mostly feeling unworthy when reading through HN posts about tech, you all are amazing! At the same time I really appreciate that HN is aware of your minority tech nerd preferences compared to the greater consumer population who are perfectly happy in their walled gardens. I practice tech in the same way some one casually dabbles in piano. I wish I didn’t have to be in a walled in garden but not enough time (for now) to make a website that’s not a godaddy template. The disdain for using gd services must be similar to how I feel about music industry discussion, but I accept that I’m a minority since I can see the ‘source code’ to everything I hear. But yeah pretty funny to be judged by the AI as a consumer for something that I actually use more of as a professional reference tool. I got, 2% basic, jazz-everyones-heard-of-jazz-flex-stuck-in-the-fifties bad. It also made fun of me a lot for listening to every episode of Marion Mcpartland’s ‘Piano Jazz’ that’s available on Spotify...')
