Typically the owner would meet me when checking-in, and they&#x27;d take a copy of my passport or drivers license, and occasionally I&#x27;d have to fill out a form with a few basic pieces of information (name, date of birth, etc) for them to submit. It was usually 2 minutes of work.<p>The downside was it was all incredibly insecure. They&#x27;d be snapping passport photos on their personal phone, and one apartment had a book in the living room with passport numbers and personal information of every previous guest.<p>So, technically it works now in different countries, but Airbnb really needs to assist these owners and get some proper procedures in place.')
