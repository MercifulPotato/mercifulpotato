We should separate an issue of moderation and actual motives of the platform itself.<p>Did the platform have algorithms to make pro-capital storming posts ascend higher than other equally engaged posts?<p>Did the owner&#x2F;company make a call to violence?<p>Did their platform spike in popularity in such a short time frame, they were unable to moderate to the same degree as other platforms? (Even Google struggles with YT moderation, though I understand the volume of content is widely different)<p>It’s obvious there exist political ties to this. Sure, have Parler respond to a congressional hearing just as other tech companies have had to do. But removing them from all these services overnight, albeit technically legal (so far), reeks of anti trust.<p>No matter political affiliation, the antitrust precedent set, if unpunished, will pave the way for greater censorship.<p>This seems like a similar level to price fixing - multiple companies, competing even, coordinating to cancel competition.<p>This is a new issue we have in the digital age. It should be handled in the Supreme Court.')
