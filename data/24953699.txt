My initial goal was weight loss (lost 100lbs from 272-&gt;172). My limit was typically 7 days but I wanted to see what the impact of a longer fast would do in the area of autophagy. I experienced some positive results but would discourage others from doing it, 3-5 days is more than enough. I would also discourage doing alternate day fasting or 24 hour fasting since it will screw up your metabolism (I ate 2 meals (2500kcal) every other day for 3 months) and found it very stressful on my general well being and metabolism.<p>These days I maintain 172 lbs with time delayed eating (18&#x2F;6) and a clean diet.')
