The notion of a &quot;time since arbitrary epoch&quot; is pretty universal, even though it may have a variety of representations. Just pick one, it really doesn&#x27;t matter which.<p>Actually <i>JavaScript</i> already did pick a representation - milliseconds since 1970. It would be easy and unambiguous to add { &quot;foo&quot;: T1606410158672 } to the grammar.')
