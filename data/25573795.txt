Decent manga (and comics in general) translation requires a &quot;redraw&quot; step where original text is completely removed. Some titles keep text strictly in bubbles, but most have text over the artwork to a varying degree, from simple (minutes per page) to highly non-trivial (hours). An image inpainting algorithm that removes text from manga would be really impressive and save a lot of effort.')
