I know I&#x27;m able to feel ennui, limerence, or hygge without knowing these words.<p>I can also perceive things and states without necessarily being able to describe them precisely with single words (but I could probably describe them approximately with many words)<p>The classic example is that the Inuit have many words for different types of snow -- implicit in this example is that they are able to recognize different types of snow and have codified them into shared symbols (words). But to me, that doesn&#x27;t mean the rest of us who don&#x27;t have those words cannot perceive the same if we&#x27;d lived in the same environment. Children can tell packing snow from sleet from a dusting even without knowing the words.<p>There&#x27;s an industry of people romanticizing certain words in a foreign culture, claiming them to be untranslatable, and then writing books&#x2F;articles about them. Not all of this is without merit, but I believe that the words themselves aren&#x27;t so much untranslatable, but that they have no compact representation outside of a certain cultural context.<p>Words are compressions of meaning, but meaning can be perceived outside of verbal representation, or even language. It seems to me one can look at a picture or taste a meal or listen to instrumental music and perceive and manipulate meaning through no use of language at all.')
