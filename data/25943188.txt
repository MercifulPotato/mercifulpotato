Didn&#x27;t they all live like kings for a while, because they could borrow arbitrary sums against their houses?<p>Similarly, some people may make good money on that GameStop thing now.<p>The &quot;common people&quot; who didn&#x27;t participate in this will probably never even notice. At most they&#x27;ll notice that their favorite shopping mall is closing, but that is part of a larger trend. And they can now shop on Amazon instead, so their quality of life probably remains the same or gets improved.')
