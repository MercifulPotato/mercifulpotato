Imagine a user names a folder &quot;Bin&quot;, which maps to ID 123, and the internal trash folder maps to ID 7, and the user sees as &quot;Trash&quot;, because that&#x27;s their interface language.<p>The user now changes their interface language to England, and suddenly they have two &quot;Bin&quot; labels that map to different sets of things.  They behave inconsistently and frustrate anyone who gets into that state.  Some messages might even be in &quot;Bin&quot; and &quot;Bin&quot; at the same time!  Searching for &quot;in:Bin&quot; returns just one set, or the other, or both.<p>Doesn&#x27;t really sound like a good solution...')
