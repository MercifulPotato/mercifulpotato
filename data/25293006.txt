Our mission at Surge is to change that.<p>We’ve been developing two products:\nA platform for extremely high-quality data labeling. Think Mechanical Turk 2.0, but with an elite workforce: in order to build models of misinformation and hate speech, for example, we need to leverage skilled workers who understand complex problems.\nTools for easily turning data into AI. A machine learning model is defined by its data, so anybody -- from your PM to your marketer to your engineers -- should be able to create ML models just by labeling data points.<p>We’re a team of ex-Google and Twitter engineers who’ve quickly bootstrapped into very healthy revenue. Reach out to team@surgehq.ai if you’re interested in chatting! Our tech stack is Ruby on Rails, React, and Python, and we’re looking for backend, frontend, and ML engineers, but love talking to talented folks of any types. (We also love personal projects and writings if you have any to share!)')
