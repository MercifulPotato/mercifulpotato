However Dart is not a brand new language. It&#x27;s a preexisting language that already has null. Given that context nullable types are the only option that doesn&#x27;t break compatibility with previous languages and allows code to be made null safe. If you already have to have null values because of prior decisions then ADT&#x27;s don&#x27;t add null safety. There may be other reasons to want them that aren&#x27;t about handling null safety. But you&#x27;ll still have the problem that values can be null and you won&#x27;t have given developers a tool to handle those potentially null values safely.')
