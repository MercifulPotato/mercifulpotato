When it broke after many years, I realised how much of a pain transferring, processing and sorting photos was, and never replaced it. Now I only use my smartphone, a Pixel 5.<p>I usually travel by motorcycle, so weight comes at a premium. I won&#x27;t fish a bulky SLR out of my pannier every time I see a pretty landscape. The RX100 could fit in my motorcycle jacket pocket, so I wouldn&#x27;t even need to get off the bike.<p>Yet, I prefer my smartphone, because it geotags and syncs my photos automatically. I can send them to people in an instant, as long as there&#x27;s signal. That&#x27;s worth a lot if you spend most of the day on the saddle, and have little time or energy left to process photos.<p>I like photography, but I don&#x27;t like making my trips about photography. In any case, I find that keeping a travel journal works much better than taking a million pictures.')
