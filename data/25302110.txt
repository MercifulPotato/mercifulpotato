Main criteria was it should be a separate api in cloud(we are not completely in cloud yet). Also I couldnâ€™t use any commercial cloud spell checkers because of data privacy and security. After putting up a demo with an open source spellchecker we ultimately decided to abandon the effort. We found out that most of our competitors were recommending their users to use browser provided spellchecker like the one provided by chrome. We followed the same suite because we felt that being a relatively small development team our time was best spent writing business logic than to to create and maintain a spellcheck service.')
