The reason for this is because as a web developer I know what can go wrong with web apps, so it’s partly an irrational fear I suppose.<p>About a year ago I decided to splurge and upgrade my development process with native apps like Ulysses, Git Tower, Kaleidoscope, CodeRunner, TablePlus, etc and discovered that native desktop apps can actually be well worth the money, so I never looked back since then. There are always exceptions to the rule: for example if 37signals had not closed Backpack down I would still be using it and Jira’s native client is crap compared to their web app version.')
