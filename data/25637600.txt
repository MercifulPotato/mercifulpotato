And then corporations will adopt it and offer employees a pay rise if they sign up to use it. Eventually it will become mandatory, and people will write wistful articles about the uncolonized dream spaces of yesteryear, while accepting that no normal person would sacrifice the most productive part of the working day (night) in order to dream about fun things that they will mostly forget anyway.')
