Rust forces you to think about memory management topics (memory lifetimes and ownership) which you will also need to know about in C++, but in C++ you are entirely on your own so it&#x27;s easier to &quot;slip into&quot; bad memory management practices (which you would need to unlearn again when moving from C++ to Rust).<p>You should also include C in the mix (very different from C++(!!) that&#x27;s why &quot;C&#x2F;C++&quot; is a bit shunned upon by some people), because Rust or C++ are often overkill. If you&#x27;re tackling Rust and C++ anyway (which is essentially a lifetime task), learning C on the side is literally a &quot;weekend project&quot; ;)<p>Just remember that C and C++ are not as similar as many people believe, they are different languages with different goals and a different philosophy.')
