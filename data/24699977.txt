That&#x27;s usually the disconnect. There are places between the poles of NYC to Madison, WI, York, PA, and other suburban hell. And, they also aren&#x27;t millennial ex-pat havens like Austin&#x2F;Nashville, where the &quot;culture&quot; is a strip of craft breweries and expensive pizza places and basically Brooklyn 2.0.  When you throw in cities with more access to the West&#x27;s geography, you start to see why places like Denver and Bozeman got huge (and joined millennial ex-pat land).<p>So what do these in-between places offer, besides the cost of living? You tend to get off the beaten path nature where the cost of living in the city means you can actually afford a vacation home (Minneapolis and Chicago get the great lakes northern coast lines), funky college towns that grew some tech talent for various reasons and are college-y and by great natural areas (old Bozeman, old Austin, old Boulder, current Ft. Collins), and lastly I&#x27;d say genuine immigrant population and their subcultures, and food to match. There are legitimate Little Italys out there, but they just left NYC because it&#x27;s too expensive (or also refugee resettlement plans). Minneapolis, Syracuse, parts of Tennessee, parts of TX that aren&#x27;t Austin, etc.<p>You throw a tech salary into that mix, and it becomes really fascinating.')
