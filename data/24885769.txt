I don&#x27;t know  if it&#x27;s the compositing or what but it&#x27;s unusable on lighter hardware that X ran fine on.<p>2) Widget toolkits handling window decoration is <i>awful.</i> Before the large number of toolkits just meant some controls were a little different but now basic behavior changes based on how programmers decided to build an app. And if you don&#x27;t like the window decorations (say, they take up too much screen space) your choices are suck it up, or if you&#x27;re lucky and willing to spend a bunch of time reconfigure <i>every different toolkit your apps use.</i><p>3) basic stuff that worked fine on X11 doesn&#x27;t work on wayland in the name of &quot;security&quot; (screenshots are a big one, there are extensions but isn&#x27;t that the complaint about X? And if there&#x27;s a security problem with something isn&#x27;t hacking around with it because people need it a really strong indication that the idea is broken and probably making the situation worse?)')
