Please note that bone marrow is where a lot of our immune cells are produced, such as white blood cells.<p>It is also critical to the ability of the body to absorb and utilize calcium. Inability to properly absorb calcium tends to also foster a magnesium deficiency and vitamin K is the other vitamin you should be taking when taking calcium supplements to make sure you are able to absorb it and make use of it.<p>Vitamin K is critical to the clotting process, as is calcium. Calcium is necessary to start the cascade of chemical processes that lead to clotting.<p>I have a genetic disorder and I have a long history of being prone to nose bleeds. Tendency to bleed is a common problem for my condition, which is also known to be associated with osteoporosis at very young ages (sometimes starting in the teens), though bleeds that this population most often is concerned with is lung bleeds.<p>When an online friend of mine was dealing with lung bleeds in their child with the same condition, I did some looking around for info and found that calcium is critical to the clotting process. I don&#x27;t know if that info helped her help her child, but as a consequence I eventually began taking 600 to 1000 mg of calcium carbonate in response to gushing nose bleeds (as opposed to the constant low-level blood seepage in my nose that was my norm for years). This practice stopped my nose bleeds cold in twenty minutes without other intervention and after six months I stopped having nose bleeds.<p>Covid-19 significantly impacts blood health. Anyone interested in understanding the role of vitamin D deficiency in Covid-19 should be curious about the relationship between vitamin D and blood health.<p>Covid-19 was initially talked up as primarily a respiratory infection, but ventilators were not performing very well for helping the sickest of the sick with this condition and there was a shockingly high mortality rate for people who ended up on ventilators -- high even for what is &quot;normal&quot; for people who typically end up on ventilators. Everything seems to point to the idea that the way Covid-19 impacts the blood is a critical detail of why it is so deadly in some populations.<p>If you have reason to believe you are vitamin D deficient, you should address that. If you address it, you most likely also need calcium, magnesium and vitamin K as well in order to redress the negative impact this has had on your health. They work together and not getting enough of any one of those tends to negatively impact your status for all of them.<p>(I am not a doctor. This is not medical advice.
