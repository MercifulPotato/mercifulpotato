Item(by='apatters', descendants=None, kids=[25159765, 25158722, 25159126, 25158834], score=None, time=1605860277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25157771, text='Sure, but for almost everyone, there&#x27;s a dollar figure at which they&#x27;re willing to stop having fun and start making money. Maybe that dollar figure is $1,000&#x2F;hr for some open source maintainer out there (I bet it&#x27;s much lower for most of them).<p>Why not put a line in the readme which says, if you want to commission a specific change, send me an email to discuss, my consulting rate starts at $XXX&#x2F;hr. Or there&#x27;s a $YYYY project minimum, or whatever is meaningful to the maintainer. If that feels too aggressive then leave the dollar figures out. Hard to imagine this running afoul of any reasonable community norms, especially for a project which already has the problem of too many people asking for things.<p>Maintainers can handle this problem however they like, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for someone who&#x27;s not getting paid, if they&#x27;ve never asked to be paid. I think they would be better off asking.<p>And again, if no one inquires - then nothing changes, it&#x27;s still a 100% hobby project, with the bonus that the expectation to do other people&#x27;s shit for free is gone.')
