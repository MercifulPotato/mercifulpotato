I know I am not. For me the it&#x27;s a revelation that _fear itself_ actually is _fear of making something lame_. So, I don&#x27;t really see the value of expressing this &quot;concisely&quot; because if  will never arrive from A to B, if A is abstract pattern. Though once you have shown me that A is equivalent to B (the practical), I do agree, A is equivalent to B. But, unless you show me B upfront, just concisely stating A to me is of no value: I can not make the connection from Abstract to Practical. Only from practical (something lame) to maybe abstract (fear itself).<p>This is also why I don&#x27;t really buy in to the whole &quot;conciseness&quot; thing - I prefer things spelled out. I suspect many others do too.')
