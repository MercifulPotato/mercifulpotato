Often they are not as intuitive or well thought out as most GNU CLI tools, but they get the job done and enable a lot of automation without using the mouse. Things like: networksetup&#x2F;systemsetup, tmutil (timemachine), open (open files in application, I often use &#x27;open .&#x27; to open de current dir in Finder), screencapture, defaults (edit application setting), security (keychain interaction), diskutil, osascript (applescript) and many more.')
