Because they want to give back. If someone becomes ridiculously wealthy and gives nothing back, we as a society tend to think poorly of them. Why? Because they are extremely fortunate and highly successful - and they could so easily help others without any negative impact to themselves. That ease makes us unhappy with them _not_ giving back. Because in their particular circumstance, we generally consider it _right_ to use their resources help others. Not required, but right.<p>Same thing with a company like Amazon. They are enormously wealthy. So we look poorly on them when they don&#x27;t give back to those bringing them even more wealth. Because they easily could. Because it wouldn&#x27;t hurt them at all. Because it is right.')
