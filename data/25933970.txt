Removing land from the potential to be developed is different from removing land from production.<p>Not that anyone is saying this directly, but I disagree with the argument that good, productive land left fallow is better than good productive land that is producing.<p>My brother makes a living and feeds his family based on his wood lot.  Traces of original settlers from nearly two hundred years ago are found throughout the forest.  Which is to say, it is pretty obvious now that it was not suited for farming.<p>But as forest, it is wonderful.  There are at least six species of viable commercial trees at scale.  Maple, oak, cedar, black cherry, pine.  Most original species, or those introduced by the original indigenous people or the first settlers.  The crab apple trees pop up in strange places.<p>My brother has a government approved forestry management plan that takes from the forest each year far, far less than what the forest produces.  The forest will remain diverse and support a family well, indefinitely.<p>The trees are coming out in a managed way that is creating trails, with clear evidence that wildlife is making good use of the trails.  Across the forest, he has installed a wide assortment of habitat for species at risk, birds, bats and others, several of which had not been seen in the area for generations - and they are being used!  Under the managed forest, wildlife is returning in which there is no evidence had been there for at least two generations.  This wildlife is moving into the adjacent conservation authority land, not the other way around.<p>If this was not an owned and managed forest, this would be happening at a much slower rate.<p>If I had to compare that against a plan that left the land alone, I&#x27;d tilt my hand to the one that actually supported people, in harmony with nature.')
