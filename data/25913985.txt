Item(by='gpas', descendants=None, kids=[25914500], score=None, time=1611653826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913722, text='Nice find. Seems like something created by a script. Show descriptions scraped from imdb, the trailers too I guess. I watched some and the crime featured in the news was perpetrated by black people...\nAlso the first has the title wrong, Quad instead of Adam, this led me to think about automation. But the Hot Wheels one has a news report about a teen hijacking a car, automated or not, that seems done on purpose.')
