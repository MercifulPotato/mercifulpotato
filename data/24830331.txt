Item(by='captainzidgel', descendants=None, kids=[24830437], score=None, time=1603137776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829994, text='I&#x27;ve had a lot of success telling people &quot;just click next&quot; for every button in the Mumble setup, but Mumble doesn&#x27;t make things simple for the non-enthusiastic end user.<p>The harder part for most users is figuring out how to connect. Mumble has a URI Protocol but that&#x27;s only a temporary fix as it can&#x27;t add a favorite to someone&#x27;s list.<p>IMO the only reason Mumble can&#x27;t compete with Discord is that they serve different niches. Mumble doesn&#x27;t offer much for users who want a permanent text suite or multiple server connections at a time, but for friends&#x2F;gamers hanging in voice it works fine (and Mumble beats Discord at VOIP). (and all of Mumble&#x27;s competitors like Teamspeak also fall to Discord for the same reasons).')
