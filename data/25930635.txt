The thing is huge - and unless its safe enough for kids to crawl all around the inside of it (which I doubt), how exactly would you make it into a museum, when it&#x27;s so large you can&#x27;t even see hardly any of it?<p>Are people supposed to just stand on the ground and look up?<p>Also, where would you put it? Popular museums are usually in reasonably settled areas, there&#x27;s just no space for something this large.<p>Not to mention, how would you even get it there?')
