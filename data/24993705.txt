It can only read, write, and delete rows; branches on admin; and returns a random number. Is it possible to extend the language in a way defining functions, if stmt and for loops are possible?<p>Since it already has if, I wonder if I can branch on things other than &quot;admin&quot;.<p>EDIT: I stand corrected, looks like using `range .. end` you can actually loop.<p>EDIT2: if also works:<p><pre><code>    {{ if (rando 0 1) }}\n     a\n    {{ else }}\n     b\n    {{ end }}\n</code></pre>\nprints a or b non deterministically.<p>EDIT3: I wish it supported operations like equality, addition, &lt;, &gt; etc')
