There are other options other than lockdown vs no lockdown. You can have a social safety net and pay people to stay home. But if you&#x27;re insistent that these are the only two options, look at Sweden. Their economy suffered despite not locking down last year because guess what, it turns out people don&#x27;t want to go out and risk dying. So if your economy is doing to have mass unemployment, you may as well do that and avoid the death and injury. Or better yet, borrow at low interest rates and let people be unemployed but not destitute.')
