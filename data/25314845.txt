Item(by='keiferski', descendants=None, kids=[25315470], score=None, time=1607179342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311215, text='There is no “inevitable fall” of Citizen Kane, neither in the article itself nor in film theory circles. The closest the article gets is this, which is not exactly convincing:<p><i>But one thing seems sure. The idea of a consensus pick, and for that matter the need for any kind of consensus, is a thing of the past. Citizen Kane, the ultimate canon title, has itself become proof that canons are there to be exploded.</i><p>The recently released <i>Mank</i> is the reason for a renewed interest in <i>Kane</i>, and in an ironic twist of fate, it’s a disaster of a film, probably Fincher’s worst, and it makes Welles’ cutting hand and firm direction seem like the actual genius behind the picture.<p>In any case, if you ever have a few free hours, I recommend listening to some interviews with Welles. He had to be one of the most entertaining and erudite conversationalists we’ve ever had. With all the names and situations referenced in his (probably embellished) stories, it’s like listening to a recording from a lost world.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oQYazeJA-Oo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;oQYazeJA-Oo</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1LnuQZ6VD_Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;1LnuQZ6VD_Y</a>')
