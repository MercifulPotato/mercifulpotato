A $200 steak is just going to be most flavorful when it&#x27;s on the rarer side. But its just a signaling thing if you&#x27;re talking about skirt or flank.</i><p>IMO, it does not have to be a $200 cut, a $9 ribeye from Walmart cooked rare is far better than a $9 pot roast sandwich from the local fast food joint.<p>With at $4&#x2F;lb chuck roast it&#x27;s more of a trade-off. A chuck roast steak cooked rare is a little too tough for my liking. But it is far more juicy and tasteful than the same cut slow cooked and served as a pot roast')
