What you&#x27;ve said in your first two sentences sounds fine as a textbook principle. But the real world is messier and opportunities don&#x27;t just vanish: if you do the math on a basic risk parity strategy with the S&amp;P and some uncorrelated ETF, you can see it will beat the market on a risk adjusted basis. Very often you can then leverage this up to a higher absolute return than SPY while keeping lower volatility and beta overall.<p><i>&gt; There is no unexploited profit opportunity that is risk free</i><p>This is essentially encapsulated by a Sharpe ratio (among other things). On the contrary, it is not especially difficult to produce a relatively high Sharpe ratio, accounting for transaction and margin costs, if you don&#x27;t have a large amount of money to invest (large means single digit billions or more). This is especially, but not exclusively, the case if you don&#x27;t care to compound your returns.')
