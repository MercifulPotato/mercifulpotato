Item(by='bdowling', descendants=None, kids=[24856146], score=None, time=1603317625, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24847091, text='&gt; GPL was found to be inapplicable in French copyright court, however it should be applicable under contract law.<p>Do you understand exactly why the GPL was inapplicable? I was unable to figure it out from the article. My guess is that the defendant may not have actually been copying or distributing the GPL-licensed program. The defendant ran a portal for a client which incorporated the program, but it&#x27;s not clear that their derived software was being distributed. So, if they did not copy or distribute the program, then their actions would not fall under copyright (or author&#x27;s rights) infringement. If the copyright action failed, then the plaintiff might try a contract claim, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the GPL will necessarily be treated as a contract.<p>Also, could you cite some authority for the assertion that there is no distinction between licenses and contracts in French law? The concepts are quite different.')
