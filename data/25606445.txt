Go ahead, document everything, it&#x27;s not going to matter. That&#x27;s not how this works. If you do that they&#x27;ll either say, &quot;Ok, I see what you&#x27;ve got there. But that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re here to discuss. We&#x27;re here to discuss your negative attitude&quot; or they can look at your documentation and say, &quot;So what were you charging the time you were doing all this documentation to?&quot;, or, &quot;So this is why you&#x27;re not getting your work done. You&#x27;re spending all this time on this paranoid documentation instead of doing your work&quot;.<p>Go to HR? Are you kidding me? First, HR is not your friend. They&#x27;re there to protect the company. Perhaps sometimes your interests align with the company but that&#x27;s just an accident. Second, there is no way these people are engaging in abusive behavior without HR having their backs so going to HR just risks exposing HR to accusations of abuse so now you&#x27;ve got an even bigger target on your back.')
