This is pedantry to the point of intentionally avoiding the point.<p>You didn&#x27;t read the other sources I linked, which contain sworn statements from two observers, as well as articles published by several news stations stating that observers (and news) were told to go home <i>because they were done for the night</i>. Resuming counting after observers and news have left is intentionally deceitful, and no rational person actually interested in a fair democratic system would claim otherwise.<p>&gt; liar<p>Assuming ill intent. You aren&#x27;t interested in holding a dicussion, just labelling. Typical anti-intellectualism coming from the political party you&#x27;re (probably) aligned with.<p>&gt; seditionist<p>Look up the definiton of that word before using it: &quot;Overt conduct, such as speech and organization, that tends toward rebellion against the established order.&quot; Mind-blowingly false - I neither said nor <i>implied</i> any sort of rebellion. You&#x27;re literally just using the worst labels you can think of, without any truth to them whatsoever, to avoid actual conversation.')
