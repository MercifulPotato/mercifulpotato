And what country can preserve it’s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms.

It is it’s natural manure.&quot;[1]<p>The whole letter I take this quote from is worth a read.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monticello.org&#x2F;site&#x2F;research-and-collections&#x2F;tree-liberty-quotation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.monticello.org&#x2F;site&#x2F;research-and-collections&#x2F;tre...</a><p>edit: formatting')
