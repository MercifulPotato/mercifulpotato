Classic case of innovators dilemma.<p>No, this wasn&#x27;t it.  DEC actually had a quite good PC business which died when everybody died to the Asian manufacturers.<p>DEC also had plenty of technical stuff as well as cash flow to ride it out.<p>DEC was purely a result of executive level and board level malfeasance.<p>After the board forced the founder Ken Olsen (who wasn&#x27;t a great CEO but actually did have vision) out, Robert Palmer (who had no vision <i>AND</i> was incompetent) (and not the singer--the singer probably would have been better as CEO) was given marching orders to sell off the company.  Which he did--with no vision whatsoever.  Lots of people tried to fight against it, but any division which started righting itself immediately got flogged off.<p>The patent lawsuit allowed DEC to jettison a bunch of the fab to Intel which then made them an attractive target to Compaq.<p>People love to comment that the merger killed COMPAQ when the reality was the <i>entire</i> US domestic PC industry was completely collapsing.<p><i>HOWEVER</i>, to give you an idea as to how badly the &quot;hostile giveaway&quot; was managed, Compaq effectively bought DEC for less than their enterprise service <i>annual revenue</i>--about $2 billion <i>per year</i>.  HP later milked this stream for more than a decade.<p>So, in the middle of a PC industry collapse, no executive could figure out how to convert a $2 billion annual revenue stream for enterprise services plus a whole bunch of leading edge technology into a profitable company.<p>This shows just how shit-tastic the executive management for both DEC and COMPAQ really were.<p>But, hey, the DEC board got their stock bump and cashed out.')
