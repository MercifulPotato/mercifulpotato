Generally I just write my own wrapper with some clunky combination of hooks to manage the lifecycle of data.<p>One common pattern I end up using for a lot of imperative calls is a &quot;useAsyncFunction&quot; hook which runs any async function, returns state for loading, error, and the result of that function.<p>Unfortunately each library handles DOM manipulation, configuration options, callbacks, instantiation, etc. in its own way, and so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any generalized solution.')
