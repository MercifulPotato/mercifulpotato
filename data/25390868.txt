Item(by='reissbaker', descendants=None, kids=[25391418], score=None, time=1607720122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387086, text='Booking.com, a major online hotel aggregator and probably more akin to Airbnb than a physical hotel chain, has a market cap of $85B — not far off from Airbnb&#x27;s $100B.<p>I don&#x27;t think individual hotel chains are an equivalent business to Airbnb, since those have high real estate costs and have clear physical hurdles to growth: you have to buy property and build hotels, and staff all of them to run the front desk, carry people&#x27;s luggage, clean the rooms, do laundry, etc. The comparison to other OTAs like Booking — that don&#x27;t own the properties but make money from listing them and allowing booking — makes more sense IMO. The valuation looks a lot less frothy with those comparisons.<p>(I am an ex-Airbnb employee and still hold many shares FWIW.)')
