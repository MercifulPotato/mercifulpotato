And that relative proportion will be determined by how quickly costs fall relative to each other. If a kWh storage costs 10x the amortized capital costs of a kWh solar generation, we will have a lot less storage than if storage only costs 2x the amortized capital costs of a solar kWh.<p>If hydrogen electrolysis can become cheap in 2030, maybe we will even use hydrogen for some storage, but we will have to balance the capital costs of hydrogen generation and conversion back to electricity with everything else, which will determine how much of it gets deployed.')
