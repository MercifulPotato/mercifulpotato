When I get a shipping number and then no activity and no communication for a week I assume I got defrauded.<p>I recently did two orders where this type of thing happens.  One (an ebay order) the company sent me a notice a few hours latter that my product was damaged and no more stock would arrive for a month could they cancel the order.  The other (new egg third party) there was no communication for a week despite a shipping label, so I contacted newegg and demanded a refund.  I might order from the first company again, the second put a bad taste in my mouth and I probably won&#x27;t use newegg at all anymore just because they are not policing their sellers.')
