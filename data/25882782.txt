They’re based on the number of voters...&quot;<p>The indiscrete game world concept of unknown changing actual population, but a number of voters would be discrete.<p>&quot;...and each sector’s overall impact on the election results, factoring in the value of campaign contributions, endorsements, and other means of influence.&quot;<p>Contributions value may be discrete, but endorsements and other means of influence I&#x27;m not sure about.<p>&quot;As the game progresses, parties will reach maximum or minimum values in some sectors. These maximums and minimums affect the game’s strategy and evoke real-life political effects. No matter how strongly Scotland prefers one party over another, Scotland’s impact is limited by the number of voters in Scotland.&quot;<p>So, there are indiscrete things in game world represented, but it has a number of voters and that number itself would be discrete.<p>&quot;The Conservative Party can also earn popularity points in the Workers sector, but can’t earn any red points there because Workers who support the Conservative Party prefer moderate MPs.&quot;<p>Seems like a calculable, discrete representation of the indiscrete.<p>Functionally it appears as a digital computer from the outside of the game, because of the point values.<p>But the point is that the game represents calculations happening in that game world with indiscrete variables like &quot;variable support from unknown population&quot;, hence the &quot;analog computer inside...&quot; in the title.')
