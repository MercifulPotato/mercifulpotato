The stimulus wasn&#x27;t diverted by the finance industry to itself.  The government set up a system where monetary stimulus comes from the central bank, and fiscal stimulus comes from the legislature.  Congress sent out one big round of stimulus checks.  The Fed increased the money supply by buying bonds, the way it always does.  Congress could have done another round of fiscal stimulus, but declined to do so.  There was no obstacle, other than the fact that our freely elected leaders decided not to do it, and did not pay a political price for it last week.')
