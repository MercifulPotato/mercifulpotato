Can walk to everything we need so we only end up driving about 3500 miles (about 5KM) per year. I&#x27;ve got an old 98 Honda civic which &quot;only&quot; has about 130K miles on it (meaning it&#x27;s good for at least another 70K miles) and still runs great. I can&#x27;t justify the expense of an EV given these criteria, though I&#x27;m looking forward to getting one someday.')
