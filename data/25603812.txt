You often need time, money, expertise, etc. to enter legal battles and if the costs of those resources outweigh the benefits, you often allow your legal rights to be infringed. Pursuit of some rights are cost prohibitive because everything in the US is so tightly tied to finances.<p>Many of your rights in the US are directly tied to your financial resources, not only in the sense that you have the resources to litigate or absorb failed litigation but even in the sense that those with massive financial resources essentially buy their own rights through legislation.<p>Let&#x27;s not pretend the justice system doesn&#x27;t have underlying flaws that allow justice to skew one way or another from money alone because it does. If you&#x27;re on trial for a serious offense, you&#x27;re probably not going to use a public appointed attorney if you can avoid it because we know how the legal system works and how financial incentives will attract better legal representation in the private sector than those for public appointment.<p>This idealized and fictionalized system where I can walk into a court of law and defend myself or use a public appointed counsel and &#x27;win&#x27; as long as I&#x27;ve done nothing illegal or unjust is a laughable joke for many legal battles, especially those of more significance.')
