I don&#x27;t disagree with you.<p>I&#x27;m weary of drawing the discussion towards pitting web apps against native apps in absolute or general terms. I think that would detract things too far from reality.<p>It&#x27;s a complex debate because the &#x27;right fit&#x27; - native or web app - depends on the use case or business case as well as the perspective of the stakeholders involved: developers, business owners, customers and users. The many trade off&#x27;s each and every stakeholder has to make are what sparks tensions and debate.<p>Speed is just one of those.<p>It&#x27;s true that web applications have set a new bar as far as customer &#x2F; user convenience as well as application maintenance are concerned. But then there are also trade off&#x27;s regarding privacy, confidentiality, security, legal compliance, accountability, trust, expenses,... There&#x27;s also reliability &#x2F; availability of a services, and there&#x27;s even a moral question regarding energy consumption tied to operating data centers.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not going to take position on those in absolute terms. Rather, I think it&#x27;s very much valid to look at your own business case or use cases and keep taking native applications into consideration as well, rather then dismissing them outright as yesteryear&#x27;s technology.<p>&gt; Maybe the current web isn&#x27;t what was envisioned. I&#x27;m ok with that.<p>Oh, I&#x27;m okay with that as well.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see you use the phrase &quot;current Web&quot; because what is the &quot;current Web&quot; exactly? In the vast majority of discussions, it tends to be reduced to the well known big tech companies and their products. For many the &quot;current Web&quot; is mainly Reddit, HN, StackOverflow, LinkedIn, Medium,... For others, the &quot;current Web&quot; might be a plethora of self-hosted websites which they have bookmarked in text documents. Your mileage really varies depending on who you ask.<p>The Web is far larger then the perception we get from it through our own daily use. And a vast amount of it will remain dark simply because we either can&#x27;t find it, or because we aren&#x27;t aware it exists, or because we simply don&#x27;t look for it&#x27;s existence.')
