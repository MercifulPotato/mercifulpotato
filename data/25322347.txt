(thus the name &quot;messenger RNA&quot;)<p>A traditional vaccine (e.g. the flu vaccines) would inject either a weakened form of the virus or material with characteristic protein patterns matching the virus, with the goal to cause the immune system to adapt against this pattern. An mRNA vaccine instead provides the cells at the injection site with mRNA that describes the characteristic proteins, and thus causing them to create the proteins themselves.')
