The Docker CLI is pretty intuitive--you have different resources and different verbs for interacting with those resources. This includes logs. No need to use a separate (and confusing) tool nor dig through man pages. I&#x27;m of the philosophy that it&#x27;s better for a tool to be intuitive than obscure-but-has-manpages.<p>&gt; Anyhow, aren&#x27;t systemd units ini files? The journalctl ships with man pages though.<p>I guess I meant that INI isn&#x27;t a standard file format--different parsers behave differently, and structured data is often coded in strings in some bespoke format.<p>&gt; Aren&#x27;t containers just processes with namespaces and cgroups?<p>My mind isn&#x27;t made up that containers are the ideal process unit, but I do like some things about them (and the container ecosystem more generally). That they come with their dependencies bundled is pretty nice, but I think the toolchain needs to improve to mitigate security concerns and so on. Something like Nix would be helpful, but Nix also has its own problems. Again, it&#x27;s directionally correct. In any case, users don&#x27;t need to be managing their own namespaces and cgroups.')
