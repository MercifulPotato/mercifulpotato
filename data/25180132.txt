A materials engineering PhD candidate, who took an engineering coding class during undergrad, but found everything so complicated that she never looked back and actually learned how to write a script. She&#x27;s not alone, and it&#x27;s frustrating to see the number of otherwise highly-educated people who seem handicapped in certain tasks because corporate vendors like Microsoft, Mathworks, and (maybe to a lesser degree) Apple create a situation where they&#x27;re unaware that there&#x27;s a free, native paradigm where writing a little bit of code isn&#x27;t a pain in the butt.<p>I myself didn&#x27;t really consider how I could use code to speed up mundane tasks until I was forced to copy files over from an embedded Linux system over bash. The introduction from &quot;open up a terminal, and type these commands in, which does these things&quot; to &quot;now just put those commands in a file called script.sh and type .&#x2F;script.sh, and it will do the thing automatically&quot; was eye-opening, at 22 years old. Looking back, it&#x27;s the exact same problem that resulted in a company I used to work for doing 100s of GB of data processing in Excel, because writing Excel macros was more accessible than writing a bash script to append two .csv files.<p>I think a lot of kids would probably really be attracted to it as well. Linux gives you control over your computing environment, in a world where children rarely have any autonomy. I don&#x27;t think every one of them needs to grow up to be a professional developer, but computer literacy seems like a hugely valuable skill.')
