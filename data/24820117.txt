There will be people arguing for regular understory and brush burning, and others arguing against it.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose that you&#x27;re a citizen who gets to vote in some way on this matter. What will you base your vote on? The materials circulated at the time by those for and against various policies? Perhaps. But how will you judge those materials if you have not even a basic understanding of forest ecology.<p>Now, if you sit down and read about forest ecology today, it will have no impact on your ability to accomplish your goals in anyway. But is is not a distraction: it&#x27;s the groundwork and the preparation for you to be able to participate meaningfully in democratic decision making, perhaps tomorrow, or next year or some other time in the future.<p>In short: it is education. You just have to be careful that you&#x27;re learning about the actual world.')
