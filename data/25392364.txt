He generally backs up his opinions with links to science studies and data, but has been censored by youtube for mentioning controversially that &quot;HCQ has some efficacy as a prophylactic before exposure to Covid&quot;.  ( He has also covered topics such as less severe Covid outcome for those taking Vitamin-D, for which there now seems to be a lot of evidence... yet why are we not seeing governments recommend and supply it more widely ? )<p>Are we still able to rationally discuss on youtube topics such as : Did SARS-CoV2&#x2F;Covid originate elsewhere than at the seafood market in Wuhan [ there are a handful of data with earlier cases in distant locales ] ?<p>Are we allowed to make videos discussing the cause of collapse of WTC building 7 on 911 ?  Engineering Professor Leroy Hulseys structural study at Fairbanks University argues that the canonical explanation of fire damage leading to failure of a weak point followed by cascading collapse is &#x27;unlikely&#x27;.<p>Will we be able to share videos that say fracking for oil produces so much extra methane as to render the proponents criminally liable for the acceleration of global warming ?<p>Will we be able to discuss on youtube.com whether google.com should pay more tax than they currently do ?  What body decides this ?')
