For one they are almost without exception breathtakingly ugly. A bucket seat in a sports car is a beautiful thing but without that context and purpose it just turns into this garish ulcer in your living room. That’s without adding the “gaming aesthetic” with neon colors and sharp angles that already plagues the gaming peripheral market. The second and more important thing is they’re not even comfortable. I question whether anyone has sat in these before ordering them because you used to be able to  (pre-covid) get a used Herman Miller, an actually elegant looking <i>and</i> functional and comfortable chair, for around the same price. I had a guy drop one off in my driveway in Austin 5 years ago for a couple hundred bucks. That “gaming chair” has lasted me many marathon gaming sessions and I haven’t had any back problems or pain afterwards.<p>Any chance I get I try to steer friends and acquaintances away from these abominations.')
