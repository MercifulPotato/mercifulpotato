What if it&#x27;s just a really close copy of your face&#x2F;body generated by machine, stitched together in a very believable fashion? You could maybe claim ownership of your likeness, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be possible to really enforce - Many people look near identical already.  Or they add a mole here or there and claim - look - clearly not you!<p>And it won&#x27;t be you, but does it really matter?  How do you prove it&#x27;s not you to other people without stripping down?<p>Upset about rape videos?  I am too when it&#x27;s a real person.  I find it much harder to argue against when it&#x27;s a performance (current porn) or when it&#x27;s not any person at all.  Who has standing in court?  No one was harmed.  Are you upset that someone was raped, or are you upset that someone is making money off of rape videos?  Because there will be generated videos of this content, and it will absolutely be customizable to look like people want it to. Does it matter if the video is real?  And removing this content won&#x27;t stop rapes at all.  So is it somehow worse if a real rape victim has fake rape porn made of them?  If so, why?<p>---<p>Basically - My point is that you&#x27;re making an appeal based on a moral system that I don&#x27;t think is going to survive the coming wave of generated imagery.<p>I too have serious issues with all of the real crimes you dislike, but I don&#x27;t think you can genuinely equate video content with the crime itself - They happen to be tightly coupled now, but that&#x27;s going to change.<p>This is NOT an open and shut victory here.  I&#x27;m not really sure there&#x27;s a victory to be had.<p>Maybe the best we&#x27;ll get is a world where even when real revenge porn is uploaded, no one will believe it&#x27;s real...')
