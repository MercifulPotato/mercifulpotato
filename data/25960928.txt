And many times the borrow checker is completely inadequate at preventing race conditions (frequently the case with distributed computing). Of course, Rust can recoup those losses elsewhere, by having better tooling or competing in domains where performance matters a lot, but Iâ€™ve not found the safety to be worthwhile in my domain.<p>EDIT: s&#x2F;data races&#x2F;race conditions')
