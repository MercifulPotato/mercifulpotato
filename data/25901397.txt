I was born in 1979, my dad was born in 1944, and my son in 2009.<p>If you look at all of our youths, the biggest difference is between my dad and me, not between me and my son.<p>My dad grew up without TV, 1 person in the street had a radio. Later cars arrived.<p>When you look at my youth, we had computers, but internet arrived when I was 18.<p>My son watches TV, plays computer games, watches star wars, etc. Not that much has changed. Sure they have smartphones and social media, but the difference are details.<p>The biggest impact of computers is already passed us, and happened probably between 1970 and 2000')
