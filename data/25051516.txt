This community does not brook any disagreement, because this service is not designed for it.<p>This did not happen overnight; for more than a year I have been watching perfectly fine comments getting buried in the gray for not siding with the prevailing mob on divisive topics. Even neutral, soft-spoken stances get struck down.<p>One can now reliably predict what the majority of comments are going to be like, just by reading the title of a post.<p>I&#x27;ve brought this up several times with dang, but apparently you&#x27;re not able to appreciate these problems until you try participating as a regular user.<p>And let&#x27;s not even mention the awful UI design with its vendetta against eyes, low light and small screens.<p>HN is broken, and one of the major indicators of a broken service is a tone-deaf management who continues to insist that everything is Working As Intended.')
