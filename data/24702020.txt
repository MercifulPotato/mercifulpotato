Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602016224, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24699778, text='NYC is a wonderful place, I spent my 20s trying to find ways to afford living there but never could (so I lived across the river in NJ and spent all my time in Manhattan).<p>The compromises to live there full time are brutal though. You need to be content to live in what amounts to a closet anywhere else. No space for anything and you better have zero hobbies or interests that take more space than a laptop.<p>&gt; Do that many people really want to have to get into their car and drive 25 minutes to the only (probably subpar) ramen shop in town.<p>This is a common misconception by big city dwellers, but stuff does exist outside as well!<p>I live in the outskirts of Silicon Valley in a town&#x2F;village, of ~10K people surrounded by forest. And no I don&#x27;t have to drive 25 minutes to get to a restaurant. I can walk to great sushi, thai, mexican, etc. I can walk to multiple supermarkets, pharmacies, everything pretty much. In fact other than for a few lumber yard runs I haven&#x27;t really driven anywhere since March. Everything is walking distance. But at the same time I can have a yard, garages, space for woodworking and  planting trees, ride a bike on quiet streets and forest trails and all that. And while silicon valley area is expensive, all this is still probably cheaper than a studio in NYC.<p>In a fantasy world where I&#x27;m ultra-rich, I would also have a NYC apartment to visit every now and then. It is a fun place.')
