He warned me -- quite jokingly -- that he had to be careful not to say something like, &quot;mynameisash, please empty the trash&quot; because the computer might hear it and mistakenly delete items in the trash.<p>Almost 30 years later, how many orders of magnitude faster silicon and countless person-hours of research and I can&#x27;t get my damn phone (which, yes, _is_ a marvel that way-back-when-me wouldn&#x27;t believe) to recognize, &quot;call mrs_mynameisash&quot; when I&#x27;m using my hands-free while driving. I don&#x27;t know how many times Google&#x27;s voice assistant has called some (possibly local?) T-Mobile instead. And my wife&#x27;s name sounds nothing like &quot;T-Mobile&quot;.')
