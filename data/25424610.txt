At least from the point of view of a customer, I don&#x27;t want a single megacorp owning the market (and let&#x27;s cut the marketing BS: Uber is not a startup, and hasn&#x27;t been for a while; it&#x27;s a multinational corporation). More &quot;copycats&quot; is usually better, as they compete (until they start racing to the bottom, but that&#x27;s another issue entirely).')
