Some people are mentioning Prolog being slow. Well, I took an undergrad class on Prolog, and my perception is that Prolog can be very performant doing complete searches, but:<p>1) You need to know how to encode the constraints so they can be evaluated efficiently, not just write them.<p>2) A common way to achieve 1) is to encode a problem as a SAT problem and use a modern SAT solver. They are pretty sick. You can write great SAT solvers in Prolog, but there are already many good ones in many languages, so it&#x27;s quite poinless unless you do it for fun or learning.<p>3) Compared to most statistical methods &#x2F; heuristics, searches in Prolog will be slow. And in most cases statistical methods will do fine anyway, because there will be at least decent solutions to be easily found.<p>My conclusion is that we often confuse the problems of &quot;proving that a plan is optimal&quot; with &quot;finding a good plan&quot;, which are indeed related, but use very different techniques to reach solutions.')
