I have doubts about what other people say, but I try to reserve judgement about those things. When them make claims that I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence for, I ask for their evidence so I can understand where they are coming from, but make my own assessment about the truth.  I am not badgering  anyone, but I refuse to let people make claims without evidence, if it is 1.) it&#x27;s a statement of fact, not opinion, and 2.) there is no consensus about it&#x27;s truth from what I have seen or it goes against that consensus. If you don&#x27;t like that, don&#x27;t read my comments.')
