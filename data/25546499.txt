These tools draw directly onto the X11 canvas, which for me begs the question - what are they for? If you want a real GUI that badly, why not use one that&#x27;s not in the terminal?<p>Ncurses-style CLIs have the benefit of being usable over bad connections and on headless boxes. I can&#x27;t see why you would want to display an image in your terminal if you&#x27;re already running a graphical session, and presumably have an image viewer installed.<p>[0]: turns out there are programs which turn images into blocks of coloured characters, and therefore <i>do</i> work over SSH.')
