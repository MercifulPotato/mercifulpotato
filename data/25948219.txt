They&#x27;re in the red. That is Melvin&#x27;s investors&#x27; problem. The second-order problem, that of avoiding a fire sale of remaining assets, is what the bailout prevented.<p>Because:<p>&gt; With respect to Melvin, I&#x27;m blown away that these trades were executed as unhedged shorts.<p>Because that ^ will take down a prime, and if it&#x27;s your prime because you&#x27;re buddies with your mentee... no sir. And to cap it off, dominos fall everywhere because of the Index Fund phenomenon if there&#x27;s no longer &#x27;liquidity&#x27; from these guys.<p>Side note: You&#x27;re smart as hell, I can tell from the few times we&#x27;ve interacted on this forum, and I appreciate the thoughtful responses. We need to figure out a way to trade info and get a beer.<p>Edit: this could become a run on the banks, but instead it would be a run on equities... which is equity cost of capital worse than just withdrawing your dollars.')
