If it was pretty darn clear that no amount of pressure that does not go through the courts could make Amazon or Twilio cancel Parler there wouldn&#x27;t be as much noise about it.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why no one is tweeting at the power or water companies to cut off their services to the Trump campaign, it&#x27;s not because there aren&#x27;t people that would like to see that happening, but because even the most deranged of them know that it cannot happen.<p>You already have precedence for this, back when corporate towns were a thing that&#x27;s where the public square concept emerged despite the entire town technically being corporate property it was deemed that people cannot be silenced on the streets or in the town square.<p>The issue here is that the Internet isn&#x27;t treated as a public square but as solely corporate property and yes sadly without a bunch of corporations the internet doesn&#x27;t actually exists.<p>You cannot get to the point that you need to essentially become a global Tier 1 ISP before you can put on a service that does not break any laws but that would essentially be immune to being canceled, and if you want to monetize it you probably need to become major payment processor if not an an acquiring and and issuing bank too because as we&#x27;ve seen in the past PayPal&#x2F;PCI can easily prevent you from taking any payments.<p>We do not have an open and distributed network a handful of companies can block any content they want at any time, TOR, VPN&#x27;s or anything else won&#x27;t save you and won&#x27;t help you your ISP can block anything it wants with a single line in a config file and if it&#x27;s not on Google it might as well not be accessible. \nYour hosting options today are rather limited especially for a platform that needs to have a global reach and that you couldn&#x27;t take down with a single 5G connection.<p>Amazon, Google, Microsoft and a tiny handful of others are the only ones who can provide you with that infrastructure, if you are going with a smaller or more traditional hosting provider then there are only a handful of CDNs that can provide you with content distribution and DDOS protection&#x2F;mitigation services.<p>If you want to grant companies the same freedom you grant to people when it comes to making decisions you need an actual free market for that, but globally the internet isn&#x27;t a free market and no one can make the argument that it is free yet alone a free market when in order to provide a legal service (regardless of how distasteful it is) without any of the existing market players being able to completely shut you down you have to build a Bank of America, a Visa,a  DeepOcean and a Cloudflare first.')
