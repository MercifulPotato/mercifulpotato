I gather you got the higher density one. I don&#x27;t use Ubuntu but I have the same display and don&#x27;t have scaling issues. I use Arch &amp; OpenBSD and configure everything myself though.<p>&gt; Speakers are incredibly quiet.<p>Mostly a PulseAudio issue (doesn&#x27;t play well with 4 speaker configurations).  Has multiple workarounds (2 speaker only and to use all 4). I got it working in an hour.  Full fix coming in next major version.<p>&gt; Suspend &#x2F; hibernate does not work reliably.<p>Has had a fix since February')
