There are so many things we can pay attention to, and so many people whose job it is to distract us, that we can rarely direct it as we want. And biologically, we&#x27;re set up to be distracted by threats and unexpected phenomena.<p>That&#x27;s not to say we don&#x27;t pay attention. As he points out elsewhere, Csikszentmihalyi identified &#x27;flow&#x27;, which is when we get into a nice state of focus on something positive.<p>Luckily, we&#x27;re finding out more about how to pay attention to things we want to pay attention to. Prioritising, dividing tasks into chunks, getting enough sleep, choosing what we attend to more wisely are all helpful.')
