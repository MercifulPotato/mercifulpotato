Not the OP you were replying to, but I love meat of all types. I also love vegetables. I also really like some vegetarian foods. Actually, I just like food, but I can&#x27;t each much of it at one sitting.<p>I think the other proposition is that, for whatever reason, there&#x27;s this push to market vegetarian foods as substitutes to lure in traditional meat eaters rather than putting effort toward convincing them that they&#x27;re <i>alternatives</i> that taste just as good.<p>Like bean burgers. I absolutely love bean burgers because regular burgers just don&#x27;t sit right with me half the time. But I don&#x27;t treat them as a substitute--I treat them as an alternative that is delicious and unique in its own right AND to be enjoyed as such. I mean, let&#x27;s be honest: There&#x27;s so many different varieties of beans, and so many things you can do with them, that even speaking as a meat eater, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get bored with how many different dishes you can make (with no meat)!<p>One example that comes to mind that&#x27;s semi-vegetarian is a black bean enchilada recipe I make from time to time. Just beans. Only non-vegetarian item is the cheese (and sometimes the corn tortillas because of lard, if you get them fresh). Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, tastes amazing, and it&#x27;s super filling. Have a side of refried beans (I like beans)[1], Spanish rice, a salad, and it&#x27;s like a restaurant-style meal.<p>Err. Didn&#x27;t mean to make this reply so long. Sorry. I guess I just love cooking, too.<p>And yes, it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> much effort to <i>at least</i> cut out red meat from your diet. Way healthier too.<p>[1] The people around you probably won&#x27;t like the side effects.')
