It had 200 members a few days ago and over 700 now. These commit to meetings on what collective action to take and pay 1% of their wages as dues. Support for unions has been growing at tech companies in the U.S. in the last couple of years, and Google is the first of major companies to come. Major tech companies have unionized as of recent in South Korea, and now it is happening in the USA. Google workers unionized by cooperating with CODE-CWA, an effort to organize unions in tech companies which is quickly gaining traction, has achieved a number of victories in minor companies and is likely growing stronger in secret right now in major tech companies that are not Google. They offer online training classes on how to organize an union at one&#x27;s company, give people guidance and dispatch experienced union organizers to get a workplace organized.<p>An union allows workers to use their collective power to force companies to run the way they want it. Tech companies in South Korea unionized primarily over working conditions. For instance, employers were forcing workers to work over 8 hours and not paying them properly. This occurred at various companies, like Naver (S. Korea&#x27;s biggest IT company which makes the most popular search engine). The workers used the power of their union at Naver to abolish such forced, badly-paid overtime.<p>In the U.S., tech workers are organizing over the combined importance of working conditions and making a positive impact on tech companies&#x27; policies. For instance, a major aim of the Google union is to curb far-right extremism enabled by Google&#x27;s platforms, as well as get Google to stop its cooperation with the U.S. military&#x27;s wars of aggression and police persecution of black people. Google workers have already succeeded in some of these aims.<p>(Originally posted to Reddit some days ago.)')
