The rewrite is mythical because not only does it invariably take much longer than it seems that it should, how are you going to carry on working on the existing system while spending 2 years rewriting?<p>Depending on your codebase, removing a specific part of it is invariably extremely brittle and the people who understood the original app might not be around any more.<p>The third, and imho best option, is to deploy something new alongside the existing application. For example, the existing email system is massively over complicated so we created a new email microservice system which didn&#x27;t only permit a rewrite, but was a small achievable system and could bring with it many other benefits over the code in the monolith, it was then relatively easy to both test and redirect the original calls to the new service. You can also do this with applications. We run two alongside each other behind a proxy to hide the movement between the apps. We only need to migrate one page&#x2F;area at a time, test it and then automatically redirect that page to the new system.<p>This approach is much more practical and also gives the benefit that if you are doing a major redesign, you simply migrate that page at the same time to the new app and you test everything at the same time. Leave the old stuff alone and eventually delete it all.<p>Lovely.')
