Of course, this is one of successful stories, so your mileage might (and will) vary.\nGive yourself tight deadlines and see if you can stick to them. Do not be afraid to bail out early, if you see that game development is not working out.  \nI&#x27;d suggest keeping your daily job until you at least have minimal working prototype of your game and get positive feedback.<p>As for games on mobile platforms, be prepared if you will create something new and unique - it will have dozen of clones on day three after launch.')
