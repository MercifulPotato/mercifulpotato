I&#x27;ve heard this same type of criticism about Native Americans. &quot;their towns are filthy, you will get robbed, (they aren&#x27;t proper people, and being friends with them lowers your social status)&quot;.<p>Having experienced them, US reservations are definitely shitty places, but everything the OP said applies. Yes, they look like 3rd world counties, and passers-by attribute that to the people living there. Rather, the real reason these places look terrible is poverty and lack of investment.<p>I had the misfortune last year of having to attend a funeral on a reservation (misfortune in the sense that my friend died), and there was a stark line between the ranchland surrounding the res and the res itself.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to Europe, but even in NA it really isn&#x27;t about color of skin. I&#x27;m of French Mediterranean background, so during the summer I&#x27;m browner than most of my Hispanic friends. Doesn&#x27;t matter, I &#x27;pass&#x27; as a white person, while my Hispanic friend who is whiter than me gets treated like a second class citizen. It&#x27;s fucked, but in America I don&#x27;t actually think it&#x27;s about race, americans just hide classism behind race since racism is more acceptable than classism.<p>Edit: not to say that reservations are unequalled places of filth. In my experience, even if you aren&#x27;t native people are willing to help out. I was cross-country traveling on a garbage old Harley that needed help every 75 miles, and I had the most generous offers when I was in Native country vs. anything else. This agrees with the OP, in these places people are more willing to help out. For example, in a reservation town in SW SD my magneto died. I struggled with kicking the bike for 10 minutes, somebody eventually saw I was struggling and offered to call their cousin with a truck. Towing the bike behind a truck got it to fire, and everyone involved refused money (common response was &quot;you&#x27;ll need it later&quot;). I get I was driving an absolute crap piece of machinery, but the reservation towns were much more helpful than other towns that I broke down in over that trip (and I broke down in a lot, I was driving a 71 harley sportster, they weren&#x27;t even reliable when new).')
