But with self-driving vehicles, can&#x27;t we make the layout of the car safer, and thus accidents cause less harm to the people inside?<p>For example, right now because we need to see the road, I assume there is significantly more danger from the windshield vs. a padded back on both sides of the car with passengers facing each other like in a train car.<p>It seems likely that we can make self-driving vehicles much safer, even with the same number of collisions, by just changing the layout.')
