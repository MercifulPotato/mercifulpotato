These are $80 ARM based single board computers (SBC&#x27;s), similar to Raspberry Pi&#x27;s.  You can bridge the gap between high and low ends buy buying low end and scaling horizontally.<p>The troublesome piece is, of course, the horizontal scaling.  For a cluster of ARM CPUs to be worthwhile, you need a job that can be parallelized, but not so massively parallel that it already runs on a GPU.<p>Even so, I think there&#x27;s a lot of potential for these low end ARM devices.  Ultimately, their impact on x86 could be the same as what x86 did to the previous generation of mini computers.')
