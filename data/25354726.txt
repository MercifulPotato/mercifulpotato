Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607482058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339390, text='&gt; The problem in the US is that everything is aligned against making stuff here. The unions have been in damage control mode for decades, trying to avoid losing the factories that employ two hundred to the more automated factories that employ twenty, but then as a result losing 100% rather than 90% of the jobs to China.<p>Short-termism around corporate earnings has done more damage to U.S. industry than unions ever could. And to be clear, I don&#x27;t think China is any better, despite popular (misconceived) impressions to the contrary.<p>&gt; But it would imply paying more for stuff because it&#x27;s not being made in a polluting sweatshop in an undemocratic country which is acting like the nation state version of a 19th century robber baron.<p>That&#x27;s increasingly not applicable with automation as well as the plunging cost of renewable energy. There&#x27;s natural gas being flared in the Dakotas because it is uneconomical to deliver it. And as I understand it both North and South Dakota are not known for an overly restrictive regulatory environment or leadership. It&#x27;s more a matter of volition IMO.')
