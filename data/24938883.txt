It&#x27;s much easier to tell someone that they can eat as much as they want, but only between 6-8pm (one meal a day). It&#x27;s difficult to tell someone you can eat 3 meals but no more than 1500 calories in total. Once I start eating, I don&#x27;t want to stop (until I&#x27;m full). But the point at which I&#x27;m full is way beyond my calorie limit if I am eating 3 meals a day.')
