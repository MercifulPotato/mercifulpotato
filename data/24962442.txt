That is the way back to sanity so instead of going into that madness of chasing bigger contracts you invest time of employees that are on bench into building your own SaaS.<p>Then you keep one of employees, later maybe more, on that SaaS and slowly change your revenue mix. Then you still might get some additional projects but you always have something to spend your FTE time on. In the end you change the company profile where you chase different things than just having butts in the seats.<p>But that might mean you are not getting any salary for months because you have to reinvest in your SaaS idea. Of course having a viable product idea is another very important point.<p>Upside on the other hand is that selling viable SaaS business will be easier than selling dev shop, because dev shop only has developers. When developers quit dev shop value goes immediately to 0, with SaaS you still might have IP and paying customers.')
