Even fewer people would do a good job of not losing them over the years.<p>I feel like this is all a solvable UX problem.  The secrets could be automatically distributed and stored on friends&#x2F;family devices, could be integrated into iMessage directly.  &quot;Choose friends you trust to help you recover data.&quot; If N of your M designated friends and family still have access to their phone when you need to recover your backup then you can get access, maybe by presenting a QR code on each device you can scan, or a notification you can interact with after confirming identity via a phone call or something.<p>The secrets wouldn&#x27;t require any actions to keep intact, they could always be synced into iMessage and included in your own backups.  Kind of like you&#x27;re operating a RAID array across your friends and family, N+X redundancy, so long as no more than X of your group needs recovery at the same time you&#x27;re good.<p>Kind if an interesting approach actually, would be neat to build this into Matrix as an experiment.')
