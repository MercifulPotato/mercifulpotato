I know that the estimate is that we were at 280ppm pre-industrial, and that one recent reading was 412ppm. I think that corresponds to 2187 GTCO2 and 3217 GTCO2 respectively. But the IPCC - a while ago - said we had to stay below 2900 to have a 2&#x2F;3 chance of remaining below 2 degrees. Another source says we&#x27;re at 2300 anthropogenic GTCO2 now. How do I square that math? I know that there&#x27;s a difference between &quot;total&quot; GTCO2 and anthropogenic GTCO2, and I also know that the planet absorbs about 55% of anthropogenic.')
