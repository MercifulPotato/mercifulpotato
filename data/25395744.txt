Or is that fine because of the naturalistic fallacy?<p>&gt;The increased amounts of pesticide run off the field and mess up the rest of the ecosystem. Now you&#x27;re seeing herbicide-resistant weeds come up in these fields.<p>AFAIK this is a non-issue except to the farmers. Resistance to whatever usually comes at a cost, so in the wild the superweeds will get out-competed by their non-resistant counterparts.')
