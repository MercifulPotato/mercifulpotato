Item(by='madrox', descendants=None, kids=[25272205], score=None, time=1606861011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25269934, text='&quot;Congratulations to Slack on its exit&quot; I say as I forgot they are post-IPO.<p>I always thought it strange how big Slack got to begin with. History will probably remember its ultimate accomplishment was getting lots of companies to switch from direct-message communication to chat rooms. However, that was probably inevitable as an internet savvy generation took over more companies, and Slack was simply well-timed. It&#x27;s not like the product was light years ahead of its myriad of competitors. It had a little better design and had friendly corporate terms.<p>Which is good news. If Salesforce really does ruin Slack, I have no doubt someone will swoop into the space just as quickly as they did.')
