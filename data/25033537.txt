Personally I use restic[1] and B2 with a dedicated API key that can&#x27;t delete anything.<p>[1]: Patched slightly to make it work, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;restic&#x2F;restic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;2398" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;restic&#x2F;restic&#x2F;pull&#x2F;2398</a> (hope this will get merged eventually)<p>How one goes about not accumulating backups forever is a problem with this setup. My basic plan is manually switching to another bucket and verifying the newly backed-up data before deleting the old bucket.<p>You can also enable a time-based deprecation of hidden files on B2 then you don&#x27;t have to actively do anything, but in theory if the malware bides its time it could still delete&#x2F;overwrite everything without you noticing.<p>If you want to self-host the restic&#x2F;rest-server also has a --append-only flag that would have a similar effect, but if you use that you&#x27;ll have to make sure the malware can&#x27;t hop onto your backup machine via ssh.')
