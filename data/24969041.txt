Examples would be copyright and patent issues, broadband availability, antitrust, net neutrality, technological unemployment [0], free trade &#x2F; tariffs &#x2F; trade war, H1B visas, gig work (eg. Uber), R&amp;D spending, space exploration, AI&#x2F;algorithmic biases&#x2F;ethics, open source, capital gains taxes, etc.<p>Conversely, how do you view the structure and detail of party and candidate platforms (eg. Warren&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve got a plan for that&quot; vs., well, anybody else)? Is more detail better or worse in terms of election results?<p>[0] I&#x27;ve always had a soft spot for this episode of The West Wing: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;westwingwiki.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;season-5-episode-19-talking-points&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;westwingwiki.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;season-5-episode-19-talking-...</a>')
