With Presidential campaigns running for almost two years in advance of the actual voting weeks, there’s a huge gap between when the thing starts and when we see results. This way, people have something to fill the time. Even now that voting has started, we are still another 10 days until the voting is done and likely another 7 after that until we have a sufficient count to know who has been elected.<p>That’s a long time for a populace that’s worried, distracted, and interested, especially since so many of us live in states where—due to the mechanics of a broken election system—we can’t do much to influence the national outcome.')
