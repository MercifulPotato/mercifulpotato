It had a full semantics layers which translated your query into a mixed-lambda calculus-prolog query, which is then translated into SQL as needed - you can see a sample of the semantics layer here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fd4EPh2tYrk?t=92" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fd4EPh2tYrk?t=92</a>.<p>It&#x27;s deep learning based with a lot of augmentation. Going from the OP&#x27;s article to actually being able to run queries on any schema is quite a bit more work. I&#x27;d love to see GPT3 handle arbitrary schemas.<p>p&#x2F;s: the startup failed. deep research based startups need a lot of funds.')
