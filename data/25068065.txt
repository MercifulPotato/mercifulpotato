Further, employees of Google aren&#x27;t going to spend any time on products you care about if they can&#x27;t get promoted by doing so.&quot;</i><p>That&#x27;s a wrong take out of OPs comment. They specifically mentioned that except for a niche subset of users most people don&#x27;t store MP3s in their phones to listen to. There is nothing wrong for a service to adapt to their new customer base. Why should they staff niche projects because some small % of users (and declining) want to keep using it and provide better alternatives?')
