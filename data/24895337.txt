We’re a but early to see mass reinfections.<p>That said, my guess would be normal reinfections would be less severe, more like a cold. There have been some severe reinfections but any reinfection under six months suggests something atypical in the immune response.<p>Also SARS-Cov-1 produced a longer immune response so that may happen here.<p>But lifelong sterilizing immunity seems pretty unlikely based on what we know so far. The vaccines aren’t aiming at sterilizing immunity actually, their goal is to greatly lower the severity of the infection.')
