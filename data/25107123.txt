Have you tried using macOS on a standard-resolution monitor? It has very different font rendering from either Windows or Linux. If it turns out that font rendering is what makes your eyes strained, you may benefit from a higher-DPI monitor.<p>If the issue is screen tearing, try Sway or another Wayland compositor. That&#x27;s always better in my experience.')
