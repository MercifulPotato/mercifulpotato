The real strength of Salesforce.com is that you can use <i>code</i> to customize it and get the real utility you&#x27;re paying for out of it.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;no software&quot; in the sense that all SaaS systems are &quot;no software&quot;. Realistically, Salesforce.com is very much enterprise software of the sort that requires real customization in the form of real code to implement the important business requirements.')
