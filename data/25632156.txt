A company is nothing without the initial investors. A company is nothing without the it&#x27;s initial idea.<p>It takes a lot of people in different roles and a lot of different resources (be it people, money, opportunity) to make a company work.<p>While there are successful employee-owned companies after, many companies today would not exist if you didn&#x27;t have the motivation there for certain people.
