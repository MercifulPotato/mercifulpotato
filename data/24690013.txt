The first will be awful to work with, and the latter will destroy your life if you hang around long enough. This is from first hand experience.<p>I placed myself in-between a NPD CEO and the rest of the company I was at in an effort to fix the company culture which was toxic when I started.  It took a year but it worked.  I put in a lot of effort to make it a nice place to work at.  I left after 2 years, and within 6 months the <i>entire</i> management staff had quit or was fired after I left.<p>People with NPD don&#x27;t know they are monsters.  They take credit and place blame without exception.  They view everyone as beneath them and treat everyone as disposable.  This guy said out loud that he doesn&#x27;t like win-win deals - it must be win-lose.  Taking something away from another person made him feel better about himself.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever heal from that experience.')
