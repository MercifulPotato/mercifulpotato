Unfortunately that still impacts contract structure today and it&#x27;s hard to change on that level.<p>TFA is talking about estimates inside projects, which are not time based anymore in any environment that cares about the problems you laid out.<p>Personally I offer my customers to either pay by the week, or pay by extremely fixed scope with a 3 month definition period up front and a 50% buffer above the estimate. I stress that paying by the sprint lets them change objectives at any time, gives  them an always-current report of how much &quot;effort budget&quot; they have left to work with, and guarantees they only pay for what they use. That felt like a risky move the first time I did it, but I never lost any business over it.')
