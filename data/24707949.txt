He certainly is more optimistic than I would be. To live and breathe the mission for so long, constantly move around and help where needed, stepping outside his comfort zone and it sounds like working more than 40 hours a week, he still gets the axe because of incompetent management.<p>I wish him the best going forward, it sounds like he is an awesome developer and teammate and whatever company he goes to next will be lucky to have him.')
