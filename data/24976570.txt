In the long run it&#x27;s not going be urban development all the way up to the summits, but I would expect the Rockies to have more of the same sort of human presence that the Alps do in about 1-200 years time. The big difference is precipitation ... the Rockies are on the low side compared to the Alps, and that may take things in a very different direction.')
