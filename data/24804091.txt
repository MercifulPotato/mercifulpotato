It&#x27;s taking a long time on some algorithms for NP-complete problems (like dynamic programming algorithms and local search algorithms). So I am considering buying a new thinkpad.<p>Potential future use: Maybe, I will launch a youtube channel so I will need to do video editing as well. But my primer use will always be programming.<p>What I love about the X230:<p>* The keyword. It&#x27;s amazing. Period.<p>* It&#x27;s silent. It always have a decent temperature.<p>* No problems with linux.<p>* Several USB ports (I am always using a mouse)<p>What I don&#x27;t like:<p>* It&#x27;s not performant for what I am doing.<p>* Although the screen is an IPS, it&#x27;s REALLY small. I am always scrolling when programming and I hate that.<p>* The batterylife is poor.<p>* It has a strong plastic feel<p>* No hdmi port<p>I don&#x27;t want to make some fashion-driven decisions. Any suggestions from long-term users?')
