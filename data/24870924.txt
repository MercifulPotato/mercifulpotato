Like, cool, I can agree it would be great if there was a viable third optionâ€”but there&#x27;s not, and your choice of protest is effectively taking what power you do have and throwing it away.<p>In a non-swing state, how is voting third party &quot;throwing your vote away&quot;? In California or Massachusetts, it doesn&#x27;t matter who you vote for, the Democrat will win and the Republican will lose, so why not vote third party, if you like the third party better? Likewise, in Wyoming or West Virginia, it doesn&#x27;t matter who you vote for, the Republican will win and the Democrat will lose, so again, why not third party if that&#x27;s what you want?<p>Maybe if the third party is massively popular, then it might change the outcome, even in one of those states, but that didn&#x27;t happen in 2016, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it isn&#x27;t happening this year either.')
