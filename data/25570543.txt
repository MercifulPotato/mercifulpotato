I use both extensively. I tend to use Apple Maps more since I like how the Apple Watch integration works, and prefer the UI on CarPlay, among some other benefits. Though I usually always and going to places I know that are not far, and use it more so I now if say their is unexpected traffic and I should take a different route, and well as gentle reminder that a turn is coming up when the kids are distracting me. I&#x27;m in New England we have the &#x27;new&#x27; maps, though when going some where new I more often than not still always run into issues with Apple Maps, where the place I&#x27;m going the location on the map isn&#x27;t correct, or directions stop prematurely when there is a small road your suppsoe to take or who knows what else, where is I almost never have those issues with Google Maps&#x2F;Waze. Also anytime say I store closes and moves, or a new store opens, Google Maps shows it within a day or so, where is Apple Maps most often can go weeks or months, and often I am the one submitting the issue to Apple Maps (Which they then correct but takes a while vs Google Maps where I submit an issue and its fixed very quickly). So while Apple Maps is getting much better, there reporting feature is far behind Google Maps and until that changes I don&#x27;t see how they will be able to be as good. And for many of us Waze is preferred over Google Maps or Apple Maps, when on the highway, since knowing when police are ahead, or a road hazard in real time is invaluable. Though for me, like many Apple Maps is usually good enough, and when it shows the wrong end result, I simply quickly open up Waze or Google Maps to get me the last mile.')
