With the 2020-12-20 measurement though I was interested whether MRI Ruby 3.0 was indeed significantly faster than 2.7 which doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. It&#x27;s also interesting to note that even if MRI Ruby was tree times faster it still would be half as fast as LuaJIT (considering that LuaJIT would be even faster if the tracing JIT would also support closures).')
