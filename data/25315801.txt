I find I can&#x27;t follow your reasoning at all, so let me give you my reasoning.<p>The accepted definition of &quot;odd&quot; is that when you divide by 2 you have a remainder of 1.  Thus 7 is odd, because when you divide by 2 you get an answer of 3 with a remainder of 1.  Similarly 15 is odd, because you divide by 2 to get an answer of 7 with a remainder of 1.<p>The accepted definition of &quot;even&quot; is that when you divide by 2 there is no remainder.  Thus 18 is even because when you divide by 2 you get 9 and no remainder.<p>Rephrasing that, if you multiply any integer by 2, the result is always an even number.  So 9 times 2 is 18, hence 18 is even.  23 times 2 is 46, hence 46 is an even number.<p>Then zero times 2 is zero, hence zero is an even number.')
