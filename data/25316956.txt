Also, opening and closing the video file makes my cursor disappear for a couple seconds!<p>I&#x27;m wondering if it <i>switches</i> from hardware dimming to software dimming when the video is opened and closed, and if that switch has to do with the cursor disappears. If it is, though it&#x27;s flawlessly undetectable in terms of brightness -- the interface white and grays don&#x27;t change <i>at all</i>.<p>Interestingly confirming it: taking a screenshot of the video while screen is at 75% brightness show massive brightness clipping in the video, since it&#x27;s &quot;overexposed&quot; in the interface&#x27;s color range. But taking a screenshot while screen brightness is 100% shows no clipping, because the video is no longer &quot;overexposed&quot; to the interface.<p>I&#x27;m just so surprised I had utterly no idea macOS worked like this. I&#x27;d never heard of this feature until now.')
