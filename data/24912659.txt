I’m\ncomfortable doing that because I’ve read through the whole of the regulations and have\na degree-level education in Physics and understand the risks. If a stranger asked \nme whether they could wire their house through Youtube videos I still wouldn’t\nhappily say yes — even though theoretically there’s enough good information out\nthere to wire a house.')
