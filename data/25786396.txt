Rust is optimized for solving certain problems -- but solving them <i>robustly</i>, not <i>quickly</i>. Python comes a bit closer, but Python also wants to be <i>readable</i>; I don&#x27;t have to worry about that.<p>I guess one way to frame it is: the core values (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;230142234" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;230142234</a>) of this language are velocity, and...that&#x27;s it. Maybe expressiveness (less typing) and transparency (immediate feedback), but really those are just aids to velocity moreso than orthogonal values.')
