Even if we had infinite time and energy to expose and debunk it all, the attention of the viewer is limited.<p>As result, we&#x27;ll never be able to convince people who&#x27;ve read this fake content that what they read is false.<p>There&#x27;s only two ways this can end:<p>1. We block this kind of fake, unverified content<p>2. We accept living in postfactual times where truth is up to the highest bidder and fake content decides elections.')
