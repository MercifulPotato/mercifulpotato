Maybe they think twitter is doing enough to moderate their platform already, or maybe not enough.  None of this has bearing on whether or not the article is misinformation of disinformation.  The article is factual, reporting facts (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong about that) concerning a real lawsuit.<p>And you don&#x27;t have to be a lawyer to understand the meaning of <i>&#x27;the lawsuit alleges&#x27;</i> repeated a dozen times.  Or is your position that  reporting allegations against tech companies is <i>always</i> misinformation because you think only lawyers know what allegations are?')
