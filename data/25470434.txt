Item(by='Tuna-Fish', descendants=None, kids=[25470593], score=None, time=1608317244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25469614, text='Tesla&#x27;s monthly sales in any specific (non-US) market are completely meaningless, because total demand greatly exceeds supply, and supply is not evenly distributed. That is, there are months where individual European markets get thousands of Model 3&#x27;s, and there are months where those same markets get a handful, if any. This means that both the &quot;OMG Tesla sales grew 15005% in market X!&quot; and &quot;LOL Tesla only sold 3 cars in market X!&quot; are completely meaningless non-news from which you cannot derive any information.<p>Just to drive the point home, new registrations of Tesla cars in Norway by month in the past 8 months:\n    April:     44\n    May:       8\n    June:      568\n    July:      348\n    August:    33\n    September: 1439\n    October:   95\n    November:  326<p>No, Teslas did not suddenly become hugely more popular during September and then immediately lose a lot of their popularity in the month after. It&#x27;s just that in September, a lot more cars were allocated to Norway, and so a lot of the people on the waiting list finally got theirs. During the other months, those cars went to other European countries.<p>Tesla is still ridiculously supply-limited compared to the amount of cars they could sell, if they only had the cars. Whether they succeed or not depends mostly on how fast they can scale their production.')
