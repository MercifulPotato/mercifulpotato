It would mean platforms that don’t moderate have no liability. The law was created because a website that didn’t moderate was found to be not liable for the comments it’s users posted, and a website that did was found to be liable. This is even on the Wikipedia page for section 230.<p>I guess the conclusion that repealing it would result in more censorship is based on the idea that platforms would moderate more aggressively to try and avoid all liability. When really, that’s simple not possible, and they would have to abandon the practice all together. Well, the larger platforms would have to at least.')
