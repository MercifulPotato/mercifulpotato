I take care to keep the pages minimal and fast. Everything (from the HTML to the CSS) is hand-rolled by me. [Except analytics] there&#x27;s only JS for the minimal email sign up that only loads on the main homepage, and it gracefully degrades without JavaScript. Everything else is static.<p>It&#x27;s a point of pride, glad you noticed :)')
