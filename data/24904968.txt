Over the years, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on HN.<p>I do freelance writing and I blog and I&#x27;ve been repeatedly told &quot;Get a real job. Quit expecting writing to pay. It doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>I briefly was interested in trying to contribute to open source as a non programmer. I&#x27;ve seen other non programmers ask about contributing to open source.<p>It&#x27;s a really unwelcoming environment for non programmers. Even people who are programmers and wanting to get into open source talk about how difficult it can be to get involved. Now dial that up a few notches for people who don&#x27;t program, think differently, communicate differently and are frequently looked down upon by programmers because programmers make good money and many of them are openly contemptuous of people who don&#x27;t make good money and are often openly contemptuous of the kind of work they do, as if what they do takes less smarts, isn&#x27;t as valuable, etc.')
