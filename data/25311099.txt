At that point it is straightforward to say, &quot;does this unit test increase my confidence?&quot; and then go onwards. The thing is you need to learn to accurately gauge your confidence which can be difficult at times, especially when you are dealing with unknown unknowns, but if you iterate on it you get to a place where problems pop up in the areas you are least comfortable with and that is a good signal you&#x27;re at least approximating it correctly.')
