The number of jobs that require &quot;expertise in AWS&#x2F;expertise in Google Cloud&#x2F;etc&quot; is laughable. It&#x27;s like every company is creating its own vocabulary for things network engineers have had terms for years.<p>This serves as an artificial barrier to hiring. I&#x27;ve done years of network engineering but then it comes down to &quot;how many years of experience in AWS.&quot;<p>EDIT: Note that this isn&#x27;t a new thing, e.g. we&#x27;re looking for an &quot;Oracle engineer&quot;&#x2F;&quot;vmware specialist&quot;&#x2F;etc.')
