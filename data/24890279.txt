I can update the firmware and BIOS from inside Linux, and Lenovo have even started shipping newer versions of the laptop with Fedora pre-installed.<p>There&#x27;s massive scope of tinkering with Linux if you want to, but as long as you&#x27;re careful with the hardware you buy there&#x27;s absolutely no need to tinker at all if you don&#x27;t want to.')
