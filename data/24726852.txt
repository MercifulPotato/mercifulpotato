It&#x27;s also meant to be a utility system-level method and in Java standard library utility methods follow a certain organizational scheme so as to designate their system-level status. This status implies certain aspects of behavior not codified in the API name. Therefore this sort of organizational scheme can be argued to be of necessity and not merely an arbitrary design decision.<p>I think the key word in your argument is &#x27;implies&#x27; and you didn&#x27;t use the word &#x27;requires&#x27;. If the authors of the API are implying the nature of these sets of functions by organizing them under &#x27;system&#x27;, they are doing so to convey information and an opinion as to the nature of the function. The fact that java.system.out is STDOUT, could be also put into java.io or java.system.unix.out, java.logging.out etc. The &#x27;system&#x27; is arbitrary, its not &#x27;required&#x27;. For example, the out function does not inspect its package name to determine that this out file outputs to STDERR.')
