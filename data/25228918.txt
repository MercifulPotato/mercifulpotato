Item(by='DavidSJ', descendants=None, kids=[25229533], score=None, time=1606487284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228308, text='Some other senses in which 1 can be thought of as the &quot;midpoint&quot; between 0 and ∞ come from the many common ways to invertibly map an interval onto (0, ∞), in which the midpoint of that interval maps onto 1. For example:<p>• tan maps (0, π&#x2F;2) onto (0, ∞), and tan(π&#x2F;4) = 1.<p>• f(x) = x&#x2F;(1 - x) maps (0, 1) onto (0, ∞), and f(1&#x2F;2) = 1.<p>• exp is an isomorphism from the reals under addition to the positive reals under multiplication. 0 is the natural &quot;midpoint&quot; of the reals under addition, and exp(0) = 1.<p>(Closely related to that last one: when dealing only with positive numbers (and their limits 0 and ∞), it&#x27;s natural to think of their group operation, multiplication, for which 1 is the identity, creating a symmetry between the numbers smaller than 1 and the numbers larger than 1 under reciprocation.)')
