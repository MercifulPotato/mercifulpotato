Constant 2.8 at M43 is exactly equal to a constant f&#x2F;5.6 on FF. Indeed, at the FoV equal to 50mm on FF, you would need 25mm on M43. At f&#x2F;5.6, the aperture diameter of the 50mm FF lens is 50&#x2F;5.6=8.93, and the M43 lens would have an aperture diameter of 25&#x2F;2.8=8.93mm.<p>This means that the lenses are equivalent. Indeed, the amount of light captured by a lens from a point source is proportional to the angle of the cone with its tip at the point and it&#x27;s disk at the aperture. And so, since the FoV is the same, you will be at the same distance from the point for the same image, and since the diameter of the aperture is the same, the two cones will be identical, and thus the amount of light will be the same.<p>For depth of field, the calculation is similar, and they are indeed also equal.<p>And so, an f&#x2F;5.6 aperture on FF is equal to an f&#x2F;2.8 aperture on an M43 lens of the same FoV.<p>As a conclusion, your 12-40mm f&#x2F;2. 8 lens is exactly equivalent to a 24-80 f&#x2F;5.6 lens on FF. And so, a 28-75 f&#x2F;3.5-5.6 lens on FF is faster in average but has a slightly smaller zoom range. In the end, the variable aperture lens is optically superior, at a third of the price.<p>As for the Tamron, it is indeed made of plastic, but I like this because it makes it lighter and barely less resistant as the G-Master. It is still capable of gathering four times more light.<p>If you want to actually test this, we can print two test charts and put them one meter from the camera then one meter from each other in a line, and you can take a picture of them at 25mm f&#x2F;2.8 on your Olympus, I&#x27;ll take the same picture at 50mm f&#x2F;5.6 on my A7ii, and you&#x27;ll see that the depth of field will be exactly the same. If we had a way of controlling lighting, we would see that at the same shutter speed the noise levels of the two images will be very similar too.')
