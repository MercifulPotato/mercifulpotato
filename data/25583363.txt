So you can pick like a color or model.  But then they group all the reviews together despite what buttons you&#x27;ve picked.  This is so frustrating!  At least they&#x27;ve added a little thing that says which SKU the review is for.  But I wish they would just separate out the reviews for different models &#x2F; colors.  It just seems another way to get increased review counts and make it look like a clear obvious quality winner from the search results box.')
