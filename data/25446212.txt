I live in San Antonio, TX where we sometimes have air quality days which have specific restrictions.  The trigger point is that we expect to rise about 10 AQI which is the WHO guideline.  Our average for 2019 was 9.4.   Living in a city where the average is over 100 sounds terrible to me.  I&#x27;m asthmatic, and I have seasonal allergies, and there are days the air quality here bothers me.')
