Item(by='masswerk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612058380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25974828, text='I&#x27;d say, &quot;tech&quot; as in scientifically based engineering design arguably starts with Archimedes. (Mind that the Antikythera mechanism is generally thought to be an offspring of this revolution and that it is also considered by some as the first computer. The circumstances of the site, where it had been discovered, also suggest that mechanisms like this were carefully marketed goods. You might say, that by 90 BC, there had been an established tech business.) However, if you prefer to dismiss this as a lost tradition, then you might consider that there was certainly tech and a thriving tech business in the Victorian age. Even, if you wanted to dismiss any pre-electronics, I have a hard time figuring out what would mark 1971 as a starting point for current developments. (E.g., mind that Moores law was proposed in 1965 or that Kay&#x27;s KiddiComp&#x2F;Dynabook concept, which started the handheld revolution, was envisioned in 1968.) The idea that &quot;tech&quot; or technology started in 1971 is highly absurd.<p>Edit: Please compare a recent entry on the front page, which supported the idea that there hasn&#x27;t been a key innovation since 1978. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25947901" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25947901</a>')
