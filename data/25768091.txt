Item(by='chernobylrocks', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1610572631, title='Ask HN: Looking for a co-founder who can code [Details Inside]', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I have spent a few years working in e-commerce and I have a solid idea that I would like to execute. I understand code and technology and do a fair bit of coding which I&#x27;ve taught myself over the years, but I&#x27;m by no means an expert. I understand the level of expertise required to build a scalable application and MAINTAIN it in the long run requires someone with good experience and command over full stack development.<p>I have semi-implemented this idea for a client already (not fully automated though) and I know there is enough demand for it to be able to turn a profit if we do it right. It&#x27;s not the first of it&#x27;s kind idea, there are a few competitors already in the field and people are definitely trying. I believe there is room to grow and possibly new markets to create. I would like someone to bounce off ideas with who can also think in terms of whether or not a problem is adequately solvable by code they can write. Hopefully if not, they you&#x27;re willing to learn&#x2F;do some research.<p>There might be a little bit of an investment required once we launch. Some sort of affordable + reliable + robust hosting will need to. And somewhere between 500-2000 USD (I&#x27;m not from the US, and the customers can be from anywhere) might need to be spent in a few months on some marketing activities (unless we can find a third co-founder who would be willing to help out). It&#x27;s not a world changing idea, not yet anyway. I believe if we can create enough of something that takes care of the bread and butter, it would give us the creative freedom to innovate though.<p>I&#x27;m completely fine with splitting up equity using the formula here - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;foundrs.com&#x2F;, after adjusting for the weight of any upfront capital investments. I can do market research, placement and other business stuff. Email is in my bio. Send me an email with your availability for the next 72 hours (try calendly maybe?) and let me know if you&#x27;d like to have a discussion over google meet &#x2F; zoom.')
