One uplink is satellite and for weeks it had no signal as the farm is only a few kilometers from one of the largest fires.<p>The other uplink was a solar powered 4G connection and despite several deep cycle batteries and a few 200 watt panels, the station did not get enough light to stay powered over those weeks.<p>We finally found a hilltop wireless ISP that can serve us. We’ll try to get Starlink too but I don’t expect that to work well during fire season. It’s tough to be offline for weeks at a time.')
