But even those 74,222,593 people don&#x27;t “think one way”; if that wasn&#x27;t obvious from, oh, actually listening to them at the time or having a basic understanding of humans, it&#x27;s pretty damn obvious right now, when in defeat the Republican Party which was, if nothing else, pretty unified in electoral support for Trump, (much less the broader group of Trump voters which necessarily included a substantial number of non-Republicans) has been turned against itself with great intensity by Trump’s post-election actions, starting with the election challenges and escalating through the Trumpist attack on the Capitol.<p>&gt; Deny them the right to speak openly and what might you have?<p>No one is interested in denying the vast majority of the people who supported Trump in the last election the right to speak openly.
