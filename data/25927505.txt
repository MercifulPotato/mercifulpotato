The runtimes idea are totally overkill and not granular. Using libraries, packages, IDEs and coding tools is horrible with Flatpak.<p>Just look at the wierdness of running VSCode(ium) in Flatpak. According to flatpak &#x2F; red hat guys the dream setup is :<p>- Remove the sandbox of VSCode through flatpak-spawn escape permission (so there no point in using flatpak...)<p>- From there call &amp; enter Toolbox&#x2F;Podman and install your dependency there using yet another package manager (dnf)<p>So you loose sandboxing, use two separate container tool &amp; use two separate packaging tools.<p>So overkill &amp; overengineered.<p>Now take Guix. You have simple dependency system (just list the packages you need), you have true (recursive) reproducibility, and you could have only one container system for everything.<p>The issue is that Guix containers are not compatible with Flatpak portals (which is now pretty much a standard) and, from what I understood, are not really meant for security but more for the insuring basic reproducibility.<p>If some Guix guys would be interested in developing&#x2F;improving a Guix container system to be compatible with Flatpak portals&amp;APIs and that uses Guix packages instead of runtimes, I&#x27;d donate quite a bit for that. Maybe some other people would be interested in that too.')
