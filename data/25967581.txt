It&#x27;s a bit like CPU execution ports, if you &#x2F;don&#x27;t&#x2F; use them you&#x27;re leaving performance on the floor. Only here nvidia (cuda, tensor, rt) &#x27;cores&#x27; are a bit higher level than exec ports. Also it&#x27;s kind of hard (i.e. fun) to find a use for rt cores. Digging up all those 90&#x27;s papers about exotic applications of Raytracing (I mean weed must have been <i>great</i> then :-)<p>Interesting times.')
