Other measures roughly stayed the same. Prior to that, roughly one in every 88 people were considered to be active cases. Today, that number is one in every 121.<p>Of course this is just my rough calculation (latest population census divided by the number of active cases), and the number is expected to improve somewhat as the amount of population with antibodies increases, but I&#x27;m pretty sure masks help.')
