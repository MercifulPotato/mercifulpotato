Sqlite in particular lacks the ability to attach the metadata usually used for that purpose, but does store code comments in the schema, which provides roughly-equivalent functionality.<p>What level of in-db documentation are you in the habit of writing? I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never worked on or encountered a codebase that explained fully the significance of any of its database columns with in-db comments. I would count myself exceptionally lucky to find natural-language prose documenting such details! Generally I find myself puzzling things out by a combination of reading application code, tinkering with tests, and interrogating developers.<p>I think I&#x27;ve only ever once seen any real use of comments in a real-life codebase. It was a postgres database, where columns that contained PII were commented according to whether it was plaintext or encrypted.')
