I have seen souped up meters which are not directly connected to odometers etc.<p>I have also seen places where if you don&#x27;t know the language and&#x2F;or localite they will demand more than the meter and create a scene get nearby friends to support them.<p>When running late to airport or someplace urgent pretending no change to charge more .<p>The list of tricks go on, ridesharing did away with a lot of that.<p>P.S. it is not all taxi drivers are evil or something, plenty of them have been really helpful in tough spots even the ones who ripped me off have come back to return a valuable item I missed.')
