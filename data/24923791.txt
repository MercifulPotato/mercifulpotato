I made it to switch between various backend implementations which are non NVidia specific.<p>Pytorch may eventually need porting, but for now I don&#x27;t need it. I&#x27;ve been trying out Coriander and DeepCL now but I  decided to stick to Keras, which seems to be a decent compromise. Not using 2.4.x though, do not need it.<p>OpenCL based backends are cutting it for me, running production workloads without needing to install CUDA&#x2F;ROCm is the best way to go.')
