There are &quot;only&quot; 330 different complex organizations in probably a hundred-plus countries to try, so I guess this is pretty unlikely.<p>But even if it is, you can actually hack the entire system with just a BGP hack. Today, if you issue some false BGP routes, you can MITM LetsEncrypt (or one of the other 329 CAs) to sign a valid cert for you. It&#x27;s not hard because validation is automated and depends on proving you own IP space... and IP space is just what your router&#x27;s BGP table says it is at the moment you issue a cert.<p>I would not depend on the kindness of banks giving back money on very large scales. They care about themselves more than they care about you.<p>You&#x27;re right, DNS registrar and nameserver attack is another great attack and usually they&#x27;re pretty vulnerable, so that&#x27;s another good option.')
