It&#x27;s and open protocol, you can make your own AMP crawler, content-maker, parser, etc?<p>I agree that the continued increase of &quot;shiny&quot;-ness of &quot;content&quot; is basically hacking people&#x27;s attention and it should be drastically clamped down - but still, I don&#x27;t see the argument for how Google and AMP and the &quot;open web&quot; and competition interact together.
