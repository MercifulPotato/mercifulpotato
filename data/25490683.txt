(It was part of neuro-psych testing to look for ADD, so they didn&#x27;t run the specific test battery used for Asperger.)<p>In many ways my life has been just fine: steady well-paying employment, wonderful wife and kids, etc. So as with you, being (probably) somewhere on the spectrum isn&#x27;t correlated with a crappy life.<p>But...<p>I&#x27;ve also had some unusual personality traits for my whole life, and I&#x27;ve really beaten myself up regarding them. Once I had a probably Asperger diagnosis, I felt like a tremendous weight was lifted. I no longer felt like I was uniquely messed up in those way. And maybe the subconscious logic is that if I&#x27;m part of a <i>cluster</i> of people with these idiosynchronies, maybe there&#x27;s an underlying physiological cause that&#x27;s somewhat out of my control, and therefore I&#x27;m less morally culpable for my atypical social failures.')
