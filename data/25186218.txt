Fourth-gen Macbook Pros were rather meh, coming after the much acclaimed 3rd-gen (not to mention the keyboard fiasco). 2012 MBPs are still sought after today; will anybody really look for a 2018 MBP in 2026?<p>&gt; Apple have successfully executed a bigger R&amp;D project than any PC manufacturer in history.<p>That&#x27;s a testament to the greatness of the open architecture, actually. No single PC manufacturer ever needed to innovate on the core HW, as they could reap the benefits of Intel&#x2F;Nvidia&#x2F;AMD&#x27;s R&amp;D. This allowed for cheaper PCs which penetrated our world much faster than the previous fragmented microcomputer offer. Granted, this also led to a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; wrt. stuff like trackpads and displays, but let&#x27;s also look at the bright side for a moment :)<p>&gt; As a result, the base model Macbook Air now offers objectively better value for money than any competing laptop, when considering just the basic metrics of performance, form factor and battery life.<p>Still, I agree with you on that. All benchmarks (not only from the magazines, but also those from tech Twitter) point to a paradigm shift in what people will expect from a PC a few years from now.')
