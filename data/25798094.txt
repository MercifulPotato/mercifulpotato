Not everyone cares about history and inequality here. The political right in America would love to integrate native people and don’t much care for native land rights.<p>Excuse my lacking knowledge about your country, but it seems like you are also conflating the general UK sentiment with labour supporters. Wasn’t brexit a direct response to immigration and cultural changes of the sort you said isn’t taken seriously? It certainly seemed that way to an outsider like me.<p>2) I think you hit the nail on the head when you said<p>&gt; I will say that in my experience isn&#x27;t true, at least if you&#x27;re looking on an individual level.<p>My take is that neither political party individuates in the way you are. A rich black man here, to the left, is black and therefore a member of an unprivileged minority who deserves help and further advantagement. To the right, he is rich and needs no help. Both parties generalize, but their heuristics for doing so are different.<p>3) I’m not sure our countries are so dissimilar! There has been much talk that Trump was a consequence of white fear of being a minority. Popular sentiment on the left is that those whites need to shut up and accept it. That sounds very similar to your example, with the minor difference of whites being nonnative in America. Google “the war on Christmas” for a silly example of how the American right feels culturally alienated by minority encroachment.')
