I say that as someone interested in their products.  Who would love to see a realistic competitor to CUDA.<p>AMDs linux support has been somewhere between no-assed to half-assed for the preceding decade.  I think they believed that the world will return to windows for everything.  That ship has sailed, long ago.  The point about CUDA being usable up&#x2F;down the HW stack is quite salient.  When I develop GPU things, I start on my laptop GTX1060.  Test on my deskside RTX2060, and run them on V100s.  Code is in Julia, C, Fortran, so it should work anywhere with good underlying library support.  I&#x27;ve got a zen laptop with integrated Radeon.  No dice, can&#x27;t do computing on it (yet).<p>AMDs function&#x2F;library support is nascent, and will take years to get to a viable point for many.<p>I am hoping ... hoping ... that AMD sees this as an opportunity long term, and not a short term expense that must provide immediate ROI.  SW ecosystems drive the HW purchases, but there is usually a lag of years before this engine really gets started.<p>AMD needs to be in this for the long haul.')
