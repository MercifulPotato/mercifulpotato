It was top notch and had great contracts with US and Russia at the moment. Decades later the retired goverment officials confirmed they were &quot;advised&quot; and said &quot;we did not understand what we were doing very much back then&quot;. Of course, they were ex-soviet middle level officials and anti soviet activists who suddenly found themselves in power and needed such advices.<p>The true reason for those who wonder was the fact that ALFA was making electronics for MiG, Su, Tu and for missiles. I had family and friends working there btw.')
