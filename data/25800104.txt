The team can safely share feedback and risk sharing our crazy ideas<p>- high degree of care for the craft. We hold each other accountable to quality<p>- ships, regularly, to real customers<p>- little status seeking - goes with emotional safety - few individuals on the team need to be “in charge” or hold arbitrary titles.<p>- the individuals are more than fairly compensated and the company shows their love for the team in big and small ways<p>- the team talks to their customer and has a lot of empathy for their problems. They want to be accountable to them<p>- the team has a lot of empathy for new team members and works hard to make on boarding easier<p>- some willingness to “get in trouble” with the broader org because you know what you’re doing is right ultimately for the customer<p>- high self starters: instead of complaining, people feel empowered to solve problems or prototype ideas without a permission structure<p>- not too much catering to “super stars”. 1-2 heros does not a team make, the senior people make it their job to lift everyone up. The team doesn’t obsess over their high performers.<p>There’s a lot more emphasis on emotional intelligence and  empathy in an effective team than on any specific process.')
