And management is used to using this with sales teams, everyone in sales is always competing with each other. It&#x27;s never fair, they&#x27;ll have unequal markets, for example, but the competition is incredibly motivating. When I was in sales long ago, the drive to be the best and regarded as such was even more motivating than just getting more commissions. It&#x27;s dog eat dog but for better or worse it works.')
