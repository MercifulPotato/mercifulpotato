In France they fined people who were outdoors on &quot;non-essential errands&quot;. That&#x27;s fucking insane. No one should be required to give up their right to take a walk in their own hometown. Forcing people to do that is Soviet-level authoritarianism.<p>It of course also sets a precedent. If the rulers can whip the masses into thinking a curfew to stop a virus is necessary, they surely can do it for other reasons again and again. Bye, bye right of assembly.')
