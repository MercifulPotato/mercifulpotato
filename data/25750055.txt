Don&#x27;t forget that there are many community contributors. As far as I&#x27;ve understood the LTS branch is closed for community contributions which makes sense since it would not be desireable to wait one year until these contributions would be accessible to other FOSS users; but this only applies to the LTS branch; the other branches are not affected.<p>&gt; <i>Qt 5 would be abandonware from a FOSS perspective, much like Qt 4</i><p>Well, I still have many active projects using Qt 4.4, 4.8 and 5.4; didn&#x27;t see any added value in upgrading. Maybe people using QML can profit of more recent versions, but I&#x27;m using the C++ API only with work mostly done by Trolltech and Nokia.')
