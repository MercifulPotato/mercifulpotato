They got classified intel, private phone calls with the president, numerous concessions, everything they could have possibly wanted in terms of foreign policy, including an abrupt and chaotic withdrawal from Syria where Russian troops literally took over American bases, and a significant number of GOP congressional representatives visiting Moscow on July 4th together, with no American press there to cover the event or tell us who they met with, what they discussed, or why they went.<p>There&#x27;s also evidence that Russia infiltrated the Treasury in 2015, unrelated to the election interference afterwards.<p>It&#x27;s been war for a long time, and we have not been winning.')
