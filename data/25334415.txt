Bikability too, which is a big feature of many European cities.<p>The language issue is real, though. It&#x27;s probably better, I think, to accept that you can&#x27;t speak the language, and to give yourself a break learning it. If you like it, and want to learn, and want to be able to deal with banks and mobile providers over the phone (extremely difficult without fluency, and computer translation tools won&#x27;t help you!), then take a class, and take it slowly.<p>It&#x27;s stressful enough to move overseas. My advice is not to add language on top of everything else you have to learn - you are lucky to speak English, so lean into that. (Many people will appreciate practicing their English with a native speaker, too - although some small minority will hate you for it.)<p>But yeah, don&#x27;t do what I did and try to do everything at once. It&#x27;s stressful, exhausting, and you never give yourself a chance to recover, mentally or emotionally, from the stress of learning. <i>Be kind to yourself</i>!')
