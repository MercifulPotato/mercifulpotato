And since Sweden&#x27;s numbers for this single cause of death are worse than its neighbours, it&#x27;s covid19 strategy is some sort of abysmal failure.<p>And yet, 2020 is currently on track to be the <i>third least deadly year ever</i> in recorded history in Sweden.<p>And yet, the total all-cause mortality rate in Sweden for 2020 is on track to be lower than its neighbour Denmark, higher than Norway, and about the same as Finland.<p>Because the most infurating thing about everyone&#x27;s obsession about covid19 death numbers is that people seem to have forgotten just how many people die every year from other causes. And there&#x27;s very little debate about how much suffering and death that the lockdowns themselves are causing. There&#x27;s no balance, no compromise, no trade-off, no proportions, only a myopic staring contest at a single cause of death across countries.')
