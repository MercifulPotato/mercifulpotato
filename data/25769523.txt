Item(by='godot', descendants=None, kids=[25770218], score=None, time=1610580851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767627, text='I&#x27;ve heard of the McDonald&#x27;s theory many years ago and I do somewhat agree that it works. But I&#x27;m not so sure that Seinfield for conversation-starting works in a similar way. I was an immigrant in the US from Asia. Even though that was almost 25 years ago and I&#x27;ve lived in the US for far longer than in Asia now, I&#x27;m still not familiar with Seinfield; and that&#x27;s the case for many other immigrants friends I know as well.<p>But take that idea further, I&#x27;m not even talking about Seinfield in particular. Let&#x27;s say we use any subject-X for this purpose of conversation-starting. I&#x27;m not a natural conversationist, and most conversations with acquaintances or strangers often end in awkward silences after a sentence or two. I&#x27;ve had great conversations sure, but usually it&#x27;s because they happen to touch on very specific topics that I really am interested in. In other words, I don&#x27;t really buy this whole idea that all you need to do is to start with a topic common enough, and the conversation flows. It just hasn&#x27;t been my experience.')
