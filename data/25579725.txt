The differences between ethnic groups starts early in childhood. It&#x27;s about the role models kids have. It&#x27;s about how much time their parents spend with them and how much they nag on them to study. It is totally fixable if we generally focus on promoting independent thinking, long-term planning and delayed gratification.<p>So besides not answering the question asked of you, you assert without sources that Black parents don&#x27;t give a shit about their kids&#x27; futures and that Black people can&#x27;t hold in their urges enough to plan for the future and think independently. I&#x27;m curious, how do you think they got through life to even apply at Coinbase in the first place without possesing any of those attribues? Humor me, did you acually even look up the CVs of the Black Coinbase employees? That would at least raise the standard of discussion from the realm of racial platitude.<p>&gt; Everyone can do this, it&#x27;s hard but absolutely possible. But instead, our society is trying to erase these values by penalizing those who were raised with them.<p>Wait, so these Black employees <i>didn&#x27;t</i> do &quot;this&quot; or possess the qualities you expouse? How did you find this out without resorting to common tropes about Black people?<p>&gt;. Like it or not, there are behavioral differences between men and women. I&#x27;m not saying one is better than the other, but there are differences, especially when it comes to risk-taking and multitasking.<p>OK, so could you explain how this extrapolates to working at Coinbase given the pay gap occured in the lowest rungs of positions according to the article? My guess is we&#x27;re not even talking positions that&#x27;re responsible for putting out &quot;web scale&quot; fires, much like how frontend devs at Google aren&#x27;t doing genius shit all day')
