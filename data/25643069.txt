There’s a bold text [1] “shall not be transported if return of spontaneous circulation is not achieved in the field”. There’s a pretty big difference between abandoning patients with little chance of survival in general, and giving up after failure to achieve ROSC.<p>Perhaps at some point we’ll be at the place where EMS really have to give up without even attempting CPR, but we’re not there yet.<p>That’s not saying the situation is not bad — it’s terrifyingly bad. But a headline designed to make incorrect impression just doesn’t help.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Pervaizistan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346295476405084168" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Pervaizistan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346295476405084168</a><p>EDIT: link, to focus on the right tweet. typo.')
