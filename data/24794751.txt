It has a Google Translate like GUI and lets you install packages to support translating between different languages.<p>It currently doesn&#x27;t have the ability to go to web services for translations you don&#x27;t have installed locally but that&#x27;s a feature I&#x27;m considering adding at some point. It would seem like the best way to do this we be to track (locally) which translations you use frequently and then save them locally (a one way translation package between two languages is ~100MB). This would give you the privacy&#x2F;offline access of translating locally for language pairs you frequently use, while also seamlessly supporting the large number of languages supported by cloud services. You could also give power users much more fine-grained control over which translations they keep saved locally.')
