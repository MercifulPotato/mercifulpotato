I write docs for a few public libraries and some users just want to get up and running quickly. They don&#x27;t have time or want to go through trial&#x2F;error and explore the nuances.<p>Maybe there should be a greater burden for the givers of advice to acknowledge the trade-offs in their &quot;best practices. Then again, answering a question with &quot;it depends&quot; can be a big turn off to some people, to the point where they stop listening&#x2F;reading and look elsewhere for help.')
