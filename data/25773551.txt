Maybe you should open your eyes.<p>I literally just asked you for evidence and you literally refused to give any. Then I asked you to stop spreading unsubstantiated claims. Somehow you are surprised at that reaction?<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3i9NknT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3i9NknT</a>\n&gt; This is the stuff which made it to the courtroom.<p>I could easily find similar posts on Facebook and Twitter. The questions are: how prevalent is this &amp; did Parler really not delete this stuff?<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t delete this shit because it&#x27;s their competitive advantage.<p>Parler claims to have deleted every single post reported by Amazon. You claim that they didn&#x27;t delete any of them. Do you have proof? It would be pretty weird for Parler to flat out lie on this point, so unless I see some evidence I&#x27;m going to assume Parler is (in this particular instance) telling the truth and you are lying.<p>&gt; If they don&#x27;t post threats and violent plots, there is no reason for them to exist.<p>You fail to imagine <i>any</i> other reason for Parler to exist other than for &quot;threats and violent plots&quot;? That&#x27;s so outlandish I don&#x27;t think you believe it yourself.')
