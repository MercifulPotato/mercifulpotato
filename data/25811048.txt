Item(by='cheph', descendants=None, kids=[25811191], score=None, time=1610895012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810870, text='Thanks for this, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audiobooksnow.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audiobooksnow.com&#x2F;</a> also looks like a good option for DRM free audiobooks. I think people should definitely vote with their wallets here as there are alternatives. I can find almost everything I want on downpour (and possibly audiobooksnow) and the monthly fee is lower than what I was paying at audible.')
