Election officials and workers would not risk their personal livelihood and jail time just to see their candidate maybe win. And if they would I believe they wouldn&#x27;t have stopped at just the president, but would have given House Democrats more seats. Then again this is all based on your delusional demonization of poll workers and election officials with no basis in reality. It honestly sounds like you&#x27;ve never voted in person or even volunteered to work at a polling center.')
