Thus it will fail with probability essentially 1.  Yet, I don&#x27;t want my programming language to force me to make an asymmetric distinction between the two cases.<p>By &quot;equally likely&quot; I don&#x27;t mean &quot;having equal probability to occur&quot;.  This is very difficult to model, and it will depend mostly on the usage patterns of the users of the program.  I mean that both cases are worth of the same attention and merit an equivalently serious treatment.  No need to disparage one of the two cases as an &quot;error&quot; or an &quot;exception&quot; and require a special language construct.')
