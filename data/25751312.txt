Rust features for the most part are orthogonal to each other, whereas C++ features tend to have weird interactions with each other that are really hard to track and understand. (The one place where Rust starts to get messier in terms of feature interactions is async Rust, but luckily you can program Rust just fine while ignoring the async features.)<p>Consider initialization: C++ has <i>dozens</i> of different ways of initializing objects that in turn interact in complicated ways with move semantics and references and so forth. Rust&#x27;s initialization story by contrast is straightforward: you just make the thing you want to make using struct or enum literals and maybe wrap those initializers in functions if you want.')
