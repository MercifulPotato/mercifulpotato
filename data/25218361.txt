Every service or utility is different, and every one of the various sub-functions of each has a different level of interaction with and or effect on human minds.  If measured on a black-to-white scale, each and every service&#x2F;utility as well as their various sub-functions would have intervals whose beginning and end points would be different shades of gray, so too would the lengths of their intervals.  This is further complicated by the fact that these ranges would be different for every person on the planet.  Whist the collective range of interactions and effects isn&#x27;t infinite, it is for all practical purposes.<p>What I am referring to is the net worldwide effect(s).  If you like, consider them integrands or areas under curves.<p>Again, this is made more complex by the fact that each service or utility has changed (and is still changing) over time.  Let me give you a simplistic but important example: operating systems.  The third operating system I had anything to do with was CP&#x2F;M.  It came self-contained and complete on one floppy.  There was no registration necessary and it didn&#x27;t dial home to Digital Research even with a completely unrestricted internet connection between the computer and D.R.  CP&#x2F;M&#x27;s primary purpose was to act as an &#x27;intermediate utility&#x27; to make it easier for users to load and run programs.  It did precious little else.<p>Now move to the other extreme.  Windows 10 purports still to be an operating system and the fact that it loads and runs <i>some</i> programs puts it into the category of operating systems.  I say <i>some</i> programs because Microsoft is now censoring what programs can be run, and from recent announcements this will become more restricted over time.  The next point is that Windows 10 secretly talks home on multiple fronts and these are all unknown to the user, in doing so it steals users&#x27; data and, to date, there&#x27;s no legislative process in any country that can stop Microsoft from collecting that information—information that can only be decoded by Microsoft.<p>The third point is that Windows uses&#x2F;allows advertising—even if you pay outright for Windows 10.  Fourth point is that with every new version of Windows, Microsoft deliberately obsoletes older technology so that it can increase profits by forcing users to upgrade hardware.  MS&#x27;s primary planned obsolescence mechanism is refusing to develop software drivers for old hardware for new versions of Windows as well as keeping essential internal system calls&#x2F;software interfaces&#x2F;HAL code etc. proprietary and secret (so third parties cannot them).  Microsoft, thus, is one of the biggest producers of e-waste in the world.  Again, there are no legislative mechanisms anywhere to stop Microsoft doing this.  Essentially, Microsoft is too big for politicians anywhere in the world to take it on, as the risks to their political careers are too great.  <i>Ipso facto</i>, effectively Microsoft is tampering with democracy, as politicians are too scared to act in the best interests of the citizenry.<p>My last point is that Microsoft takes it upon itself to experiment in social engineering, which it has done with almost every new version of Windows (the last six being the most influential).  That is, features and interfaces are changed at whim and these cause considerable disruption to users—not to mention that most are useless or are of little value—and if you consider the cost of retraining, maintenance, etc. worldwide then it accounts for millions and millions of wasted dollars, not to mention the enormous loss of human time and effort.  With Windows 10, the matter is made worse by the fact that users cannot turn off automatic upgrades, which means that new features and interfaces can be added or changed at will—often against users&#x27; wishes.<p>Moreover, this is not the end of it, Microsoft has conned AMD, Intel and Qualcomm to adopt its new Pluton security for Windows.  As with most security systems introduced by large manufactures in recent times, their introduction has more to do with ousting completion than it does with security, (this has been obvious to even to Blind Freddy for many years but again politicians aren&#x27;t game to touch it for reasons given above):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kFY0a_VOGbE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kFY0a_VOGbE</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Coming_War_on_General_Computation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Coming_War_on_General_Com...</a><p>…And that&#x27;s just the beginning, almost any half-witted observer could write books on the subject it&#x27;s so vast.  The facts are  that these changes and many others introduced by Big Tech have principally been driven by profit and with little or no oversight or for consideration of the effects on human users.  In effect, users are guinea pigs who haven&#x27;t given their permission.  This has to stop and only legislation can change things effectively.  Google&#x2F;Microsoft officials <i>&#x27;if you do this or that then we&#x27;ll lock you up&#x27;</i> would work absolute wonders.<p><i>REMEMBER:  What I&#x27;ve said about the progression from DR&#x27;s CP&#x2F;M to Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 10 all happened without users&#x27; permission! Moreover, because these huge companies have intimidated legislators to such a degree that even existing anti-monopoly laws haven&#x27;t been called into play, thus their products have had no effective competition. In effect, Windows is a de facto utility, and at law should be treated as such—effectively we should &#x27;nationalize&#x27; it by regulating it to the hilt.  Clearly that won&#x27;t begin with the US but perhaps some country brave enough or prepared to take on or ignore the WTO may eventually lead the way.</i>')
