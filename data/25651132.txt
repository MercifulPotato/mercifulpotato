There&#x27;s certainly a very wide range of ways to be charitable. For example, you could be charitable in this discussion by not lampooning those who disagree you as &quot;tunnel-vision engineer types.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d like to hear more specifically how you think people should approach charity. Surely some people actually should travel to Africa? And some should not.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re being sarcastic about quitting one&#x27;s job and traveling to Africa in a conversation about charity. It&#x27;s not an insane thing to do. The point I was trying to make was that not everybody can do it, and that some people can actually do more good by just being excellent at their current job.')
