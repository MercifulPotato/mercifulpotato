Potholes, cracks, and other physical deterioriation is part of their definition for poor condition.<p>Even going by your (I say extremely disingenuous) &quot;usable lifespan&quot; definition posted elsewhere, that is a gigantic bill about to come due that isn&#x27;t part of the current repair backlog with no plan for paying it off.<p>&gt; <i>The entire backlog of road projects is 90 million dollars which is ~15% of the annual budget. That&#x27;s not a sum that is going to bankrupt the city.</i><p>So we&#x27;ve established that the city spends 1&#x2F;20 of what is necessary to clear the current road maintenance backlog, that the backlog, as backlogs do, continues to grow as time goes on, that clearing the current backlog would take a substantial percentage of the entire city budget, that there are other costs that aren&#x27;t going anywhere that have to be paid regardless of how the city is arranged, that there&#x27;s much _much_ more to infrastructure than just paving roads, and that in order to pay for needed maintenance they&#x27;d have to increase taxes beyond what people can afford to pay and&#x2F;or cut other services.<p>And &quot;Making matters worse, in the next four years of the parish’s five-year capital outlay budget, the budget for any kind of roadwork — fixing existing roads or building new ones — is, quite literally, $0.&quot;<p>&gt; <i>A category 4 hurricane impacting water quality for some weeks is not evidence of poor infrastructure.</i><p>It absolutely is when hurricanes are expected, common, and known to be getting both more frequent and worse in the region. It&#x27;s quite well studied that development can make flooding better or worse. It&#x27;s why after Harvey there were so many &quot;Houston could and should have prevented this&quot; articles.<p>But here, no hurricane needed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theadvocate.com&#x2F;acadiana&#x2F;news&#x2F;article_701ae113-a8bb-5c3a-af18-8916603dd68f.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theadvocate.com&#x2F;acadiana&#x2F;news&#x2F;article_701ae113-a...</a><p>&quot;But each time it’s rained over the past year, the untreated sewage spills into the backyards and creates a mucky lake over the grass that blocks the pathway and causes a serious stench, Hornung said. The contaminated sludge spills into the coulee that drains into the Vermilion River.<p>Although the families alerted the city about the problem, its patchwork attempts to fix it — first, by extending the manhole covers above ground to relieve some of the pressure, and second, by bolting the manholes shut — only pushed the eruptions further down the sewer lines to neighboring properties, Hornung said.&quot;<p>&quot;Some downtown Lafayette employees also were recently requesting relief after the same downpours that caused the sewage overflows near Girard Park caused some downtown storm water drains — which flow into different pipelines than those that carry sewage beneath the city — to overflow above the sidewalks and into their businesses near the corner of Jefferson and Convent streets.&quot;<p>And here, no hurricane needed: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;115&#x2F;9&#x2F;2078" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;115&#x2F;9&#x2F;2078</a><p>&quot;Here, we show that health-based drinking water quality violations are widespread, with 9–45 million people possibly affected during each of the past 34 years.&quot;<p>&quot;in a given year, about 7–8% of [community water systems] report at least one health-based violation.&quot;<p>&quot;In 2015, 9% of CWSs in our study sample violated health-based water quality standards, affecting nearly 21 million people. During each of the past 34 y, 9–45 million people were affected, representing 4–28% of US population.&quot;')
