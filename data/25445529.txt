The problem is that people are not really approaching wasm as an operating system or shared platform.  Rather they are making piecemeal efforts and adding little bits of functionality in here and there in different runtimes etc.<p>So so far it seems a missed opportunity to create a framework where people can collaborate on what the platform is.  Something like a common ABI.  Or a distributed package registry.  Or a voting  mechanism for new features.<p>We should have a new shared platform built on web assembly.  And for the information distribution part, drop CSS and HTML and start over with content-centric networking and markdown.  Focus on instant retrieval and pre-dissemination.')
