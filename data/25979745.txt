It would probably be best with a pair who are equally motivated whether they would be getting the half million apiece or not, because a lot of that could be spent by now.<p>When everyone creating the software has the rare extreme performance ability that very few companies ever get to have even one employee that good, the more suitable the performance the fewer operators it should be expected to require.<p>This just has to be put into perspective compared to what you can get from a typical bureaucratic team for $44 million.<p>Average bureaucrats have never been good enough for average things.')
