I have some merino wool boxer briefs, which are utterly soft and comfortable. They&#x27;re made from organic mulesing-free wool, which is what you should be looking for, if at all possible.<p>I also have some military surplus (Finnish M65) wool pants, which are made primarily for warmth and durability, not so much for soft comfort. Even after a sorely-needed rejuvenation with lanolin, they are still made from thick and somewhat coarse wool, which is obviously better for winter pants than silky soft merino.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t find wool to be annoyingly scratchy. While I certainly do feel it a little bit when I put on a coarse wool flannel shirt before it warms to my body temperature, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I know some people absolutely can&#x27;t stand it, but I don&#x27;t think anyone would have issues with good merino.')
