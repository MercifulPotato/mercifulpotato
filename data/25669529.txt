Just that decentralization is a prerequisite for something to avoid complete control by a single party long term.<p>A better example would be HTTP&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;JS. Sure it is not perfect and protocol updates are hard and slow due to endless implementations but we got a working decentralized internet out of the deal that is very hard for any single party to take over now, so I call that worth it over a single party enforcing proprietary protocols like AOL having a total monopoly.')
