I wonder why, maybe because anyway the society is patriarchal so there is not much difference between this field to others unlike in the west where all misogynist white males concentrate in this profession and all the good guys go to law or acting or wherever there are many women and everything is equal and rosy. But then you have to wonder why would those Arab women want to move to a horrible place like the western tech industry instead of removing their shackles and becoming a nurse in a hospital or work in HR of a big corporation, the places where women feel comfortable and equal in the west. It is a bit of a mystery.')
