Maybe there are exceptions, but the ones I saw in that ended up with negative points were unsubstantive and often inflammatory. Please stop posting like that to HN, and make more of an effort to stick to the intended use of the siteâ€”thoughtful, informative conversation on topics of intellectual curiosity, avoiding flamebait. Do that and the downvote issue should go away. If it doesn&#x27;t, you can email us at that point: hn@ycombinator.com. But please don&#x27;t compound the guidelines breakage by posting like you did here.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
