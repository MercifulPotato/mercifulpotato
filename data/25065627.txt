No vendor lock in. I canâ€™t lose access to my notes because of random account bans or the company going under or w&#x2F;e. Also plain markdown, no nonsense proprietary formats.<p>2. Platform independence, I work across mac&#x2F;windows&#x2F;ios on home and work.<p>So I ended up using a git repo with markdown files. I use Noteable and Typora on mac&#x2F;win. No need to import&#x2F;export anything they both work with plain markdown files on the fs with tags as markdown front matter (I sync manually with git). For mobile I use GitJournal which basically has the same features and it can automatically sync with a git repo.')
