The rebrandings never changed the &quot;Gen X&quot; part.<p>That&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t understand: Why go with both minor versions and the Gen&#x27;s in a single name?\nThey could have just retroactively rebranded USB 3.0 to USB3 Gen1, and then went USB3 Gen2, USB3 Gen3 for the 3.1 and 3.2 specs (2×2 is another mess [1]).\nTech people would have understood that the specs are 0-indexed and the marketing names (GenX) are 1-indexed. Consumers would only see the Gen on ports, cables and devices.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t even understand why hiding the raw speed number from consumers is so important: Short Numbers are always better than vagely similar marketing names:\n- USB3 (5Gb)\n- USB3 (10Gb)\n- USB3 (20Gb)\n- USB3 (40Gb) or (2×20Gb)\nDone.<p>[1] The final page of this Anandtech article is pretty spot on about Gen2×2:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16133&#x2F;usb-32-gen-2x2-state-of-the-ecosystem-review&#x2F;8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16133&#x2F;usb-32-gen-2x2-state-of...</a>')
