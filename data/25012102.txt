Even super conductors have a far greater resistance for an electron than a room full of air would on a the flow of a photon. If I had to venture the guess I would say we mastered the electron as we could control and produce it very easily, we have just begin to explore the exotic nature of photons and the potential impacts on technology they may hold')
