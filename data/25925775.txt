There is the communication overhead to deal with. Even when things go well this consumes time. When it doesn&#x27;t: more time. Then there&#x27;s of course the constant arguing and bickering over what is best; more people means more opinions on this. And of course the more people you have the more complexity gets introduced. Conway&#x27;s law is a thing.<p>The benchmark for me is what I think I can pull off in a few days vs. what I would build with a whole team in a few months. You can build a lot in a weekend. But not not with a whole team around you questioning every move. So, when I need quick results, I give the right people a lot of freedom and not too many distractions and see what happens.<p>I&#x27;m building a new webapp for a startup with a few people since three weeks. We&#x27;re launching with customers next month. That involves a lot of pragmatic decision making and taking on a few risks. Most of the hard choices were made in the first week and at this point the app is starting to look alright.<p>Here&#x27;s what we did not do: we had no designers involved. We also had no lengthy meetings about what features we were going to have. We&#x27;re patching up our existing backend and adding some new features to it.<p>Otherwise, it&#x27;s an emergency rebuild of an app that just wasn&#x27;t good enough (wrong mobile platform, developer is out of the picture, and it&#x27;s a lot of technical debt and stability issues). I took the decision in December and gave our inexperienced frontend person some guidance to investigate the technologies I picked for him. By December we had a clear idea that this was doable. January we started doing this. That&#x27;s 3 weeks ago. By now it&#x27;s largely done. We&#x27;re adding a few missing features and then we have an MVP that will run on IOS, Android and the web.<p>If I had a few million, I could not do this any faster. But I&#x27;d be able to ship beautifully native apps six months later. If fast is a goal, keep your team lean.')
