The language itself is horrible (which is why I prefer to use another language for complex back-end computation). Libraries for reading and writing formatted data are a joke (try reading a large XML or JSON file; or even a large CSV file with a mix of numeric and string fields); etc., etc.<p>But it is just <i>so</i> good for visualization that I am willing to suffer its other problems. For example, try the below and zoom in &#x2F; out &#x2F; resize in both MATLAB and Octave:<p>n = 2000000; x = rand(1, n); y = rand(1, n); plot(x, y, &#x27;.&#x27;)')
