A search [1] pulls up several examples of these claims. Some of the photos make it pretty hard to give police the benefit of the doubt (as far as whether journalists and protesters are hard to tell apart).<p>Even still, what we have is a situation where people were attacked and permanently injured by police. For example, Linda Tirado was permanently blinded in her left eye from police shooting a less lethal foam bullet. A photo of the officer aiming at her [2] leaves little doubt that he intended to shoot her.<p>In my mind, that leaves two possibilities: journalists were regularly physically attacking police officers, or police officers— unprovoked— attacked and maimed journalists covering the situation. Neither of these should be true in any capacity.<p>This is, of course, to step over the other oft-repeated claims by protesters that police were responsible for most of the violence. Given that the protests were largely due to police violence, this doesn&#x27;t paint the situation in a better light.<p>[1] Setting region to US may return better results: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=protest+police+targeted+journalists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=protest+police+targeted+journalist...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startribune.com&#x2F;photographer-sues-says-officers-blinded-her-in-eye-with-nonlethal-shot-during-mpls-unrest&#x2F;571266322&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startribune.com&#x2F;photographer-sues-says-officers-...</a>')
