The electoral college process still serves us better than a simple majority would.<p>I agree there are possibly better ways, possibly force choice ranking, etc. But all a simple majority vote would do would be to ensure we would become a one-party system, the opposite direction we should be headed (a multiple-party system).<p>Having it be controlled by the states is a great testing bed for that, for example, in Maine. There&#x27;s no reason to take that power away from states and make it federal.<p>IANAL, but my interpretation is that the part that is in the constitution is that it is up to the individual states to decide how to run their elections and assign electoral votes.')
