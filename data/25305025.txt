A blocking call on a socket doesn&#x27;t make a blocking system call, thus permitting the carrier OS thread to go do something else. As for file I&#x2F;O, things are a bit messy. Older linux kernels don&#x27;t support &quot;true&quot; async file I&#x2F;O, and the Java NIO async file channels do use thread pools to emulate async behavior in that case.')
