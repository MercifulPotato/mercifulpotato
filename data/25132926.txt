BMP turned out to be not even barely enough even by Unicode 3.0 [1] where the initial set of Unicode emoji (722 characters) would barely fit in the undesignated area of BMP. Many important characters, starting from a larger set like CJKV and eventually to almost everything by Unicode 6.0 [2], got allocated in SMP and SIP instead as a result. HKSCS additions in the CJK Unified Ideograph Extension B block (U+20000..2A6FF) are notable examples.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicode.org&#x2F;roadmaps&#x2F;bmp&#x2F;bmp-3-0.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicode.org&#x2F;roadmaps&#x2F;bmp&#x2F;bmp-3-0.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicode.org&#x2F;roadmaps&#x2F;bmp&#x2F;bmp-6-0-0.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unicode.org&#x2F;roadmaps&#x2F;bmp&#x2F;bmp-6-0-0.html</a>')
