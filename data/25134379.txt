It is just an habit and meaningless difference, that is all.<p>&gt; This is one example, it has rules because those are effective at communicating. How can you just write it off like that? With no reason other then you think it doesn&#x27;t count?<p>Researchers and their papers are not effective at communicating. That a thing that researches complain about periodically.<p>In any case, corporate mail is not research paper. Among other things, it is supposed to be significantly shorter.
