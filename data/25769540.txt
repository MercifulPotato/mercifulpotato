It feels like they are written for a completely different type of person and very rarely do they focus on practical applications of something.<p>My only experience before Phoenix was Django, and I have to say, even though it took a little while to wrap my head around Phoenix, it was about the same time it took to get my head around Django.  Once I did, I found Pheonix to be more expressive and exceedingly productive.')
