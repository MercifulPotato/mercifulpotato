Some things I am really interested in can be smashed out at home with no problems. But boring work is a chore unless I&#x27;m at the office where I can get my mind to say &quot;you&#x27;re at work, you&#x27;re getting paid for this&quot;. I can do boring work well at work, whereas at home I wanna do anything just to get it out of my face.<p>Not only that, for some people the commute is 1h each way and for others it&#x27;s 10 minutes. So some people don&#x27;t see the issue with going into the office every day.<p>And unless <i>everyone</i> is going to work from home, if you&#x27;re someone working from home but most other people are in the office then that can stifle your career development for internal promotions. Like it or not, the managers and higher ups will be in the office, it&#x27;s easier to get to know someone in the office, it&#x27;s easier to get inside knowledge on what&#x27;s going on, what projects are happening, etc. I work for a company who has remote developers and none of them are leading anything or have any sort of significant power to influence decisions. They are just man power to get work done, even if that is wrong, that&#x27;s how it is and I don&#x27;t see it changing.<p>For as long as this is the case I don&#x27;t see fully remote working as a viable career choice. I would only do it for a company which is all remote or all software dev is remote.')
