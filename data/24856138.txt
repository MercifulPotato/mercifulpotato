Shoot for 2.5 to 3.5 liters a day maximum. If you do this for any prolonged period of time, or multiple weeks in a row, you&#x27;re going to have issues.<p>Source? Or what kind of issues? I average 5~8 l on a normal day and have been for years. The few times I&#x27;ve had my values checked they were mostly fine, apart from the lab being hassled by the huge sample they got for my 24h urine. Naturally I have a bit higher salt intake than most.')
