It runs in a jail and dumps my files to the local, shared filesystem as a result. I also put the nextcloud clients on my phone so that my photos auto-upload to my NAS vs google photos. It&#x27;s been quite nice to be able to just drop files to it, right click, then share someone a link to those files.')
