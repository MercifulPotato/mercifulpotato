I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to commit any development resources of their own, but I&#x27;d think it would be in their interest to (A) provide Marcan with some documentation and (B) make an engineer available to answer occasional questions.<p>Apple makes money selling hardware, and Linux support will sell more hardware. Perhaps not much more, but for a commensurately low amount of effort. What does Apple gain by forcing Marcan to reverse engineer everything?')
