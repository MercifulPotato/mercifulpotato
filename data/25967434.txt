Remember quite a few articles from spring about that. 3rd world countries having no chance of receiving what was agreed upon.<p>I mean I understand, when SHTF its everybody for themselves and fuck the rest. I guess in some twisted view a human nature. But I really have to severely twist it and leave any morals behind the door.
