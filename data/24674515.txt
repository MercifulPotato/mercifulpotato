We live in a changing world, especially at some periods, and what we need is adaptation of agreements to new ways of life propelled by increasing possibilities, from tech and quality of life.<p>There are places for conservatism, stemming from slowly changing human nature, but for now it looks more like an exception than the rule.<p>Popular vision of conservatism is hardly defendable today. Real - real - conservatives today would be progressives. AOC, Sanders, this kind. Not because they propose sticking with non-working mechanisms - they don&#x27;t - but because they correctly see the ideas, intents of rules proposed for society - at times when changes weren&#x27;t that stark.<p>Edit: this is an opinion.')
