Item(by='_tulpa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607545663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363730, text='&gt; ... easier to regulate one giant company than a myriad of smaller ones<p>This sounds... incorrect.<p>Small players are much more vulnerable to fines and other penalties which range from &#x27;cost of doing business&#x27; to &#x27;slap on the wrist&#x27; for the big guys. And small ones don&#x27;t seem to have much in the way of lobbying power or other direct influence over regulators.<p>Maybe more accurate to say that it&#x27;s a bit harder to police lots of small players, but also that  it&#x27;s <i>only</i> the small players who produce good behaviour under regulation.')
