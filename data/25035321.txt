As such, producers and supply chains don&#x27;t have to go to the same extremes (breeding them to be tough rather than flavorful&#x2F;picking them completely green) to get them to the supermarket shelf intact.<p>Similarly, canned tomatoes taste great[1] because they are picked ripe and packaged.<p>[1] Canned tomatoes have a slight cooked taste so they&#x27;re never going to taste fresh, but are great in anything you&#x27;re going to cook.')
