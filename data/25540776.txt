There is a gaping hole in the side of the building, though how much damage was done isn&#x27;t known. Some services were affected before they had to cut the generators, per some reports. Internet and cellular is still down, and our DirecTV local channels went black right when they cut the power. I suspect they redirected that because it came back an hour later well before cellular and internet.')
