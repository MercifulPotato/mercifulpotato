Social media has enabled a massive avalanche of misinformation, and of this massive avalanche of misinformation, some subset of that new avalanche gets removed.<p>The net effect is that there much more misinformation than there has ever been before. Despite the best efforts of twitter, facebook &amp; youtube they appear to have been virtually powerless to halt the spread.<p>The problem of social media CEOs having too much power is real, and has wrought real damage: Zuckerberg&#x27;s naive ideas on speech have lead to far too much harm, and now that he&#x27;s recovering from his free speech trutherism and implementing reforms it&#x27;s too little, too late.<p>Lastly I would say that if you are looking at this state of affairs and seeing 1984 or fahrenheit 451, you&#x27;re seeing things wrong. There are fair examples of that, e.g. Hong Kong, mainland China. But the western internet doesn&#x27;t fit that at all.')
