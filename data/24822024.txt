Maybe I just process sound very differently.<p>Earplugs succeed at exactly one task: attenuating dangerous sound levels down to comfortable ones. The don&#x27;t reduce the amount of information. A 30dB conversation is exactly as distracting as a 60dB conversation. I also have custom fitted IEMs that provide similar attenuation. These are equally useless when disconnected. You still need masking sound. You just need less of it.<p>In a quiet environment, earplugs amplify the sounds of my own body. I hear my heart beating. I hear fluid sloshing around. I hear very prominent vibrations from anywhere my head is shifting relative to the pillow. I&#x27;d have to work pretty hard to design a more unsettling sleep-deprivation apparatus than earplugs.<p>None of this is remotely as useful as an actually quiet room with a box fan running.')
