In 2013&#x2F;2014 I was super excited about mesos and then kubernetes came out. Having worked at Google, seeing this thing come out it was clear from the get go it would win. But if you&#x27;re a startup with millions in funding running at 100mph you can&#x27;t stop. It&#x27;s impossible to course correct immediately and you shouldn&#x27;t. You have to see it play out in the market. Even in hopes that you can continue to establish a strong business. In this case kubernetes ate everyone&#x27;s lunch including mesosphere. It&#x27;s sad. It&#x27;s really sad to be a technologist who works on something for years only for that to become irrelevant when something comes out that takes the market in a different direction. And this gets published even harder when every cloud provider starts using open source as a marketing and distribution channel. I experienced this with grpc. My original project is now no longer a company maintained effort but instead a side project once more and it&#x27;s even been renamed. The perils of going up against Google. The only saving grace is to solve the same problem but in a different way. E.g move ontop being a &quot;platform&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sad for Ben, Tobi and Flo but that&#x27;s the game and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t go your way.')
