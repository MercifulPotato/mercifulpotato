When Steve Jobs was at NeXT, he was quoted numerous times bashing C++ as having &#x27;dead objects&#x27; while pointing out that ObjC objects were &#x27;alive&#x27;. One seldom needs to make use of swizzling, but when you do need it, it&#x27;s an awesome capability.<p>As prabhatjha pointed out in another comment in this thread, swizzling was used to automatically capture networking calls just by adding our framework to your app and initializing it. You could then log into our app&#x27;s web-based dashboard and see stats about networking calls (counts, latency, errors, etc.). This simple and elegant solution would not have been possible with C++. We also supported Android at the time (Java), and the developer was required to change his code to call our networking wrapper calls to get the same tracking for their Android apps.')
