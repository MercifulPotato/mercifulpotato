There is something about his YouTube content I don&#x27;t personally enjoy. It&#x27;s a little hard to articulate, but to me it feels cheesy. I understand his schtick is creating overengineered solutions to life&#x27;s little annoyances, but his on-screen persona seems put on to me. I get the sense he&#x27;s a super talented guy who also has an amazing crew and network of friends. I just don&#x27;t have a swimming pool or access to a trillion orbeez, so perhaps I am more drawn to normal engineers making youtube videos about them hacking on their raspberry pi.')
