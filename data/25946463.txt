I could imagine some kind of nonlinear steering response system that could handle it.<p>However, in my experience with them as a Tesla Model Y owner, I don&#x27;t trust Tesla to do it right. My Tesla&#x27;s rain-sensing wipers are the worst rain-sensing wipers I&#x27;ve ever owned. To the point where my Tesla wipers are normally kept OFF instead of &#x27;Auto&#x27; as I have had it in my BMW, Porsche and Volvo cars. I have to manually adjust wipers in the Tesla. Also, the FSD package makes the cruise control usable about 50% of the time. The rest of the time CC is worse than my 1982 Chevrolet Camaro. I could go on, but my point is made.<p>The only Tesla technology I&#x27;m impressed with is the motors and battery. That&#x27;s what I bought it for, that&#x27;s what I expected to get, and beyond that the car hasn&#x27;t impressed me. So I won&#x27;t give them benefit of the doubt with any new technology. They still can&#x27;t get wipers or cruise control right, so why should I?')
