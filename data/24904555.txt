I&#x27;ve had a lot of hassles with Twitter locking my new accounts because I don&#x27;t have a phone number to give them. Fortunately support has always been able to help me out so far. It probably helps that I have a long history of responsible behavior with various accounts.<p>As my educational presence has grown online, I&#x27;ve had several ideas for things I&#x27;d like to teach or build that involve Twitter&#x27;s API, but I can&#x27;t join their dev program without a number and they don&#x27;t accept the one I have. Given you lost your whole account over it, maybe I&#x27;m lucky I haven&#x27;t been able to link a number.<p>The entire idea of requiring a legacy phone number to use online apps is both a huge step backwards and exclusionary towards anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a stable number due to frequent travel or other reasons.')
