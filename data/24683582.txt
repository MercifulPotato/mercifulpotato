Tesla have to compete with the entire world&#x27;s car industry including companies that have much more experience selling cars at that scale. Is it impossible, no, is it unlikely yes - Tesla will grow from now but I just can&#x27;t see that P&#x2F;E turning into cold hard cash.<p>Tesla sold 367,500 vehicles last year, Ford sold about 5,387,000. In other words, Ford sold almost 15 times as many cars as Tesla in 2019, which is a significant difference in scale.<p>Fast forward to Q3 this year. Ford sold 551,796 vehicles (sales down significantly due to the pandemic). Tesla sold 139,300 (sales <i>up</i> significantly despite the pandemic). They are now just a factor of <i>four</i> apart.<p>And that&#x27;s just vehicles; Tesla is really an energy company, don&#x27;t forget. The battery and solar parts of their business are just getting started.<p>The P&#x2F;E is extreme, but given how well Tesla is executing, and how steep their growth trajectory is, perhaps it&#x27;s not so crazy after all...')
