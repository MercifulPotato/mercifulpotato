Although the 3090 theoretically falls behind the V100, Titan V and Titan RTX in terms of pure mixed-precision matrix math, in practice the 3090 still performs better on almost all workloads.<p>So maybe not 100% designed for ML, but better than anything else out there unless you want to sell a kidney.')
