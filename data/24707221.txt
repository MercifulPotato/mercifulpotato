If I use wealth to teach you how to drive a truck or learn to program, that’s growing value inside a person. That person became stronger, and in the eyes of society, more meritorious for some tasks.<p>Merit is due to many things, and mentorship, experimentation, and preparation are all parts of it. Medical training is also very expensive and part of medical merit, but also clearly entangled in discussions of money, opportunity, and growing inequity.<p>If you have hidden biological talent but never trained as a doctor due to wealth, should we trust you now to perform medicine? Not before that expensive prep; it’s part of merit.')
