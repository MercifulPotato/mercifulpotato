When you&#x27;re in a dominant position, free speech doesn&#x27;t threaten you. Or at least, you think it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Few free speech advocates think you should be free to call for violence. That&#x27;s free speech that does threaten them. Speech that calls for discrimination against groups they don&#x27;t belong to, however, is perfectly fine -- they know that they&#x27;re too important to be threatened by it.<p>So practically all self-described free speech advocates do put limits on free speech, and there aren&#x27;t any True Scotsmen.')
