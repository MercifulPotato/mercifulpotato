Packages have a terrible habit of setting dependencies on one or two of the &quot;modules,&quot; which wind up bringing the whole thing along with them. Sure, you can &quot;disable&quot; it after the fact, but then you&#x27;re left with a system that will break in fun and exciting ways when something a package you requested wants isn&#x27;t available.<p>If you don&#x27;t want systemd, your only option at this point is also-ran distros.')
