So, each one was more meaningful. Sure, they weren&#x27;t much more interactive. But the Witcher is mostly about going around clearing up the dangers of each place. Monsters were the focus, and they were far more distinctive than Cyberpunk NPC&#x27;s shooting at you. So, it&#x27;s not like the Witcher 3 was far more interactive or anything, but NPCs had their place and gave the world life. Cyberpunk doesn&#x27;t manage to strike that balance. And you can&#x27;t strike that balance by writing more for each NPC in such a densely populated world, so you need to cover for it with better AI, responses to events, emerging events, randomness... cover with more diverse content... or innovate. GTA V, to mention an example (although I&#x27;m not particularly interested in GTA games), has better NPC AI, better responses to events and decent diversity. In Cyberpunk, as a watcher it might look really beautiful, but as a participant it doesn&#x27;t have as much life. I still think the writing is great and many side quests are great and there&#x27;s a lot of great content, but hopefully this helps you see a bit better what people feel is off in the game (besides the bugs, of course). Like, don&#x27;t compare by looking at single factors one by one, look at the world as a whole.')
