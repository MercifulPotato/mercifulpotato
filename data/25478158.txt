But who cares, if a function communicates it&#x27;s point it doesn&#x27;t matter whether I prefixed &#x27;get&#x27; to it or not. It&#x27;s completely irrelevant. I&#x27;m saying that a 20 word function or a 10 word function doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it communicates the point clearly. You say Many function names can be slashed in half and I say there&#x27;s no need to slash any of those functions in half. There&#x27;s no point other then this ocd need to come up with the most elegant name in the universe.<p>But my argument goes even deeper then that because in fact humans cannot apply the logic you presented to other languages outside of programming.<p>Take this function name:<p><pre><code>   get_the_amount_of_water_in_the_bucket\n</code></pre>\nThe function name is grammatically correct, but it offends your eyes because of all the wordy and unnecessary information I totally get it.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is if I tried to communicate the same concept to you in english you aren&#x27;t complaining?<p><pre><code>  Get the amount of water in the bucket. \n</code></pre>\nActually let&#x27;s apply your logic to English let&#x27;s make it more concise and save screen space and make it less verbose.<p><pre><code>   Bucket water amount. \n</code></pre>\nYou have a task for your friend to get that water amount and instead of saying a proper sentence you point at the bucket and say the above. Efficient yes, but your friend now thinks you have brain damage.<p>Therin lies the contradiction because for some irrational reason humans actually prefer the verbose form of english communication over conciseness in code.<p>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to have some proper grammer or unnecessary adjectives in an english sentence and it doesnt hurt your programming language either.<p>That is my point. Profile_list vs list_of_profiles doesn&#x27;t matter. Both are understandable. Maybe your version saves memory but who cares. It doesnt do any logical damage to the code. You only want to shorten things because of ocd because clearly no such desire exists when people write things in grammatically correct English.')
