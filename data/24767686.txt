While hand writing traditional Chinese is harder, more complicated characters are made of other characters with a related meaning. Consequently, you can guess what the word means. Conversely with simplified, there less sub characters, so there&#x27;s a lot of lost context. Easier to write by hand is also not so much of an advantage anymore given computers.<p>If you&#x27;re going to learn to read or write, learn traditional. It&#x27;s easy to read simplified, but not so great the other way around.')
