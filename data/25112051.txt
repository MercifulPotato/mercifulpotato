We also don&#x27;t know the numbers for that population for these vaccines.<p>I worry also for the times during which there are not enough vaccines for everybody who is willing to get one. And also for the times when the immunity by those vaccinated vanes -- in other vaccines that also happens faster among those who are older. These numbers we can&#x27;t have now anyway, that will by definition take much more time.')
