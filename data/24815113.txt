Every time I read about a funded startup, I heard words like &quot;VCs&quot;, &quot;valuations&quot;, &quot;pitch decks&quot;, &quot;exit strategy&quot;.<p>I always see a lack of words like &quot;growth channels&quot;, &quot;getting users&quot;, and most importantly, &quot;paying customers&quot;.<p>If you compare forums like IndieHackers vs. StartupGrind, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;re in totally different industries. Although in reality the goal is same: Make the startup &quot;successful&quot;.<p>Though it seems they define &quot;success&quot; differently, and the problem starts from there.<p>Would appreciate if anyone enlightens me on this issue.')
