I think aaronsw could have done the same except he had bad luck and wasn&#x27;t in a strong place at a critical time. I don&#x27;t hold the prosecutors responsible for Aaron&#x27;s suicide any more than I hold myself responsible for not publicly doing more to help him. From my conversations and dealings with aaron, I believe he was willing to die for his ideas, which were correct and true and just. I hope to god someday we can build the world he envisioned where everyone, regardless of wealth or location or creed, has access to the world&#x27;s best knowledge and information.')
