Rents are high in cities because of highly paid workers who are capable of paying those rents. Now the middle class is priced out because their wages have been stagnant despite highly paid workers reliably getting raises. Either wages for the middle class has to go up dramatically, or rents have to crash, and rents aren&#x27;t going to crash if the whole reason why they went up is because demand from highly paid workers, who haven&#x27;t gone away. Something will have to give, people can&#x27;t live in their parents house or commute 3 hours one way forever.')
