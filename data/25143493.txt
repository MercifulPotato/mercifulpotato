Item(by='ericol', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605739044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137202, text='TL;DR. If you plan on giving a child a phone, make it very clear that it&#x27;s not &quot;her&quot; phone - just as like with cars when they are learning to drive - and that you are lending it for certain activities, and that you can impound it whenever you feel like, for whatever reason. Also, that they should expect a certain level of privacy invasions.<p>I have 3 daughters from my first marriage (ranging from 26 y&#x2F;o to 2). When they were growing up I was a single father, and their phones went from brick-like nokias to Androids in the time it takes you to snap your fingers.<p>At the time I didn&#x27;t give it much thought, and when I realized what was going on the harm was done. I really wish I&#x27;d knew better; I should had.<p>My youngest daughter is 7 now, from my 2nd marriage. And phones in particular and technology in general is something I give a lot of thought, and have discussed at length with my partner (Thankfully, we&#x27;re on the same wavelength here).<p>She is also really creative; she was learning violin before lockdown, and while in lockdown besides her violin classes, she took singing and piano lessons (Obviously, at the level a 7 y&#x2F;o can take then over Zoom &#x2F; Meet).<p>We only let her watch around 1 hour of TV per day. Being strict here is a constant struggle, but we keep it more around that amount of time.<p>She also plays with the computer (Or phone, or tablet) &quot;only&quot; 1 hour a day, with the tablet or phone restricted to only weekends, and a particular game - Star Wars Battlefront - only 2 days a week.<p>Besides that, something that we haven&#x27;t been able to manage - namely because it can go from 15 minutes a day to several hours - is phone usage for video calls. But I have to admit that I struggle here because I don&#x27;t have a decided opinion regarding what to do here. She does sometimes hour + video calls with her grandmother on the mother side; they are very close, and due to COVID she haven&#x27;t seen her since February - she lives 1500 Km away, with travel almost impossible in this country (Argentina) - when usually she would travel frequently, say every two months. Same happens with her friends that she hardly sees nowadays. and I gotta reckon that the video calls are usually on the creative side, for instance with a friend that lives in the same town as my MIL they would play using local toys similar to legos.<p>Both my wife and I dread the time when we&#x27;ll eventually have to give her a phone,because just like TV and tablets and computers, it&#x27;s going to be a constant struggle, made worst by the &quot;but my friends do it &#x2F; have it&quot; line of reasoning.<p>As we do want to be prepared for this, what we decided is that, would the moment arrive, we are not going to give her &quot;her phone&quot;. We are going to lend her a phone, that is not going to be hers, and she will be allowed to use under certain circumstances. And we would have the right to inspect that phone whenever we fell like it.<p>The reasoning here is that from our point of view, having a phone is not very different from having a car. If you would not give a 10 y&#x2F;o a car, why would you give her a phone in an uncontrolled way?<p>Wish us luck.')
