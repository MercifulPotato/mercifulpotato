I don’t care if this is true or not — someone is dead and people that knew that person (including many on HN) are grieving. Surely, the judgment-filled “how’s” from someone who created an account just to rip on a dead person can wait. If you’re too much of a coward to put this under your usual username or even own it under your full name, that’s a sign to me that this sort of comment doesn’t belong here.')
