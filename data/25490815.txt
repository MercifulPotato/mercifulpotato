It&#x27;s easy to go wild in simulation and think you can flip in and out of positions. But if you&#x27;re a retail trader (and in this context, by that I mean &quot;not connected directly to the exchanges, at the minimum&quot;)<p>* Not taking into account the impact of your own trading on markets. This is obviously impossible to really simulate. Sometimes you can ignore it (if there&#x27;s enough liquidity) but I&#x27;ve seen trades that looked great on paper and when trading at small-ish sizes, but then when you try to crank it up and do more volume, prices run away from you.<p>Obviously, there is money to be made in algo trading. It&#x27;s big business and obviously not everyone is doing crazy latency sensitive stuff- there are quant trades that you could probably do with execution available to retail traders. And honestly I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some retail traders manage it. But I will say that I think for an individual, it&#x27;s not worth the effort even if you are ones of the ones who can consistently make a profit. Just buy sp500 ETFs and sit on them and do something else with your time.')
