Item(by='rzwitserloot', descendants=None, kids=[25471054, 25473115, 25470826, 25471317, 25471032], score=None, time=1608318405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25470455, text='nitpick: virii is wrong.<p>The latin plural of &#x27;virus&#x27; does not exist. It is a nebulous, uncountable concept to ancient rome. Like &#x27;malaise&#x27; or &#x27;ocean&#x27; (we can pluralize oceans in english, but hopefully you can imagine that a language would treat it as a concept for which the concept of pluralization doesn&#x27;t make sense).<p>You&#x27;d think: Hey, it&#x27;s `-us`, I know that one, it pluralizes to `-i`, but, no. There is no plural. It&#x27;s a rare form that also ends in -us but doesn&#x27;t work like most of the words you know derived from latin that end in -us.<p>But there is `vir`, latin for &#x27;man&#x27;, and the plural of that is viri.<p>So, &#x27;viri&#x27;, as in &#x27;the latin pluralized form of virus&#x27;, is dead wrong.<p>There is no -ii ending in latin. At all.<p>The plural of &#x27;virus&#x27; in english is &#x27;viruses&#x27;. Any other form is stupid. Sometimes language does that, but surely you&#x27;d agree that something like &#x27;irregardless&#x27;, whilst somewhat common, sounds very unprofessional. virii is the same way.')
