Item(by='chrisked', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604684411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25006716, text='There are multiple options to create a German limited company available to you. You can find a local notary who speaks English via notar.de. They will be able to prep everything for the company formation. If you need help with opening a bank account, trade and tax office setup you can use different service providers. If you have severe time pressure buy an off the shelf company. You can do this via most notaries or directly with vendors like foris or blitzstart. If you go that route you will pay roughly 1.5k more. Also make sure you pick your location. Do not buy an off the shelf company in Munich and try to transfer to Berlin. This will severely slow you down.<p>I am running one platform in that space (www.firma.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;). Feel free to reach out via ck AT firma DOT de and I am happy to jump on a zoom call. There are surely more things to cover.')
