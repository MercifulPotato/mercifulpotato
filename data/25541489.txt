Although it does seem to be taking hold now as more and more people discover that they really struggle to get out from under student loan debt, can&#x27;t get jobs in their relevant fields, or find they can&#x27;t buy a home.<p>I think it&#x27;s good to see data like this put together, and more crucially to present some realistic perspectives to kids about what possible paths they might take in life and what the risks&#x2F;rewards of those plans might look like.')
