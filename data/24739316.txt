It went nowhere. I had a problem, and I didn&#x27;t know how address it in an FP manner. The language didn&#x27;t help me by getting in my way when I went down a wrong path, so I never learned the &#x27;right&#x27; one for FP.<p>As a trivial example - I want to iterate, I can use a loop; it doesn&#x27;t prevent me from using a loop and instead directing me to recursion. In fact, with recursion I get all sorts of terrifying comments about making sure it can be tail call optimized, to use @tailrec to make sure of that, or else I might explode the stack, oh-God-what-is-this-why-would-I-ever-do-this-etc. Meanwhile there is that good ol&#x27; friend &#x27;for&#x27; waiting for me to help me get things done...<p>Having used other languages, though, recursion holds no fears. I still am not a fan of Scala, but I&#x27;d be okay with being given all the options. Though not for any sort of team development unless everyone else had also been exposed separately to the paradigm we were standardizing on.')
