Everyone who wants to use them is an &quot;X client&quot; (e.g. a text editor), it communicates with the X server via a network connection (Unix socket or TCP&#x2F;IP) and speaks a protocol called &quot;X11&quot;. In order to speak to the X server, X clients use the standard library &quot;libX11&quot; so you don&#x27;t have to reimplement the X11 protocol. For example, when an image viewer wants to show a picture, it opens the picture locally, then pushes the pixels to the X server by calling a function in libX11.<p>An analogy is &quot;userspace vs kernel&quot;, kernel is the X server and provides many services for the userspace, an userspace program is the X client, it communicates with the kernel via syscalls to do things by speaking a protocol called the calling convention. All the syscalls are encapsulated inside the C&#x2F;POSIX standard library, libc, so you don&#x27;t have to replement the calling convention by putting parameters in the registers manually. For example, when a text editor wants to open a file, it asks the kernel for the file by calling a function in libc.<p>&quot;X&quot; is usually the catchall phrase for the software in general, but sometimes especially refers to the X server. &quot;Xorg&quot; is a particular brand of software implementation of X, which is maintained by the &quot;X.Org Foundation&quot; (other implementations include XFree86, XQuartz, etc). &quot;X11&quot;, in a narrow sense, is the protocol that is spoken by all X servers and X clients, and can also refer to the broader architecture of X server in general. But since it&#x27;s extremely unlikely to be updated to X12, so &quot;X11&quot; is also another way to say &quot;X&quot;.<p>Again, analogy. &quot;Unix-like&quot; is the catchall phrase for the operating system in general, but sometimes especially refers to the kernel. &quot;Linux&quot; is a particular implementation of Unix-like operating system [1] (other implementations include FreeBSD or Solaris), which is maintained by the &quot;Linux Foundation&quot;.<p>[0] We only consider 2D graphics without hardware acceleration. If OpenGL is involved, it&#x27;s more complex.<p>[1] It&#x27;s only a kernel so it&#x27;s not entirely correct. But let&#x27;s ignore it for the moment.')
