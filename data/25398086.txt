The general public wonâ€™t have access to the ownership data, a disappointment to anti-corruption campaigners, who say public scrutiny would help combat criminal activity.<p>Looks like the data will only be available at the Federal level and not open to the public.<p>&gt; In another transparency setback, the law also exempts some entities from the disclosure requirements, including domestic investment funds that are advised and operated by a registered investment adviser.<p>Sounds like the practice of using Registered Agents will still be allowed to continue.<p>So it&#x27;s a new law that will change how the Feds can access and prosecute organized crime, which is a good thing, but won&#x27;t help much in allowing us to learn who really owns that new shinny LLC.')
