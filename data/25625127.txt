Without an end definiting goal or a line drawn, discussions tend to feed themselves to <i>ad infinitum</i>. Basically, the more people you put in a room together, the more they will keep on talking until it&#x27;s time to go home or someone stands up and tells everyone to shut up. In this scenario, you almost question the person that doesn&#x27;t talk, and almost urge yourself to join this &quot;discussion&quot;. Without moderation, topics could digress anywhere. So you have egos competing to make their mark in this amalgamation of a &quot;discussion&quot; that is supposedly supposed to self moderate and direct itself to a conclusion? The more frustrated those responsible for a needed outcome get, their words and tone become less &quot;fun&quot;, as does anyone frustrated about anything said.<p>So half the solution of &quot;write it down instead&quot; is simply not putting people in a room. Basically, avoiding as much &quot;discussion&quot; as possible.<p>Whenever you need progress, you need a process. Discussion on its own is hardly a process. It takes determination and skill to have a constructive, time-efficient conversation.')
