Kidoteca never turned a profit, mind you over time the revenue is not terrible, but investors lost their money basically, games are still for sale and still generating revenue but too slowly to be useful.<p>2. Many bigger investors are wary of supporting such business, because they got scammed (games in general have some fraud here and there, mobile game industry, has rampant fraud, IP theft, actual physical stuff theft, and a bunch of other crimes, corruption, government espionage... it is just nuts).<p>3. If you still want to try anyway, knowing all that... there is a whole industry named &quot;hypercasual&quot; games, where you create a simple game, and publish through some platforms, and if the game is successful, they help you spread it further and share the revenue with you.<p>4. DO NOT attempt to make PC&#x2F;console-style games on mobile, you will lose money, people that want &quot;real&quot; games do it on a Switch or PC or a Dingoo (a cheap mobile console from Korea) and so on.<p>5. As much as I wish selling games directly were a good business model on mobile, it isn&#x27;t, people just want free stuff, so you have to rely on freemium or ads, sadly for Kidoteca case both of these models are terrible considering our target market (kids below 6). One of our competitors that had success, did so by having the game be the advertising in first place, ie: the game purpose is make the brand known, and then they get money selling cartoons, toys, t-shirts, etc...')
