I enjoyed it because it uses Assassin&#x27;s Creed as a lense to teach us a bit about history.  No culture war related baggage is required for admission into this article IMO; the narrative compromises necessary to make a playable game out of a 9th century setting are kind of hilarious, and this article helped me process the cognitive dissonance that comes from playing such games.<p>The bit about christian churches being decorated like abandoned shacks, with all the gold in a chest in the middle, I thought was funny.  Making game worlds that feel &#x27;used&#x27; by their inhabitants is a really interesting one.<p>idk, games are different things to different people; they&#x27;re escapism and we don&#x27;t all escape the same way.  Some of us enjoy pillaging inaccurate churches, and some of us like chortling about how silly it is while we do it.')
