Bit.ly custom domain, goo.gl, yourls on a php server, bit.do, &amp; many others. Even a static site Jekyll powered one at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;davch&#x2F;static-redirect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;davch&#x2F;static-redirect</a><p>I could not use YOURLS because its too much maintenance demanding, like any other php script. Server vulnerabilities, versions, errors. Bitly custom domain because you can&#x27;t customize the word after slash. Its still going to be random. Bit.do was&#x2F;is fun, &amp; good.<p>Then I got introduced to Firebase, at that time recently acquired by Google. Dynamic Links, with myWord.page.link subdomain. I got few, 5 max subdomains were allowed initially. I made two projects, &amp; total have 8 subdomains with page.link ending. Now they even allow custom domains, &amp; it is even default option. I am using that not from about 2-3 years.')
