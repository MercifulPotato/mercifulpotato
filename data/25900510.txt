Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=[25901051, 25900820], score=None, time=1611560871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25899617, text='&gt; And electricity is much cheaper than gas.<p>Maybe.<p>When I was commuting, my daily driver gas car got 36 MPG. My commute used 0.72 gallons. At $3.55&#x2F;gallon, the trip cost $2.56 or about 9.9 cents&#x2F;mile.<p>At the same time I had a Fiat 500e. The same commute consumed 11kWh.<p>So the breakeven point (between my two cars) is $0.24&#x2F;kWh in electric cost.<p>Looking at my PG&amp;E bill, peak time (4pm-9pm) cost is $0.35&#x2F;kWh and part-peak (9pm-midnight) is $0.34&#x2F;kWh. These are winter time prices, they are much higher in the summer (but I only have my current bill handy).<p>So if I had to ever charge the electric car during peak or part-peak times, it is quite a bit more expensive than gas.<p>Now, of course, I only charge it at night (PG&amp;E price $0.17&#x2F;kWh) so it is a bit cheaper. Just need to be careful to set the timer so charging never starts before midnight.')
