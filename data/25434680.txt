It&#x27;s worth noting that Seattle and Portland, are primarily Caucasian (67% taken from OPCD), (77% taken from US Census Data) respectively. I think the looting can be more attributed to a general anarchy&#x2F;countercultural movement in the PNW as opposed to protestors regarding BLM. It&#x27;s definitely something that is more complex and requires more research than an off-the-cuff comment could generate.')
