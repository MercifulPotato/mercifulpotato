The means to reach them are vastly different, and indeed the soviets had their own anarchist factions eliminated after the revolution.<p>Property also refers to such property that requires workers to be productive (farm land, factories), not personal property (e.g. a house you live in). The fascists might not have cared about your property being under worker control, but they sure cared about the output being under their control, so I don&#x27;t see too much of an advantage.')
