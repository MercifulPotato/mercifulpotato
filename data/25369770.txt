You don&#x27;t state a position, you just ask (leading) questions, without ever stating a position that can be refuted.  When someone calls you on it, you say that you&#x27;re &quot;just asking questions&quot;.<p>It can be a real dishonest, manipulative technique.  You&#x27;re running close enough to that to set off peoples&#x27; defense mechanisms.  So, even if you&#x27;re doing it in complete innocence, if you want to not have people upset with the way you&#x27;re carrying out the conversation, change your style.')
