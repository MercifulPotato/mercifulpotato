He trashed a company in exchange for a vast amount of money. Now we&#x27;re supposed to be sorry for him because he can&#x27;t be Canada&#x27;s PM. I do not understand the (neo)liberal love for failures. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s a nice guy over brunch. I&#x27;d rather have a PM who has been successful at something other than accumulating money.')
