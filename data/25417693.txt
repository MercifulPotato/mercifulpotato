Basically work like that for 3 months, ship a new course, take a 2 week break and repeat. The only reason I even took those breaks was to reflect on what I learned and figure out how to do things better for the next one.<p>But when I&#x27;m not able to afford doing that and I need to mix in contract work, especially contract work that I feel doesn&#x27;t help me in the long run because it&#x27;s doing things I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily do in my own projects, that shit drains me like nothing else. Just working on stuff like that for 2 hours destroys me for the rest of the day.<p>That and personally I find that I&#x27;m not optimized for juggling many different things at a time. I work best when I can block out large amounts of time and just plow through 1 task instead of chopping up smaller amounts of time to do things in parallel. I think it&#x27;s because if I don&#x27;t finish something all I do is compulsively think about it until it&#x27;s solved, so trying to do that with many concurrent projects leaves me in a constant state of feeling like nothing is ever going to be done which drains me overall.')
