There is zero consequences for their actions and they have zero reason to change their policy.<p>This paragraph completely decontextualizes what&#x27;s going on and makes it sound like the Chinese state is just rolling around blowing up ships for fun. In reality, fishing in international waters has always been messy.<p>&gt;You might say &quot;the consequence is that they look bad&quot;, but they don&#x27;t, at least not to the people they care about - mainlanders. They own and&#x2F;or control the news media in mainland China. To produce an anti-CCP news piece in China is suicide for these companies.<p>This is just orientalism. Unlike us normal westerners, <i>they</i> don&#x27;t care about what other people think! How scary!<p>&gt;External &quot;free&quot; media have their own interests and biases, meaning they may or may not publish articles depending on whether they coincide with their goals. If a bad China news piece makes the current President they support look bad, do you really think it makes headline news?<p>This is delusional, as I discuss here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25121329" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25121329</a><p>&gt;Doing &quot;drive bys&quot; is hardly actual action, like say dismantling a Chinese base made in international waters. THAT would be concrete action, and I bet they would get all upset but ultimately do nothing (unless it&#x27;s too Australia, in which case they&#x27;ll find some other product to ban).<p>This is just bloodthirsty lol.')
