Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25484165], score=None, time=1608441400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483671, text='<i>&gt; the notion that unemployed people should starve because otherwise no one would work to produce food</i><p>I don&#x27;t see where anyone is making an argument based on any such notion.<p>I think the reason most people are suspicious of those who don&#x27;t work for a living is fairness: we all benefit from the many goods and services that our society produces, so we all should contribute our fair share to producing them.<p>I agree that the market for jobs in our society is very inefficient, which means that many people are unemployed not because they are unable or unwilling to do productive work but because of our inefficient process for matching people to jobs that will actually be meaningful for them. However, no one has any more efficient process for doing that; there are processes that lead to less unemployment in the sense of fewer people not having a &quot;job&quot; on paper, but those processes (as shown by the Soviet Union and China) don&#x27;t care about the actual job satisfaction of individual people, so they don&#x27;t solve the problem we are discussing here.<p>I also agree that industrialization created many &quot;jobs&quot; that actually aren&#x27;t meaningful at all; the only reason people were used to do them is that nobody (yet) knew how to build machines that would do them. I agree that <i>those</i> jobs should be automated. What <i>should</i> happen as a result of such automation is that the necessities of life--food, clothing, shelter, basic transportation--should get cheaper over time. The main reason this hasn&#x27;t actually happened in developed countries (or hasn&#x27;t happened as much as it should--there are areas in which it has) is governments artificially keeping prices high to serve special interests (for example, the US government paying farmers <i>not</i> to grow crops). That is a political problem, not a technical problem.<p>Even if all the drudge work is automated, however, people will still need to design the machines, make sure they are doing what they&#x27;re supposed to do, take care of any malfunctions, and update the designs as conditions change. Plus, there are many services that only humans can provide. So I don&#x27;t think we are anywhere close to having a shortage of work that people will pay other people to do.')
