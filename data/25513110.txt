I mean, I&#x27;m sure what you&#x27;re saying is a big component of the problem, but... I can take a pretty nice video of my cat playing with a toy, just using my phone, without doing any work on lighting or anything.  Ditto for taking a front-facing-camera video of myself and then playing it back.<p>However, even with some minimal effort on lighting (turning off lights behind me, keeping an overhead light and a light somewhat in front of me), my Zoom calls still look like shit (as do most of my co-workers&#x27;, who are mostly using Macs).<p>Now, Google has put a lot of work into my phone&#x27;s camera, work that I doubt Dell has put into the little built-in webcam on my laptop.  But I doubt the camera in my phone is a significant part of the phone&#x27;s BOM cost (though maybe I&#x27;m wrong about this).  Would my laptop cost <i>that</i> much more if some more attention was paid to its integrated webcam?<p>And then Zoom is compressing the hell out of the video and is likely destroying quality in several places in the pipeline.<p>I agree that lighting is important, but I don&#x27;t think it explains all that much of the issue we&#x27;re talking about here.  The camera hardware sucks, and the software pipeline is optimized for reliable delivery, not quality.')
