If so, why did you buy it? If not, can you not return it?<p>Maybe you didn&#x27;t realize the issue at the time. Maybe you got it as a gift (from your parents, for example). Maybe the choice seemed more viable back then, before the noose tightened (jailbreaking, safetynet, etc). Maybe you didn&#x27;t really have a choice (for example, here in Sweden, BankID is pretty much mandatory at this point).<p>We don&#x27;t let grocery stores sell rotten food, and then blame the people who buy it.')
