It visually breaks up identifiers in misleading ways and doesn&#x27;t always play nice with double-clicking. So I could have gone with a Base62 implementation over a Base58 one, but the latter is more common, and even still, it can be useful to reduce visual confusion because people (at least developers) will be looking at these identifiers, even if they&#x27;re not typing them in.')
