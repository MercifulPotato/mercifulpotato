Facebook is trying to limit false positives. They would rather deny 10 world-class developers than hire one person they need to fire 6 months later.<p>Facebook, who is paying a lot of people to optimize its hiring processes, has found a correlation between the objective of &quot;lower short-term attrition &#x2F; first-year PIPs&quot; and &quot;quiz people about the mesh size of the goal net.&quot; I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the best long-term or that I agree with false positive bit as a business decision, but I find it hard to believe they&#x27;re doing stuff like this just because they feel like it without any data to back it up.')
