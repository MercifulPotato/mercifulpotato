Intuitionistic logic can be viewed as an <i>extension</i> of classical logic with new &quot;constructive OR&quot; and &quot;constructive EXISTS&quot; operators. The classical operators are recovered via negation: NOT (NOT a AND NOT b) is classical OR, whilst NOT FORALL x (NOT p) is a classical existential quantifier.')
