It&#x27;s easier to understand what&#x27;s\nhappening when you know at a glance what datatypes are involved,\nwhether they&#x27;re used by value or reference and how each case is\nhandled. When I last worked with Python it was rather time\nconsuming to fix bugs that crashed a script at some point after\n10 minutes of processing, caused by code that would have thrown\na clear compiler error in some languages and would have been\nfixed in seconds.<p>And when I look at e.g. a Rust function signature I immediately\nsee what kind of data is used as arguments and what&#x27;s passed\nback in the result. Meanwhile in JavaScript you just need to\nforget a symbol in a check and suddenly it won&#x27;t know the\ndifference between &quot;false&quot;, &quot;null&quot; and &quot;undefined&quot;.<p>You are right about integrating third-party systems, but I still\nprefer the approach where possible issues are discovered as\nearly as possible.')
