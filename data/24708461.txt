I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Tesla still has a higher defect rate, but I think it would be much closer than these articles will have you believe.<p>In general, anything Tesla related gets more coverage than an equivalent issue for any other car maker. I remember a few years back when Autopilot accidents would make national news while any other generic car wreck doesn&#x27;t cause anyone to think twice.')
