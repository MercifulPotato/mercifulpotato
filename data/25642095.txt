However most of the other programming languages have their own ways for doing multi-threading and many of the programs for this benchmark do make use of them.<p>The rules at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;description&#x2F;binarytrees.html#binarytrees" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net&#x2F;benchmarksgame&#x2F;...</a> request that submitters use the same algorithms as existing programs and I try to follow that rule. I believe all the binary-trees programs are using recursive functions so naturally I did the same to avoid breaking the rule about using different algorithms.')
