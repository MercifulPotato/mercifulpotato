If I can&#x27;t see a coworker such as yourself over video, when am I going to get to see anyone? The only in-person interaction I have had since March outside of a neighbor on the sidewalk&#x2F;going to the grocery store and seeing the cashier&#x2F;going to the doctor, has been only my mother and only 3 times. This is pretty isolating!<p>You are helping me out by feeling a little bit more connected to people if I can have a video chat with you.<p>I&#x27;m very used to isolation, but I can also tell it isn&#x27;t ideal for my mental health and 2020 hasn&#x27;t been excellent.<p>Make an exception for me please.')
