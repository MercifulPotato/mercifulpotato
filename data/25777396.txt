In my experience it used to be the case that my\nFitBit would break once or twice a yearâ€”and like you they\nwould always replace it. But I&#x27;ve noticed a trend toward reliability.<p>My Versa 2 has been operating like a champ since the day I\ngot it when it came out. I push it too the limit in the outdoors with activities like surfing, snorkeling, et cetera.<p>Every year I buy the Apple Watch thinking this will be the\nyear I switch. But again, just returned it on Friday.\nHardware is super impressive, but it just feels like putting\nan iPad on my wrist. I don&#x27;t want a computer on my wrist I\njust want to be healthy. And the battery life on the Versa 2\nis just so much better. I put it on and only have to take\nit off about once a week for an hour to charge.')
