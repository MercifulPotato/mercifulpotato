Normally you have many flood arrays with a dozen or more lights each.<p>&gt; People did it with less powerful light sources:<p>Cool!  So that&#x27;s somewhere around one kilowatt, significantly easier to do.<p>Though notably it&#x27;s still a spotlight.  I wonder how many watts of flood light you would need.')
