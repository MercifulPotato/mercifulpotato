I didn&#x27;t say any developers won&#x27;t benefit from having a better CPU. What I disagree with is the statement that JS developmant is comparable in this way to C++ dev. In C++ dev the required horsepower is INHERENT because of the language. This is simply not the case for JS development. If you require high horsepower for JS dev it&#x27;s because you work in a dev environment that results in requiring that horsepower. It is a CHOICE someone made when setting up the dev environment. That same choice could be made for any dev environment and doesn&#x27;t have much to with JS.')
