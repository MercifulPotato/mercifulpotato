Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24775509], score=None, time=1602675717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775391, text='&gt; The avenue (IMO) is to fight the legality of malware and&#x2F;or malware mercenaries within our countries.<p>That&#x27;s hard to do though. Germany has their attempt with the infamous laws around &quot;hacker tools&quot;, which place a lot of legal insecurity on any serious security work. &quot;Rouge malware vendors&quot; would already be operating illegally, and a state sanctioned developer that provides the state with malware can&#x27;t be considered a mercenary, I think.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced regular law enforcement badly needs malware to investigate, but I also don&#x27;t see why they&#x27;d not get that tool (with court orders and solid procedures) if we allow them to do other kinds of surveillance. From my experience, they&#x27;re not at a level of competence where the malware helps significantly, i.e. for low level crime you don&#x27;t need it, for highly sophisticated crime you won&#x27;t have a lot of success with off-the-shelves attacks.')
