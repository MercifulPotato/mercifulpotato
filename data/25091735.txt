They have the same problem than regular expressions or markdown. Each implementation adds a new trick, or feature or special case, and all of them are slightly incompatible.<p>I usually just open Excel. One of the problems&#x2F;features with Excel is that it use the local configuration to write the csv. I&#x27;m from Argentina, so IIRC the default configuration is to use semicolons instead of comas, and the decimal point is a coma. (Add that to the feature request list, but perhaps you can try to adapt to the USA market first, that is more uniform but has enough configuration options.) Sometimes I need a csv, but the the other program only understands the non-localized version of the csv, so I have to open it in a text editor and replace the semicolons with comas.<p>I sometimes use the version of csv that use tabs instead of comas, it it probably worth adding soon. And there is an option to use many spaces to keep the data in columns.<p>Also, there is an old post by patio11 about reading csv instead of writing them:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;design-and-implementation-of-csvexcel-upload-for-saas&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kalzumeus.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;design-and-implementati...</a> (HN <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8960280" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8960280</a> | 107 points | Jan 28, 2015 | 35 comments) Perhaps it has something relevant.')
