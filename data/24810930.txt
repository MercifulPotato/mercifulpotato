If you&#x27;re asking me whether we do the same kind of moderation on baity right-wing sources, the answer is of course, we do that all the time. If you&#x27;re asking whether we&#x27;ll do that on every future article that you might see as opposing your political beliefs, probably not. How we make these calls depends on the article. For sure we make some of them wrong, but you seem to want us to change the entire system by which we make them, and I&#x27;ve explained above why that would be bad.<p>The main thing, though, is that your question doesn&#x27;t feel like a question. To me it feels like you&#x27;re trying to conscript me into political battle for a position I don&#x27;t occupy to begin with. HN commenters who feel strongly on any topic (not just politics) sometimes make stories in which, for whatever reason, I, or rather &quot;dang&quot;, gets cast as the enemy. That&#x27;s a job hazard and inevitable, but those stories are not mine and that&#x27;s not me.')
