Calling it py3 is an exercise in marketing - instead of creating a new language to compete with py2 (along with all similar languages e.g. Julia) the existing py2 community was leveraged&#x2F;shamed* into supporting the new thing, and most importantly, py2 was killed by it&#x27;s maintainers (rather than handed off) so it couldn&#x27;t compete with py3, and so that users would be forced to move <i>somewhere</i> else - py3 being the easiest.<p>If it had properly been a new language, they could have taken more liberties (compat breaking) to fix issues, like a single official package manager. And migration to py3 would have been more by consent, than by force.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;python3wos.appspot.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;python3wos.appspot.com&#x2F;</a>')
