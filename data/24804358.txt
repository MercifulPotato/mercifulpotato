Most companies that make use of a large amount of opensource actually contribute a fair amount back.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think your claim about Amazon is true. But even if it is, it&#x27;s not relevant. None of the OSI licenses require improvements to be contributed back to the original project. The most restrictive of them simply requires improvements to be open to the user.<p>The intention of open source licenses was never to force those who redistribute the software to improve on it. It was to provide end users with the freedom to be able to do that themselves, by distributing the improvements as well.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that licenses from a generation ago don&#x27;t adequately cover all the nuance of cloud computing. But the reality is that open source licenses were never about preventing companies from profiting at the expense of original developers. They were about user freedom. If you&#x27;re unhappy with the way a company is using the software you open sourced, that is a sign you weren&#x27;t prepared to commit to what open source means, philosophically.<p>Something like the AGPL would be preferable, if also more controversial. Then you&#x27;d also have a peanut gallery of people telling you your software is &quot;source available&quot; instead of open source.')
