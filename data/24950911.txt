For software with strict requirements of correctness, correctness is sometimes proven mathematically.<p>It&#x27;s not that a rigorous approach to software development is impossible, it&#x27;s more a question of when it&#x27;s really worth doing. At present, formal methods are very costly to use. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s always necessary to go all the way to full formal verification for software development to count as rigorous, though.<p>Related reading: <i>They Write the Right Stuff</i>, from 1996. [0]<p>&gt; efficiency is obscure at modern coding levels<p>Depends on the domain. There are plenty of domains where efficiency doesn&#x27;t much matter, on modern hardware. Game engines are still tuned for efficiency, and will continue to be.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;28121&#x2F;they-write-right-stuff" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;28121&#x2F;they-write-right-stuff</a>')
