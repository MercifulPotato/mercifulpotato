Immediately recognizing the inherit silliness of this task (boring, error prone etc), I built a form creation tool, which all these years later lives on as RackForms.<p>Over the years the feature set grew organically to accommodate an ever growing set of demands. Yes we still build forms, but we also call into web services, display data, and so on.<p>Point being, RackForms and any number of other form builders are the blindingly obvious choice for this task -- it would be down right silly to code forms by hand in this era.<p>And yet that&#x27;s what we do with the web as a whole.<p>Once again Microsoft seems to have had the right idea in the good old Web Forms days. Instead of coding app&#x27;s you&#x27;d simply drag and drop components and add wiring code to do what you needed.<p>Sure it was never <i>that</i> easy, but it&#x27;s really hard to see how it couldn&#x27;t have been better given more time.<p>Fast forward to today and as much as I adore say, VS Code, it&#x27;s really nothing more than a hyper-powerful text editor. It has none of that  tolling to allow for drag and drop development, Id propose that;s the real solution to this issue - Better Tooling.')
