One night we were talking and one girl started asking questions and the rest of the group sneered at her &quot;not knowing&quot;. She ignored them and kept asking because I was earnest and knowledgeable. Five minutes turned to an hour and I think everyone in that group learned (or at least heard) more about the origins of the universe, stellar evolution, evolution, chemistry, physics, etc, than they had learned in school up to that point.<p>I sometimes wonder what happened to those people.  I suspect the girl who asked questions ended up way more knowledgeable than the other 10 combined.')
