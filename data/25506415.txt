For various reasons, fascists are really interested in medieval european history and like to attend conferences as &quot;independent scholars&quot;. They pass out propaganda and harass scholars who have the gall to do things like discuss women in medieval europe or any form of cultural transmission between europe and the islamic world. The solution has been to rip this stuff out. You can&#x27;t have &quot;order&quot; in the conference where people are able to share actual scholarly work while free of harassment without &quot;slapping down the fascists&quot;.')
