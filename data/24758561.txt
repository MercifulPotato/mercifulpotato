I definitely don&#x27;t do any business with IBM and I&#x27;d kill it if it came up at work because IBM is not that great. Weapons production is not that big a deal to me but I happen to not own a Mitsubishi or whatever so I get that one for free. I don&#x27;t buy bottled water from Nestle and frankly they are pretty bad at making chocolate. I don&#x27;t buy that nasty office brand coffee either. I don&#x27;t watch a lot of TV, and I avoid drugs and the medical system as much as I can, by trying to live healthily.<p>So, I&#x27;m already &quot;boycotting&quot; almost every company you listed, without even needing any ideological goal to chase after. The fact is these giant evil mega-conglomerates aren&#x27;t that great at making things. The more you avoid them the better off you will be.<p>Now, everything is connected to everything else, so I think the following rules are reasonable for avoiding evil companies:<p>- If it&#x27;s a commodity, and it&#x27;s mixed in with all the other commodities, it&#x27;s probably not practical to separate the tainted stuff from the cleanly produced stuff.<p>- If it&#x27;s a specific company with a specific product that they have specifically done evil stuff to push, that&#x27;s an example of something to avoid.<p>- If the same people are in power as when the company was evil, it&#x27;s probably still evil. If everything but the name has changed maybe they can get another chance. For degrees of change in-between those two, use your judgement.')
