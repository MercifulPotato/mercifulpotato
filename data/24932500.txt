Threat of competition if they don&#x27;t?<p>The mechanism is the ubiquity of folks using &quot;apps&quot; instead of contacting restaurants directly.<p>It used to be in NYC that every time a restaurant made a delivery, they&#x27;d leave paper menus for the residents.<p>Now, you either go through an &quot;app&quot; (read: an inferior interface to a website) or a search engine to find restaurants.<p>Aside from the fact that a low&#x2F;mid-priced restaurant likely doesn&#x27;t have the tech expertise to set up an online ordering platform, or the financial resources to purchase a point-of-sale system that includes such functionality or to contract with a developer&#x2F;hosting provider to do so, getting on these sites may <i>seem</i> to be the only way they can maintain their business.<p>And since GrubHub, et. al use SEO spam to get themselves at the top of search listings, have contracts that forbid restaurants from charging less if orders don&#x27;t use them, and then take all the profit (and then some) from the bulk of transactions, the deck is stacked against such restaurants.<p>I suppose you could argue that if a restaurant can&#x27;t compete in the market, it should fail.  And most do.  The average lifespan of a restaurant is just five years, and the vast majority fail within one year[0].<p>But those aren&#x27;t the restaurants I&#x27;m talking about.  I&#x27;m talking about neighborhood institutions that have been open for decades being forced to close because all their profit and then some is being taken by services like GrubHub that aren&#x27;t even providing <i>delivery services</i>, just listing on their site (which runs from ~12-30% on every single order).<p>The insertion of the middle man here, taking up to a third of the revenue on <i>every single order</i> which provides just a <i>listing service</i> (they actually charge the customer for delivery service if the restaurant doesn&#x27;t provide it -- not the norm here in NYC), has put many wonderful restaurants out of business.<p>This <i>increases</i> prices, reduces the diversity and choice of cuisine and quality, without providing any value, except in listings and credit card processing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;money&#x2F;restaurants&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;highest-grossing-restaurants-in-america&#x2F;37227589&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;money&#x2F;restaurants&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;...</a>')
