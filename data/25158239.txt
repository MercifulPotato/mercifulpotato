Item(by='vbarrielle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605859132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151563, text='Agreed, I find per-parameter docs useful in dynamic languages such as python, or to a lesser extent useful when the type system is weaker (in C), but in Rust I seldom find them useful. This can be useful to express constraints not present in the type system, for instance `fn matmul(a: Matrix&lt;f64&gt;, b: Matrix&lt;f64&gt;) -&gt; Matrix&lt;f64&gt;` will benefit from a documentation describing the constraints and guarantees on the number of rows and cols of each matrix, since this cannot be expressed in the type system (yet).')
