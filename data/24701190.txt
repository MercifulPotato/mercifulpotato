I know a blonde person of unmistakable Scandinavian extraction who, it turns out, possesses a Y chromosome haplogroup from Northern China, presumably inherited via the Sami or a similar herding society that moved across Siberia. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;S%C3%A1mi_people" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;S%C3%A1mi_people</a> AFAIU, because of how the inheritance traits for hair and eye color work, a population could have a relatively persistent fraction of people exhibiting non-typical phenotypes for some time even with a temporary infusion of alleles, not to mention regular contact.<p>In general, people got around more than one might think. The Inuit reached Greenland shortly <i>after</i> the Vikings from the opposite direction; both ended up displacing the existing inhabitants. The Age of the Vikings is pretty much modern times in terms of speed of migration and population mixing; not much different from today as compared to when many stereotypical phenotypes originally arose.')
