The differential equation for a simple harmonic oscillator is<p>x’’ = ax<p>which has a simple solution - sum of a sine and a cosine, aka a wave. (Here x’’ = second derivative of x with respect to time, or acceleration)<p>But the equation of motion for a real pendulum (from a free body diagram) is much more complicated and has no exact solution:<p>x’’ = sin(x)<p>It’s a very strange function whose second derivative is equal to the sine of the original function, and can’t be expressed in ordinary means. Any high school physics student can derive this equation of motion from Newton’s laws, but you need the assumption sin(x) ~ x to make any progress finding a solution.')
