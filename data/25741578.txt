Not bad given the caveat of &quot;the above location is likely accurate to only a few 10s of km at best.&quot;<p>The e-mail address in the petition has the domain tower-research.com, which is a high-frequency trading firm.<p>The only thing I&#x27;m confused about is that the zoning petition was discussed at the meeting on Dec 8th 2020. If it was approved, it seems remarkably fast to build a tower given that the article was from Dec 15th.')
