There does appear to be something going on with the experiments I&#x27;ve looked at, but I doubt it can be commercialized. For one thing, it&#x27;s very unreliable and hard to reproduce, so if it is a real phenomenon it probably relies on some unknown conditions that we don&#x27;t know how to bring about. For another, even in the experiments that demonstrate it, the amount of energy produced is not very much so unless someone can find a way to make it happen reliably and scale it up it seems more like a neat physical oddity than a useful power source.')
