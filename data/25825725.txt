I can&#x27;t think of any other reason to invoke &quot;your&quot; parents and grandparents.<p>If the point is that it&#x27;s unhelpful to make irrelevant assumptions about parents and grandparents, then this is in complete agreement with the parent&#x27;s point and is not a critique of it.<p>This is not a clever gotcha.')
