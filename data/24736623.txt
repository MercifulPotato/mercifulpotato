Item(by='reitzensteinm', descendants=None, kids=[24737095], score=None, time=1602302795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24734720, text='Your &quot;repeated&quot; refutations include a claim of $1400 per kWh-year of hydrogen storage with a link to a report [1]. That seemed way too high for me so I grabbed the report - which, by the way, argues that hydrogen is economical for storage of spilled wind - and have no idea where you got this figure from.<p>It appears you&#x27;ve mixed up kW and kWh at the very least. The figure you&#x27;re reading also appears to include the cost of buying the electricity at market rates, which is shown to not be economical. But it isn&#x27;t what parent argued for, and you explicitly state it does not include.<p>Reading further in to the report, it breaks down the capital cost of a hydrogen system minus storage at $550&#x2F;kW, and notes the very low cost of underground storage at large scales (for smaller scales, it argues for using tanks and being geographically independent).<p>So you disagreed with parent, threw out a nonsensical figure and linked to a report as proof that agrees with them, not you.<p>And hey, it looks like someone informed you of your mistake 3 months ago [2], which you didn&#x27;t bother to reply to or correct yourself.<p>This is a repeated theme with your accounts (your main and your sockpuppet). Every time I dig in to the numbers you throw out I get a sour taste in my mouth that you&#x27;ve caused me to waste my time. I believe that you are arguing in bad faith, cherry picking whatever numbers you can find, in context or not, to make a pro nuclear case. Which is a bit sad, because I think there are still strong (but dwindling) cases to be made for nuclear.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prod-ng.sandia.gov&#x2F;techlib-noauth&#x2F;access-control.cgi&#x2F;2011&#x2F;114845.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prod-ng.sandia.gov&#x2F;techlib-noauth&#x2F;access-control.cgi...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23741288" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23741288</a>')
