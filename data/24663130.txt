It&#x27;s unacceptable. If I&#x27;ve said something that you consider racist then I sincerely apologise.<p>You are right that I thought you were white. It is because you said, &quot;don&#x27;t start calling all white people racist for being nothing but white&quot;. I apologise for the assumption.<p>You did, however, call me a moron, which doesn&#x27;t really strike me as arguing in good faith.<p>You also said this:<p>&gt; The aboriginal people of Australia face real problems. The police isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>If you live in Australia and you don&#x27;t think that cops are, at least until relatively recently, a huge part of the problem with Aboriginal welfare, then maybe you missed the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody [0]. I was in high school when that stuff went down, I remember how many people were being killed, and the fact stands that Aboriginal people are 10x more likely to die in prison than Europeans.<p>&quot;The key finding of the royal commission was that Aboriginal people are more likely to die in custody because they are arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates. That remains as true in 2020 as it was in 1991.&quot; [1]<p>&gt; For what it&#x27;s worth, &quot;statistically, aboriginal people commit more crime. Studies have shown that this is because of chronic health and economic issues which have never been adequately addressed by any Australian government&quot; Was pretty much the gist of what I was getting<p>But that&#x27;s not what you actually said.<p>&gt; I thought that was pretty obvious given the context and adding the context doesn&#x27;t really make my statement any more or less factual.<p>Mate, there was very little context in what you wrote. If I took you the wrong way then I apologise, but maybe you can accept your part in this too. Maybe you didn&#x27;t express yourself as well as you might have. That&#x27;s cool, but how you express yourself is not my responsibility.<p>&gt; if you took my remarks on good faith it wouldn&#x27;t have been a problem. But that is the problem<p>You called me a moron!!<p>&gt; with this American narrative<p>...and you assumed I&#x27;m American? Or that I don&#x27;t have my own reasoned narrative? That&#x27;s not really good faith now is it?<p>&gt; everyone is too busy trying to win, nobody is trying to look at facts for what they are and find the common ground therein.<p>When you say that &quot;Aboriginal people just commit more crime&quot;, that&#x27;s not a fact, it&#x27;s a tautology; of course they commit more crime, they are generally poorer and sicker, because of how they&#x27;ve been treated. I&#x27;m pretty sure that poor white people commit more crime too. Aboriginality has nothing to do with criminality; and just because a statement is true, through some twisted logic, doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t also be racist.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that I think you are a racist; I have no idea. But I do think what you said is.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Royal_Commission_into_Aboriginal_Deaths_in_Custody" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Royal_Commission_into_Aborigin...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;australia-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jun&#x2F;11&#x2F;deaths-inside-how-we-track-indigenous-deaths-in-custody-and-why-we-do-it" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;australia-news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jun&#x2F;11&#x2F;death...</a><p>edit: add quote')
