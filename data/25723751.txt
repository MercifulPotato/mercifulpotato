While it would be extremely hard if not impossible to get a TV station such as Fox News to be banned here, its hosts&#x2F;mouthpieces&#x2F;guests could certainly be sanctioned - up to actual jail time.<p>Also, our core media codex (&quot;Medienstaatsvertrag&quot;) binds all broadcasting stations - radio, TV, streaming - to journalistic integrity and truthful reporting (§§6, 19, 51 MStV).<p>&gt; What about CNN? They are as biased as Fox News.<p>I have yet to see a report that CNN broadcasts people that claim that the election was &quot;stolen&quot; or &quot;manipulated&quot;. There is a massive difference between biased reporting and <i>openly distributing lies</i>.')
