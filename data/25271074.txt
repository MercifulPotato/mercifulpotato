Most of their revenue is from the weird money pump&#x2F;merger with Solar city and carbon credits. I&#x27;m with everyone else with the confusion on the valuation. Investors seem to love TSLA even though they lose their money every car they sell. I guess they&#x27;re banking on the Uber&#x2F;Lyft strategy which is to dominate the market hoping that the competitors will not last(?). Equally confused with the self driving fleet strategy too. Even if Tesla figures out how to get cameras to provide as meaningful data as LiDAR, they will still be years behind. All the big players have been spending the past couple years trying to figure out how to create a robust &quot;driver&quot; while Tesla is spending all this time figuring out how to get useful sensor data.<p>Disclaimer, I work in the Autonomous vehicle industry and my opinion are of my own and not of my employer.<p>Edit: I would love to hear if any part of my comment was wrong rather than just being down-voted. I even double checked the profits from TSLA earning and they have had 6 (barely) profitable quarters in the past five years. None of those would of been possible without EV and&#x2F;or solar credits...')
