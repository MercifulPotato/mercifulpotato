I do wonder though, is there any combination of parts that will make even the simplest computer last 100 years? (With proper maintenance, ideally not replacing parts that can&#x27;t be produced for the next 100 years)<p>I&#x27;m defining a computer here as an electronic CPU with some sort of I&#x2F;O, both user I&#x2F;O and peripherals.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of something like a Commodore 64. I&#x27;ve been able to get one working after 30 years of it sitting on a shelf before, although many suffer from burst capacitors, bad chips, oxidation of circuits&#x2F;pin connectors, etc.<p>I wonder if you could take the idea of a simple, self contained system like the C64, but use ultra reliable, beefy industrial components, like from computer systems in manufacturing factories. Maybe throw a few redundant components the computer can silently switch over to if the first component goes bad.')
