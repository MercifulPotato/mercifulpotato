This seems like a given to me if you care about equitable access to information technology or whatever.<p>Apple is creating a world where they&#x27;re the only realistic way to get apps onto the personal computing devices of a large share of society.<p>Since that&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s choice, it&#x27;s their responsibility to reconcile these two points.* If they&#x27;re not doing that, it seems appropriate for society to create better incentives for Apple.<p>(* Promoting and processing payments for every sketchy unverified submission is probably not the right way to go about that, sure.)')
