The one thing that turned me off on mercurial was that branching information was stored as part of the commit.  This led sometimes to weird conflicts where the branch list needed to be merged.  Granted that&#x27;s been several years ago, so it might be different now, I don&#x27;t know, and with git I have no need to.<p>I definitely appreciate branching data being meta data outside of the branch.<p>Also Darcs had severe issues maybe a decade ago where merging would appear to cause infinite locking.  It wasn&#x27;t a coding bug, it was due to their originally flawed theory of patches.  So while it may be awesome, the world has definitely moved on.<p>It&#x27;s worth reading this from pijul:<p>&gt; Did you solve the “exponential merge problem” darcs has?<p>&gt; Yes, we solved the exponential merge problem. The only caveat is that Pijul does not (yet) have an equivalent of darcs replace. In other words, Pijul works in polynomial time for all patches that systems other than darcs know of. We’ve not yet thought all the theory of this through, but it might be added in the future.<p>So good, but polynomial time can still be large beasts computationally.')
