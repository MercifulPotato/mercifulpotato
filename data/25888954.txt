To put it simply, they like Precise data, not Accurate data.  They want a bunch of data-points saying <i>one</i> thing and couldn&#x27;t care less if it&#x27;s objectively the right target, not a bunch of data points saying a bunch of things, one of which is actually right.<p>Precision data gives them convictions and convictions give them promotions.  As they say, any metric that becomes a target...  This is why giving the police invasive surveillance tech is a terrible idea, they will only focus on the data that fits their narrative and discard the rest.  The defense doesn&#x27;t even need to know that any other data exists.')
