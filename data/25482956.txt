It’s shocking to me you think this is somehow simpler or that the testability is somehow better.<p>This is how nasty convoluted API get created. Now other functions up the call stack will also have to have a randrange param if they have to pass it forward.<p>At best I could say in some unique use cases there could be API trade offs that make this ok, but definitely not at all for passing around pseudorandom sampler functions. Your change is strictly more confusing, has strictly worse coupling and has a strictly worse API and even after all that, the test is not simpler and isn’t even less code than a one-liner mocker.patch in pytest.')
