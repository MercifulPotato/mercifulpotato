Item(by='tschwimmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603736393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897851, text='FWIW, I tried the first query on Google Home and it suggested I talk to a third party extension called &quot;Air Check.&quot; I didn&#x27;t go through with connecting it but I assume it would give you what you wanted. It sounds like you were on mobile so maybe it&#x27;s different there. I actually appreciate it prompting to connect before making the request because there&#x27;s probably some privacy tradeoff there.<p>The second query was hard for me to test but it seems like a reasonable one to make.<p>The third one is probably impossible due to Instagram&#x27;s TOS (among other things.) Their TOS states: &quot;You must not crawl, scrape, or otherwise cache any content from Instagram including but not limited to user profiles and photos.&quot; [0] After Cambridge Analytica I&#x27;m not surprised that this is the case. Even if Instagram allowed scraping of their data, this feels like a somewhat specialized (though currently very relevant) request. I tried reformulating this request as &quot;What is the mask compliance rate in Shasta county?&quot; which also didn&#x27;t turn up results, but I&#x27;m not surprised by that either. I suspect that data doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere, so it&#x27;s hard to fault the assistant for not pulling it up.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;legal&#x2F;terms&#x2F;before-january-19-2013&#x2F;#:~:text=You%20must%20not%20crawl%2C%20scrape,written%20consent%20from%20Instagram%2C%20inc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;legal&#x2F;terms&#x2F;before-january-1...</a>.')
