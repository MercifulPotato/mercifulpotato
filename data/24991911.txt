Though, maybe you could argue that the engagement wasn&#x27;t formal enough.<p>They found the initial hint of the bug from normal use, and requested permission before doing the actual pen test.<p>Regarding the analogy, this isn&#x27;t some random house they wanted to test. It&#x27;s an essential service they used and depended on. Perhaps your analogy can be improved by them being an apartment building resident interested in the security issues of the building as a whole, since it affects the security of their own apartment. Even then, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a perfect analogy that accurately reflects the situation. In the analogy, you could argue that they should change buildings if they&#x27;re concerned, but banking options seem way more limited in comparison.')
