If the data input is 1, and you change set from 1 to 0, the output can actually glitch to 0 for a very short period of time, which is a big no-no. (If you draw the equivalent circuit out with just nand gates and assume they all have some delay between input and output, you&#x27;ll see why).<p>A safer solution would be to cross couple two nand gates into an SR latch [0], use another two nand gates to control the Set and Reset signals, and an inverter to create NOT(data).<p>Of course in reality, a latch is usually custom built out of transistors rather than logic gates, but there are some cases where I&#x27;ve used logic-gate-latches to make things easier.<p>&lt;&#x2F;pedanticism&gt;<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;electronics-course.com&#x2F;sr-nand-latch" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;electronics-course.com&#x2F;sr-nand-latch</a>')
