I assume all games run XWayland, which makes it a non-issue. (Otherwise, it&#x27;d presumably be an FPS hit in a world where adaptive sync [like G-SYNC but not really FreeSync since the latter doesn&#x27;t really work in Linux lol] makes tearing a thing of the past and obviates v-sync entirely.)<p>Also, can you use xdotool for key input redirection or screen capture programs and stuff yet?')
