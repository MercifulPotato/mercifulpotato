After it went into remission, she was unable to recall new information long enough to read papers and had to put her studies on hold.  Eventually a doctor did a blood test that included vitamin d levels, and she was in the single digits (don&#x27;t remember units but it was supposed to be at least 20).  She started supplementing and graduated this spring.  Just one data point, but it was pretty clear that remedying a deficiency made a marked improvement in her case.')
