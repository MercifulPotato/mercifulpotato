Should I buy a BMW that seems — according to the manufacturer — to need an extended warranty?  This also seems like a privacy issue, but only if you and one other car pass by the sign at the exact same time.  The most prevalent spam calls on my cell phone are for extended warranties... this seems to cast BMW in the same light unless you really should get the warranty.  But, full circle, if that’s right there must be a more reliable comparable car, right?  I’m sure BMWs are great but I’d certainly shop alternatives knowing this looms after year 3 of ownership.  I also wonder what this means for their certified pre-owned cars.')
