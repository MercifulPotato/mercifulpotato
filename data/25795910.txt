At the end of the day, all that really matters is what percentage of BTC bought was from HODLERS.  If 80% of all BTC bought was from HODLERS, it means the market cap of BTC can NOT drop anymore than 20%, at the very maximum drop, and since the number of BTC coins in existance is constant, it means the drop in value of BTC is at MOST 20%.<p>The last bitcoin bubble was mostly bought up by speculators who eventually sell very quickly, which what allowed the price drop to occur so much because most BTC holders were not hodlers and most were just speculators.<p>You can sidestep all the concerns about Tether and USDT and conversion, etc.  Just figure out what percentage of BTC is bought by HODLERS or get some kind of estimate, and that will tell you your downside risk.<p>I for one, am long BTC, because I know this time around a much higher percentage of BTC was bought by HODLRs and there&#x27;s a whole lot more coming in 2021.')
