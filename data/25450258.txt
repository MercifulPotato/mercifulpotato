If I were you, I might keep Slack filling the screen most of the time, with the browser on workspace 9 — so it can pulled up with Super + 9 — and make a combo like Super + M both focus Zoom (on a third workspace), `xdotool key --clearmodifiers Alt+m` (with the setting enabled for that to toggle mute), and perhaps `xdotool windowmove 80% y` or so Slack and make Super + S or something reset the Slack workspace afterwards.')
