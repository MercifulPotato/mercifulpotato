Even being within spitting distance is really great in my opinion for an off the shelf, general tool.<p>&gt; However none of the databases tested above is anywhere close to the efficiency of a column store database that can do vectorized execution over batches of rows. ClickHouse is a good example of one such database. For queries that have to shift through large amounts of data, either filtering or aggregating it, the performance difference is easily &gt;10x. I was seeing aggregation performance above 2B rows&#x2F;s and that was I&#x2F;O throughput bound.<p>Agreed -- OLTP (in the case of Timescale) and purpose built timeseries-focused (but not necessarily analytics focused) DBs hold nothing to a proper OLAP database.<p>Did you write about this anywhere? would love to read it. I&#x27;ve never had a real need for the kind of stuff that Clickhouse does, but it looks to be the best in class for F&#x2F;OSS OLAP DBs. Have you ever tried Druid?')
