That seems like a difficult state of mind to achieve.<p>I&#x27;d buy that there are subcultures where prefixing &quot;I think...&quot; is a gesture of respect. But the CoC&#x27;s I&#x27;m familiar with generality don&#x27;t demand that the speaker aligns with a specific culture. Often they encourage accepting multiple cultures.<p>Indeed, I&#x27;ll go as far as saying that a big part of conferences is encouraging different subcultures to listen to each other.')
