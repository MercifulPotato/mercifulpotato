It also broke out of the box support for running full VMs, which was pretty painful for me as well, and I wasn&#x27;t going down that rabbit hole to try and build it myself.<p>YMMV of course.. but that&#x27;s just my take on it.. I bought specifically for Linux support, but took a few months to shake out.')
