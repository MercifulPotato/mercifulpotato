With Quest 2, anyone who tries it on would have full access to my Facebook account and Messenger history, so I can&#x27;t do that. And no, they don&#x27;t give you any sort of warning about this, you have to figure it out yourself.<p>(I reported this to their bug bounty program on October 26. The submission was rejected as a duplicate. I rechecked today and it was still not fixed.)')
