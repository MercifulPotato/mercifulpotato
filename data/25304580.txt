Item(by='Zancarius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607100760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25299261, text='&gt; without being neurotically verbose<p>Unfortunately, I know what you mean. I have a tendency toward verbosity that makes it feel that every time I write a post I&#x27;m crafting a treatise that might make the great statesmen of old blush (with the exception that I&#x27;m far too stupid to make it as interesting or entertaining).<p>And yes, intent is difficult to convey through text even if you&#x27;re afforded a great deal of time and effort.<p>&gt; you wanted to focus credit on the one thing about the A1 SOC<p>No, not at all. The ML cores and other, err, accessory CPUs they&#x27;ve added are incredibly fascinating. Mostly I was thinking of the ARM portion of the hardware.<p>Truthfully, I confess that part of my excitement lending itself to ARM is because I genuinely want to see more vendors follow Apple&#x27;s footsteps and either a) craft their own designs or b) build out ARM-based platforms that will lead toward greater competition in the desktop&#x2F;laptop markets (or both?). <i>Fortunately</i>, Apple&#x27;s tendency toward setting market trends gives me some hope that we&#x27;ll see noteworthy contributions that embarrass x86 and upend the idiotic convention that I think M1 has finally broken. Namely that you can have a chip that works on an incredibly tiny power budget or you can have performance. Apple&#x27;s proven we can have both, and I think that&#x27;s a good step forward. It excites me that we may actually see viable competition this decade, and if we do, I&#x27;ll absolutely credit Apple with upending conventional wisdom and proving that our fixation on x86 for &quot;performance&quot; was myopic and unnecessary.<p>Maybe that explains my reasoning a bit more. At the expense of being unnecessarily verbose (though you may appreciate that). :)<p>Also, I owe you an apology. I wrote my reply out of some frustration last night. Regrettably I allowed myself to get sucked into a &quot;discussion&quot; with someone I didn&#x27;t know was an antivaxxer until I realized their refusal to listen to an explanation of microbiology wasn&#x27;t born out of lack of interest but rather suspicion. When I saw your post, I genuinely believe I unfairly took some of that frustration out on you. I&#x27;m truly sorry about that.')
