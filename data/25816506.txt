Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=[25816604], score=None, time=1610927305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814129, text='Just to play devil&#x27;s advocate, that&#x27;s the whole purpose of patents, to prevent progress by others.<p>On the other hand, the gain is that E Ink Corporation decided it was worth investing in developing and commercializing the technology <i>knowing</i> they&#x27;d have exclusive rights for 20 years, and quite possible <i>only because</i> of that. If they didn&#x27;t have that guarantee, it might not have been worth any company developing it in the first place.<p>Now I&#x27;m not familiar with the history of investment in e-ink specifically. But I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s anyone here who is: if patent protection wasn&#x27;t available, would it have been worth it for any company to develop it, knowing it might be copied a year later by a competitor who would then undercut the original inventors (not having to pay for the expensive R&amp;D)?')
