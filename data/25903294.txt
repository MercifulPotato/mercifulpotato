Then you have thier video streaming, subscribe and save, etc. It seems to pay for itself but it really increases the chance we&#x27;ll order from Amazon over a third party (e.g. in Canada, Walmart is really a good alternative as long as you only by &quot;sold as shipped by Walmart&quot; items, but it is rarely the first place I go).')
