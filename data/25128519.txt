Being the &quot;first place&quot; people look when they&#x27;re hungry gives them pretty okay leverage.<p>In non-pandemic times this is actually a sweet deal for restaurants that don&#x27;t want to do their own delivery because food and the marginal cost of labor is cheap and your goal is to reduce kitchen idle time as much as humanly possible and another source of orders is a positive. It cannibalizes take-out orders a little but opens up people who would do delivery but not take-out.')
