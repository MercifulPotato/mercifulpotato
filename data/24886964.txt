My experience is the choices are:<p>Use a binary blob that only works with a 3 year old vendor kernel, and works most of the time (but you can&#x27;t fix it when it doesn&#x27;t work, and if you are compositing most of the time isn&#x27;t good enough)<p>Use a mainline Linux kernel that is so buggy that fixing the bugs in it is a full time job<p>Use fbdev')
