We&#x27;re the smart people in the wee-woo box that primarily focus on patient care with our friends in law enforcement and fire close by.<p>My issue with it is that EMS and a &quot;mental health professional&quot; could easily get stuck in a situation with a violent, armed person and be at the mercy of police coming from a separate location to help in an emergency.  Sure, the vast majority of patients are not like that, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me to take the risk.  In my experience, having police on scene but keeping their distance is fine and patients usually understand when we say they&#x27;re not in trouble and anything they say to us is confidential.  Some other services probably don&#x27;t do it as well, especially since police get there faster most of the time.')
