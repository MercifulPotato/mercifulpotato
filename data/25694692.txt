Weather Underground, for example, bombed the Capitol in 1971.

This caused a minor kerfluffle when the details resurfaced to public light in 2008, but it was clearly, in the end, no obstacle to Obama&#x27;s election.<p>One might raise a similar point about a figure like Oscar Lopez Rivera who, while he never bombed the Capitol, definitely did bomb about 100 other locations around the country and was rewarded for his efforts by an NYC ticker tape parade once he was released from prison.  Lin Manuel Miranda&#x27;s admiration for Rivera has hardly proved a stumbling block for his wildly successful career.<p>And that&#x27;s just one end of the frequency-severity spectrum.  Mobs break into the Capitol and interrupt proceedings with  perhaps surprising regularity, as with the Kavanaugh hearings for example.<p>In any case, it seems that bombing the Capitol or doing widespread domestic terrorism is only selectively an impediment to a later life of comfort in the US.')
