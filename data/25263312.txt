Item(by='rococode', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606809092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262127, text='FYI, lots of freelance and professional digital artists who draw for a living are using the $50-150 models which don&#x27;t have displays to great success. I have one of those (old Wacom Bamboo Capture, no longer sold) and it&#x27;s more natural than it sounds to make drawing motions with your hand that are rendered on your computer monitor.<p>Unless you have reason to believe the person who made the Christmas request expects a present with $300-$5000+ price tag or specifically wants one with a display, they&#x27;re probably thinking about the screenless ones (especially if they don&#x27;t already have a drawing tablet). In that case, they&#x27;ll likely be very happy with any Wacom model - Wacom Intuos is currently the popular one.<p>As for the price and functionality - the really expensive ones are targeted towards full-time corporate professionals who sit in a room and churn out art all day, and their company will happily shell out $5k for top-tier equipment for them (the artist version of a Bloomberg Terminal haha). The $300-500 ones with screens are priced like regular tablets because that&#x27;s kind of what they are, just specialized for drawing with a pen. The $50-150 ones focus on the pen input itself and don&#x27;t deal with the complications of having a screen, making them simple tools that enable digital drawing (it&#x27;s much more tedious to draw with a mouse than a pen). Their price is the baseline for this category of tooling, as even those basic tablets have a variety of features like pressure sensitivity, high precision, side buttons, etc. which mostly justify the price tag.')
