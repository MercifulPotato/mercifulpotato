In that respect, here is (I believe) the report which shows the numbers put out by the machine are not reliable, at least, and also gives evidence that 2020 log files were deleted whereas 2016 log files were not:\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.9and10news.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;Antrim_Michigan_Forensics_Report_121320_v2_REDACTED.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.9and10news.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;Antrim_Mi...</a><p>Next, we know the state&#x27;s mouthpiece will try to refute that handily, so we take a look at such an article, from Michigan itself:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.detroitnews.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;michigan-judge-allows-release-report-antrim-county-voting&#x2F;6537394002&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.detroitnews.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;14&#x2F;m...</a><p>In particular, pay attention to the confounding of two separate issues to discredit the above forensic report:<p>&gt; The group previously claimed there were six precincts with more than 120% turnout in the state&#x27;s election. But its data was incorrect, according to publicly available turnout numbers.<p>&quot;The group&quot; did not make such claims or at least I could not find any, it was the affiant who did and he is management at the company. I could not actually find the source material on this so I am trusting the article.<p>Anyway, what is important is what was NOT refuted in the article.<p>Because, quite possibly, there is where efforts should be focused. These pieces of presumably factual evidence should be refuted by an adversarial party but are not and are just left to be memory holed.<p>I have not yet found anything specifically refuting the forensics report above. Simply news articles confounding things in what appears to be an effort to discredit findings. Not that I&#x27;ve looked too hard, mind you.<p>So I&#x27;m still wondering... why are 2020 logs missing while 2016 logs remain? Why do the machines give different numbers for the same votes?<p>These are important questions. Do not think we&#x27;ll get an answer though.<p>And for the record, I always found Bush&#x27;s Diebold election fishy.')
