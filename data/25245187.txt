It was no secret even then that electric motors had insane performance. With a  proportional throttle you had to learn early on to go easy or you would smoke your tires.  Almost any electric car will smoke a ICE car, the first lap. Even the humble Nissan LEAF is under 6secs.<p>What Tesla really brought was capacity (we were still lead acid and NiMH at the time) and the Supercharger network. The battery tech and network are their largest asset. The cars themselves are pretty underwhelming design-wise.')
