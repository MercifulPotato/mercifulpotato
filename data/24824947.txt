Surprisingly, their map showed a path. There is no path, even though there is a right of way. OS shows the right of way, but I imagine OS map users would know that right of way doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;path&quot;.<p>On OSM I have made efforts to tag the physical properties of a way separately to any enshrined rights but it&#x27;s hard to get right.<p>I&#x27;ve used GPS to navigate for many years now. I used to carry paper maps, but you need a compass (and the ability to use it) to make it useful if you get lost in the moors or something. I just carry a backup Garmin now instead of paper maps.')
