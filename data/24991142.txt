Item(by='fireattack', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604511275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988028, text='Discogs started as an electronic music database, so it&#x27;s not surprising.<p>I guess we can say that all these crowdsourced music databases have obvious priority or bias, despite they are appeared to, or want to, be a comprehensive one, which isn&#x27;t very realistic just due to the sheer amount of the music produced. In Discogs&#x27; case, even though it gradually expanded to &quot;everything&quot;, its strength is still at its core (where it started): electronic, hip-hop, rock, jazz, (in this order, named in the article), but probably not pop.<p>One probably would have <i>much</i> better luck looking for something in one than the other, totally depending on the genre. Like, if I&#x27;m looking for game music, I definitely will check VGMDB first.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not limited to music either. It can happen in much, much smaller fields. One particular case I want to mention is that there used to be <i>three</i> wikis for a single game, Dota 2, and each have their own strengths (there are still two today!).')
