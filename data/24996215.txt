It is not an open source project in the sense of most major open source projects and if you don&#x27;t work at Google on the go team you are highly unlikely to be involved in any significant changes.<p>I worked on the compiler in 2011 as an open source contributor and firmly got this impression back then which seriously put me off and the absolute farce of how modules were handled (community heavily involved put a ton of work in then out of nowhere Russ Cox just did his own thing anyway) suggests to me nothing has changed.<p>Generics have been heavily discussed and desired from the beginning of the language and many have contributed thoughts and concepts. At first the designers said more or less &#x27;nope not needed&#x27; which changed to &#x27;if somebody suggests a good implementation we will do it&#x27;. But would they really? If this design document had come from outside the go team would they even give it a glance?<p>I like the language and the team are clearly talented but it is a pity that the project is quite so proprietary.')
