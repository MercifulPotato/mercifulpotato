If you use consent, then it must be freely-given, but can often use a different legal basis when processing personal data.<p>The ePrivacy Directive requires consent for reading or writing from a terminal device. This includes anything with cookies, even if they&#x27;re not personal data. While the ePD refers to GDPR for its definition of consent, it is a separate piece of legislation and many things that are true about GDPR are not true about ePD (such as being able to invoke Legitimate Interest instead of consent).')
