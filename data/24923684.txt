As someone who works a lot with Python and is very familiar with its package ecosystem, I find the lack of leadership from PSF to be discouraging and upsetting. The past few Python releases have what I would characterize as cosmetic improvements while repeatedly missing opportunities to improve interpreter, packaging, and interface fundamentals. The position that CPython has to be kept simple as a reference implementation is untenable in the absence of an active collaboration or effort to produce a performance oriented implementation.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, CPython as an interpreter technology has not advanced in the past decade - and Python has grown thanks to the data science community efforts and excellent library ecosystem you mention, not due to PSF. PSF can only miss so many opportunities before something comprehensively better starts to eclipse it.')
