They didn&#x27;t say &quot;we ban company X from making any fridges&quot;, it was a general ban. If there&#x27;s a certain behavior that&#x27;s problematic (still not sure what specifically you would be referring to here), then ban that, not handpicked companies.<p>This is the TikTok crap all over again.
