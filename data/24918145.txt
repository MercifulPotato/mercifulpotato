Google does it out of greed, because $50b or $60b in sales isn&#x27;t enough versus the $166b they&#x27;re getting now.<p>Apple could try to make a lot more money off of their iOS platform right now by becoming very aggressive at abusing privacy. They don&#x27;t do it because the already lucrative path they&#x27;ve chosen gives them a big competitive advantage in the age of privacy violation.<p>If Google were a thinner organization instead of a hugely bloated monster conglomerate, and if they ran advertising with weak targeting, they would be a very profitable, very large company at a far lower sales level. That wasn&#x27;t ambitious enough for Google.<p>Google&#x27;s privacy abusing margin is Apple or Duck&#x27;s opportunity.')
