That&#x27;s the CEO&#x27;s security issue, and the company&#x27;s security issue. Therefore, it&#x27;s a useless pen test, unless the purpose is to tell employees no emails from anyone can be trusted.<p>A phishing email can come from the inside. But seeing whether employees will respond to a valid internal email is not a test of employee security. And in this case, it was as heartless as it was useless.')
