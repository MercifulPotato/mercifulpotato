We can&#x27;t have censorship (or moderation) without bias and intepretation. The question is then whether\nwe want biased moderation or no moderation.<p>&gt; This does not look questionable to you<p>Not at all. I completely support Twitter&#x27;s right (and decision) to make a subjective call. It&#x27;s not an easy one, but given the circumstances I consider it correct.<p>&gt; There is nothing in his (other) tweets that incites violence.<p>A public official falsely claiming (for example) that Trump &quot;won the elction in a landslide&quot; is <i>now</i> clear incitement of violence. \nIt&#x27;s knowledge we have after the fact. The violence already happened. \nThe reason Trump wasn&#x27;t banned for those same tweets earlier? Because those same messages could charitably be interpretated as hot air. And Twitter did use that interpretation. They are only seen as inciting violence after the violence.<p>One could argue that waiting with banning people for inciting violence until <i>after</i> the violence occurs is a ridiculously high bar!')
