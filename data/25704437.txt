As epigramist Ashleigh Brilliant noted, &quot;Success for some people, depends on becoming well-known, for others it depends on never being found out.&quot;<p>Or quite often, for becoming <i>differentially known</i> within different domains.  As Sun Tzu writes:  &quot;All warfare is based on deception.&quot;<p>Advantage comes via information arbitrage, by cultivating domestic strength and projecting foreign expectations or images.<p>Cranston gave fascism voice, yes, <i>but not on the fascists&#x27; terms</i>, and emphasizing parts of the message the fascists explicitly wanted suppressed abroad.<p>Cranston used the fascist&#x27;s <i>words,</i> but infused them with his own <i>narrative.</i><p>This is the difference between providing direct access to the microphone --- itself one of Hitler&#x27;s most powerful tools and a notable Nazi Germany technology --- but using exposure tactically and strategically in social interest.')
