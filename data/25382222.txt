Roughly, a 3 credit course consists of 3 hours of lecture and a 1.5 hour tutorial. The courses I took that have more than 3 credits typically have a lab component that adds an extra hour.<p>You are correct that I didn&#x27;t &quot;attend&quot; every single hour of those. But it just further proves my point that just because you&#x27;re sitting in a room designated in your time table, it doesn&#x27;t mean that you are inherently working. Instead of going to those classes, I used my time effectively and studied (not necessarily in the classroom) for a normal 8 hour day. When I say useful work, I don&#x27;t necessarily mean that something is produced. Like you say, sometimes you need to find dead ends before finding the correct path. That&#x27;s useful. Yes, you can work for 12 hours in one day. It&#x27;s just not sustainable. A 80 hour work week implies one of two things:<p>1) You aren&#x27;t working as much as you think. Go to the gym. Hang out with friends. Enjoy life.<p>2) You are about to burnout. Stop. Go to the gym. Hang out with friends. Enjoy life.<p>If you want to keep perpetuating that you need to be in your building for 60-80 hours to be a good grad student, you are directly contributing to the mental health issues seen among  grad students.')
