I do a lot of audio and video work, and after extensive research over the last ~decade I&#x27;ve just got literally half a dozen pairs of Sony MDR-V6&#x27;s around; they&#x27;re $100, they sound pleasant and also reasonably representative (though not as representative as my monitors, which is to be expected!), and unlike the Beyerdynamic DT-990s they actually fit on my head (I am a problem for hat-makers).')
