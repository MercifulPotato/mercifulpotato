Is there a distributed&#x2F;decentralized solution out of this? I am not sure, basically any attempt at adjusting the underlying pricing structure to reflect carbon prices again has to be global and have some sense of fairness built in for newcomers &amp; guess what they dont hold the power to force rich countries to adapt. so we are back to TotC just at the national level. and even if they do or there is a sudden moment of clarity for the rich &amp; powerful countries any voluntary adjustments will only last till there is a real recession then another DJT will be there to spin an &#x27;alternate fact&#x27;.<p>this is why I feel creating another parallel industry of carbon capture may be the only way out of this mess. that too imho will work when fear starts to take hold. the big question is how much time we as a species will have to react before it becomes SHTF.')
