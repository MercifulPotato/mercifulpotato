Outsiders can often get info from people they wouldn&#x27;t share with family members.<p>&gt; All that is both pretty straightforward and fun.<p>Not for most people, and not with any reasonable assurance you&#x27;ll get something &#x27;good&#x27; at the end.  Even scheduling time between multiple people can be a deal breaker.  The OP had posted there never felt like a &#x27;good time&#x27; to do it.<p>Asking good questions, prompting people who aren&#x27;t great (nerves, whatever) can all add a lot of stress to the process.<p>I think you&#x27;re probably a bit of an outlier.
