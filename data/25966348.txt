It&#x27;s true peer-to-peer: Every client is its own server, and the code runs there.<p>I.e. users install &quot;plugins&quot; for Freenet, and those use the network primitives which Freenet provides to establish dynamic connections and render dynamic content.<p>So you <i>can</i> have dynamic HTML if you want to. It&#x27;s just not served by the sites you visit. Instead, things are developed &quot;once and for all&quot; as plugins for all sites and users to use.<p>So it&#x27;s kinda like &quot;forced true decentralization&quot;. You can&#x27;t just shove JavaScript down the throat of random visitors of your site. You actually have to go through the effort of making your site&#x27;s service a real application which people voluntarily choose to run.')
