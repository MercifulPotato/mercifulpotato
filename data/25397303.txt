Item(by='WA', descendants=None, kids=[25415476], score=None, time=1607769073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390798, text='&gt; I have several free sites on Netlify and none of them seem slow at all - all three sites load in under 450ms on Chrome.<p>Does this also measure the time to connect to the server? Not sure if Chrome is perfectly correct. I used <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.pingdom.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.pingdom.com</a><p>I&#x27;m German. My free Netlify sites load twice as slow from Germany than from the US. US: 1.2s, Germany ~2.5s (and I thought Netlify has servers all around the world?!)<p>But still, 1.2s is very slow imho. My website on a dedicated VPS, hosted in Germany, loads in 1.2s from the US and 200ms from Germany. The connection time being the slowest part of all. All websites are static and rather small.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s unfair to compare the free Netlify server to a paid dedicated VPS, but since this thread is about &quot;self-hosting&quot; vs &quot;using Netlify&quot;, I just pointed out that Netlify is slower in my case.')
