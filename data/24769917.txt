I&#x27;ll just speak to one example off the top of my head: the default glibc malloc() stores an allocation size near or below the actual allocation data itself. In contrast, an alternative like jemalloc tracks the size in a separate control block. When freeing allocations with the former, that memory has to be touched; with the latter, the control block has to be touched instead. Similarly it can lead to less or more efficient packing of aligned data. All of this yields better or worse performance depending on the application.')
