I like CocaCola as a product though. Never tried Uber. For example I really like some Nestle products, but try to avoid them because of their bad company&#x2F;brand reputation, even if their product is both cheaper and tastier I buy from a competitor instead. Whatever a company stands for and how they act will affect their brand.')
