You kinda admit that you personally might support the violence.  If even you admit this, then really you should not be pushing back hard on this assumption that other people also supported it.<p>It should not be an out there claim, that other people supported the violence, when you are kinda implying that you support it yourself.<p>I just don&#x27;t think that you should act flabergasted, or surprised, or indignant, or demand large amounts of specific evidence, at someone making a claim that other people supported or wanted violence to happen, given that you kinda are saying that you support it yourself.<p>&gt; The context we&#x27;re in is advocation for violence prior to the events<p>&quot;Nobody advocated for violence before it happened, but now that it <i>did</i> happen I definitely think that the violence is justified!&quot;  feels like a pretty poor argument to me.<p>If you are going to imply that the violence was justified, then really you should not push back on this idea that other people thought it was justified to, and endorsed it prior to the event.')
