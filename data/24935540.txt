There might have been a nuanced point in there if it wasn&#x27;t infested with politics beyond the scope of the article. To talk about Trump and his plans for NASA are relevant, so are the effects of severe technological progress on our daily lives. Yet to then reference Trumps relationship with the media and to claim he has destroyed trust in american insitutions and link an article about how &quot;This has led to a wholly new and different, but still very real, wave of destruction [reffering to coronavirus misinformation].&quot; is so completely sidestepping any usefull discussion about space exploration. (Yes, there are also references to Nazi&#x27;s)<p>nonetheless I feel like pointing out some actual claims.<p>&quot;Indeed, the idea that technological developments will solve all of our problems —eventually allowing us to leave Earth — is instrumental to political mobilization on behalf of the powers that be. It [the idea of technological developments] helps to perpetuate the current socio-economic system that is designed for the one percent to stay in power and the working class to stay working.&quot;<p>Technological developments have been awfull at &#x27;keeping the 1% in power&#x27;. If technological developments truly made sure that &#x27;the 1%&#x27; would stay in power then Bill gates as an example wouldn&#x27;t have been able to go from his &#x27;working class&#x27; status to the top 0.0001% using technological developments. The author&#x27;s statement couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth, unless you are of the opinion that the 1% ought to be so immoral that they dont deserve to exist in the new world of technology.<p>&quot;the wealth divide between the global billionaires and the bottom half of humanity is steadily growing&quot;\nWhen has this NOT been the case? If I manage to aquire any wealth or influence in this world I would give it to those I know that deserve it. This probaly means someone close to me rather than an unknown person who might have needed it more. If parents want anything it is to give their kids the best oppertunities to prosper. What more could you ask for than a millionaire willing to pay a piano teacher for their kid?')
