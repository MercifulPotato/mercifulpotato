(However it seems that the author himself unpublished the article from his Substack.)<p>All of the visceral reactions to the article are... very revealing. It&#x27;s an opinion piece, and you don&#x27;t have to agree with it. If you felt angered &#x2F; hurt &#x2F; offended by the author&#x27;s words, I would challenge you to do some introspection â€“ and explore the reasons why it generated such a strong reaction for you.
