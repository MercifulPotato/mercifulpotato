Both the sound and the music it contributed to are relegated to nostalgia those days.<p>Its popularity in the synth world was quickly eclipsed by Roland-303s and Korg M1s after some mere 5 or 6 years of production. People were very keen to move to anything else and it sorta gave FM a bad rap for a while...<p>Also, Synths like Prophet and Oberheim were already dominating pop when the DX7 popped up, and they paved the way for the DX7. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think the DX7 &quot;changed music&quot;, like the article says. However, unlike the DX7, bands didn&#x27;t stop using those synths when the &quot;next thing&quot; else came (even though they lost some market popularity), and they&#x27;re still sought after today. People still love that Bernie Worrell funky-sync sound.<p>And Moog and ARP were already popular it in the preceding decades and were back on hits in the 90s, with Dr. Dre using a Moog in N.W.A., in his solo and in Snoopy Dogg&#x27;s albums. Trent Reznor used a MiniMoog very prominently in Closer, but treated DX7s as disposable: they were just live MIDI controllers that were meant to be destroyed at the end of every concert.<p>Maybe there will be a DX7 revival but I&#x27;m not really holding my breath. Vaporwave was sort of, but in an ironic way, and using samples instead of the synth itself.')
