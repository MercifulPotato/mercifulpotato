The lower round-trip efficiency of hydrogen means you only use it where batteries can&#x27;t do the job (chemicals, air&#x2F;sea travel, long-term grid storage).  Batteries and hydrogen might both be competitive in certain niches (long-haul trucking, short-haul air&#x2F;water, some train routes). As batteries continue to improve, they will actually cut into the addressable market for hydrogen, at least in mobility (chemicals and long-term storage are safe though).')
