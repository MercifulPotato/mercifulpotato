Especially across the oceans. It&#x27;s not quite as simplistic as this take makes it out to be, since the 5%ile case for networking a packet over tier 1 really is expensive to handle, maintain, bill, and provision.<p>That said, there should be better regulations on tier 1 inclusion. On the other hand, they did make deep investments into infrastructure that took decades to become profitable. Often times with government assurances. It&#x27;s one of the reasons telephony had such high penetration in Canada (75%) at a time when it was much lower in France (~25%), Bell was given assurances that we&#x27;re now paying for in more expensive internet. Not saying it&#x27;s right, but it&#x27;s like this for understandable reasons, and it&#x27;s not strictly raw corruption.')
