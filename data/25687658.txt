In fact, I find it hard to dispute that the popular alternatives are considerably more open-ended, more secure, and apply much less censorship.<p>However, for the sake of argument let&#x27;s assume the characterization is a fair one: that one&#x27;s communications are limited when using an alternative social network where fewer people are registered users. Under this circumstance, what right does any of us have to reach the kinds of people  Facebook and Twitter offer?<p>Perhaps we shouldn&#x27;t necessarily consider it &quot;limiting,&quot; when we are unable to reach all stretches of the globe. One&#x27;s ability to be &quot;heard,&quot; really falls outside their full control as soon as one wants to be understood past the walls of the current room.')
