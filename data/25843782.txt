His writings are much more polemic screeds and less balanced academic analysis.  He sees the US-China situation very much as battle between good and evil (with the Democrats being complicit on the side of evil), has zero nuance and very little sourcing in his books. All of this makes his books rather controversial.<p>All that being said. None of this is evidence for his books actually being wrong.')
