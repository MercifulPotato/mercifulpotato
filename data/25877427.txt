It is not a scale of &quot;good vs evil&quot;, despite what Calvinism has imposed on people&#x27;s brains. If your stance is that leftism is evil, you are entirely free to say or think so, but it <i>still</i> does not change what the ideals of leftism are, and it still doesn&#x27;t make trying to change the definitions of those ideals so that you can call yourself&#x2F;others leftists (for what reason?) any less intellectually barren.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make claiming that I&#x27;m making stuff up when I&#x27;m referring to actual, much-written-about schools of thought that have been critiqued and analysed by people all over the spectrum any less intellectually barren. Reading is free, and many of the works in question are in the public domain.<p>&gt; and wash you hands with the actual, real life examples of how your &quot;ideals&quot; turned out in real life.<p>As if <i>you</i> don&#x27;t?<p>All your boogeymen (boogeymen that I&#x27;m willing to wager have never actually had an effect on your life) are communists. All _my_ boogeymen are capitalists, to this very moment: the UK, France, the Western world in general, first with literal colonisation and currently with a decades-long trail of neocolonialism and outsourcing the cruelty and inequity needed to sustain their economic systems to the parts of the world nobody really cares about. It&#x27;s <i>incredibly</i> telling which of the atrocities of the 20th century get dragged out all the time and which get swept under the rug.<p>&gt; When talking about this stuff, the only actual thing that I will except is real life examples of your ideal government. Because, if I don&#x27;t do that, then leftists will just make a bunch of stuff up, that is not grounded in reality.<p>You know the funny thing about this? My proto-ideal society (cannot really be described or named as a government, because it was acephalous communalism) did exist, and fragments of it still remain. But then the British came.<p>And that&#x27;s essentially the story of the late 19th and the 20th century - nascent right-wing politics and economics running roughshod over nascent leftism, particularly violently so. First with a new wave of colonisation in Africa and Asia to fuel the growth of imperialist capitalism, squashing and integrating various societies that traditionally leant left along the way. And a few decades later with the fascism that swept Western Europe (the quote that free speech advocates like to bring up does not start out with &quot;first they came for the socialists&#x2F;trade unionists&quot; apropos of nothing). The leftist movements that survived were the ones that were big enough and violent enough to resist destruction, and like I have already said without strong systems such movements were doomed to turn totalitarian. Much like right-wing economics was doomed to turn into this current mess of cronyism, de facto oligarchy, and murder for profit.<p>But, again, understanding that would require engaging in good faith and recognising that there are multiple factors that influence this topic, which you seem somewhat loath to do.')
