Call the protocol &quot;Email 2&quot;<p>2. Build something that actually justifies the name<p>I&#x27;m only half joking; the messaging <i>around</i> the protocol is almost as important as the protocol itself. iMessage is a good example of how to expose something like &quot;Email 2&quot; to the end user: as a seamless upgrade, indicated by a subtle UI element, when a client happens to negotiate the upgraded protocol with the server.<p>Enabling incremental upgrades to infrastructure is critical, but strict backward-compatibility isn&#x27;t necessarily so. As long as the architecture of the new protocol makes falling back to IMAP&#x2F;SMTP straightforward when an upgraded client or server isn&#x27;t available, Email 2 doesn&#x27;t have to be able to talk directly to legacy.<p>There&#x27;s certainly a chicken-and-egg problem in driving enough server adoption to get client vendors to add support while driving enough client adoption to get server operators on board, but there&#x27;s probably a sweet spot between making a clean enough break with legacy tech that it&#x27;s more straightforward to implement, while making it <i>conceptually</i> similar enough that it can still plug into the same patterns.')
