Like Ted Kazinsky crazy can be smart and intellectual. The writings seem to make sense, especially for a young mind, and people develop an empathy for the cause. People read his manifesto and others like Mein Kumph and sometimes people, especially growing minds, seem to think it makes sense.<p>YouTube and other videos are much worse because you have full scale productions instead of books and letters. Do you remember the ISIS state videos? Where everything looked peaceful and welcoming? Then when people go there it was hell on earth, some raped, some killed, some even worse.<p>There’s a line we haven’t figured out between free speech and hate speech. Ted’s manifesto is more like free speech but the ISIS stuff and Nazi stuff is pure hate.')
