If I visit Canada using my UK mobile phone, I have to be sure to keep data roaming turned off because I get dinged for Â£6&#x2F;Mb (about US $7.50&#x2F;Mb). Over a couple of weeks, google sipping a bit of bandwidth here or there can actually end up doubling or tripling my monthly bill, even when it&#x27;s single-digit megabytes.<p>(The real problem is of course the existence of the search&#x2F;advertising hybrid business model, which needs to be addressed at a legislative level. But no, costing me a noticeable amount of money under unpredictable circumstances is not an abstract&#x2F;trivial problem.)')
