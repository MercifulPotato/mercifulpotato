(I doubt bloak is actually upset. It&#x27;s mock outrage.)<p>Edit: I was actually confused by the title of the submission which is illustrative of the distinction between the two words.<p>To me, a lay down desk is a desk that can be laid flat, and that&#x27;s what I thought this was going to be. Some kind of desk that could be easily collapsed to make space.<p>Whereas, a lie down desk is a desk you lie down to use.')
