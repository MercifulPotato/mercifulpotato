No doubt some papers were published and cited.<p>Question: Why did none of the operating systems written on L4 work on a practical level to get useful work done?<p>QNX is the one I have heard of most often when someone wants to tout a microkernel based OS success. In fact I&#x27;ve never heard another OS being suggested in that context.<p>Given the repeated claims about the benefits of microkernels, complexity management, better security, self-healing faults, lower bug density etc etc. Why isn&#x27;t QNX the hottest OS that everyone wants to run for just about everything? Certainly everything that needs to be secure on a hostile network. Some might not want the performance trade off of essentially making your cache smaller so things run slower but plenty wouldn&#x27;t mind that trade off at all. Yet it hasn&#x27;t taken off or even gotten a toehold that I can see. Nobody has ever tried to sell me QNX for anything. Remember pwn2own and the various variants - never saw QNX even entered there...<p>Why is that? I feel like there is something being left out of the standard discussion of these things that is crucial. RMS said Hurd didn&#x27;t work out because it was really hard to debug. Is that it? Is there some other reason why microkernels are just too hard to deal with? Are the benefits a bit illusory? Is it something else?<p>These are genunine questions. Usually when I ask them I&#x27;m met with a wall of unsubstantiated claims and anger bordering on abuse. But still no microkernel based OS I can run to do useful work. I wish I understood why I don&#x27;t have a microkernel based OS to even play with better.')
