It&#x27;s really just &quot;how much power am I receiving&quot;. The tuning ends up defining the window of spectrum you average power over.<p>In the frequency domain, you could think of AM demodulation as computing the <i>width</i> (and phase!) between the carrier images on both sidebands. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the signal is a bit off to the side, because the width will be the same. You have a mirror image which gives an absolute reference.<p>In the IQ domain, you look at the magnitude of the vectors, not their angle, so you don&#x27;t care about the frequency.<p>In SSB you only have one sideband, and often no carrier at all, so there is no reference. You need to nail the frequency to get a proper signal out. And even then AIUI your phases will be random, though that doesn&#x27;t matter for audio.')
