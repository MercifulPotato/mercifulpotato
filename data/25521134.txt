My point is that fitbit and similar wrist mounted consumer devices aren&#x27;t currently useful for real health purposes.<p>I was responding to:<p>&gt; Maybe, but since we don&#x27;t have currently good way to use our health data for health purposes<p>My criticism is that the is NO WAY you could use this data, because the data is junk. I even pointed out that there are larger devices that do work. But there are real physical limitations in trying to measure heart rate through the wrist by bouncing light off of the veins. Measuring blood flow through tissue downstream from the heart is an indirect measurement at best. Skin, sweat, tissue composition, and motion all add confounding variable that are hard to correct for in software.<p>The data you do get from the device is do you regularly exercise while wearing the device or not.')
