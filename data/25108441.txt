Item(by='m0zg', descendants=None, kids=[25108566, 25108471], score=None, time=1605505002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108122, text='&gt; COVID-19 has a fatality rate between 1 and 10%<p>There&#x27;s a whole slew of reasons why even 1% estimate is bullshit. Consider this: median age of COVID death is currently 78 years old. US all-age life expectancy as of 2018 is 78.9 years. That is, approximately half the people who are dying of this would die anyway that same year. Now granted, expectancy is a mean, not a median, but you get my point.<p>1% CFR means 3.3 million deaths in the US alone if everyone gets it, which everyone eventually will, and which exceeds even the most ridiculous estimates from March of this year by a factor of 1.5, and is quite obviously not going to happen.<p>It&#x27;s also ridiculously difficult to track down this median age number for the US, by the way. I wonder why that is.<p>That&#x27;s before we even consider how the US has 760 deaths per million, and the likes of Iran or Russia (which have nowhere near the medicine the US has) report one half and one third that correspondingly.<p>So yes, C19 quite obviously has substantially higher CFR than the flu, but 9 months in nobody has any idea as to how much higher. Anyone who says otherwise is selling you something.')
