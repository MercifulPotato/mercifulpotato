I have an iPhone now, but most of my devices aren&#x27;t Apple. Rokus pretty happily stream and interact well with iPhones, Androids, and Windows computers without issue. To me, the fact that Roku both operates well and has wide independent app support and <i>also</i> can be mirrored to from nearly any device is a almost completely unmatched feature set.<p>Even if Roku doesn&#x27;t have my app yet, as long as one device I have it on does, I&#x27;m good. Whereas I stumble over if my iPhone can mirror to my LG webOS TV (it can&#x27;t), for example, and I have to break out a Windows PC just to mirror a show on an app it doesn&#x27;t have.<p>With regards to HBO Max, that was a contract dispute over advertising share. Roku has had the existing HBO app for a long time.')
