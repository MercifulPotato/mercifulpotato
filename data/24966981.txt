Item(by='mlthoughts2018', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604317306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24964710, text='&gt; “ Wait, so at no point in time does it go through your mind that the second person is claiming that the original person is making a descriptive claim about the world that is false, and requesting they put up (evidence) or shut up”<p>You are correct. A “citation needed” comment absolutely does not lead me to think that. The original comment that a “citation needed” comment is replying to <i>might</i> make me think that because of omission of evidence, but any comment that “calls them out” on omission of evidence would only reveal laziness and counter-productive argumentativeness.<p>I would never see a “citation needed” comment and think, “yeah, you’re right, a citation <i>is</i> needed.” I might <i>separately, on my own, and privately</i> come to that conclusion, but never as a result of a “citation needed” comment.<p>I believe you are confused.<p>- Do strong claims need strong evidence? Yes, they do.<p>- Is it useful or rhetorically acceptable to point out omission of evidence with a “citation needed” comment? No, it’s not, and it has nothing to do with strong claims needing evidence.')
