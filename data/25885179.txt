Item(by='willtim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611429104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25883792, text='&quot;Generics&quot; (a.k.a. parametric polymorphism) might be terrible for code clarity in a verbose language with subtyping and little to no type inference, but in many languages they actually <i>improve</i> code clarity:<p>map : (A -&gt; B) -&gt; [A] -&gt; [B]<p>It&#x27;s quite clear from the above type signature what this function does and <i>does not</i> do. It can only use the supplied A&#x27;s to create B&#x27;s using the supplied function. It cannot do anything else with the A&#x27;s and the B&#x27;s. To me, that is clarity.')
