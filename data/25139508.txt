Where does negotiation power stem from? Is it a skill? No. You are a product much like eveything else in this economy and you price is a function of how much you cost (living cost, heavily depedent on location) + supply&#x2F;demand trends. Yes, your attitude and negotiation skills can impact your salary but only by a bit. You can&#x27;t get your salary to tripple by negotiation. Why? What is the force that doesn&#x27;t allow that? Supply and demand of other people who will do the same for less.<p>Thus I argue the trend will be a big decline in salaries for remote jobs in places like SF or London, but a very slight increase in salaries in places like india. The market of remote workers is going global, thus the price for this product will adjust accordingly. There will still be some variation in the salary depending on where you are, but the global min-max difference will decrease')
