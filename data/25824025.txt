Is it comparable to an American physician? German docs can be the highest paid academics in German by a factor of 10, but if American docs make 3x what any German doc makes it&#x27;s kind of a moot point.<p>To do a real analysis you&#x27;d need to see a breakdown of where the money goes. What percentage is to a physician&#x27;s salary, hospital overhead, insurance premiums, etc. for both countries and see where the big disparities are. My guess is, <i>everything</i> is more expensive on the US side, including salaries, and adds up to the big difference in price.')
