As a software developer I&#x27;m pretty sure the happy-path of &quot;reformat and copy everything onto the drive&quot; will work correctly, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that there&#x27;s untested edge cases and bugs in all the varieties of 10.15.0 -&gt; 11.0, 10.15.1 -&gt; 11.0, 10.14.3 -&gt; 11.0, 10.14.4 -&gt; 11.0, etc., not to mention what happens when someone disables SIP to overwrite some system binaries.<p>So far, reformat and install has never given me a problem, but I also don&#x27;t upgrade until Xcode forces me to, so probably the problems tend to be ironed out by then.')
