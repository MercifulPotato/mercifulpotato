I honestly don’t know how people put up with it, especially when some many of them offer no value at all. For example, go back three days on the frontpage and you’ll see 4-5 articles about “How I read book” or “How I take notes”. All of those offer little insight into any of those activities beyond what a high schooler already knows. Meanwhile, they all make it sound like their method is the most useful thing under the sun, and that they should be thanked for their “enlightening research”.')
