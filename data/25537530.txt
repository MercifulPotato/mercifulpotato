Uncharitably, in my experience, these 3 bottlenecks are usually accidental consequences of decisions made by software developers who do not fully understand the whole lifecycle of a web application request&#x2F;response.<p>I usually run Rails on two servers for redundancy. Any features that are CPU expensive I will spin off into a separate service (I’m partial to golang.) This is all on the order of $10s of dollars a month on AWS. 90% of most products’ landscapes are CRUD, and bottlenecked on IO to the database, not expensive CPU calculations.<p>Stripe primarily interfaces with 3rd party payment systems. Anytime a request has dependencies outside of the database, you’re “off the Rails” and should investigate additional options.<p>Shopify is a great example. Last I checked, Shopify is doing great still using Rails for 90% of CRUD and are optimizing just the 10% that they see ROI from.')
