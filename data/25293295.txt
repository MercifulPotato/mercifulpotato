It was easy in classical music; they just started doing auditions behind a curtain, without any verbal Q&amp;A, and suddenly a field that used to be dominated by men became pretty much 50&#x2F;50, and all the people who said that men were better at the highest echelons of musical achievement had to shut up.<p>But tech companies want to talk to the humans they&#x27;re hiring, so race and gender are (almost) always available as information inputs during the hiring process. There&#x27;s no equivalent to the curtain to remove the possibility of bias, so you need to look at alternate methods. Setting hiring targets is one way to do it. If you&#x27;re going to complain that the targets are unfair, you can&#x27;t just say &quot;Well shucks, guess we have to stick with the system that produces massively unequal outcomes.&quot; You&#x27;ve gotta propose a system that&#x27;s less unfair than the status quo.')
