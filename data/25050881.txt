I don&#x27;t want to spend hours on displaying some styled list in my apps, that should be done in a few minutes. SwiftUI allows for that. Once all the bugs are gone, that is. So far, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on SwiftUI&#x27;s bugs. Luckily, you can always dive down to UIKit if all else fails.<p>SwiftUI brings concepts from React and Flutter to the Apple ecosystem, which is great. It&#x27;s especially great for people writing non-trivial software, because we don&#x27;t want to spend our time on doing trivial stuff.')
