If you have someone strong in science but weak in math, their math disability can actively block their ability to learn their favorite subject.<p>But I really shouldn&#x27;t ever bother to discuss this on HN. The only person who knew me before I joined HN knew me through homeschooling and gifted circles and never once said anything nice about me, just politely nitpicked my comments to death for eight years. No one ever said &quot;Dude. Wow. Leave her alone.&quot; Because misogyny and double standards are alive and well.<p>So y&#x27;all feel free to feel like you know more than I do about the topic. My sons are grown. No one here will ever either respect me or pay me for my expertise, so your current pain points on this topic really aren&#x27;t my problem.')
