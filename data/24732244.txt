It&#x27;s an easy way to integrate science and religion so long as you&#x27;re not a biblical (or whatever the equivalent in your religion is) literalist. Maybe god did setup this universe like a giant clockwork toy and all we&#x27;re discovering are the gears and springs of the universe. Discoveries and inventions are still the work of people but the cause of all the natural forces just ultimately trace back to god.<p>It leaves a little crack open for divinity and it&#x27;s a lot around a question of why; why&#x27;d the big bang happen? why are the physical constants of the universe right in a series of bands such that stars, planets and everything else eventually formed? etc. It&#x27;s a question parallel to science that has a lot of answers for what happens where this is more of a philosophical question of why.')
