I love the Joe Rogan Experience podcasts, and the guy is obviously not going to be running for office. My take? The old media is afraid of the new media, and it writes hit pieces like this in order to try to cut down the competition.<p>It also attempts to associate a right-winger like Carlson with a left-winger like Rogan, which amounts to a smear on Rogan. That is utterly distasteful, and it has got to stop.
