But don&#x27;t take your ads under the condition that some content you don&#x27;t like is removed, or content you like is added.<p>Commercial companies should have no say to what I watch, or what news I read, or movies get made, etc, using their advertising dollar.<p>And whatever the content is pornographic, religious, right wing, left wing, communist, fascist, hate speech, or whatever, should be up to the law and the content delivery platform (but only if they do curation in general, e.g. like a news website or Netflix, not like Facebook or Twitter), to remove - not the whims of some commercial company who advertises there.')
