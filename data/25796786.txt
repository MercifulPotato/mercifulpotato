Compiling on the phone itself is simply too slow.<p>I&#x27;ve poured a few hours into fiddling with QEMU aarch64. I&#x27;ve got the compilation going. Still seems too slow, might need to go through the pain of getting cross-compiling working. I also haven&#x27;t been able to get a display working yet.<p>Can anyone recommend a good tutorial for either&#x2F;both:<p>1. Setting up QEMU&#x2F;aarch64 with a working display device? Ideally needs to work on a reasonably old distro so that the executables will dynamically link on a range of distros.<p>2. Cross-compiling for PinePhone or Raspberry pi, which should be close enough to figure out the rest.')
