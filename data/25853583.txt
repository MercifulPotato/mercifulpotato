What I found was interesting.  First, for all the integrals I dealt with, computers can&#x27;t solve them using the rule systems that exist.  Instead, you need a Physics Grad Student who knows how to solve integrals.   Mathmeatica  will just take your integral and spit out a more complicated one.<p>However, Mathematica  is  really good for symbolic algebra!  I wrote a Python-Mathematica bridge many, many years ago, and  learned that not only could it decompose numeric matrices, it could do it for matrices with symbols.  Mind=blown.')
