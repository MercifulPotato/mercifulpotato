It&#x27;s an enormous negative influence on our society, yet there&#x27;s a lot of social pressure pushing for alcohol use, and we allow advertisements that encourage it. I wonder if in the future we&#x27;ll look back on this the way we now look back at how ubiquitous smoking was a few decades ago.')
