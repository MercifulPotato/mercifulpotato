Go out and drive on a highway sometime.<p>I do, and I&#x27;m not in a particularly big state (small New England one.) Yet I pass empty miles and miles of forest, often without a single building in site. Even in normal streets I can go fifteen minutes down my road by car, and the houses thin out to nothing.<p>Unless you restrict the world to maybe what, the 100 most dense megacities, there&#x27;s insane amounts of empty land out there. We are not that dense. The owning and restricting of land through law in many ways seems to be more a part of capitalistic society than a requirement; people have to own land to make money or not make money.')
