Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25294065], score=None, time=1607015070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290622, text='&quot;Virtue signaling&quot; is the all-purpose response to anything they don&#x27;t wish to do solely because you wish them to do it. They don&#x27;t have to engage with whether or not it&#x27;s a good idea. They don&#x27;t have to engage with whether you&#x27;re being serious or not. It&#x27;s just a two-word dismissal: if you care about it, it must be wrong, and no further thought is necessary.<p>For me, it has a convenient counter response: nobody using the term &quot;virtue signaling&quot; has anything useful to say, on any topic. It&#x27;s &quot;vice signaling&quot;, their call-out to their buddies that they, too, don&#x27;t like anything you say solely because you say it. They&#x27;re not listening to me, except for the purpose of rejecting it reflexively, so there&#x27;s no point in talking to them.')
