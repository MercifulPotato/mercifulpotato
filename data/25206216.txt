We could return results in about 250ms, but a large portion of beta testers gave feedback that it felt &quot;shallow&quot;. Added a 4-5 second animation and loading bar, and people gave better feedback on the actual results, etc. Small sample bias? Maybe. But no one ever complained about the speed in the two years we ran it.')
