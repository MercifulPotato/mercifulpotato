Because these blogs are mostly not hyperlinked anywhere (one is a personal quote collection, another is a collection of hacks and tech tips I found useful), Google doesn&#x27;t seem to even have them indexed. Nevermind that I manually submitted them for indexation back in the day.<p>Not that I expected much better from Google at this point.')
