There&#x27;d be a lot right with it, honestly - I would be trumpeting it as a clear victory of the little guy over snobby funds who don&#x27;t think anyone else can understand finance.<p>But what&#x27;s happening right now is almost certainly a pump and dump with a short squeeze as a facade. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of commenters who seem to be grievously misled about the actual mechanics of a short squeeze, and think that short sellers will be forced to buy all their stock at market price on Friday.')
