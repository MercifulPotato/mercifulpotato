Also rebooting without saving the state of the applications opened while the user is working away, not great either. There are reason why security is taking a back seat, business needs are greater than the risk incurred by user bad behaviour.<p>If you have a company in mind, then whatever they do is their problem. This is called risk management. Security takes a back seat until it does not when there are 400 GB of sensitive data that were stolen and are at sale for 10 Mâ‚¬.<p>If that company&#x27;s computers then participate to criminal activities the company should be successfully sued for that. Together with the grandma and families that did not reboot when asked.<p>&gt; BTW how is it that Windows 10 still needs more reboot to update any parts of itself, than a regular Linux distro? The update cycle on my Windows 10 machine is maddening compared to my Linux workstation.<p>That&#x27;s another point. A good point. Every OS has its crapiness, even my beloved Linux that I extensively use since 1994 and still hope, one day, to have on desktop at the quality level of Windows 10.')
