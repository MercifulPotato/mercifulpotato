And then I had stomachache and lost plenty of time.<p>Similarly, another day I was trying to be frugal with time and didn&#x27;t refactor a React component properly before building plenty of features on top of it. And now I&#x27;m facing the consequences and have to rewrite the whole thing.<p>Also: When I was 17 I got my first job as a full stack developer. My boss at that time was being frugal and underpaid me and so I left 3 months later. It has been 8 years since then and his start-up has somehow survived and is doing decent. But I&#x27;m pretty sure my current start-up (which doesn&#x27;t underpay talents for frugality) will be way successful than his.')
