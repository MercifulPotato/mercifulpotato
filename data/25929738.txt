Barriers are closer, but also have slightly simpler semantics, again allowing for a potentially lighter weight implementation.<p>But the semantics are not sufficiently different as to allow for any notably new use cases&#x2F;code flow, certainly not from the examples I&#x27;ve seen. Every one of them could have been written using condition variables at any point in the last 30 years and would look almost indistinguishable.')
