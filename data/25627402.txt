I&#x27;m not sure if the version on the store has the tab backup feature enabled or not but there is a backup feature that is under the options area. It just dumps a json file with all your tabs and a restore feature where it opens up all those tabs again but that is really slow if you have a lot of tabs.<p>Interesting idea on the popup; I&#x27;ll give that some thought.')
