It&#x27;s really, really hard to justify expending the effort<p>If things work flawlessly, do we care?<p>If companies want to support Linux out of the box, they don&#x27;t have to expend resources creating multiple builds and need only to focus on testing a single build. Even a token amount of testing from a single QA engineer (does it run?) would go a _long way_ into ensuring we can run things on Linux.<p>From lurking in wine-dev, games that work but have a few issues progress much faster than ones that don&#x27;t even boot up (or they do but don&#x27;t actually work).<p>It&#x27;s a bit unfortunate that the Win32 api is being used as a lingua franca, but I&#x27;ll take it.')
