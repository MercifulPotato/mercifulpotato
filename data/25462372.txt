This is part of the problem. We need unbiased reviews now more than ever. So many people aren&#x27;t going to share your principles so trying for force the issue by giving a misleading rating is not a good approach. I think it would have been much better to just review it based on the product you&#x27;re purchasing and if you feel so inclined put a big &quot;DISCLAIMER&quot; at the top that people will read first that goes into your feelings on the matter.')
