I agree that something like JavaScript&#x2F;XML is a good place to start when learning new languages because it is so accessible and immediate. I once showed a young, budding nerd how to animate SVG files with jQuery, and I could see his mind being blown in real time. While it is not as deep and has constraints, JavaScript does still have most of the basic concepts required for any of the more advanced languages.')
