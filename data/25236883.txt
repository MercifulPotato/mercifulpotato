I mean the spec is so &quot;loose&quot; that most compilers don&#x27;t even work with the same code if it has any level of serious complexity. Normally that&#x27;s put under the rug of &#x27;undefined behaviour&#x27; but imo it&#x27;s a &quot;vendored version&quot; of the language, the most common variants being MSVC, GCC and CLANG, and even projects which make efforts to be agnostic or have many eyes (linux) can&#x27;t support GCC _and_ CLANG easily.')
