However, the counter notice was sent yesterday and they restored access <i>1 day later</i>, not waiting the legal minimum of 10 days. In restoring access so quickly GitHub isn&#x27;t fully complying with ยง512, opening themselves up to liability if the RIAA decides to pursue legal action.<p>Perhaps a symbolic gesture to restore access a couple weeks before they would have been legally required to restore access anyway, but nonetheless interesting to see their willingness to set aside ยง512 safe harbor protections in the future if their reading of facts suggest a takedown claim doesn&#x27;t have merit.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;512" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;512</a>')
