It&#x27;s up to you to do a cost analysis and decide if it&#x27;s &quot;worth it&quot; -- I use lots of proprietary software, I&#x27;ll admit. Office365 and Steam are two big examples that I either can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t give up because of the professional or personal consequences.<p>However, in both cases, I&#x27;m not in control of either piece of software. That&#x27;s what I get for using proprietary software. It sounds like crazy Stallman ranting, but maybe he was right on this one -- the real solution is to not let proprietary plugins like Flash become &quot;required&quot; to use the net. As long as your computing platform is free, you have the choice not to.<p>The number of people agreeing with this sentiment that this is about controlling our computers is kind of disheartening.
