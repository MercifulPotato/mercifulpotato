Item(by='killtimeatwork', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611833171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25934990, text='&gt; The reality is that if the degree to which you value a stock is based on its PE ratio and other na√Øve but nice sounding metrics, then to be blunt you&#x27;re no more sophisticated an investor than the people blowing their money on GME.<p>Or, the stock market is in a huge, 1929-style bubble and that&#x27;s why the P&#x2F;E numbers don&#x27;t make sense. People don&#x27;t want to even consider that though, because of what it&#x27;d do to their investments. Considering how many people have the money in the markets nowadays, this collective magical thinking can go on for some time. At some point though the value of the stock becomes detached from the actual company and its profits, and the stock becomes just a fiat token that people trade, like crypto.<p>BTW one scenario that can play out in the upcoming years is that the inflation finally catches up with the money printing, which increases the nominal profits of companies (as the dolar value of every product they sell increases), and the P&#x2F;E numbers will again normalize. No idea how likely that is though.')
