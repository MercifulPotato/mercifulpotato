Someone then places all the cash on a table for you to take and you sigh &quot;finally!&quot; and turn around and exit, leaving it all behind on the table.<p>&quot;Empower and walk away&quot; is the american way and until that changes good luck trying to get HSR or anything that benefits the well-being of society.')
