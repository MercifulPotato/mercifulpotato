But that&#x27;s not an argument, it&#x27;s just faith in materialism.<p>What other explanation is there? A magic fairy unicorn in the sky is making the qualia possible? How does that solve the problem you are pointing to, wouldn&#x27;t we still want to get there via &quot;first principals&quot; ?<p>And if we did find a magic unicorn in the sky, we&#x27;d study it and probably eventually understand how it works, what forces are acting upon it or vice versa. And once we&#x27;d done all that, someone on a forum would say of course this can&#x27;t explain qualia because its &quot;just materialism&quot;.')
