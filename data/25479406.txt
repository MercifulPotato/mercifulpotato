It needs to be the path of least resistance or it won&#x27;t happen.<p>Whether that &quot;resistance&quot; is red-squiggly lines in your editor, CI failures, code-review comments, or being told off by your boss for not following company policy, there needs to be some form of control.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read of Google&#x27;s software development process they&#x27;re pretty great at this. Editors warn about a lot of specific stuff (and adding more there is easy), automated code review bots point out issues (and again, adding more of these is easy enough), code-review has strict standards and a process to become a qualified reviewer, generated tests catch incorrect new uses of APIs, etc.<p>In my experience, teams don&#x27;t invest in this sort of tooling enough, which means that rolling out changes like &quot;let&#x27;s not use memcpy&quot; or &quot;let&#x27;s move to Python 3&quot; become much harder, and this certainly impacts security.')
