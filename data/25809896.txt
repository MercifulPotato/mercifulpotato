It was nothing other than in-group&#x2F;out-group signalling. It&#x27;s the same type of signals that lead to bubbles in the first place. The sad thing is that the bubbles we have seen on the Web are increasingly toxic because the way FAANG (and all the FAANG copycats) think it should work.<p>Yesterday I was on YT with a fresh account, a VPN and a totally new hardware, and got immediately a recommendation for &quot;Titania McGrath&quot; (which IMO is funny), but I also know the next videos YT will show me after watching it is radicalizing trash that tries to convince me that I should fight the &quot;woke&quot; ideology. It is almost like in the first days of every new online identity platforms make people &quot;choose their battle and weapons&quot; ...<p>Bubbles are normal and they would still exist in gemini:&#x2F;&#x2F; but they would be a lot less toxic than when you have sh1t merchants like FAANG shaping people&#x27;s ideology.<p>(organic) info-bubbles are a good thing. But what we have is a situation where Web companies like FAANG are in the business of producing them artificially. The more isolated people are behind their little screens the better for these companies.')
