The parents of my stepmoms also divorced and remarried. Our lives are all so much better because of it.<p>Yes, managing holidays with a complicated family is complicated, but that&#x27;s really a minor inconvenience. Me and my step-sisters have two sets of stable parents that we can go to if we need help, and an even larger support network of aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. beyond them. Our parents are much happier and that in turn gives them more energy to be supportive. No matter how unusual a problem, there&#x27;s almost always someone in my extended family who has experience with it and advice.<p>Divorce doesn&#x27;t have to make life less stable. It can make life richer and more stable. If you care about the children but the marriage isn&#x27;t working, it&#x27;s better to divorce while you&#x27;re still capable of co-parenting than wait until you&#x27;re constantly arguing and can&#x27;t stand the sight of each other. That&#x27;s part of fighting for stability as well.')
