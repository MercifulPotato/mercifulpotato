On 1, in case you have a synology NAS, it does not offer full disk encryption. Its folder encryption also has a number of problems. Your mitigation here (back ups) doesn’t help with loss of data to others.<p>* Network security. In addition to the physical security, consumer NAS devices  don’t do enough in network security. Some of them come with closed source operating systems with a lot of potentially dangerous sharing and networking features. The code is often not reviewed.<p>On 2., you can use ZFS or btrfs, and they offer good features, but come with separate set of problems.<p>I spent some time on NAS security and couldn’t find a good solution. I thought I better let Amazon and google to secure my data.')
