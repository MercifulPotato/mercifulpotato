After Mao the whole political model was &quot;collective&quot; so no one could become so strong he would become an Emperor, Xi changes that by removing the  two term (10 Yrs) rule of leadership. The CCP had one thing for legitimacy, economic growth.  For 30 years China become richer and freer.  In 2007 even people in HK were proud to be Chinese. That is not the case anymore. China peaked internationally in 2017.<p>Post-Xi China whenever that occurs will be a large poor country surrounded by enemies without easy access to global markets. It is impossible to use any Chinese product without the possibility of the use of slave or child labour within the supply chain.<p>China is more likely to return to Warlordism than become rich.<p>TL:DR - China became richer and freer post-Mao and now that process has reversed and China is becoming less free and poorer.')
