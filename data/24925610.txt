If the what happened in the CA incident is wrong, the NYU incident is wrong too (ethically. I am not a lawyer and can&#x27;t comment on legality). If CA was not wrong, this isn&#x27;t wrong either.<p>Since at least in the court of public opinion, CA was wrong and FB was a terrible company for letting CA happen, then well FB is doing the right thing by asking NYU to stop.')
