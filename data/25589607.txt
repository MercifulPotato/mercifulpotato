As if people were supposed to specifically review licenses they create, whether they&#x27;re compatible with every GPL clause. Nobody needs to care about GPL, it doesn&#x27;t deserve special treatment.<p>Other licenses not compatible with GPL:<p>- Apache License (only version 2 is compatible and only with version 3 of GPL);<p>- GPL (v2 vs v3), as other comments already mentioned.<p>Are the authors of those licenses bullies?
