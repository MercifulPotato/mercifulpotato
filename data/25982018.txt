From the standpoint of software developers being able to grok it, it looks like a strong improvement on the MIT and BSD families.<p>If you are serious about adoption, I suggest providing an official header to embed in files.  Something simple like this:<p><pre><code>   &#x2F;&#x2F; Licensed under https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blueoakcouncil.org&#x2F;license&#x2F;1.0.0\n</code></pre>\nAlso &quot;instructions on how to use this license in your software project&quot; would be helpful.  (Paste the text of the license into a file named &quot;LICENSE&quot;, &quot;LICENSE.md&quot;, or similar.  Add the header as a comment to every file...)')
