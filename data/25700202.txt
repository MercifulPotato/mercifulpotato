And in my experience non nominal type system as seen in TypeScript are already helpful making changes easier then in JavaScript. But it&#x27;s still harder to change (larger projects) in TypeScript then e.g. in Rust (assuming the type system was not abused!!).<p>- To be fair abusing type systems is in my experience often worse then not having a nice type system.')
