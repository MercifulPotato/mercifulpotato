Headaches without. I often wake up a few times each night to drink  water to get rid of dehydration headaches. And I carry water with me all the time, thirst all day, headaches when it runs out. (like yesterday). Worse in the desert.<p>One guy I worked with suffers from extreme debilitating migraines and only drinks about 1&#x2F;4 of the amount of liquids that I find necessary to avoid headaches. (which is about ~3-4 litres&#x2F;day). I would tell him if I did the same I&#x27;d have major headaches too. But no, he doesn&#x27;t want to hear it, says water doesn&#x27;t work. Too dumb perhaps.<p>Actually I can feel a slight headache now so will go drink some more water to get rid if it. If it hurt more I&#x27;d reach for 400mg of ibuprofen or two and, of course, more water.')
