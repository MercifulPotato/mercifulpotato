On windows thats easy, control + delete. On Mac, somehow I never remember how to do it and end up deleting the entire line of text. It&#x27;s just stupid.<p>Also, want to delete a file? Yeah that&#x27;s going to be a different keystroke, the delete is only for text.<p>But wait, you&#x27;d think that surely you could just remap that little fingerprint key which does absolutely nothing when pressed? Nope, it&#x27;s unmappable. :-)')
