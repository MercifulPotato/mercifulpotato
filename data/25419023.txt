Everyone does.<p>The engineers building this software don&#x27;t need philosophical training. Instead, they need a personal&#x2F;professional ethics (or, in lieu of such self-regulatory instincts, government regulation). Again, neither of those presents a philosophical problem.<p><i>&gt; Other engineering disciplins whole-heartedly disagree. Regulation is besides the point.</i><p>I disagree. Other engineers disagree precisely because they operate in highly regulated disciplines. PE codes of ethics are not (just) personal ethical commitments; rather, they are (also) backed by the force of law. BTW, lots of engineers build WMDs.')
