Item(by='nightcracker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607546756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360012, text='Suppose my <i>data</i> is a single letter, the letter &#x27;x&#x27;. I might <i>represent</i> this data as (for example):<p><pre><code>    1. The integer 24, as x is the 24th letter of the alphabet.\n    2. A picture of a handwritten x.\n    3. The symbol x, as I did above.\n    4. The integer 120, as in ASCII.\n</code></pre>\nAll of these represent the same data, despite being different.<p>Data representation often has multiple layers. For example\nthat integer 120 from ASCII is then often represented as a single byte containing bits 01111000. The &#x27;symbol x&#x27; has some unspecified representation. The picture might be represented using vector art, or an array of pixels, each with a color (which then requires[1] a representation for the colors).<p>Now suppose I&#x27;d want to write a function that gives the next letter after the symbol I&#x27;d give in. Choosing the right representation for your data can make this easy or hard.<p>For the example above, representations 1, 4 are very easy (simply increment the number of the representation by 1), 3 is somewhat easy, and 2 is highly impractical.<p>---<p>[1] I said something requires a representation. But this is only true when creating a concrete implementation. But while designing algorithms or systems it can often simplify things to simply think of the <i>data</i>, and not its <i>representation</i>.')
