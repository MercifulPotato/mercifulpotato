Since this sort of worked, I added Woo Plugin. Results on these sites provide (in part) affiliated links. They generate some money, but not that much.<p>Things I hadn&#x27;t anticipated:<p>- Sellers not allowing you access to their affiliate program because a) you haven&#x27;t bought the product yourself or b) the sites only &#x27;list&#x27; products, but don&#x27;t actively sell&#x2F;review the product.<p>- Most sellers are okay, but some need a continued reminder that they actually have to pay the generated affiliate fees, increasing required labor input.')
