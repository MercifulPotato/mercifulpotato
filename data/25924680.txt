WaitGroup has an ability that latch doesn&#x27;t: WaitGroup can Add() and subtract (Add() with negative) whereas latch can only subtract (latch has to be initialized with its maximum value). The fact that latch is initialized with its value could be a little more convenient than WaitGroup in some situations (save 1 line of code). latch has an ability that WaitGroup doesn&#x27;t: .try_wait(). Also latch&#x27;s .arrive_and_wait() can save a line of code compared to WaitGroup.')
