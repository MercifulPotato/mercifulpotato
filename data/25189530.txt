The concentration of wealth allow for an ever greater capture of markets as well as the government that would reign in their monopolistic behavior. This should be obvious with what just happened with Uber, who successfully bought legislation to defend their unprofitability but movement towards monopoly, and has large executive overlap with the former Obama&#x2F;soon-to-be Biden administrations.<p>&gt;I still maintain that structurally unprofitable companies are an abberation caused by negative interest rates, and I don&#x27;t think it would be recognised as capitalism by time travellers from the 70s.<p>Maybe its not an &quot;abberation,&quot; but fiscal policy put in place to further the wealth and power of existing Capital owners? It&#x27;s also irrelevant in practical terms what people 50 years ago called something versus today. Countries, businesses, religions, ideologies etc  both <i>persist and change</i>, regardless of whether they remain recognizable to anyone at a given point in time.')
