Again, we&#x27;re spending a tremendous amount of energy and attention on things that future generations will laugh at. This is no similar than the billions of people who can&#x27;t learn to wear a face mask properly. We&#x27;re the laughing stock of the future. Should I refer to my boy or girl to they to be PC-compliant, too? How shameful is to associate your children with specific genders, right? As typical flawed humans, we&#x27;re blowing everything out of proportion, we keep pressing and pressing, until matters burst into uncontrollable chaos!')
