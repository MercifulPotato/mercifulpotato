If you want an &quot;immediate&quot; transaction, you do a wire transfer, and pay $30-60 for it, which is a hefty sum. That was one of the original &quot;problem statements&quot;. Of course, BTC transactions are now very expensive, and that&#x27;s an issue until lightning solves that.<p>As far as loans - the theoretical, grand idea there is that the loan market becomes global, e.g. Americans can loan to Sierra Leone, where they don&#x27;t have access to a traditional, efficient banking system. Again, a pipe dream for now. Btw, there are other coins claiming to do loans based on reputation, but so far, I haven&#x27;t seen them working well. And of course, there will be scammers.')
