Basically it&#x27;s an intelligent PCI-e &lt;=&gt; network bridge that lets you emulate&#x2F;share PCI-e devices on the host while the actual hardware (NVMe storage, GPU, etc.) is located elsewhere.  This lets you reconfigure the host in software without having to physically change the hardware in the servers itself.  It also lets you change the way you have things in the server rack since everything doesn&#x27;t need to be able to physically fit into every other server case.<p>EDIT: informative article about DPUs, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing-unit-quick-primer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing...</a>')
