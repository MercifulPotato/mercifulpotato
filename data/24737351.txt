Just as private actors may have a profit incentive, technocrats have an incentive in promulgating a technocratic regime. Additionally there may be 3rd parties positioning themselves to profit from the aforementioned regime of regulations.<p>Hopefully reasonable people may be able to agree that a profit motive isn&#x27;t necessarily evil. Similarly, government&#x2F;supranational institutions and the individuals within are not absolute in their nature. Blanketedly tarring and feathering the outcome of a program or research simply because of an implied profit motive strikes me as illogical. Additionally it is hypocritical in the context of potential technocratic conflicts of interest.')
