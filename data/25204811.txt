It works because probability works.<p>People think entropy is some natural phenomenon in nature that is fundamental.<p>No. Entropy is a consequence of probability. The math works because probability happens to apply to nature. The below is the intuition behind why entropy occurs... once you will realize this it will make sense.<p><pre><code>   Disordered states tend to be more numerous then ordered states that&#x27;s why any random configuration of gas particles in a system is more likely to be disordered.\n\n   Also when you try to purturb the state of random particles from state1 to state2, by probability state2 will be disordered because there are far more possible disordered states than ordered states... even when the initial state is ordered. Hence entropy increases. \n</code></pre>\nThe philosophical thing people should be examining is the nature of probability and reality which we already know is intrinsically tied with the nature of fundamental particles.<p>Probability is an axiom, entropy is a theorem derived from the axiom of probability.')
