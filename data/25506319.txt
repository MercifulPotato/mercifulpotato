Not poisonous like lead, or deadly like uranium in ceramics. Instead they are a bit more sneaky. While plastic in itself is not so bad, all the other stuff in plastic is. Take BPA [1], a known endocrine disruptor. It is especially bad for humans in the early stages of development and has life long effects. Boys will have less testosterone (leading to multiple knock off effects) and girls will have earlier puberty, more breast and other types of cancer. Because the doses are so low the effect are not typically seen in individuals. Instead we detect them on population scale. An example is the testosterone levels of men is dwindling each year [2]. Of course correlation does not equal causation, but more and more studies are pointing to chemical disruption.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;21605673&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;21605673&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;jcem&#x2F;article&#x2F;92&#x2F;1&#x2F;196&#x2F;2598434?login=true" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;jcem&#x2F;article&#x2F;92&#x2F;1&#x2F;196&#x2F;2598434?login...</a>')
