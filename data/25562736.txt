You need to be in IO in order to catch an exception.<p>That is to say, if you have:<p><pre><code>   bam :: (Int, Int) -&gt; String\n</code></pre>\nThere is no way to write:<p><pre><code>  bam (x,y) = &quot;bar&quot; if x is called first\n                     &quot;baz&quot; if y is called first.\n</code></pre>\nHowever, if you were to instead have:<p><pre><code>  bam :: (Int,Int) -&gt; IO String\n</code></pre>\nSuch a function is possible to write, as you can now catch the exception and do something with it.')
