Perhaps you accidently did this. The reason for you going back in time still exists.<p>However, I believe the worst that could come of this would be to split the timeline in the case that string theory and multiverses exist where the timeline we return to is one that is different than the one we came from.<p>What if we really are living in a simulation?<p>Could it be possible that any moment we arrive in the past would possibly have a random outcome on the future? What if every choice from the moment you arrive to the moment you left could have a random effect, and thus the world you arrive back at if it is a closed loop could be different as night and day, simply because all events that happened after your arrival were erased and all choices were given a second chance to arrange themselves like coin tosses mixed with end-user free agency.<p>If that were the case, how would you prove that it&#x27;s a randomized closed loop vs string theory since to you the time-traveler, everything has changed which the easiest reason would be you&#x27;re in a different timeline. It never dawned on you that events along the timeline could be shuffled at anytime and are inconsequential to how the universe works because we&#x27;re actually in a simulation.')
