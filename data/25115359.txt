You waited a few months, and then safely enjoyed 10.x.x updates for another 2-3 years.<p>With the annual release, your 10.x version comes out every year, the 10.x.1 version a few months later but it’s hardly as well tested, and you’re probably better off waiting for 10.x.2 and then by the time that’s done, Apple is already preparing you for 10.x+1.')
