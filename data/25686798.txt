If not, then magnet links make sense; researchers can then seed their own papers, and by downloading from them, you&#x27;re essentially downloading a paper with their consent.<p>And of course the magnet links isolate sci-hub. And it provides necessary and practical non-piracy validity to torrenting, which helps keep that protocol alive further.')
