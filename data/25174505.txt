Item(by='unclekev', descendants=None, kids=[25174640], score=None, time=1606013379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25174379, text='14 year club here as well.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the following are fundamental changes that have impacted the community in a big way:<p>- Selling 10% of the business to Tencent&#x2F;Chinese investors<p>- Firing their community managers in 2015 and not replacing them<p>- When I first joined Reddit it was more technology focused, now it&#x27;s all pop culture and memes. Although Tech subs are still plentiful so it can still be that site. (With some effort)<p>- Banning any Sub-Reddit&#x27;s that go against whatever the admins mood is on a particular day, or content that no longer fits with their &quot;We have shareholders and need to keep them happy&quot; mantra. Reddit is absolutely not a place for free speech&#x2F;uncensored discussions these days. Because of both toxic mods and horrible admins.<p>- Huge increase of censorship across the site in Sub-Reddit&#x27;s, Posts and Comments<p>- Users care about the video stuff because Reddit&#x27;s video hosting is fundamentally broken and hardly works, but they would rather keep it broken because it makes it harder to download videos (DASH)<p>- The whole new design is anti-user, the site is just masses of white space, super slow, JS heavy and pretty much unusable outside a third party mobile client. The day old.reddit.com gets shut down will be a sad day.<p>None of this stuff was a problem 14 years ago<p>Although some of the above comes with the toxicity that tends to come with huge community growth.<p>You can argue the above isn&#x27;t significant, but as someone who&#x27;s been on the site for 14 years, it sure ain&#x27;t the same place I signed up for all those years ago.')
