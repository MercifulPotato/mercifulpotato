The United States is the only country ever to use nuclear weapons, and is also one that I reside in. If I lived in Russia or China, I would advocate for unilateral disarmament in those countries as well. Nuclear weapons are an absolute horror and should be completely eliminated from this planet. The United States (unlike China) does not even have a &quot;No first use&quot; policy -- it reserves the ability to use nuclear weapons aggressively or pre-emptively.')
