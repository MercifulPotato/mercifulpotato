Chinese &quot;peaceful expansion&quot; is also being the 2nd last out of 6 claimants to conduct land reclamation or weaponize features in South China Sea disputes. Chinese &quot;peaceful expansion&quot; is _INHERITING_ all these disputes from ROC (Taiwan) i.e. they are not dispute of CCP&#x27;s making, but hand me down disputes that must be resolved somehow... which China has done mostly diplomatically so far, with minimal blood shed.<p>Without exaggeration, PRC ascent and border resolution is unprecedentedly peaceful relative to human history. In terms of modern dispute management, it&#x27;s has been the most peaceful. Japan has disputes with 5&#x2F;5 her maritime neighbours. And she&#x27;s an island.<p>&gt; At least in America we (almsot always) give you a trial before we kill you.<p>lol what is this, modern China has trials too. Maybe one day China&#x27;s foreign policy will use paperwork to make enhanced interrogation not torture, and droning combatants not random civilians.')
