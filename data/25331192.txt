It&#x27;s somewhat mitigated in the commercial sector since commercial clients have incentive to &quot;brand&quot; their buildings as sustainable, but it&#x27;s depressing as hell in the residential sector. Although it would definitely be harder (albeit, have way more impact) to use the EFFORCE model during new construction versus retrofits.')
