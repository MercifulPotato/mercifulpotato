(Smoking) 35,000? (Traffic accidents) 5? (Amoeba infecting the brain)<p>But are those being ignored (not sure about the Amoeba bit)?  Do we routinely mock those who say smoking is bad?  Do we ignore traffic fatalities by ripping seat belts and air bags out of vehicles?  Are autonomous vehicles widely derided as not useful?<p>The response absolutely needs to be proportionate to the risk.  I never said anything different.  In fact, in NYC most of the city is open again, because the impact and risk have been reduced -- by taking the virus seriously and a broad segment of the population are taking steps to protect themselves and others.  What&#x27;s more, widespread testing and tracing enable us to identify outbreaks and limit their spread.<p>I don&#x27;t see that as overreaction.  I see it as taking a public health issue seriously and engaging the populace in mitigating&#x2F;minimizing it.<p>&gt;If you say none, do you agree that the measure still needs to fit the threat? Stopping driving would eliminate the cause of death, but it would cause other problems.<p>I didn&#x27;t say anything even approaching that.  Please don&#x27;t try to put words in my mouth.')
