It helped target early adopters in a market.<p>I had 2 Nissan LEAF from 2013-2018 and was keenly aware that I was enjoying a piece of the future. Part of the experience was simply revolutionary: quietness, no gas station, amazing torque.<p>At the same time, being an early adopter had a steep cost: limited range, limited charging options outside of home. (As it turned out, that cost turned out to be less steep than perceived, and simple planning made it pretty much a non-issue.)<p>This is obviously a generalization and there are exceptions but there seems to be a large overlap between those willing to have a radically different product that comes with severe drawbacks, and those who enjoy the quirkyness of it. And yes: the status (even if it&#x27;s a subconscious thing for most people).<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the 2019 Nissan LEAF was redesigned to look like regular cars, just as its battery doubled in capacity (tripled if you compare from the first models). It signaled that it was no longer cutting edge and ready for mainstream. Anecdotally, tax agencies agreed as most tax incentives were either dropped or severely reduced around that time.')
