Anyway, this is not a new problem. In fact, &#x27;seditious libel&#x27; was a totally different concept back in the 1790&#x27;s - we actually have more freedom of speech than before. Without going to much into that - the Alien &amp; Sedition Acts were aimed at this type of newspaper rags. There were many newspapers and operaters that were foreign born, or foreign influenced, peddling influence in the young United States. Part of the motivation of the Federalists was due to a widespread fear of imminent war with France. France and the United States were in the midst of the &quot;Quazi-War&quot; which well, wasn&#x27;t exactly a war. Democratic-Repubicans (think jefferson and other extremely liberty minded politicians and journalists) were supporters of the French Revolution, and many wanted a similar revolution in the States to remake American society.<p>Not so many were prosecuted under these acts, but many did flee or change their tone.<p>This all to say that the influence of newspapers is not a novel issue, and the issue remains alive today, especially amidst the current wave of very Yellow Journalism.<p>Anyway. I thought it was interesting - I may have botched some of the details.')
