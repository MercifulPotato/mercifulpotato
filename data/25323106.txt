That&#x27;s why Codd&#x27;s paper has hardly any references, he pretty much made it all up, to solve a practical problems he saw (unnecessary rewriting of code). Though he <i>was</i> a mathematician, so...<p>The limits of knowledge, of what can be proven, is to do with &quot;computability&quot; - sure <i>sounds</i> like a prpgrammer thing!<p>So maybe you have something there...')
