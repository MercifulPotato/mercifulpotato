You could eat out every single night and buy a new BMW twice a year, and still save more than 20% of your take-home pay.<p>Not only that, but we&#x27;re talking about salaries for ONE SINGLE PERSON. Married in tech? We&#x27;re talking a $900k annual salary. Calling this lifestyle &quot;very economical&quot; is so insanely out of touch with how most people live their lives, it&#x27;s no wonder tech people are hated as completely out of touch.<p>Edit: Changed $24k to $21k, the calculator I used didn&#x27;t include state taxes even though California was the chosen state.')
