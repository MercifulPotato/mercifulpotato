Innovation in UI&#x2F;UX have been stagnant with little changes. Most development is about APIs and other internals. Anything that will have impact on less than 2B users is not prioritized &#x2F; not worth the effort. And doing significant changes for 2B users is risky.<p>Meanwhile Opera takes a market niche, bundles multiple things to target this market niche and improve their UX considerably.<p>The browser is <i>user agent</i> but the market leaders sometimes forget it. Then smaller players show up and often come with some really nice things.')
