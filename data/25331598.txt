This heat is tax-free since the heat is a &quot;waste product&quot;, keeping the single biggest energy use sector at an artificially low price (energy use for heating is bigger than transport and consumer electricity).<p>It would be political suicide to start taxing the energy for heating, leading to all kinds of weirdness such as:<p>- Denmark _paying_ to export electricity when the power stations need to run to produce heat (because if the power plants used the electricity to provide heating, the heat would not be a waste product)!<p>- Big data centers cannot sell waste heat for heating, because they would need to run heat engines to raise the temperature to usable levels, again rendering the heat &quot;not a waste product&quot;.<p>(TBH, The last one is so clearly stupid that a workaround in the rules is in the books)')
