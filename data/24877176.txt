Nexus, Pixel, Chromecasts, GMail, Fi, Android TV, Google Domains...<p>I&#x27;m about done.  It seems like every month they do something to make it more apparent that they&#x27;re just an advertising company.  Products fail to get maintained, they get upgrades that make them less useful, or they&#x27;re outright cancelled.<p>I&#x27;m planning on de-Googling a bit soon.  I may stick with Android, although iPhones or FOSS options are tempting.  I feel like I can&#x27;t stomach supporting Google when they continue to make misstep after misstep.')
