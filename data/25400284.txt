Item(by='BryantD', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607797444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399565, text='I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s rarely been decided by a public debate. It&#x27;s traditionally been decided by (for example) the small number of companies who are in the business of publishing textbooks. Or the small number of people who teach law at prestigious universities. Or the small number of people who decide which textbooks will be bought in Texas, particularly since Texas is a large enough market so that this decision affects other states as well. Or religious figures, laying down a decision about what doctrine can be taught in churches.<p>Obviously in the past these small groups of people have made the wrong decision, and sometimes that&#x27;s had very bad consequences. I am not arguing that this is a good methodology. I <i>am</i> arguing that we can&#x27;t assume that public debate will generate a better set of decisions.')
