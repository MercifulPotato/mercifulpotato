Meanwhile, the people have freedom subject to laws restricting their behavior (i.e. default allow). This means Twitter, Facebook, etc. can restrict speech on their platforms in ways governments often cannot, in the absence of laws that compel them not to. And in any event, such laws may well be unconstitutional.')
