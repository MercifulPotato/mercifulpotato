Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=[25598898, 25598987], score=None, time=1609458018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598564, text='Yeah, Coinbase changed the other year, only for US citizens, where a passport is insufficient, you need to prove state residency (i.e. for most people, a driver&#x27;s license).<p>But one of my points here is that, while I&#x27;m sure some people here are chomping at the bit to nail me with a gleeful &quot;see? ironic!&quot;, I simply don&#x27;t have to use Coinbase. I can, for example, exchange Bitcoin locally the same way I can trade USD for pesos with my roommate. I was SOL at one point when I was simultaneously banned from Paypal while my bank at the time spontaneously rejected further access to my own account, the two institutions I was depending on to operate abroad. It&#x27;s what made me turn to Bitcoin, and I began considering how ridiculous the state of our financial status quo where I have precarious access to my own money.<p>I can appreciate that my outlier needs make it hard for people to relate to me the same way most people don&#x27;t understand why an HNer cares about Linux when Windows works for them, but I think most people here are disappointingly eager to reject any possible upside of &quot;digital cash&quot;. Even if its upsides are exceedingly niche for most people, that&#x27;s not reason to dismiss them.<p>To me it&#x27;s like reading an HN thread where everyone dismisses Purism&#x27;s smartphone because Android and iPhone do the job for 99.9999% of people, and who the hell could possibly care about separating the CPU from cellular baseband? Or maybe they&#x27;re claiming that only criminals would care about that. Well, that very few people are in a position to appreciate it has no basis on whether we deserve the option.<p>This is my last comment on this particular submission.')
