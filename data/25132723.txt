Item(by='t0astbread', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605668497, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25132381, text='There might be an official standardized explanation for this but the way I see it, certificate expiry has two reasons:<p>1) It&#x27;s an assurance that the verification of identities&#x2F;servers (or whatever) behind the certificate is at least somewhat recent<p>2) Certificates imply a loose agreement between the certificate holder and the world that the certificate holder keeps the private key safe. The expiry date automatically ends that agreement.<p>Time is relevant in both cases but it&#x27;s not that relevant that the timing is exact in web browsing. Identity verification is still about as fresh one day after expiry. The second case is a bit more critical but chances are certificate holders don&#x27;t leak their private keys immediately after expiry.<p>Giving a &quot;grace period&quot; with noticeable but non-blocking warnings (something like the &quot;this site recently had an account breach&quot; popup in Firefox perhaps) might cause website operators to find out about the problem without disrupting the service. It would be a good idea to standardize the length of the grace period.<p>Off the top of my head I can only think of one situation that might turn problematic and that is when an expired certificate gets compromised. I&#x27;m not familiar with how CAs do it but I hope renewal automatically revokes the renewed certificate already. It would also need to be possible to explicitly revoke an expired certificate if something like a grace period existed.')
