They exist as a separate entity, whether China likes it or not.  And some of us refuse to deny reality just because China wants us to.<p>It&#x27;s more complicated than that, of course.  Taiwan is <i>de facto</i> a separate nation, but both Taiwan and the mainland agree that they are one China.  They just disagree about which government is the legitimate ruler of that one China.  One suspects that the CCP would not be pleased if we replied that, yes, China is an inalienable part of the territory ruled by the government of Taiwan, even though we would be (technically) <i>agreeing</i> with them about one China.')
