Too long have universities maintained the illusion that all subjects are worth studying. They are not. And we have a valuation mechanism - pay. The truth is that some subjects need far fewer participants than others. You don’t need the marginal new mathematician or historian or geographer.<p>We do need the marginal electrical engineer or software engineer. It is crucial that we signal to students their prospects accurately and operate our collective learning facilities in the interest of the public.<p>The number of support staff required to service a bug organization does grow super linearly which is a reason to have smaller universities. These institutions suffer massive diseconomies of scale past a certain size as information transfer suffers.<p>Unfortunately, support staff grow more support staff at a higher rate than productive staff so it is necessary to keep university size small.<p>But of course, Tim Gowers is a bit of a luminary, so maybe I’m entirely wrong on all of this.')
