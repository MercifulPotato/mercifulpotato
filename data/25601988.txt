Item(by='jocc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609493495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600942, text='Hi there!\nI scraped the web apps from PH, that is true.<p>&quot;It would have been great if you actually rated the execution of each site, i.e. your own personal opinion of 1 to 5. As well as potential market size or that company&#x27;s current MRR (as is popular on IndieHackers)&quot;<p>I see what you mean, but this 9,000 list had a different goal than that. I plan to do something like this, but then I would have a fairly smaller list than this.\nJust this list took me 2 weeks to gather from start to finish, it would have been much more if I take the time and rate every one of them.<p>&quot;Is it fair to say &quot;validated&quot; just means &quot;submitted to product hunt&quot;? If so, I think it would be better to state that up front.&quot;<p>No, I hope that I can clarify that for you.\nI used the following criterias when scraping from PH:\n- more than 249 upvotes (so it&#x27;s fairly popular)\n- has more than 5 reviews\n- BUT the rating is lower than 3.21<p>This way my goal was to get popular but &quot;badly&quot; executed products from there.<p>I&#x27;m really sorry to hear that you are disappointed - do you want me to refund you?\nBy the way, my next list will focus on Web apps completely.\nIf you want, you can give me your email and either choose to:\n- get a refund\n- give you a massive, unique discount once my new list gets posted.<p>Tell me what you think. :D')
