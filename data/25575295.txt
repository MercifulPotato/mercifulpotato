This doesn&#x27;t work for consumers (i.e. you can&#x27;t say &quot;If everyone stops buying plastic bags, we do something for the environment&quot;, because well, nobody cares... You have to make selling plastic bags either illegal or add a significant surcharge that causes consumers to avoid them for reasons that actually affect them, like &quot;too expensive&quot;)<p>And it doesn&#x27;t work for anything else either. As long as there is funding, this will go on. The &quot;solution&quot; is to stop funding, but apparently since funding is still flowing, someone still values the research. So what is even the problem?<p>No progress has been made? Well, if funding is still there, whoever funds this seems to be beyond happy with the progress. This is a non-issue.')
