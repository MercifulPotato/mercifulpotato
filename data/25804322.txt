The second one is somewhat related to the first one or could even be the result of fake positivity. Working during a paid time off (PTO) is terrible for culture – makes your co-workers feel guilty if they won&#x27;t spend a few hours at work during their PTO. I almost feel like an employee&#x27;s access to Slack&#x2F;E-mail should be restricted to read-only while they are on vacation.<p>If you are one of those two, stop kissing your manager&#x27;s ass! Enjoy your vacation–forget about work.')
