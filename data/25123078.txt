My teams tend to be around 6-8. Across a dozen teams, myself and nobody on the team save a couple even looked at the graph. One who loved a clean history showed it off, people thought it was pretty, and went back to work as normal. `git commit -am &#x27;slightly helpful message&#x27; &amp;&amp; git push origin $branch` does about 90%+ of what I&#x27;ve needed.
