Item(by='njarboe', descendants=None, kids=[25613988], score=None, time=1609604966, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612615, text='Most of the value gains of companies in the current economy occur before a company IPO&#x27;s and shares are available to the general public. If regular people are to be able to invest successfully then they will need access to invest in those companies. The JOBS act tried to help facilitate this, but by making it easier for companies to wait to IPO, it seems to have just made it easier for accredited investors to reap the benefits of their special status for even longer periods of time. While this law may help with shutting down some corrupt entities, I fear it will prevent many new possible ways for normal people to invest in the last remaining sector of the economy producing any decent returns. Would an ETF of a large number of start-ups be allowed under this law?<p>Also, attaching a bunch of non related stuff to huge bills like defense appropriation is really an annoying to me, but I guess that is how the sausage gets made.')
