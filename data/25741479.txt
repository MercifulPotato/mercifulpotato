There&#x27;s a reason there&#x27;s a law specifically for UGC service providers, and you cannot defend this while at the same time demanding that they get treated like book stores when it comes to compelled speech.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.detroitnews.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;online-giants-not-exempt-defamation-laws&#x2F;2710006002&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.detroitnews.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;online-g...</a>')
