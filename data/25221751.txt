You can&#x27;t work around the ancient cylinders&#x2F;heads&#x2F;sectors-per-track code in the BIOS any more; all the values are maxed out to get 2TB. And the BIOS dictated the structure of the Master Boot Record, meaning this was a hard limit for the PC disk partitioning system. So it had to go.<p>I disagree, it is true (but nor exact as CHS is not used since several years, it is LBA in MBR that has a limit at 2^32-1 sectors, which is roughly 2.2 TB with 512 bytes&#x2F;sector ), but that limitation is only for boot devices, and the &quot;switch&quot; happened exactly at the same time rotating hard disk boot devices (anyway smaller than the 2.2 TB limit) were replaced by even smaller SSD devices.<p>And for non-boot devices 4 KB sector disks allow BIOS and older, non GPT compliant OS&#x27;s to get to up to around 17 TB.<p>So UEFI was a terribly implemented solution to a non-existing or very rarely occurring problem.')
