In this case, there is no listing of evidence, hence those involved still talk past each other because it does not build a shared understanding.<p>There is also the burden of evidence. Those making unsubstantiated claims often do so quite freely without much effort; this often incorrectly places the burden on those to disprove sometimes extraordinary claims. Moreover, in these cases, reporting circumstantial evidence that shows the underlying claim is highly unlikely can have the opposite of the intended effect.')
