Keep in mind that all of the worst things we’ve managed to accomplish as a species tended to start with dehumanization as the first enabling step.<p>I’d also suggest that this comment would also necessarily include dismissing just about every psychologist, philosopher or ethicist who studies the nature of self-interested motives as being a sociopath as well.<p>If you really wanted to be cynical however, I’d suggest you start by asking who’s benefitting from us having this conversation. I’d say it’s the regulators, and to a greater extent the executives who have been in charge of those regulators, who are the people statutorily responsible for these failures. I can’t imagine how happy they’d be with us debating how culpable big pharma and their management consultants are for it.')
