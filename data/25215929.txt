SF also developed strong security practices from the beginning, but not the same way.. SF insulates each user from each other.. (leads are trivially stolen by the guy at the next desk in a competitive sales environment). I believe that SF addressed that in version zero.. the two components combined spell .. hm.. you could probably name it differently than I would.. I am sceptic of this future.')
