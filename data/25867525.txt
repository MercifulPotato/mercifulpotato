After uprooting his life to deal with that he has returned to blogging. Many people expressed their support, for which he is very grateful. The NYT is still committed to doxxing people if they feel like it, which Scott abhors. As part of radically changing his life he quit his previous psychiatrist job and is going to see if itâ€™s possible to make a living treating the uninsured for a lot cheaper than most psychiatrists. He signs off with his real name.')
