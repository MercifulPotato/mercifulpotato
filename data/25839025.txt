I mean, obviously moderator abuse exists.  In fact, reddit has whole subreddits devoted to pointing it out and discussing it!<p>Virtually everyone wants moderation.  And, sure, we tolerate some level of abuse as part of that bargain; in the expectation that we always have a large choice of forums.<p>Note that there really isn&#x27;t much discussion space in the intermedia area between &quot;moderated like reddit&quot; and &quot;open like 4chan&quot;.  And that&#x27;s for a reason: any attempt to loosen the moderation valve leads rapidly to a descent into loud-and-viral-but-unsavory content.  That&#x27;s what just happened with Parler, for example.')
