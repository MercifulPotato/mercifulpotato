There are entirely different governing laws (Outer Space Treaty vs whatever land or sea treaty applied to T-3, which wasn&#x27;t clear).<p>Had this happened in space, with the details otherwise the same, it would be 100% clear which jurisdiction applied: that of the nation which was registered under the OST as responsible for the hab&#x2F;trailer in which the murder occurred.<p>Had the murder happened outside of a hab, in EVA suits for example, it would be a bit more complicated. But it is our general understanding that in those circumstances the Law of the High Seas would apply. The specific caveat of the article that was discussed (is a long-lived arctic iceberg a island or international waters?) probably wouldn&#x27;t apply. All of space is generally assumed to be international waters, for the moment.')
