If you make 4x car parts per unit of time, you might net the company a $1M of loss, because the supply chain people won&#x27;t be expecting the components to run out so fast and you&#x27;ll stall the whole assembly line until the logistics can be sorted out.<p>It seems to me that &quot;addictive&quot;&#x2F;&quot;subtractive&quot; split doesn&#x27;t work for any job if you analyze it with the thoroughness the article otherwise applies to software development.')
