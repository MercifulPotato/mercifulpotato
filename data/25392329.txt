Apple yawns at the sight of folks that tell them that <i>&#x27;they will not buy any Apple devices&#x27;</i> for any reason. So what? 10M more new users will take their place.<p>I bet the FSF has been telling others to do this for years and yet Apple is still Apple. Tim &#x27;Apple&#x27; Cook probably marked them all as spam and laughed all the way to the Bank of Apple Inc.')
