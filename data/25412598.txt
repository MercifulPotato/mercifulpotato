If you don&#x27;t include profits from regulatory credits, they&#x27;ve lost over $700M so far this year. Government money is not scalable or sustainable, so this an important indicator of how their finances are doing.<p>The intuition is that Tesla cars are like iPhones. I think it&#x27;s wrong. This is a low-margin business, where you increasingly compete with <i>all</i> of the goods and services people buy, like housing, education, healthcare. It&#x27;s not a &quot;buy a new phone for Christmas every 2 years&quot; business.<p>People are on the phone all the time, so paying $200 more for an improved experience for several hours per day is justified. But paying $5k or $10k more for an improved experience for 1 or 2 hours per day? If you&#x27;re rich, maybe. If not, why not move closer to your work instead, so you don&#x27;t have to use the car? Why not take a longer vacation, or eat out every day, or retire earlier, or pay for your kid&#x27;s college education?')
