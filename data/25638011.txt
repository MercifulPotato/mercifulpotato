Burning in an incinerator is completely clean and releases only water and CO2. If you burn it badly you can make smoke, so don&#x27;t do that.<p>I suppose I should have been more careful with my terms - &quot;burning&quot; was meant as a layman&#x27;s &quot;making fire&quot; rather than in a controlled process within an incinerator as you mentioned.<p>If this is clean, why are people so motivated to look for alternatives for its disposal, giving up and resorting to landfill? Is incineration cost-prohibitive? Or is the transport to the incinerators inefficient?')
