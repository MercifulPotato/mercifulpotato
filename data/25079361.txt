Referring back to the cult example (extremes are easier to denote boundaries) we agree that a cult member is not free. Yet if you ask them they will say that they believe that they are free (many will insist that it is in fact <i>you</i> who is not free). This dictates that our usage requisites the ability to make this determination from outside one&#x27;s own understanding of one&#x27;s self. So either that cult member is free or freedom can&#x27;t be based purely on one&#x27;s understanding. I think sidestepping is an apt description, because it just ignores the nuance, which is what we&#x27;re getting into here.')
