Item(by='munificent', descendants=None, kids=[25766939], score=None, time=1610565789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765928, text='Maybe Steve Jobs is right, but maybe it&#x27;s also good for the world if you can build a sustainable business on a feature.<p>In the world of music, an effects pedal or guitar stomp box is more &quot;feature&quot; than &quot;product&quot;. You can&#x27;t write a song just using a chorus pedal. But there are many many thriving companies that do nothing but produce and sell pedals.<p>Much of this likely rests on the fact that the &quot;protocols&quot; that music gear use to talk to each other are simple, well-established, and legally unemcumbered. Also, for reasons that aren&#x27;t clear to me, even dominant companies in the market do not seem to have pushed very hard to extuinguish that interoperability in anti-competitive ways. Or, at least, not yet.')
