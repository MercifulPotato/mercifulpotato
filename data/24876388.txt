Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=[24876440], score=None, time=1603505876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875516, text='TL;DW: Andy lives in a rented apartment in Portland that Hulu’s “Shill” series wanted to film in, but couldn’t agree on compensation levels. Landlord (who lives in the building) basically decided he wants this thing done, and started the whole “crazy neighbour” routine: shouting through walls, insulting him, staring through windows, taking down the mailbox, and removing the wifi network. Andy seems to have moved out, and I guess will sue the guy for breaching the lease.<p>The landlord seems like a piece of work. All this to be able to say at parties “hey, my house was used to film that tv series &lt;that nobody remembers anymore&gt;”. I hope somebody throws the book at him.<p>Even sadder, the production crew doesn’t seem to care. I guess you don’t win an Emmy without breaking some dude’s life, or something.')
