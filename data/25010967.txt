When we unknowingly treat people badly, and get the wake up call, we can (perhaps) shift to treating them better.<p>My personal journey has included discovering how amazingly angry I was, <i>without even knowing it</i>.  It precluded having reasonable (engineering) discussions when people disagreed with me, being able to take and give direction, etc.  Therapy helped a lot.  Learning to be truthful, disagree reasonably, keep promises, think through problems, treat people kindly are all &#x27;learnable&#x27;.  But some core elements of our beings are pretty intractable, and I believe having the solid core of &#x27;self&#x27; that can stand (again in the face of negative personal consequences) against the often outrageous conduct that&#x27;s around us in the world is only very occasionally developed in adulthood.')
