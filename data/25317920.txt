The intmax_t type was made to represent the largest signed integer type on an architecture.  If you modify the architecture to support a new, larger, integer type, you have now created a new architecture, with a new ABI.  If you do this, there is no problem with intmax_t.<p>But of course, ABIâ€™s are <i>important</i>, since proprietary binary blobs are what is important.')
