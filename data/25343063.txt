Musk has said that he thought SpaceX had a less than 10% chance of even getting a rocket to orbit when he founded it, but trying was worth it anyway. Now that SpaceX has built an orbital booster that comes back to land at the launch site like in the fucking cartoons in the 1950&#x27;s, why would one spend time thinking about if they will fail instead of how great it would be if they succeed. You can&#x27;t short SpaceX stock.')
