In isolation, this is a no-brainer and Mozilla&#x27;s doing the right call.<p>I&#x27;m not happy with DoH though, at all. I fall in the crowd who wants to control my own DNS on my own devices (and I do realize that for those less technically knowledgeable, the status quo is putting that in the hands of the network admin or even ISP, but at least in principle they have the means to do so if they just figure out how, which is relatively trivial). DoH effectively completely cripples things like pihole. I&#x27;d have to start whitelisting IPs&#x2F;hostnames for port 443 :&#x2F;<p>Another practical negative consequence is the further centralization of TLS termination in (most notably) Cloudflare and Akamai, as I am sure this will de the default for those who are now rushed to TLS-enable currently uncompliant endpoints. Great sieves for XEyes and private tracking industry.')
