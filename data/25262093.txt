Forward secrecy is about deliberately and <i>frequently</i> changing keys so that a point-in-time compromise can&#x27;t be used to rewind all your previous communications. They are not the same thing. In particular: offline keys make it much harder to switch keys, which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to suggest that the OpenPGP protocol contains the bones of a forward secrecy system --- it does not, it&#x27;s just something people talk about grafting onto it.<p>Regarding deniable messages: the ability for an unrelated Mallory to confirm a message Alice sent to Bob is a vulnerability. It leaks a piece of information to the world that only Alice and Bob needed, and that both needed only for a brief moment in time. In the real world, nobody pays any attention to any of this stuff, which makes the vulnerability worse: non-repudiability is virtually always moot <i>except in the circumstances where you need it not to exist</i>.')
