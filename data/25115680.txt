Research notes are digital. I find that the input mechanism for digital notetaking (line by line unless you use your stylus for a bit and then you fiddle with it afterwards) constrains my ability to structure thoughts on paper. Mind map tools have the same problem: the tools constrain the way I think.<p>Of course your mileage may vary, but even with an abundance of digital tools I personally find that I prefer to always keep a notepad and pen handy. Leaving the screen helps too.')
