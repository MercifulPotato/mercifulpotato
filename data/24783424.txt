We currently have a pump storage capacity of 40 GWh, so that&#x27;s about 30~40 minutes of electricity storage.<p>If you want to go the power2gas route, just have a look at the combustion heat of methane to calculate how much you would roughly have to synthesize to store 1600 GWh worth of energy.<p>&gt; Renewables are cheaper to build than conventional power.<p>They are. But they need backup power plants as their energy densities and capacity factors a very low compared to nuclear power plants.<p>That&#x27;s why electricity prices in Germany are the highest world-wide:<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalpetrolprices.com&#x2F;electricity_prices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalpetrolprices.com&#x2F;electricity_prices&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; Power companies hate them because they challenge the profitability of their existing coal plants.<p>That&#x27;s simply untrue. Power companies <i>LOVE</i> renewables because they are highly subsidized and the government always guarantees that any kWh renewable electricity produced is also purchased.')
