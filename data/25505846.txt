Never felt anything like culture shock.<p>Until one day two of the young male japanese students asked in hushed tones if it was true that the extremely flamboyant guy in our group was gay. Kinda weird, but ok, maybe that&#x27;s just not something that&#x27;s culturally normal to acknowledge in Japan. They then continued, saying they were concerned that, since they were unable to get dates, they would become gay.<p>That was a fairly shocking moment.')
