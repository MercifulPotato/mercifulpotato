Item(by='minimuffins', descendants=None, kids=[25636753], score=None, time=1609788546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636270, text='I wish there was a term for &quot;means of production&quot; that was clearer or more succinct but I don&#x27;t know one. The term is sometimes a discourse killer because it triggers a kind of (understandable) reflexive distaste for extremism and a certain kind of annoying radical personality or whatever.<p>But whatever synonym we use for it, MoP is a concept that you can&#x27;t really dispense with if you want to talk about this stuff productively. You don&#x27;t have to buy into a Marxist worldview to use it.<p>I&#x27;ll take a crack at a definition: The means of production is the <i>conditions</i> required for making the things that the economy makes, whatever that is. For oil production, it&#x27;s land and mineral rights in oil rich areas, oil derricks, trucks, private roads, refineries, all the plant equipment to make a refinery work, tools, maintenance equipment, barrels..., I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s 65,000 more things...whatever happens to be required to convert dead dinosaurs into 10W30.<p>It sounds Marx-y, but it&#x27;s a simple, straightforward idea.<p>In tech, MoP is things like intellectual property, data centers, etc. The lines are blurred a bit because when work takes place inside a worker&#x27;s brain instead of in a mine or on a factory floor where workers push things around with brute physical force, it&#x27;s not exactly clear who owns what. In my view that ambiguity is something employers have used to mystify the relationship between employer and worker. They try to convince us that we are all just working together to make the world better, and anyway, we&#x27;re paid well enough so why complain and rock the boat?<p>But in the end the rules are the same. You can&#x27;t make it in this system unless you own some means of production (or get access to them by starting a company of your own and becoming a capitalist yourself--which is fine, but by definition not everyone can do it), or you work for someone who has them.<p>A related point is tech production is not actually as ethereal and abstract as it sounds. Yes, code is just a bunch of immaterial mental abstractions, in some sense, but it&#x27;s useless without a shockingly large array of computers, buildings, massive data centers which are expensive, difficult and labor intensive to secure and maintain. They suck up a ton of electricity and water and require armed guards, etc. There&#x27;s a huge amount of hidden physical infrastructure and somebody is going to own it. Whoever does will wield a ton of power in our society, especially as we become increasingly reliant on tech in our everyday lives.')
