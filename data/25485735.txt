A Pi 4 draws 6-7W at full load. A former desktop PC turned server likely idles over 100W.<p>They&#x27;re different beasts, so I&#x27;m not saying &#x27;a Pi is better than a PC&#x27;, I&#x27;m saying &#x27;if your load could also be handled by a (bunch of) Pi(s), then all else being equal that might be better than the PC&#x27;. Of course all else is never equal, ymmv, you may already have the old PC, you may need very many Pis, so even if pennies cheaper to run it might take years and years to break even on the Pi acquisition cost.')
