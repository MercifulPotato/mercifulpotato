Item(by='josquindesprez', descendants=None, kids=[24884425], score=None, time=1603554789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24879154, text='My personal experience is that most people in the language learning community have trouble fitting SRS into their long term workflow because they don&#x27;t stop to think much about the natural spacing of repetition they get in their other learning processes.<p>The people that popularize things like Anki the hardest are those that built and stuck with their own systems from the start. That&#x27;s more of a referendum on their personality type than on the utility of their way of using Anki.<p>My hunch is that most people end up struggling because a lot of the most popular systems end up doing the exact opposite of spaced repetition once you consider the complete universe of foreign language input a learner is getting.<p>I&#x27;ve found that for me, Anki works really well for the first 1000 words, letting me jumpstart early vocab while most of my other time is spent on basic grammar.<p>For words 1000-5000 or 10000 in frequency, it&#x27;s easy to get stuck in a trap I see a lot online: every time you encounter a new word, add it to Anki. This is a great way to burn out. You&#x27;ll encounter most of these words with a natural spacing as you read native materials, if they&#x27;re in the higher frequency bands. Doing reviews becomes excruciating, since you&#x27;re losing the efficiency benefits of using the SRS unless you adjust review frequency based on the native input you consume (a good machine learning side project, perhaps?)<p>I&#x27;ve had a lot more success using Anki for words off in the long tail that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have a chance to remember.')
