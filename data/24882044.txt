The idea of the State as an instrument of class warfare is a Marxist idea.<p>And indeed, the concept of ruling class and of class in general in the sociological sense of the world also comes from Marx.<p>As for the Greeks, while they of course had a violent State (as we&#x27;ve seen, all States are organs of violence), they didn&#x27;t view the State that way. The conception of the private&#x2F;public sphere that they were discussing distinctly comes from Greece.')
