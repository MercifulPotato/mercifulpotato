IMO any company allowing such practices opens itself up to corruption and nepotism.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for startups and even mid-sized publicly traded companies where managers with sufficient seniority were allowed to extend offers on a whim and it always resulted in friends of said employees being hired. Inevitably, entire teams and even business orgs would be filled with friends or fraternity brothers and their work performance would vary greatly.<p>No one likes interviews but it&#x27;s crazy that I keep seeing HN users considering this an acceptable practice.')
