Item(by='Moodles', descendants=None, kids=[25094709, 25093930, 25094334, 25095523], score=None, time=1605375230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093737, text='I actually have a somewhat controversial opinion (that shouldn’t be controversial because it’s all math, but it still is regardless) that, after you save 5-6x your emergency fund, you don’t need an emergency fund at all and you’re better off investing it all in a total market index fund. The reason being that even if there is a market crash, you’ll still be able to afford the emergency since you’ve saved multiples of it already, and in general in the long run having stocks instead of cash or T-bonds in an EF will be better. Various blogs have done the math and it all checks out, but people still push back at me for this. Having an EF if your net worth is a few multiples of your emergency fund, is entirely psychological. Which is fine. But people should just be aware that it’s a bias they have.<p>Perhaps investing on margin is the same. I have personally taken the leap and got rid of my emergency fund. But I haven’t looked at investing long-term on margin yet. I did see a test from HEDGEFUNDFIE on bogleheads forums about this. But I haven’t looked into it. I definitely think taking out a margin loan while simultaneously having an EF in cash makes no sense though.')
