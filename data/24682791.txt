Linear ODEs and PDEs are not, even in many dimensions, and many important real-world systems (building blocks of electronic circuits, acoustics and vibrations, optics, and so on) <i>are</i> linear, or are easily approximated as such.<p>Yes, for complicated nonlinear high-order systems, you need a numeric solution and when that&#x27;s the case, that&#x27;s fine. But for engineers, it&#x27;s really important to identify when that&#x27;s not the case.<p>This is really fundamental. The whole reason we can even define things like &quot;impedances&quot;, &quot;natural frequencies&quot;, &quot;buckling modes&quot;, &quot;reflection coefficients&quot;, &quot;critical speeds&quot;, and &quot;damping ratios&quot; that let you actually design things like filters, speakers, ultrasound systems, lenses, motors, transmission lines, delay lines, antennas, rockets, and the Eiffel Tower, is because you can solve the governing equation analytically and then collect the solution and recognize an important term that factors out, get the formula for it, give it a name, and take note of the variables that it depends on.<p>Even for something as infamous as the Navier-Stokes equation, you can extract important parameters like the Reynolds number, Froude number, and so on -- which I hope I don&#x27;t need to explain why they&#x27;re extremely useful, even for a numerical design approach -- so even if you can&#x27;t solve the equation, you can still get a lot of mileage out of the analysis itself.<p>(Even integrating factors are something that I&#x27;ve used &quot;in anger&quot; in my career, as part of an assignment to predict inventory stockouts).')
