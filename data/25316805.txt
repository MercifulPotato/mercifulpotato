I have spent strictly more time tracking down compiler bugs.<p>I can count on one hand the memory errors I <i>have</i> debugged in five years. The longest took a half-hour. (Code that used a &quot;relaxed&quot; atomic load was moved to a place where it needed &quot;acquire&quot; -- which is the default.) So, I eagerly prefer (rounding up) 2.5 hours of debugging spent in five years over spending 5 extra hours <i>every week</i> -- 1750 hours in 5 years -- waiting on builds from a very slow compiler. (I don&#x27;t know any reason why the Rust compiler could not be two orders of magnitude faster, and notably faster than a C++ compiler.)<p>My experience may be unusual in that I do not habitually depend on code badly-written by other people. My complaints about other people&#x27;s code I do use are more typically about performance, conformability to requirements, or poor usability.')
