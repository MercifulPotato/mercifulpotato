Add to that that the &#x27;personalized&#x27; ads are, if the targeting is functioning properly, worth more to the buyer [0] than simple placement ads and you can see why automatic targeted ads dominate the space, human approved&#x2F;sold, non-personalized ads are both worth less on a per impression basis and more expensive for the buyer and seller to use.<p>[0] For example a make-up company really doesn&#x27;t really care about putting an ad in front of me a man who doesn&#x27;t wear make-up.')
