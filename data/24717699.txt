I would argue that Influenza is worse than COVID, for the simple reason that it kills more young people and children. The average age of a COVID fatality is higher than life expectancy. Influenza destroys more years of life.<p>I think that&#x27;s a very good point. And also one of the reasons the perspectives differ so much.<p>However we don&#x27;t know yet about the long-term effect of COVID on younger people. It could still very well lead to a decreased quality of life for young people as we&#x27;ve seen in other posts about scarring of the lungs and permanent fatigue.<p>Granted influenza can cause similar after effects (like pericarditis and permanent fatigue), but it appears to be less frequent.')
