States are not individuals, you cannot treat them like a person, just being to dumb to do what&#x27;s good for them. They are run by many people everyone of which having their own profit motives. So it is very easy to lobby them into doing stuff detrimental to the general public.<p>It is much easier for a company run by its founders to act morally. Airbnb does not, which to me is not the end of the world, but worth pointing out in thread about how great those founders supposedly are.<p>Suggesting that it is just the state&#x27;s fault is a naive view.')
