You can read the (hopefully syntax-highlighted) comments as a list of steps in the function.<p>Also, maybe that was a large block of code that was replaced later with a function call.  Or maybe the code used to validate things about the customer used to be there before the function call and now that&#x27;s all been wrapped into the called function.')
