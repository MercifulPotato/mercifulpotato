So they believe them.<p>Right, and there we also see the answer.  We need to move people to no longer <i>want</i> to believe the lies.<p>For example, if I believe that it&#x27;s all a conspiracy by &quot;them&quot;, then it&#x27;s not my fault that I&#x27;m a failure.  That&#x27;s comforting.  But it also follows that I&#x27;m helpless, and that things are never going to get better.  That&#x27;s... not so comforting.  If someone shows me that, I may not want to believe that any more.<p>Now, that&#x27;s a very slow process, and almost requires one-on-one interaction with lots of time.  You can&#x27;t do it in a drive-by post on the internet.  Worse, even if you put in the time and effort, it still may not work.  But I don&#x27;t know of anything else that will, and this might work at least some of the time.')
