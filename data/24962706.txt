WhatsApp stores the local chat history unencrypted in the device and does not mark it as &quot;do not backup&quot;, so the cloud sync service uploads it to the backup service. And Android does not encrypt this information.<p>For contrast, Signal does encrypt the local history and the backups (to the point that is a bit harder to backup the chat to outside in Android, you need to copy a randomly generate password manually to restore it. But it&#x27;s a safe approach).')
