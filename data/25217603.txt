We have constraints of around 20ms for real-time audio packet processing. Recently some stop-the-world pauses introduced by the GC resulted in calls dropping. A few GC parameter tweaks brought our latency below 20ms and the application no longer drops calls.<p>This is using the GC that ships with JDK 11. Future improvements, such as Shenandoah and ZGC, may be able to further drop the interruptions to 5ms on average.<p>The radio repeater is designed for real-time, safety-critical operations dealing with voice communications. Java is up for the job; like others have mentioned, it&#x27;s more about the technical team and whether management understands what it takes to write and maintain an excellent code base than it is about Java versus C++.')
