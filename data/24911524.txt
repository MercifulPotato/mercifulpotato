I&#x27;m not sitting here in Brooklyn eagerly awaiting a chance to move to a cheap giant home in the suburbs - I genuinely like walkable communities, and moved to one, and found a job there which paid me enough to justify the high COL.<p>This feels like a regression-to-the-mean sort of move, where the net effect over time will be all tech salaries becoming reduced as the labor pool spreads to cheaper areas and the national average market rates become depressed. It&#x27;ll be great for those who genuinely like living in small towns in the midwest, they&#x27;ll probably still be doing well relative to the local average. It&#x27;ll be horrible for those who genuinely like living in expensive coastal areas - the pressure to move to a cheaper place will be enormous.<p>(And thats not to say anything about my belief that a lot of low-COL areas afford to be cheap by providing poor social services, which feels like we&#x27;re diminishing the ability of high-COL areas to apply social pressure to elevate the standard of living of other states and regions...)<p>Am I thinking about this the wrong way, or are high-COL urban workers going to take a hit here?')
