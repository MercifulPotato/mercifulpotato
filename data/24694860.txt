Item(by='fenomas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601960657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24689943, text='&gt; I think CSS is &quot;difficult to understand&quot; because most people who do front-end don&#x27;t want to spend a day learning it.<p>I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. There are a ton of reasons CSS <i>really is</i> hard, even when one understands the box model etc.<p>E.g.:<p>1. Hugely non-modular. An element&#x27;s behavior always depends, to some extent, on styles applied to other elements. Systems full of entangled global state are inherently complex, separate from any other concern.<p>2. Highly magical. E.g. if you want to control how elements stack with z-index, you need to also know that z-index is ignored for elements that aren&#x27;t positioned, which in turn means you need to set up your margins differently because positions disable margin collapsing. There&#x27;s no one &quot;model&quot; to learn; it&#x27;s a big morass of interconnected rules and edge cases.<p>3. Extremely fragile. Layout changes that a human user might consider minor often can&#x27;t be done without significantly redesigning the page.<p>Of course, problems like these can all be mitigated to various extents. But that takes care and experience; it&#x27;s not just a matter of reading some articles like you imply.')
