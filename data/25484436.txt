I&#x27;ve read a lot about DDD but things just don&#x27;t seem to click for me, partly because example are trivial. For example, I read &quot;Architecture Patterns with Python&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cosmicpython.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;preface.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cosmicpython.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;preface.html</a>) but just didn&#x27;t find it practical. Some random thoughts I had while reading, in no particular order:<p>* what if domain logic can be optimized in the database?<p>* how do joins across multiple tables work?<p>* in Django I&#x27;ve come across plenty of examples where you have property method on a model that goes and performs additional queries. For instance, something along the lines of `my_post.get_latest_comment()`. Should this instead be somewhere in the service layer?')
