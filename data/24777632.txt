And cliffhangers are often a tactic used [for] audience retention<p>Series can very easily &quot;jump-the-shark&quot; and go on far longer than they should. There&#x27;s a beauty to having something just &quot;END&quot; rather than go on until it needs to be cancelled because people are sick of it.<p>The Walking Dead, for example, just keeps going on and on and on. 9th+ season now, they&#x27;re just re-cycling themes they&#x27;ve already covered 2 or 3 times. I guess they want a &quot;sure-thing&quot; but FFS, I wish they would place more value in trying out new things which, after all, is what really brings in the audiences when it works.')
