To me walking is like sleeping in that, it allows my mind to wonder while I walk. I churn to all sorts of problems I might have faced and will be facing in the coming week(s).<p>I used to run in my 20&#x27;s but I busted my knees. Now, every Sunday I walk ~15km. It takes me about 3 hours. I live in Sydney so it&#x27;s hilly and the weather is nice (most of the time).')
