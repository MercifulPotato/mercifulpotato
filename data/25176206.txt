This makes it easier for kids to learn, because they have smaller hands, and we want them to actually learn!<p>In any case though, the main difference is that at <i>some</i> point, if you want a competition that is between people, you have to pick an actual size that people compete on, and whatever you choose, different genetic characteristics will give some people benefits over others. Piano playing, on the other hand, is a <i>solo</i> activity - so there is no reason why people shouldn&#x27;t have individualized instruments, even for &quot;competitions&quot; (except for practical purposes).')
