Sort of, If I can write it down in such a way that I can explain it, then I&#x27;m more confident I actually understand it. I then look at it and think what would someone who doesn&#x27;t know any of this ask if they read this or if I was explaining it to them. Sometimes I don&#x27;t know the answer, so I have to go off and research to allow me to fill in those knowledge gaps.<p>I find this really helps me.<p>I just don&#x27;t publish the bloody thing to the internet! Because I know it would just be clutter when people are looking for an actual experts explanation of the thing.<p>It also means I have quite comprehensive notes I can go back to, again private though.')
