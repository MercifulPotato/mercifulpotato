In the long run this may work out worse for everyone.<p>I would expect the same, but substitute &quot;worse&quot; for &quot;better&quot;. Trumpism lives on conflict and trolling. There&#x27;s nobody to troll on Parler. It&#x27;s affective politics as much as ideological: they may believe awful things, but they&#x27;re mostly out to have a good time. Parler is like a video game with all the cheat codes on; it will entertain them at first, but they&#x27;ll get bored quickly.<p>What they&#x27;ll do next I&#x27;m not sure, but the whole political success of Trumpism was based on turnout, which was based on enthusiasm. Facebook and Twitter are enthusiasm-generating machines, and cutting Trump supporters off is not much different than cutting off a bar patron who&#x27;s clearly had seven too many. They might make new social networks, but they won&#x27;t be as good, and that&#x27;s enough.')
