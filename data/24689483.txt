They&#x27;re just matching for a specific hotword, rather than constantly performing speech-to-text (which is computationally expensive and done remotely). Think of it more like Shazam or the other audio fingerprinting services – you don&#x27;t have to actually transcribe the text to understand if a particular word has been heard.')
