This persecution complex is almost completely manufactured.<p>Best example? The War on Christmas. Almost completely fabricated on the evidence. But people <i>feel</i> like they are being pushed to the margins, and there are several leaders fanning these feelings.<p>And that&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t real issues. The middle class is shrinking! Whites are not the majority, just a plurality. The manufacturing world is gutted. The opioid crisis has reversed the upward trend of life expectancy!<p>But then what do they blame? Feminists. Liberals. Immigrants. Not the actual problems. And being marginalized has more to do with as a bloc them removing themselves from a shared worldview and facts and increasingly becoming more and more unhinged by conspiracy theory thinking.')
