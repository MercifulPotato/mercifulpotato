The Usenet killfile model was awful and was a big part of why huge swaths of it were an unnavigable mess for most users--because unless you wanted to expend the effort to build one you <i>didn&#x27;t have one</i> and got the whole sewer pipe spraying straight into your face. And, oh boy, <i>client-side moderation</i> happens on Twitter, it works so well? Then why do female friends whose posts get some attention have a bunch of dudes in their mentions saying how they want to have sex with (consensually or not) and&#x2F;or kill them no matter how many they block? Could it be because it&#x27;s an abject failure of a model due to the low stakes of spinning up a new account--so low that Twitter <i>stopped using egg avatars</i> because they destroyed interaction rates with new users <i>because most of them were troglodytes</i>?<p>I do wonder.<p>I&#x27;m trying to assume good faith in your reply so let me point something out to you: the people who are wringing their hands about this used to bleat about shared block lists being used to get <i>some</i> semblance of value out of &quot;client-side moderation&quot; (which is not to say that it is successful at dealing with shitty actors, just that it&#x27;s <i>less unsuccessful</i>, when you use them), just as they&#x27;re bleating about this. Because the real beef here is not with Twitter Deciding, it&#x27;s with <i>Anyone Deciding</i> that they are not entitled to the attention of anyone they demand it from.<p>But they <i>lost</i> re: shared block lists, and this is a retrenchment to attempt to keep relevance when they can, and should, lose this one too and be shown the door. If they want &quot;unmoderated&quot;, there are platforms like Parler and Gab where they can have that. Relatedly, those platforms are full of literal-not-figurative fascists. <i>I wonder why.</i>')
