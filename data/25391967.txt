Since then it has been refined many times over and made more feature complete. It has been used in some fairly high profile projects with impressive amounts of traffic and proven to be battle tested and production ready. Given i recently left my job (I&#x27;m looking for the next thing BTW) I decided to finally write some documentation for it and refine the API a bit so that others may be able to use it and find it as useful as I have.<p>Thanks!')
