I see a recurring pattern of this in U.S. politics or politics-infested parts of reddit: mods of &#x2F;r&#x2F;PoliticalHumor or &#x2F;r&#x2F;MurderedByWords can make a pro-D. echo chamber out of their subreddits, but an attempt to make a pro-R. echo chamber of the similar temperature would be quarantined&#x2F;banned&#x2F;whatever.<p>For an outsider, it was quite disturbing to see how dissenting opinions on U.S. politics were silenced on reddit in a matter of couple of years (2017-2018, I guess?). I do not care about U.S. politics that much, but erasure of dissent <i>is</i> scary.')
