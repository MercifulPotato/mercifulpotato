Let&#x27;s take Omnifocus...<p>It&#x27;s $99 for Omnifocus Pro on Mac. If you want to see your tasks on your iPhone you have to buy the iPhone version separately at $75 (they have blocked users from running Omnifocus iOS on M1 macbooks).<p>And even after spending over $170 (for what is effectively a gtd task manager), they still ask you to pay $5 a month to access it on the web.<p>And you might expect it then, to sync with the $199 you spent on their project management software (Omniplan) - but nope!<p>Then after you have bought the project management software, you might expect that it can export to a common format so you can share it with users that don&#x27;t use OmniPlan (i.e. Microsoft Project) - but nope!
