Ryanair comes in at the 7th place for the low-cost-airline safety.<p>It could mean that Boeing are handing out huge discounts, or that Ryanair bets on these planes never making it to market, forcing Boeing to give them a killer deal on a replacement plane etc.<p>The thing is that most passengers that have read any of the articles about this plane, will never set foot on one of them.')
