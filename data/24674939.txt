The industry for media is way more complex than this and it involves an interplay between media consumers and creators.<p>What is defined as &quot;best&quot; is a constantly moving target because audiences are getting more and more sophisticated. Every time the industry breaks new ground with new media or a new concept, the audience learns from the experience and the movie industry can only regurgitate that concept so many times before the concept becomes redundant.<p>You think something like game of thrones could have been made two decades ago? What drives the sophistication of TV shows up to the point where they kill off the main character in the first season just to keep you interested? Doing outlandish stuff like this was never needed to keep audience engagement in the past... In fact movies made nowadays are waaaay to intense for audiences back in the 60s.<p>This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m just making up. Movie execs are very very aware of this issue, they know that the bar needs to be constantly raised to engage viewers and ironically by every time you raise the bar you train the audience to be even more more sophisticated and you gotta raise the bar again.<p>I&#x27;m only a matter of time before audiences are so sophisticated that they begin realizing this fact as well.<p>Right now, in general, the audience isn&#x27;t intelligent enough to recognize this positive feedback loop. To the audience this phenomenon mostly appears as &quot;all modern movies are stupid except for the classics.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s going on is that the &quot;classic&quot; you love so much was the bar raiser and all the other movies that came after it are filler in attempt to capitalize on the concept and raise the bar further. The cycle continues until one random movie actually successfully changes the game.<p>How many marvel movies need to come out before the whole franchise becomes boring? I&#x27;m enjoying the franchise right now but I know that eventually it won&#x27;t be as good as the classic original movies that started it all.')
