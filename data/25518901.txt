Item(by='pliny', descendants=None, kids=[25520092], score=None, time=1608739029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25517221, text='Don&#x27;t have much to say about the rest of the comment but<p>&gt;The spread on most trades is probably in the range of 50c on low liquidity shares and $1 on low liquidity options.<p>Is demonstrably wrong. The minimum spread on options contracts is $1 and the spread on liquid options contract (not SPY liquid but like TSLA or AAPL) is generally in the mid $10s and often hits $100+ on ATM contracts). Right now an ATM call on AAPL a month out quotes 4.75 to 4.85 which is $10 and the same on TSLA quotes 44.05 to 44.40 which is $35. Not a trivial amount, and it implies that the broker could get price improvement that is an order of magnitude more than the typical commission on options (~1$ per contract).')
