But left unsupervised, she&#x27;ll spend probably 99.99% of her time on TikTok and Instagram and 0.01% on Wikipedia. Access is great and necessary, but far from sufficient.<p>edit: I don&#x27;t know if I would have chosen differently, if all were available in my youth.<p>edit2: I think do know. I probably spent much more time on video games than on Encarta.')
