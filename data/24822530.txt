It is so dense to read. I distrust people that don&#x27;t speak in plain English.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d like to see some recognition that you do think there are worthy &amp; compelling reasons for Linux gaming and&#x2F;or tech like proton. I have tried, amid my &quot;platitudes&quot; to accept some dings, but I have not seen any places where you acknowledge or realize that there maybe something good for humanity at stake here.<p>Why? I don&#x27;t owe you anything.<p>Good for humanity? We are talking about video games. It is just entertainment we are talking about. Get a grip!<p>If we were talking about access for information and censorship, I do think open source is important? Yes I do. That why I run Linux and try to use it in my work (however most companies want me to use MS tech). But I can create my own tools and software if I wish to.<p>If you wanna muck around with proton and game on Linux. Do it. I am not stopping anyone.')
