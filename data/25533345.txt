It&#x27;s gotta be as absurdly easy to use like iMovie but at least have the basic capabilities of a Sony Vegas Home version (the $30 kind). Cutting, scrubbing, aligning, have multiple tracks, and for gods sake a simple and easy way to understand what I&#x27;m encoding&#x2F;rendering (see Shotcut). KDENLive and Shotcut are two OSS video editors I&#x27;ve used simply because they&#x27;re open source, but by god do they still have a long ways to go in terms of stability and ease of use.<p>For me, 99&#x2F;100 times all I want to do is trim, split, have multiple tracks, have some fades, add text (animation or not), and lastly read and output various codecs.<p>Update: I had a thought right after posting. Basically if you could take Shotcut, but make it look and feel more like Sony Vegas, I think you hit the nail on the casual&#x2F;semi-pro you&#x27;re looking for.')
