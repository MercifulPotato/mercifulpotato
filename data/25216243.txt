It just needs a lot of data most users probably don&#x27;t have when starting out.<p>I just use bogofilter, and it worked almost perfectly from the start, just because I saved years upon years of SPAM and HAM. 10&#x27;s of thousands of messages each.<p>It got slightly worse over years, because I incrementally only train it on new SPAM but not on new HAM, because of laziness.<p>People probably have HAM archives, but don&#x27;t usually save their SPAM, to be able to start using Bayesian spam filters right away with great results.<p>Personally I find it much better than whatever Google uses. I don&#x27;t even bother with SMTP level domain&#x2F;IP blacklists, or reverse IP&#x2F;domain checks anymore. All mail is just passed right to the mailbox and is then pre-filtered by a bogofilter to SPAM folder that I check once weekly, and barely find any HAM there. I receive about 500k mails a year.')
