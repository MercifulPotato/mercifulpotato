Due to that and so much more, it wouldn&#x27;t be <i>surprising</i> to see this phenomenon in USA building inspection as well. Only, I&#x27;ve built several buildings in the last decade, and I can confirm that the building inspectors (who in every case worked for the relevant local fire department) are very professional and very opposed to letting unsafe shit be built for the use of the public.')
