The family seems to be quite good at what they do. Ryan himself is telegenic, has a boundless reservoir of enthusiasm, and his parents seem reasonably careful at not excessively exploiting him (not having him do too many videos, and responsibly managing his money).<p>As for the consumerism: Yeah, it&#x27;s absolutely blatant, but so is much of the media content for children in general. Ryan videos are a good teachable moment to discuss this (What do you think happens with all the toys the next day? etc.)')
