Bitcoin (the BTC chain) got it&#x27;s GitHub repo hijacked years ago by corporate interests and the company Blockstream. The whole concept is a dead end and they are actively trying to push people into using their &quot;second layer&quot; solutions to the congestion and problems they have introduced.<p>People like Greg Maxwell and Adam Back were able to kick out the original maintainers and are hell bent on making Bitcoin not work.<p>Bitcoin Cash is the closest thing to &quot;Bitcoin&quot; now but Blockstream employees an army of Twitter and Reddit trolls to block any real discussion.
