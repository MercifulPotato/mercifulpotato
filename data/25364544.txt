Which means there might be an arbitrage opportunity for companies to pay slightly less and cater to weirdos like me.<p>A lot of this is not unlike personal finance: if what you have now is fine, do you really need to upgrade? And also a lot of costs are just sort of non-negotiably baked into the budget (e.g. payroll, mortgage), and what&#x27;s left is relatively small and carefully spent. I could see how tight cash flow could make this even more of an issue.<p>The more-frequent-replacement requests I&#x27;ve had have more been around new capabilities rather than raw performance. Like being able to charge off an iPad charger in a pinch, or being able to run iOS apps natively.<p>Lastly I&#x27;d point to The Joel Test[1], which has mixed results in terms of how well it has aged, but mostly that some of the items are even more &quot;table stakes&quot; than they were at the time it was originally published.
