They aren’t the same.<p>I see three points in the &quot;grandparent&quot; comment:<p>1. “The guy had armies of white supremacist supporters and advisers.”<p>2. “He told right-wing extremists to “stand by” on national TV.”<p>3. “Every time you gloss over this, you give a pass to it and to those who knew about it and supported him anyway.”<p>I would consider these the arguments being discussed in this comment tree, not &quot;Trump is racist&quot; or &quot;Trump is ... right wing&quot;.<p>&gt; You can argue Proud Boys are right wing if viewing it in relation to Antifa for instance, but they aren’t racists. They are pretty diverse as a group, they just may not hold your values.<p>I don&#x27;t think that even the proud boys would dispute a label of &quot;right wing&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t really know how to respond to the claim that they aren&#x27;t racists. Gavin McInnes is on the record with NBC in 2017 as saying &quot;I’m not a fan of Islam. I think it’s fair to call me Islamophobic.&quot; and Islamophobia is anti-Muslim racism.<p>More recently, Enrique Tarrio has said they&#x27;re not racist, but they&#x27;ve just gotten more careful with how they express their racism; they use dog whistles and veiled references.<p>If you look through archives of their early 2019-era merch store, you&#x27;ll see things like multiple versions of the &quot;Honkler&quot; incarnation of Pepe the Frog — commonly used as a neo-nazi dog whistle, a picture of a black silhouette with the caption &quot;Don&#x27;t monkey this up, America!&quot; — a reference to the racial slur that Ron DeSantis experienced backlash for using in late 2018, references to lynching, references to QAnon, and a joke about Muhammad being a Pedophile. (You&#x27;ll also find a pile of sexist and transphobic content.)<p>&gt; KKK and Neo Nazis are not right wing, but they are very racist.<p>From the wikipedia page on Neo-Nazism: &quot;Neo-Nazism is considered a particular form of far-right politics and right-wing extremism.&quot; (citing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verfassungsschutz.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;fields-of-work&#x2F;right-wing-extremism&#x2F;what-is-right-wing-extremism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verfassungsschutz.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;fields-of-work&#x2F;right-win...</a>)')
