Giving a trivial function such as search box on a webpage or some animation results in a convoluted 10MB JavaScript monster from hell. If they run into anything remotely challenging they&#x27;ll simply add a library to do it for them creating more bloat. It used to be the opposite. When asked &#x27;why not just some jQuery and DOM&#x27;? they&#x27;ll reply it&#x27;s too hard. React, webpack, node etc are great tools but they need to used carefully.')
