Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611224481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840459, text='&gt; The last two weeks have ushered in a wave of new domestic police powers<p>No, they haven&#x27;t, and you can tell this because Greenwald can&#x27;t point to a single extension of domestic police powers. All he can point to is people talking, in the future tense, about applying existing domestic police powers against a long-recognized threat which, out of political favoritism, has not in the past been targeted the way other (often less dangerous) domestic threats have been.<p>There are certainly some legitimate grounds for concern about that, too, but they are bypassed and obscured in Greenwald’s dishonest and tiresome anti-“liberals” partisan fearmongering.')
