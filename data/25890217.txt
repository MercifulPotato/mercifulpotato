Possession doesn’t even really factor at all in contract or restitution law for fungible currency.<p>Smart contracts are contracts, because you agree to their automatically enforced terms when you sign them. The “legal overhead” is when the terms as written don’t match what you actually agreed on, for example there was a mistake.
