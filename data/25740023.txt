There&#x27;s no particular reason to think one side is more on the &quot;right side&quot; than the other from an absolute sense, looking at the historical track record.<p>For that matter, the notion of human rights as we conceive of them is a relatively modern invention. Liberalism isn&#x27;t even 400 years old yet (and the notion of universal rule of law as codified in the Magna Carta is itself only just past 800). By comparison, Ancient Egypt lasted for around 3,000 years, and Rome for 1,200. We&#x27;ve got a while yet before we can declare our way is any more successful than theirs.<p>Particularly if someone believes that it&#x27;s a religious issue dictated by a deity who takes an active interest in the world, then they&#x27;ll definitely believe they&#x27;re on the right side of history.')
