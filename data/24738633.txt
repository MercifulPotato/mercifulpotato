Item(by='metalliqaz', descendants=None, kids=[24739892], score=None, time=1602334397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737476, text='you&#x27;re living in a fantasy world, an absolute fantasy world, if you think Obama was more divisive than Trump.<p>And I didn&#x27;t say Trump was racist, I said that inclusive (rather than divisive) language angers racists.  I think it&#x27;s very telling that you interpreted that as &quot;trump = racist&quot; and jumped into action with unrelated talking points you just happened to have laying around.  That&#x27;s very shill-like behavior.<p>Even though I think he probably is racist, I don&#x27;t know for sure.  What I do know for sure is that he intentionally uses rage-bait and wedge issues to divide the public for his own benefit.  This is clear and obvious.<p>That &quot;evidence&quot; up there is from a class of argumentation designed not to change anyone&#x27;s mind, but to give supporters an excuse to put concerns of racism out of their head and stay with him.  That&#x27;s why you find it so convincing.  you <i>want</i> to like him.  Most of politics is like this.<p>How can I tell?  Well it&#x27;s flimsy to anyone who cares to look.  For example, the only numbers cited compare two values that are very similar (within 10%) but compare two period separated by 8 years, with the former during an bad economy that Obama inherited from Bush (and fixed) and the later during a good economy that Trump inherited from Obama (and destroyed).  Also, as I&#x27;m sure you know, executive orders don&#x27;t increase funding for anything.  Congress does that.  What Trump did is what he always does.  Some purely-performative stunt that does no actual good and is just designed to grab headlines.  Moving an advisory board into the White House is a death sentence, not a benefit.<p>But of course none of this matters.  Your tribe is your tribe, until death do you part.  What you might want to consider is that your tribe will only survive if you cut out the cancer.<p>I won&#x27;t be responding further.  Have a nice day, and try not to catch the &#x27;rona.')
