HN doesn’t seem to want to even condemn a lot of the quietly racist views expressed here. Not ban - simply condemn.<p>I’m not a person of color and I don’t find the discourse on the site to be “kind.” I would imagine a person of color would probably feel pretty enraged reading some of the quietly yet obviously racist views expressed.<p>I’m aware this probably violates site guidelines and am OK being banned. I think the community is valuable enough that it deserves an opportunity to reflect on what it stands for.')
