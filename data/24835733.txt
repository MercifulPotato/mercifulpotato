Back in the day as much as about 40% of the components by value were manufactured in the USA, including the early Samsung CPUs made in a fab in Texas, and Gorilla Glass made by Corning in New York state. That was actually the case at the height of the furore about iPhones being made in China around 2010-2012, although few commentators bothered finding that out.<p>Nowadays the countries of origin are more diverse, and the proportion made in the USA has fallen. The biggest single change though was moving from US made Samsung CPUs to TSMC chips from Taiwan.<p>I believe some of the more sophisticated assembly and QA test equipment is US made, or at least used to be but can&#x27;t find a reference for that online.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifewire.com&#x2F;where-is-the-iphone-made-1999503" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lifewire.com&#x2F;where-is-the-iphone-made-1999503</a>')
