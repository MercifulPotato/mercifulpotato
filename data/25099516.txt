In my studies, I was already one of the two to three odd-one-outs who used Linux (&gt;90% of students and professors didn&#x27;t know anything besides Windows).<p>I bought an ARM-based chromebook, installed crouton and... quickly discovered, that <i>nothing</i> besides Vim&#x2F;Emacs came pre-built for it. There even wasn&#x27;t a simple, official way to build Electron (so all those editors weren&#x27;t an option, either)!<p>So you could say, I only picked them up (I tried both) reluctantly. And I stuck to Vim-bindings because all other alternatives I know <i>suck</i> in comparison. The best I knew beforehand w.r.t flexibility was Sublime Text with its multiple cursors and regex searches, but that also pales when compared to Vim macros.<p>Make of that what you will. I&#x27;m certain your point about mentors isn&#x27;t wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t explain it all, too.<p>Also, if anyone could point me to similarly promising editing schemes, I&#x27;d be glad to have a look at them :)')
