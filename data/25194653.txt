I thoroughly enjoyed Firewatch which had a (relatively) short story and just provided a simple enough story. It didn&#x27;t try to do a ton more than what it advertised and it left a lot unanswered (which was fine)<p>I also found a ton of value in Stardew Valley which I sank hours into but the condensed time of a single &quot;day&quot; made gameplay much more bite sized and short. It is a MUCH longer game though compared to Firewatch but both scratch a good itch.')
