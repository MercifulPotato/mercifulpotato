The scientific evidence shows that:<p><pre><code>    &gt; Higher vitamin D blood levels are associated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n    &gt; Higher D levels are associated with lower risk of a severe case (hospitalization, ICU, or death).\n\n    &gt; Intervention studies (including RCTs) indicate that vitamin D can be a very effective treatment.\n\n    &gt; Many papers reveal several biological mechanisms by which vitamin D influences COVID-19.\n\n    &gt; Causal inference modelling, Hill’s criteria, the intervention studies &amp; the biological mechanisms indicate that vitamin D’s influence on COVID-19 is very likely causal, not just correlation.</code></pre>')
