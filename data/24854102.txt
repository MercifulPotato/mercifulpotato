I used to use Ask.com but it gave inferior results to Google Search. I have tried Bing and it was inferior so I continue to use Google Search. I use Android because its more open then the competition iOS.<p>When Google is not the best I don&#x27;t use it. I use Audible and Kindle not Google Play Books. I use a opensource pod catcher I like rather than what ever the google android podcast app is. I use Open&#x2F;LibreOffice rather than Google Docs. I have Chrome installed, but can&#x27;t remember the last time I opened it as I much prefer Firefox as my daily driver because its superior in the measures I care about extensions, customization, and privacy.<p>Google only has me a as a customer as long as they offer me better service, if they don&#x27;t I go elsewhere easily.')
