(I&#x27;ve been up to my elbows in SAML2 before, so that&#x27;s going to color my response.)<p>But suppose you set up a specific semi-public organization to act as the identity provider. (Like IANA? Maybe that&#x27;s not a good example. :-)) Following something like a provably secure communications flow[1], the chat site gets a unique number representing the user. <i>That&#x27;s all they know about the user.</i><p>Alternatively, and with the approval of the user, the site gets the user&#x27;s name or whatever the user wishes their online reputation to be associated with and can display that, for their comments to be taken seriously.<p>Ok, so let&#x27;s take the example of Parler. Parler doesn&#x27;t moderate its content, and actively resists attempts outside attempts to do so. However, anything illegal is still associated with individuals and the court system can force Parler to complete the link (that&#x27;s the &quot;effectively anonymous&quot; approach, here), resulting in that user facing legal consequences. (This is opposed to the current system, where Parler could be technically designed to be unable to complete that link (Yeah, Parler are idiots.) and any kind of moderation relies on Parler&#x27;s goodwill.)<p>AWS can continue to host Parler under the cover of a statement like &quot;The POPO are keeping them in check.&quot; Or, AWS can kick them off based on measurable facts like &quot;they got more than 10 or 15 subpoenas a day for three months&quot;.<p>As for your last paragraph...<p>Personally, I think Parler was a sewer filled with the morally and intellectually challenged who lack any sense of responsibility as citizens of the United States of America. (My understanding is that its users were limited to the US, btw.) I understand and agree with its vendor&#x27;s decisions not to do business with them any more, in the same way I understand and agree with their decisions not to do business with ISIS recruitment sites.<p>The rich left loves &quot;consequences&quot;, except for themselves. The rich right loves &quot;consequences&quot;, except for themselves. \nThe poor love &quot;consequences&quot;, except for themselves. Libertarians love &quot;consequences&quot;, except for themselves. You love &quot;consequences&quot;, except for yourself. I love &quot;consequences&quot;, except for myself.[2] Everyone loves &quot;consequences&quot;, except for themselves.  Because humans suck.<p>[1] Yeah, I&#x27;m a formal logic guy.<p>[2] Except I don&#x27;t really, schadenfreude aside. I seem find in myself a streak of moralism and an excessive sensitivity to fairness. It sucks. Even my schadenfreude doesn&#x27;t extend to the Darwin awards.')
