At every stage of the process, I was presented with tens or hundreds of pages of paperwork that I was expected to sign, most of which was exactly the same as the paperwork I had approved in the previous round, with changes only on a page or two to reflect the renegotiated terms. However - I had no proof of that similarity, and so I had to read through every page to verify it for myself. If I could have had a programmatic way to show that a) changes only occurred in the following places, and b) the original document that I reviewed is the same as a blessed authoritative template provided by some trusted independent party, the whole process would have gone a lot faster.<p>Actually, now I come to think of it, this wouldn&#x27;t even need blockchain - it could just be Version Control, right?')
