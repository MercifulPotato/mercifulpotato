Drive implies you aren&#x27;t the prime mover in the mechanism (i.e., an engine is doing the work, and you&#x27;re merely performing the task of executive signaling and control to that set of movers and systems carrying you along do so. The inflection point is actually legal in nature; in that once you slap a motor on it, you require licensure, because you&#x27;re driving now. This is also why I disagree with driving being a privilege granted by the State; I&#x27;m not big on large edifi telling me I can only utilize mechanical devices at their whim, but such is life, yes, I&#x27;ve had the argument before, no I&#x27;m not going into it now).<p>A cyclist, however is the mechanism. You can make the argument that it&#x27;s silly, but I&#x27;ll bet you more people will look at you funny for saying cyclists drive than for saying the operator of a motor vehicle rides especially given the legal baggage that comes with driving.<p>Aside from that, they&#x27;re quite easy to identify. They&#x27;re usually the ones either breaking traffic laws, or being ignored&#x2F;cursed at because their mere existance increases the volatility of motor vehicle traffic patterns in urban environments.')
