You&#x27;ll find plenty of niche market software shops that don&#x27;t want to bother targeting more than one distribution, and that being the case they target RHEL. If you&#x27;re writing and selling some niche business software, do you really want to dedicate your limited support resources (which, let&#x27;s be honest, are probably your developers!) to supporting other distros?<p>At the end of the day, what do you need from the distribution itself? It&#x27;s a tool to run the software you care about. Some distributions take pride in providing that software as a part of the distribution, but not RHEL. RHEL is stable, it&#x27;s a known entity. You want a newer version of PHP? Go for it, but you&#x27;re building and packaging your own on RHEL. And for many shops - not just enterprises - the &quot;you&quot; here is not actually anybody at the company, but some external vendor or some OSS project maintainer who packages everything (including dependencies) for RHEL.<p>And by the way, this is why Docker containers are so popular now - you can incorporate whatever system libs you want directly in your deployment bundle, and know that if the base system can run Docker you don&#x27;t have to think about it. Something old and crufty like RHEL, as long as it has good Docker support (yes, arguable...) - you never need to care how old and crufty it is (they DO backport major kernel improvements to their custom kernels).')
