Item(by='rorroe53', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611482914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882704, text='I think hybrid approach will be the best for most people. It&#x27;s good to see co-workers regularly, maybe once or twice a week max. It&#x27;s nice, though not a requirement for tasks that require high level of collaboration, and at least for me helps avoiding certain feeling of detachment from my work.<p>However, I would never want to return to working from office 100% of the time. When I really need to concentrate alone, I find home to be much better for that. Having to go to office every working day is also way too limiting in terms of where I can live - the hybrid model allows people much more freedom to choose where they live, long commute is perfectly fine if you only do it once or twice a week.')
