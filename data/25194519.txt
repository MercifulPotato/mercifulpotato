FYI, I just noticed the store link on your site is broken.<p>Having a non-opinionated system using a simple http call makes sense to me.  I would say the main drawback is that a lot of automated certificate management has, in effect, standardized around ACME and hook points for integrating anything else seem like an afterthought.  For Traefik specifically, it&#x27;s not possible to cleanly reload TLS certificates:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;traefik&#x2F;traefik&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5495" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;traefik&#x2F;traefik&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5495</a><p>So with an ACME provider, Traefik deals with scheduling of renewals and reloading TLS certificates as needed and I don&#x27;t have to think about it.  Obviously that has the downside of being a hard to debug (for me) black box, but I think a lot of people are willing to accept opaque systems if it saves them any amount of effort &#x2F; thought.<p>That said, when I started using Traefik for TLS termination a year or two ago, it would have been <i>much</i> easier to set up cron or systemd timers to request certificates from Certera than to learn Traefik&#x27;s manual config for terminating non-docker endpoints.  In fact I might be using Certera and HAProxy for all my TLS termination had I known about it back then.<p>I&#x27;ll definitely create an issue on GitHub if I try it and run into problems, but I&#x27;ll try the existing setup first.  I actually prefer HAProxy to Traefik and IIRC the only reason I&#x27;m using Traefik is that I didn&#x27;t have an easy way to solve LE challenges in HAProxy.  If I can have Certera playing that role I could drop Traefik and it&#x27;s one less thing to keep up with.')
