I&#x27;m just not so sure if the economy of scale favors energy storage (required for large-scale EVs) or ICEs right now, or in the forseeable future if we don&#x27;t heavily invest in backup energy if renewables are not available.<p>The US is heavily dependent on air conditioning, for example. What would happen if the available energy was low in summer nights? Some kind of base energy backup needs to be there, and the energy cost of air conditioning alone is huge.')
