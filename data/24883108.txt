I&#x27;m not saying the robots wouldn&#x27;t have died from radiation, but better a robot discover a high source of radiation to its peril than a human.<p>It seems clear to me that autonomous systems will be the only way to go in such scenarios - most types of external communication are near impossible and the situation itself can be dynamic.<p>I&#x27;ve occasionally seen some very awesome work come out of Japan and the Fukushima nuclear cleanup process. Fingers crossed we can advance robotics far enough for the devastating scenario where they are really needed.')
