Women self select out of technical pursuits (CS) and self select into more verbal or empathic areas (Law or Medicine, and an even more extreme example being liberal arts) even though such areas might entail even more study than CS. This self selection is magnified when women have more choice and freedom. Women in software is more common the more poor a country is.<p>I mean it&#x27;s not only career choices where such gender differences manifest, we also see it in the choices that young children make. The burden of proof is on the camp that proposes that it&#x27;s entirely sociological since the extant empirical evidence, along multiple independent lines, contradicts it.')
