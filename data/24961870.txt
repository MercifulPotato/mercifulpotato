Item(by='squarefoot', descendants=None, kids=[24964110, 24962794], score=None, time=1604259326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960430, text='Not just Linux, being free and open in general help immensely to reduce e-waste.<p>Just think of how many old cellphones that don&#x27;t receive updates anymore could become media players, portable terminals, IoT consoles, instrumentation interfaces, retrogaming consoles, in-vehicle dash screens, etc. if only the manufacturers released the information necessary to install much faster and open operating systems and write device divers for them. Each one of these old phones recycled that way would be one less phone thrown away.<p>The Pine 64 isn&#x27;t anything special hardware wise, actually it&#x27;s way inferior to most popular phones (but runs much more optimized software, and no preinstalled junkware), however, being able to customize it to the point one day I could give it new life by buying say a faster mainboard instead of a complete cellphone then ditching the old one in a landfill, makes a killer argument in favor of Open Source software <i>and</i> hardware.')
