Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602029111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702910, text='The parent comment was comparing DJ equipment to a record player (to this patent), which I feel is a poor example because modern DJ equipment almost always has different equipment too rather even if you could technically do it with a fader and some record players (as in at a gig, I&#x27;m aware people still mix on vinyl - pretentious as it can be).<p>The patented guitar thing is literally played the same way but in a different place, which I think should really be considered prior art unless the fashion aspect is considered rather than purely functionality.')
