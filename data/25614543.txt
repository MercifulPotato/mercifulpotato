I have no trouble focusing for long blocks of time on tasks I&#x27;m engaged in, or even on any of my work in a week where I&#x27;m feeling motivated, but the problem is there will be days where I feel like I spent the whole day working (doing code reviews, answering questions, doing things for other people, etc.) but didn&#x27;t get any of my project work done. I think those days tend to happen around boundaries where I finish one of my tasks and have to pick up a new significant task that I don&#x27;t feel pushed to get started with for one reason or another (maybe combined with external life factors). A lot of other software engineers I&#x27;ve talked to can relate to this, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just me. This system is more for me to smooth out my productivity so I can make sure that I&#x27;m always getting some of my own stuff done and not just doing &quot;filler work&quot;. The &quot;intentionally doing one thing at a time&quot; thing also just makes me feel a lot better and makes it easier to blow through an entire day with almost no distractions. There have been two or three days that were Fridays I think where I decided to take a break from the system just for a day and it&#x27;s really remarkable how much worse it feels :)')
