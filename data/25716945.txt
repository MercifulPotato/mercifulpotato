I read it as the maximum, not the slope. The confusion is from the use of higher instead of faster. Faster would be the rate of change while higher is absolute value.<p>&gt; We know for sure that the average temperatures have risen higher in the last 40 years than they have ever before.<p>This could be a year over year increase in maximum, with a very small slope too')
