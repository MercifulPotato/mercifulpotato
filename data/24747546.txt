Loss of coolant accidents are unforgiving in boiling water reactors and quickly fail catastrophically (in the engineering sense).<p>&gt;  the 1950s design CANDU reactor is small enough to be considered “modular”<p>Ummm, no. I stood in front of reactor #4 at Darlington just before it went into production. I think this was the last CANDU reactor to go into service in Canada. The scale of the reactor, the turbine hall, and the containment building are incomparable to anything else man-made that I&#x27;ve experienced.<p>The large size compared to equivalent boiling water reactors accounts for the CANDU&#x27;s primary failing: it costs too much. Especially in the age of fracking, nuclear is uncompetitive cost wise compared to natural gas.<p>The supporters of nuclear energy and The Green New Deal both rely on a working assumption that the cost of CO2 emissions is the only important factor moving forward. Geographic and geopolitical considerations may play a significant role in continental Europe, Japan, and China but I have yet to hear a reasonable non-ideological argument against a natural gas centric strategy in North America.')
