There is probably still some cachet in a name brand publisher. And they do some things for you which would otherwise take time. On the other hand, for better or worse, editing was pretty lightweight and more errors crept through copy-editing than should have. I did go ahead with a v2 of one book but I probably wouldn&#x27;t actively pursue a publisher if I do another book at some point.<p>The summary makes it sound as if the co-authors worked together pretty well although I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t completely friction-free. It&#x27;s very easy to end up with a co-author who likes the idea of having written a book more than they like the act of writing it.')
