Or just a fan?<p>Thanks for the response!<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a small clock between the sending date and the (double) tick which indicates just that.<p>Cool, I see it now. But there&#x27;s still no way to change it. In Snapchat, when I set the time it impacts all messages in the conversation. It&#x27;d be nice to have the timer impact all messages in the conversation, it&#x27;s weird how it is set at the conversation level but doesn&#x27;t apply to all messages in that conversation.<p>&gt; Which features are you missing on the desktop version?<p>Create new group. Invite friends. Change your avatar. Change group avatar. Literally had to text myself a picture from my Macbook to my Phone so I could use it as my avatar. Oof. Windows Desktop version vs iOS app version. MacOS version I dont&#x27;t think is any better.<p>Found another annoying thing... two actually. &quot;Mark as unread&quot; is device specific, not message specific. Also under the little info on each message there&#x27;s a button &quot;Delete Message&quot; but again it&#x27;s not a real delete, it just impacts the device -- all the other places they said, &quot;Delete message for me&quot; so they know it&#x27;s confusing to just say &quot;Delete&quot; and not have it actually delete the message for everyone.<p>&gt; It does suck on iOS from what I&#x27;ve read.<p>Good it works better on other platforms, but yeah it really sucks on iOS. Get a new phone, and you have to be re-added to groups.<p>&gt; If you compare Signal with Discord, Slack and Microsoft Teams, Signal will never win on features.<p>Why? Doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d be impossible to sync all messages across all devices. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;d be hard to allow for deletion of sent messages. It&#x27;s not peer-to-peer, and they keep all the messages on the server... when you turn on Signal Desktop it goes and retrieves the messages for you going back quite a ways. They just need to sync between devices.')
