From there she was more interested in making stand-alone little animations&#x2F;games in Scratch itself, and now (almost 2 years later) is mostly obsessed with making objects in Blender and has started doing physical electronics using various kits.<p>I basically let her follow her own path, I show her how I do something then if sheâ€™s keen to try it I stick her in front of the keyboard and she does it herself with me verbally guiding (but never reaching over to take control, something I personally think is important).<p>She loves hanging out in my workshop and watching me prototype electronics or work on my own game dev or tinker on other hardware&#x2F;software projects, and she knows at any time she can have a go (and she does, regularly).')
