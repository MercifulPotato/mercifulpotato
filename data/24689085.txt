I looked through the oldest photos I have online, and it looks like they are all after that setup, or at least don&#x27;t include any photos of it.<p>With the exception of the two monitors, which were $1,100 each, the setup boiled down to roughly: $300 for super duper monitor arm, $250 for the entertainment center (close out from fancy furniture place), club chair I already had, but was $350 from a going out of business furniture place.  Also $50 for a couple USB hubs I sticky tape mounted conveniently located on entertainment center (computer was back behind entertainment center).')
