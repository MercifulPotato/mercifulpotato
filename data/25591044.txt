But that’s part of the taxi medallion scam. They convince governments that the medallion owners drive their own cabs (ha!) and everyone just pretends that the exploitative rental scheme for drivers doesn’t exist. Like I said, it’s always struck me as odd that so many people that I agree with ideologically are insanely loud about how evil&#x2F;corrupt Uber and Lyft are (and they are!), but say nothing about the taxi ecosystem, which is, I will argue, worse for drivers and passengers.<p>I’ve spoken to enough Uber drivers who used to be cab drivers to know that the alternative isn’t any better. That isn’t to say those people like Uber — but it’s not any worse than the taxi industry. It’s almost like we have to face the reality that essential jobs in our society, like drivers, are often poorly paid and exploited. And that it is systemic. But people don’t want to do that.')
