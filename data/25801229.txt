But be aware that it has no error handling around view() method and any error thrown from there will irreversibly break mithril internals everywhere on the page, this is by design. Second thing, I didn’t push it to the limit as another commenter, but massive vdoms (many tens of thousands of vnodes) are slow to even rebuild and compare, so you’ll have to use lazy techniques described in docs. It is not exclusive to mithril, but worth knowing. Otherwise, mithril is basically a core vdom tech similar to vue and&#x2F;or react, wish these two had their render cycles as separate packages. Also, if someone knows a cheap way to turn react into mithril’s spirit, e.g. via light setState-detaching layer, please share.')
