Item(by='mariodiana', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602877285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24803922, text='There&#x27;s a book that came out some years ago, <i>Proust and the Squid,</i> by Maryanne Wolf, on the subject of reading and the brain. Part of the book discusses dyslexia. Now, I read it years ago, the book is fairly dense at times, and neuroscience is not my field. With those disclaimers in mind, let me offer a guess.<p>Paraphrasing wildly, Wolf said that writing as a technology is something we built by repurposing different areas of our brain that evolved in response to our pre-literate environment. Our brains didn&#x27;t evolve to read. Reading is one of those marvelous things that we hairless apes have managed by pushing ourselves. It&#x27;s what we do.<p>Dyslexia is, essentially, to put it in computer terms, the result of slow throughput in the cognitive system we&#x27;ve built from our (spoken) language part of the brain and our visual-spatial part (which probably evolved in response to recognizing details on the landscape, etc). In most people, when they learn to read, the brain &quot;wires up&quot; this system in an efficient way. It&#x27;s wired up cleanly. In people with dyslexia, the wiring is more like a rat&#x27;s nest â€” or maybe &quot;spaghetti&quot; would be a better way of putting it. (Again, I&#x27;m paraphrasing!)<p>Dyslexia is more prevalent among left-handed people. It seems like (if I remember left and right sides of the brain correctly), language is on one side of the brain, and visual-spatial is on the other. Now, left-handed people are right-brain dominant. And, if I remember correctly, left-brain dominant people are better at wiring up their brains, when the &quot;wiring&quot; needs to cross over from one side of the brain to the other. In general, right-handed people do a better job at building a &quot;system&quot; than left-handed.<p>Regarding Chinese and Japanese, the article talked about the way these writing systems are taught: namely, students are made to sound out what they&#x27;re writing, over and over. So, if I were to guess, this slow and deliberate practice recruits all the parts of the brain involved more energetically, and as a result helps the individual compensate for any innate, relative deficiency in building a cognitive system that coordinates left and right sides of the brain: meaning, wiring up a brain that can read.<p>That&#x27;s my best guess. Speaking out loud while learning to write may be the critical difference.')
