The 3 mutations hypothesized to have the largest potential biological effect are N501Y, spike deletion 69-70del and P681H.&quot;<p>The B.1.351 (South Africa) variant has N501Y but not the 69-70 deletion. We&#x27;re still learning, but virologists I follow are concerned that N501Y may be a driver of higher transmission. But it&#x27;s likely that multiple mutations contribute.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asm.org&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;2021&#x2F;January&#x2F;B-1-1-7-What-We-Know-About-the-Novel-SARS-CoV-2-Va" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asm.org&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;2021&#x2F;January&#x2F;B-1-1-7-What-We-Know-A...</a>')
