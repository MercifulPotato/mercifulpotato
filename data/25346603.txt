And $200 headphones beat $400 speakers.<p>I can&#x27;t afford to find out beyond that, but I suspect things get more nuanced on the ultra-high-end.<p>For me, for music, I&#x27;m happy with something like a Sony MDRV6 studio monitor, which sells for under $100. I don&#x27;t know of speakers I like under $200.<p>Headphones are also nice for teleconferencing, where speakers aren&#x27;t.')
