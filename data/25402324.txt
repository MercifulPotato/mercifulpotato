It&#x27;s wishful thinking on my end so maybe isn&#x27;t reasonable, but man it&#x27;d be neat.  I get annoyed when people point out &quot;you can already get a dev license for free.&quot;  Sure, but there are hoops to jump through and you can&#x27;t run it &quot;in production&quot; (which I think is mostly a meaningless claim, but still not something I like).<p>Nevertheless I&#x27;m optimistic and hope they announce it sooner rather than later.  Hopefully the current blowback will move things along ;-)')
