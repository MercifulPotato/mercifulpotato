Item(by='alistairSH', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610120366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25685093, text='In the US, voting is decentralized (state control their own election&#x2F;ballot processes).  The parties control their own candidates.<p>So, we have primaries for each party.  Some states are open (anybody can vote, but only for one party&#x27;s candidates) while other states are closed (only party members can vote).  Then, after the primary winners are selected, there is a general election where to select among each party&#x27;s winners.<p>Most of these elections are plurality, although some states require majority (with runoff between 2 top candidates).<p>Basically, this leads to extreme candidates winning the primaries, then trying to pivot to center for the general election.  It also means that if a primary has many options, as the GOP 2016 primary did, you get results like Trump - all the reasonable candidates cancelled each other out.<p>Pivoting to approval voting would be relatively easy - the ballots don&#x27;t change much (just allow 1+ choice per race).  We could maintain party&#x2F;state primaries and a national general, but move them all to approval.  That would avoid 3rd party spoilers and hopefully prevent the fringe of either party becoming the nominee&#x2F;winner.<p>This ignore the added complexity of the Electoral College. That&#x27;s an anachronism for another post.')
