There&#x27;s plenty of permissive F&#x2F;OSS projects with large numbers of contributors.<p>&gt; It would have a dozen proprietary forks.<p>Probably, but proprietary forks don&#x27;t stop F&#x2F;OSS contributions. They can even be the source of them, as upstreaming everything that isn&#x27;t secret sauce reduced the cost of maintaining the proprietary fork. A number of the big sources of F&#x2F;OSS contributions to Postgres are maintainers of proprietary downstream distributions (I don&#x27;t know that all are strictly forks, since I think the proprietary bits of at least some are using the extension mechanism.)')
