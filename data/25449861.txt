I worked at Red Hat in global support in the RHEL 5&#x2F;6 era and the developers were very opinionated and the dedication to Open Source amongst developers especially was almost cult like.<p>Many developers were brilliant, and it wasn&#x27;t uncommon to hear that they took the role with Red Hat earning substantially less then their previous roles so they could have 20-50% work time dedicated to their open source project. Also Red Hat would be fairly flexible and many worked offsite, so were able to have a cheaper cost of living.<p>Many times these open source project wasn&#x27;t even part of the RHEL &#x2F; paid offerings, however it was obvious that management liked having a team of brilliant engineers on the book to throw at troubleshooting serious issues. When the largest customers would have a serious ongoing problem, they would often demand these engineers, who would often be thrown in a room with engineers from all the other vendors to &quot;Fix It&quot;.<p>I wonder if these people are going to start to leave and need to be retained at higher salaries. If this would then cause a loss of talent that will affect the ability to support those highest value customers. If this ends up costing Red Hat more in the long run.')
