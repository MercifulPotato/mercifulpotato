Very unpleasant action.  They have nothing to lose and everything to gain.<p>Instead of being able to positively leverage the geographically dispersed workers for National political leverage, the companies now become the target of government actions they should have feared all along they would be.<p>All because of a boneheaded stunt like this.')
