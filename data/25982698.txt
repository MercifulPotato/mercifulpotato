(the harmonic series). The average (mean, median, mode[0]) is (depending on <i>how</i> pedantic you want to be) either 0 or 0+ε[1], but in any case strictly less than any positive real number, while every element of the sequence is a positive real number.<p>So it&#x27;s not true <i>by definition</i>; it&#x27;s a consequence of the basic sanity constraints that you&#x27;re working with.<p>0: Strictly speaking mode only applies to continuous ditributions (ie, with a continuous probability density function) or fully discrete distibutions (eg heads vs tails), but 0 is the only (real number) x such that for any sufficiently small positive distance δ, the number of elements in x±δ is strictly greater than the number in x±2δ but not in x±δ (namely, all but a finite number of the inifitely many elements in x±2δ are also in x±δ).<p>1: Where ε is some surreal number[2] strictly less than any positive real number, but not necessarily 1&#x2F;ω specifically.<p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Surreal_number" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Surreal_number</a>')
