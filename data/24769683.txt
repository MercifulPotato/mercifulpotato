Therefore we must focus and invest in AI, as well as fear it, because it is taking over.<p>The damage done is obvious. We discount human agency and human labor in the face of this idea. Products are being sold based on this idea. Foreign and domestic policy, security and privacy, and private and public funding are being redirected by this idea.<p>If one were to simply replace &quot;AI&quot; with &quot;machine learning&quot;, which is the name of the actual technology in most of these cases, in most of these contexts the hype and ideology would go away. And with it take away the attention and the money. We would then be able to focus on better things.')
