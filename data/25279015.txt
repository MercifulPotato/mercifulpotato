Comically bad.<p>I had an amazing indie music discovery service in Google Play Music. I found so many fantastic underplayed artists, and it helped me explore all the small music venues in my city. I&#x27;ve got a wall full of signed albums from artists I discovered with Google Play Music.<p>YouTube music recommends <i>Britney Spears</i>. It&#x27;s so awfully wrong about my tastes.<p>It also randomly inserts YouTube parody videos into my playlist. Why the hell would I want to listen to stuff like this \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-5jWtz3rzco" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;-5jWtz3rzco</a> ?<p>I hate Google so much now. They&#x27;re like evil 90&#x27;s Microsoft, but incompetent.

Remember when it leaked that they were internally threatening to defund it if they couldn&#x27;t hit growth targets? Imagine all their B2B relationships getting hit as hard as their consumers do.')
