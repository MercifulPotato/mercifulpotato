GADTs, row polymorphism, and PPX extensions I&#x27;ve wished for in particular because they solve some problems I frequently run into with MVU&#x2F;Elmish architecture on the front end.<p>F# instead has inline functions with static constraints (similar to C++ templates), type providers, computation expressions, and units of measure.')
