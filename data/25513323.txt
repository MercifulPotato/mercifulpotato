The only one here that is clueless is you if you think it was without &#x27;issue.&#x27; Hell, I worked for Kimbal who is on the Board at Tesla and he openly talks about how many times Tesla almost went under in the few interviews&#x2F;podcasts he&#x27;s been on. What echo chamber do you live in to think there was no issue?<p>&gt; This is such a clueless comment.<p>I&#x27;ve been in Motorsports with close ties to manufactures since I was 17, and then went on to work for Volkswagen Audi Group (the largest manufacture of cars by scale) and then to BMW and then back to VW because of Diesel-gate, then Nissan in various capacities from technician to supply chain. Then I tried my hand at Tesla during Model 3 ramp up and saw FIRST HAND why&#x2F;how the delay in ramp was occurring in 2017 with 2 trips to the Fremont Factory before deciding to decline and focus on SpaceX instead.<p>What experience do you have in that Industry to call it clueless?<p>I know Apple cultists are as rabid as Elon worshipers, but the two combined are completely toxic.<p>&gt;  I doubt anyone here would say Apple couldn&#x27;t make their own car, but the idea of Apple mass manufacturing a brand new car in four years is a bit crazy. In your example, Tesla took nearly a decade of focus and half a billion in capital to begin small production of the Model S.<p>In 3 years? A prototype to build hype and take pre-orders that still needs all the regulatory compliance to be on the road ahead of it, sure; a refined 49-1 street legal product that&#x27;s mass produced with scaled production line, distribution channels and supply chain to accommodate domestic, let alone international, deliveries: HELL NO!<p>Money alone won&#x27;t buy you that, especially if COVID is still shutting&#x2F;delaying down so many factories, International supply lines and look at the distribution system Tesla had to INVENT because it refused to play by the dealership system.<p>You FAANG guys live in an unrealistic bubble and think because it works for mobile&#x2F;computers, and I laugh when I say &#x27;works&#x27; because look at India, it <i>should</i> work for several ton vehicles with way more complexity and red tape than you can possibly imagine.<p>You&#x27;re comparing vastly different Industries that have little to nothing in common.<p>Nissan just announced that it will be making its EVs in Japan [0] instead of Sunderland, so unless Apple decides to detract from its business model built on slave labour in Asia, chances are it will not happen.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;nissan-picks-japan-over-sunderland-102829824.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;nissan-picks-japan-over-sunde...</a>')
