How about: &quot;Politically motivated minority persecution?&quot;<p>Maybe a bit too much. How about: &quot;Social Engineering via Targeted Group Deplatforming?&quot;<p>Because that is how these look-like to me and to a lot of these &quot;persecuted&quot; groups. These groups aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;hateful&quot; or &quot;organizing&quot; violence. A lot of the time it&#x27;s just distasteful, kinda sexist etc and the &quot;platform&quot; owners simply <i>don&#x27;t like them</i> and want to keep them from growing because (I think) they think that there is a real fear that societal opinion might swing their way. However the missing key here is that a lot of times, these are genuine &quot;political movements&quot; <i>before</i> they&#x27;ve cooled &amp; solidified, and exist solely as mis-directed or nebulous emotion, hence the &quot;hateful&quot; and distasteful content.<p>Not all, but a good chunk of them of course. Sometimes you just get bad groups, but in a lot of <i>those</i> cases, I think it&#x27;s more clear that they&#x27;re doing something blatantly evil. For lack of a better example: coordinating and sharing info on how to sabotage deforestation using dangerous methods like putting nails inside trees, which would cause chainsaws to snap and hurt the operators.')
