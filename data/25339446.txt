Employer cut off the employment two weeks early and court ruled that it shouldn&#x27;t be considered a resignation, but instead a termination by employer.<p>&gt; What&#x27;s the parallel between those facts and the dispute here?<p>That it&#x27;s, at best for Google, the <i>exact same thing</i>, except that Google gave Gebru, <i>in writing</i>, an explicit, non-resignation reason for the early separation, making it even less disputable that it was a firing and not merely accepting the (disputed) resignation? Paraphrased most favorably to the Google management narrative, Gebru said “do X or I will conduct discussions around setting a date on which I will resign” and Google management said “we accept your resignation and, further, based on an internal group e-mail you sent after this dispute started which we find unacceptable, we are ending your employment immediately.”')
