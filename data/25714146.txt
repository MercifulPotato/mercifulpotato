The reason for fixed pricing is to cover commission + if I got a lot of users with like &quot;$0.01&#x2F;mo&quot; usage, then it&#x27;d be hard to support all of them, it&#x27;s literally free option.<p>I thought about prepaid, I don&#x27;t remember exactly why I declined that option. I think I liked the digital ocean model, though they don&#x27;t have fixed dollar.<p>Hmm')
