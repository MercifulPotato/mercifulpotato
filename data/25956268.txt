You can&#x27;t take money &quot;out of the market&quot; because there is no outside, just as the environmentalists say you cannot throw things away because there is no away.<p>There are vast hundreds of billions that cannot exit the market. Everything from oligarchs to 401ks to the Norwegian pension fund (which owns a little chunk of Gamestop!). There is nowhere else to go.<p>Conversely there are a lot of &quot;outsiders&quot; who are looking for more and more radical strategies where they don&#x27;t certainly lose, fed by information of increasing volume and deteriorating quality. They&#x27;re just going to keep trying stuff that doesn&#x27;t normally work.')
