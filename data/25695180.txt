There are plenty of (worse?) examples that Twitter and Facebook essentially ignored or (maybe mostly Facebook) amplified like in Sri Lanka or Myanmar.<p>I view this ban as a result of internal politics at Twitter as more people have sided with those employees who don’t like trump (er, basically all of them) <i>and</i> want to replay form him. Maybe I’m wrong and it’s really motivated by self interest given fear of some legislation other than a defence spending bill being passed, but it makes me feel better to imagine that these decisions are the result of careful moral thought and ethical considerations rather than some political calculation or CEO’s journey of self discovery')
