I did this by running the code in WSGI instance, and it via nginx. Setting up all the activation files, locked-down permissions, secure sockets was pretty finicky to get right, and took non-trivial amount of time.  \nIt would have been much easier to use Python&#x27;s built-in web server and expose to internet directly. It has fewer moving parts and generally more predictable.<p>I still went with more complex solution -- because I needed logging, security and large file offload. And I used built-in web server for development.<p>There requirements of &quot;production&quot; system are pretty different than &quot;development&quot; one. Sometimes people are willing to install bigger (and therefore more fragile) system when they need more features.')
