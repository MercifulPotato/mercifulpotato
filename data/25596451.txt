Your problem is that you trust different sources of information from your family (or your coworkers). You believe all four of the claims you listed are lies because you were told it by sources of information you trust. Your family has the opposite belief about COVID because they were told it by sources of information they trust, and the sources they trust are different from the ones you trust. (Note, btw, that I personally agree with your &quot;lie&quot; judgment on only two of the four claims--the COVID claim is one of them, so I evidently have a different set of information sources I trust than either you or your family.)<p>Your counter argument would probably be that the sources of information you trust are obviously more reliable than the sources of information your family trusts. But my response would be that, if we actually look at track records, <i>no</i> source of information available to any of us is all that trustworthy; all of them will purvey lies and misinformation if it serves their interests. While I suppose one could describe that problem as &quot;lies&quot;, it&#x27;s actually much worse than that simple term suggests: as I have just shown above, not only are we being told lies, but we can&#x27;t even agree on <i>which</i> things we are being told are lies and which are not, because there are <i>no</i> sources of information that have maintained a good enough track record of trustworthiness to serve as arbiters to such disputes.')
