Also, the more accent, the better quality I need from the phone to understand them.<p>Voice quality from worst to best:<p>1. cell phone<p>2. wired phone<p>3. Skype<p>4. in person<p>My hearing has declined somewhat (too much fooling about with hotrods), making the situation worse.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed when listening to a talk show. It&#x27;s easier to understand the host than the guest, especially when the audio is speeded up. Apparently, a professional host enunciates words better.<p>I&#x27;ve looked around for a speech coach to improve my enunciation for the presentations I give, but all I could find were autism speech therapists and singing coaches, sigh. (I want to improve my enunciation because the easier it is for people to understand my speech, the more they&#x27;ll pay attention to my presentation. I know that I sometimes give up listening to a presentation when I have to work too hard to understand the speech.)<p>I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of video conferencing for work these days (like everyone else) and decided to trash my $5 mike and get a semi pro one so people could hear me clearly.')
