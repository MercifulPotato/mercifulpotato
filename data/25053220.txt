I found some stats (from 2011) that were roughly 20% SF &amp; NY (bucketed together), 30% the rest of the U.S.,  30% Europe, and 20% elsewhere. I&#x27;m surprised. 20% for two cities, and 50% for one country are still a pretty heavy focus, but definitely not to the degree I&#x27;d previously thought.')
