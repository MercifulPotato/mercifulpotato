Gave it up in &#x27;09 when the bottom fell out of the economy and my cofounder and I got scared.  This year I was being heavily recruited by Roblox and on the &quot;meet the executives&quot; part of the process, ended up reminiscing with David about all the competition back then - companies like Sploder, Game Closure, etc.  It was a crowded market even back in &#x27;06-07.<p>What Roblox had that we didn&#x27;t was persistence.  David Baszucki has been working on this problem since before I had a computer - he started his first company in 1989 with a recognizable predecessor of an idea, and sold it in 1998.
