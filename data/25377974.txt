They don&#x27;t have chefs, their Uncles are not Senators. They live in the suburbs in slightly better than normal homes, their parents drive Audis and they do their homework. They had braces as kids, and never had to worry about healthcare. Their &#x27;Dentist&#x27; father is not &#x27;connected&#x27;. They are really not that different from most kids, other than they never have to worry.')
