I&#x27;ve heard plenty of anecdotes of this stuff (maybe a couple dozen?) but even that&#x27;s not nearly enough for me to feel confidently say &quot;this is a widespread problem&quot;.<p>I had the opposite reaction. I was a bit surprised that OP was surprised this was happening. Roughly 20% of my amazon purchases have had some kind of card in them with an offer of money for a good review. I guess I just figured it was widespread thing. I only ever get cards with cheap mass manufactured items under $30, mostly electronics like cables or adapters along with a few cat toys.')
