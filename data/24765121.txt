Apple is trying to take over computing and prevent us from running our own software on our own devices. We should prevent them and anyone else trying to do this from using our software.<p>This is precisely what GPLv3 is for. If you distribute a GPLv3 program, its users must be able to modify it and run their modified versions.<p>I&#x27;d imagine this is why Apple is allergic to GPLv3, but you know what... that&#x27;s fine, I wouldn&#x27;t want them to distribute software I write if its users aren&#x27;t going to be allowed to change that. The issue so far is there&#x27;s not enough GPLv3 software out there for them to care. If more people use it, that could change!')
