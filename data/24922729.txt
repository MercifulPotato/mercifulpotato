Item(by='slavak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603911456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921393, text='_Commercial aviation_ has a stellar safety record. The safety record for private and general aviation flying is pretty atrocious, and non-airline commercial operations (part 91, part 135) have varying levels of safety somewhere in between.<p>I think there can be little argument against the assertion that modernizing the general aviation fleet would improve safety. The majority of GA aircraft are using 60&#x27;s technology carburetted reciprocating engines and running on leaded gasoline, and the cockpit is mostly analogue gauges with mechanical vacuum-driven gyros. Every car manufactured since the 90&#x27;s uses fuel injection, yet GA pilots still need to worry about carburetor icing. That&#x27;s not even going into other modern safety improvements like digital autopilot or ballistic recovery parachutes.')
