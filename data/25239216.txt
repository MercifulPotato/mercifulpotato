In fact, the companies I feel most mistreated by are those who have pushed more and more cross platform (Electron &amp; out of place UI&#x2F;UX) onto the platform.<p>(A notable exception to that feeling is VSCode. While I would quite prefer a native app with its features, I’ll gladly pay the Electron tax because it’s the best editor I’ve ever used.)')
