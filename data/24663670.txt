Their main selling point was no commercials because you were paying for it.  Now just sitting down and watching something on cable is a chore.  I gave up and built my own library of things to watch.   Was visiting some family and was watching a marathon of some show.  It was the same 10 commercials over and over.  Each break was usually 3-5 mins long.  It was a good reminder of why I buy my own media.')
