I was under the mistaken impression that France managed to build 57 reactors, which produce about 50GW, in 23 years, and the first of those took only 7 years to build.  There&#x27;s even a rumor that some were built in only 5 years.  Good thing you taught me that nuclear power cannot possibly be built that fast, or I would have died believing that crazy conspiracy theory!')
