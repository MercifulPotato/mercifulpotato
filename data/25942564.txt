But if someone had that attitude, and couldn&#x27;t be bothered to discuss design impacting changes with the devs who are making sweeping changes impacted by the contributor&#x27;s change?

Other developers do not have the right to make changes, push for the development to go in a certain direction, etc. If an author wants that they&#x27;ll turn stewardship over to a committee and maybe be part of such a committee. You have only two rights with Open Source work you want to work differently: fork it or forget about it (i.e., not use it).  Anything else is a massive gift from the maintainer(s) and should be viewed as such.<p>And yeah, as you can tell from the last paragraph I&#x27;ll proudly wear an Arsehole button to avoid wearing a Burnout button. Heck, to borrow from Bruce Lee in Snowcrash, I&#x27;d even wear a &quot;12 Gauge&quot; button to avoid burnout (button only though, the behavior is not for me).')
