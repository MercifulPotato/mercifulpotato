Being strictly egalitarian gets you labeled racist pretty quickly in many online forums. Just this past week in my neighborhood Buy Nothing group someone put up an item and made it available only to BIPOC people. Some people called it out as discriminatory and antithetical to community-building. They got called racist and accused of white fragility and were both muted for two weeks. No one on the side of orthodoxy got muted.')
