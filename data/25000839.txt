Ugh....nevermind&quot;<p>IMO ipv6 would have gotten far more adoption had they used a different assignment scheme:<p>* Turn every ipv4 assignment into an ipv6 assignment by zero-extending to the left, i.e. 72.217.16.142 becomes ::72.217.16.142<p>* New addresses come from a new assignment ::2a00:0000:0000&#x2F;96 which contains as much as the ipv4 space. So new addresses look like ::2a00:72.217.16.142. A little bit messier than ipv4, but still tidy mostly.<p>In fact, this address syntax is a valid syntax variant of ipv6 addresses. These addresses are just not assigned today.<p>Had we used this scheme instead of the current one with its extremely long addresses, we&#x27;d have had far greater adoption than now.<p>Note: yes I&#x27;m aware of slight incompatibility issues between ipv6 and ipv4, like higher minimum MTU values of ipv6. I&#x27;m not suggesting a translation of ipv4 to ipv6 here, the hosts would still speak the two different protocols, but the <i>assignment</i> would match the ipv4 assignment.')
