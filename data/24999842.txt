That appears to be the reason other fintechs like Stripe&#x2F;PayPal opposed the deal. Very odd to see this lawsuit filed on the potential for a future product vs. an existing product Plaid offers already. Not a lawyer but wonder what the precedence for this is.<p>2 - DOJ is targeting Visa as a monopoly in the online debit transaction space. They don&#x27;t see them as a Visa-Mastercard duopoly. Interesting to compare the DOJ&#x27;s decision to call Visa a monopoly &amp; block the acquisition vs. a full on monopoly lawsuit for Google.<p>3 - Wonder what implications this will have on exits for other fintech firms, and startups generally. Definitely makes going public more attractive if the government is signaling that they&#x27;re not opposed to putting up significant blocks to prevent acquisitions. Delaying an acquisition like this really will spook employees with stock options &amp; VCs')
