Not sure how to get there.<p>Stop giving a single person that much power. The US is huge, it made sense back when news took a month to make it across the country, but now it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Many of the best-run democracies in the world have a history of unappealing presidents, prime ministers, and so on. You don&#x27;t need better candidates, you need the President to matter less. You want the seats in the houses to dominate the media, not the figurehead.<p>(free bonus: it&#x27;ll also help you get rid of that ridiculous two-party system)')
