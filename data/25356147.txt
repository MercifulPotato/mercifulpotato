What they put out is consistently <i>good</i>, and sometimes even great. While other studios might put out a better movie from time to time than Disney, their batting average is consistently higher than everyone else.<p>The same with Apple. With few exceptions, I can walk into an Apple store and buy an arbitrary product and be assured that it’s, at the minimum, good. Contrast with someone like Samsung who has great products but also really bad products. I can’t pull a random Samsung out of a hat and be convinced that I’ll like it.')
