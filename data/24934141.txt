What to learn next?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I also studied maths and physics, among things I do remember. From those starting subjects, and knowing that I intend to start my career in the domain of computer graphics, I&#x27;m looking for a set of other &quot;logical&quot; next ones to learn.<p>And I&#x27;m struggling with defining &quot;logical&quot; in this context. Because right now my primary focus is deepening the set I already have, further exploring those subjects (something I&#x27;m doing right now with C++ and CG), and maybe learn a language like Lua. But on the other hand, after finding that job, I want to broaden my general CS knowledge, I&#x27;m really curious about cryptocurrencies and what I can do as a CS engineer to help solve the big problems of our time, such as climate change. So any answer going either direction is welcomed.')
