I don&#x27;t think this notion gets highlighted enough.<p>This is definitively anecdotal, though I&#x27;ve been at &#x2F; through approximately 5 startups across 12 years, and looking back, I believe each end everyone one (except for one) was definitely helped &#x2F; started by a founder or set of founders who didn&#x27;t have to worry about whether they went belly up or not due to family wealth. Hell, I still know some that I&#x27;ve consulted for that have lived in the bay area for the past 8 years without a product that makes any money, no vc funding, and were just out of their masters 8 years ago.<p>Clearly looking back, nearly every founder I&#x27;ve worked for came from a family with $$$. Even currently, at least one of my co-ceos just up and left their 2 million dollar menlo park house and went to live in their parents vacation home in monterey right when covid began.<p>Taking risks becomes extremely easy when you have a large family wealth backed safety net propping you up along the way. This happens way more often than people realize, and often the founder(s) will definitely not talk about this at all &#x2F; downplay it if it is brought up.<p>The privilege is real.')
