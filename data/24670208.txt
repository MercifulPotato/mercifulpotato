Gravity is so weak it can be ignored.<p>Relativity deals with so much gravity that spacetime is warped.<p>Neither is appropriate for the other and they are on opposite sides of the spectrum. Classical physics is useful in the middle at &quot;human&quot; scale.<p>What would be nice is a simple theory that covers it all. Nothing we currently have is able to stretch to be useful in all situations.<p>Sean Carroll&#x27;s _The Big Picture_ was useful for me, as was the older _A Brief History Of Time_ by Stephen Hawking')
