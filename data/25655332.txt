For example it can take tens to hundred milliseconds to start a python 3 interpreter. This effect becomes even more noticeable when you have to do it multiple times, by chaining multiple scripts together.<p>You can avoid the slow startup by using languages that are able to generate small compiled binary, but then you wouldn&#x27;t call it a script, because you have to recompile for every change.<p>Then there are other approaches like xonsh, where you (roughly speaking) replace bash or zsh with a python interpreter. Now you don&#x27;t have to start the interpreter over and over again, because your shell is python. I think it&#x27;s an interesting approach, but you have to like python and you will hardly find xonsh on any remote machine, so you are probably still confronted with bash and the like.')
