I remember back when EA was ridiculed for their statement about &quot;giving a players a sense of pride and accomplishment&quot; regarding requiring a long grind (or big payment) to unlock the most powerful characters in a Star Wars game. I&#x27;ve seen people beg developers to give them something pointless to grind for because they won&#x27;t play a game without rewards. I think developers know how to make fun games, but I don&#x27;t think most players want fun games because they&#x27;ve been conditioned to want addiction simulators with meaningless rewards.')
