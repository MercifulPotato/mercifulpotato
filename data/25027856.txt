Python3 is perhaps the most disappointing of these.  I was very hopeful in the beginning, but it&#x27;s been years now, and for plain old &quot;getting shit done&quot; work, it&#x27;s just not as good as Python2.  It&#x27;s true that lots of libraries are now no longer supported for Python2, but &quot;ha ha, we took your libraries away&quot; isn&#x27;t really an appealing argument for 3 when you&#x27;re just trying to get your work done.  It&#x27;s maddening.')
