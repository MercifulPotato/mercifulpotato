Item(by='jjoonathan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606838068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265490, text='I&#x27;m a night owl (sleep 12-8am) who occasionally experiences season-long hard constraints that force me into early bird schedules (sleep 8-4am). Whenever the temperatures get high and I don&#x27;t have access to an air-conditioned gym, I have to get up for the daily temperature minimum, whatever it takes. Since this happens for an entire summer, it gives me the chance to adapt to the schedule and optimize around it.<p>The early bird schedule didn&#x27;t reveal an untapped reserve of morning energy. It didn&#x27;t shift my late night energy burst into the morning. In fact, it didn&#x27;t shift the productivity burst at all -- it eliminated it. This wasn&#x27;t for lack of sunlight and exercise; getting up early to run outside was the entire point. It wasn&#x27;t for lack of cold showers, which were remarkably pleasant after suffering in the heat. It wasn&#x27;t due to a poor diet, or meal scheduling, which I experimented with.<p>To hear the early birds talk about it, these exercises should have transformed me into a superior moral being of hyper-optimized productivity, overflowing with perfection in every aspect of spirituality and performance. That isn&#x27;t what happened. Not in part, not in whole. The net effect was small and negative. I traded high-energy night hours for low-energy morning hours. It was worth it to access the daily temperature minimum, but I wasn&#x27;t able to make the morning schedule work for me, despite having every intent and incentive to do so. When the constraint lifted, I moved back to my regular schedule and recaptured its benefits.<p>Night owls: try the early bird schedule, there are enough people who report benefits from switching that you owe it a solid try.<p>Early birds: tips and anecdotes are fine, but frame them in terms of what works for you. Cut the sanctimonious bullshit. It isn&#x27;t helpful, it isn&#x27;t appreciated, and it isn&#x27;t appropriate.')
