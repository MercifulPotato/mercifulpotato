Close enough loopholes (intentional loopholes or otherwise) and companies end up spending more money on tax lawyers than the value of the actual tax break.  Even if some companies are able to use some loopholes, closing many of them still means more tax revenue for states.  We don&#x27;t need to get to a &quot;perfect&quot; state here.')
