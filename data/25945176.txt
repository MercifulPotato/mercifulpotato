Never mind the means (dosh) to higher education.<p>In the U.S. my parent&#x27;s were working class, broken home. Neither parents had ever invested, knew anything about 401Ks, Roth IRAs, neither owned their own home, knew about mortgages....<p>So I was beginning at square one and had to teach myself all these things, pay for my own college, etc.<p>Unless &quot;networks and connections&quot; allow you access to the Next Level (and I have observed this may in fact be true, allowing some to &quot;fail upward&quot;) I think the bigger hurdle is not having the environment that gives you an investing and monetary success mindset.<p>I have taught my children as best I can. We&#x27;ll see how this experiment plays out with the next generation....')
