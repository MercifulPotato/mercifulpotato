I&#x27;m going to do that right now (I have 5 cameras... which I bought a week before Google announced they were locking-down the Nest ecosystem and web-service, so I now refuse to buy any more Nest products and I recommend Ubiqiti gear instead now - Ubiqiti have everything Nest does except a thermostat and smoke detector (but they do have a temperature sensor product (&quot;mFI-THS&quot;) - and an adapter to bridge any RS-232 connected device (&quot;mPort&quot;), so you could attach an RS-232 controllable thermostat that way - it just wouldn&#x27;t be as sexy as Nest&#x27;s giant metal knob).')
