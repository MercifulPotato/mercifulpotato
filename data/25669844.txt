After supplying all the documentation they asked for, they came back to me, &quot;our investigation believes the account was not opened fraudulently&quot;<p>Last summer I get a teams message from my manager &quot;Call me ASAP&quot; uhhh, crap, what did I do wrong.<p>HR had received an attempt to verify my unemployment claim. Uh, er, what? Apparently, like millions of other Americans this past summer, I was one of the people that someone tried to fraudulently collect unemployment benefits on.<p>I contacted the unemployment office her and reported it, a day or so later got a form email back stating this was happening like crazy and I needed to take no further action.<p>&gt;our investigation believes the account was not opened fraudulently&quot; (i.e. that they were saying that the account, and credit tradeline, were in fact mine).<p>This is an ongoing fear of mine. That come tax time they&#x27;re going to be like &quot;whoa, you owe all these taxes on the thousands of unemployment income you were paid&quot; and I&#x27;ll be like &quot;uhhhhhhhh, no?&quot;')
