It would have been bizarre to complain about how pointillism in art lacked fundamental theory when artists first embraced it. If people want to play around with a new approach to computing and spend some money doing so, I don&#x27;t think having them sit down and prove theorems about optimal data structures is strictly necessary. Maybe it won&#x27;t be mathematically perfect on the first go around, but who cares?')
