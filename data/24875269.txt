Not trying to be dismissive, but I can&#x27;t find any on DDG or Google.<p>&gt; And of course, he actually did advocate for legalization of child rape earlier in his career.<p>He never did that. He advocated for child consent. You may think I&#x27;m nitpicking but it&#x27;s an important distinction. Child rape colloquially means unconsentual &#x2F; forced sex, but technically means any sex since children cannot legally consent. If you say he defends child rape you are colloquially saying he defends  unconsentual sex, when he never did such a thing.')
