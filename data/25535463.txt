Garmin&#x27;s high end watches are styled just the same as standard timepieces, but they just happen to be serious fitness trackers (in particular, see the Forerunner 945, Fenix series, and Marq series). Even with the standard wristband they generally fit in where any other timepiece would, and even more so if you pair it with a classic metal band (which is easily swapped in). Likewise, the watch face is customizable and subdued, unlike the glaringly bright screen of an Apple Watch. It&#x27;s hard to pass off an Apple Watch as anything but obvious, chintzy tech gear.')
