I am not sure if this spin on the cited references is novel but it is the first I am seeing any of it.  I am jarred how well it describes the &quot;middle&quot; of society, including how many of my own behaviors&#x2F;beliefs are captured.<p>One thing I am having trouble with is the connection between Michael and the &quot;educated&quot; ladder, even though a big portion of the article is dedicated to that.  I will have to mull on it more before I can convincingly respond to &quot;So you think Michael Scott represents the PhDs of the world?&quot;<p>If you are the author, kudos to you.')
