I&#x27;ve always been fascinating by PyPy&#x27;s performance, personally -- anecdotally, I&#x27;ve achieved ~10x speedups from just running a script with `pypy` instead of `python`. I always attributed that to better performance of the JIT, but I could be wrong.<p>I have nothing against Rust personally, but it&#x27;s ultimately not an apples-to-apples comparison if they&#x27;re not implementing the same algorithm, or even if they&#x27;re not using the same mechanisms (e.g. Rust explicitly using SSE intrinsics, which are certainly available to C in just as idiomatic a fashion).')
