Feel free to replace money&#x2F;power people and regular people with aristocrat&#x2F;pleb, master&#x2F;slave, clergy&#x2F;believers, cult leader&#x2F;cult follower, ubermensh&#x2F;human, etc.<p>It&#x27;s really all incredibly boring because regular people who graduate to money&#x2F;power, quickly adopt money&#x2F;power beliefs and the cycle continues.<p>(Author of this article should read a little Karl Marx, he&#x27;s re-inventing Das Kapital)')
