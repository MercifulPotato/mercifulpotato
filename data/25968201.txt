The notice period in paragraph 2 shall not apply where a provider of online intermediation services:</i><p><i>(a) is subject to a legal or regulatory obligation which requires it to terminate the provision of the whole of its online intermediation services to a given business user in a manner which does not allow it to respect that notice period; or</i><p><i>(b) exercises a right of termination under an imperative reason pursuant to national law which is in compliance with Union law;</i><p><i>(c) can demonstrate that the business user concerned has repeatedly infringed the applicable terms and conditions, resulting in the termination of the provision of the whole of the online intermediation services in question.</i><p><i>In cases where the notice period in paragraph 2 does not apply, the provider of online intermediation services shall provide the business user concerned, without undue delay, with a statement of reasons for that decision on a durable medium.</i><p>So it all comes down to what their reasons for the suspension were.<p>EDIT: Just saw this update: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;element_hq&#x2F;status&#x2F;1355465650114846720" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;element_hq&#x2F;status&#x2F;135546565011484...</a> So they revealed their reasons within 12 hours, which I&#x27;m going to file under &quot;without undue delay&quot;. (But did they use a &quot;durable medium&quot;?)')
