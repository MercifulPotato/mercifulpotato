Copying the default.nix for the up to date version and changing a few of the options got it up and running with minimal fuss.<p>There are certainly some rough edges around usability, but the fundamental value prop is immense.<p>Also just using nix as a secondary package manager on mac or some other Linux distro is great, I&#x27;d expect shell.nix to start showing up in an increasing amount of OSS projects. It showed up in hashicorp&#x27;s latest project')
