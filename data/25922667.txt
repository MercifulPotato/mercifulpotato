Item(by='rsstack', descendants=None, kids=[25922757, 25922902], score=None, time=1611706742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922604, text='&gt; ASD is characterized by an ability to focus intently on an area of special interest, developing an unusually detailed level of knowledge of that topic.<p>However, this is not true. It doesn&#x27;t apply to all people with ASD. I volunteered with adults with ASD about ten years ago. One person in the group really had a special interest fixation (a person), but he didn&#x27;t know more than the average person would know after reading a single biography. He was barely able to read or remember complex facts, so I don&#x27;t think he had the ability to develop an unusually detailed level of knowledge of that topic or any other. The rest didn&#x27;t have any memorable interests, but I guess it&#x27;s also possible that it wasn&#x27;t cultivated in them.')
