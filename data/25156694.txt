Sorry, that&#x27;s just the price they pay for using a webview as a shortcut to providing a full browser.<p>Okay. So using a browser library for building a browser is a shortcut, and that disqualifies it from being a &quot;full&quot; browser. Of course one of the fundamental tenets of software is to <i>not</i> reuse other people&#x27;s work. Silly me.<p>brb writing my own browser called Chremium and petitioning Google to allow it. Apart from that I&#x27;ll also publish a library that uses the guts of Chremium, called the Chremium Ombodded Framework, which can be embedded in other applications.<p>Of course any application that uses the COF is indistinguishable from Chremium itself, but Google won&#x27;t then distrust Chremium because it can&#x27;t distinguish it from COF any more, right?')
