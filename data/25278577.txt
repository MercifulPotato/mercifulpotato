But not 1Gbps..<p>I also move between three or four places and I want consistency. The extreme case I talked about was in the mountains. <i>However</i>, the coverage was <i>good</i>, but the &quot;internet&quot; sucked. It is this that&#x27;s infuriating. You never know. Sometimes, you have 30Mbps on mobile, sometimes you have 120kbps. If there&#x27;s no consistency, you can&#x27;t forecast. You can&#x27;t rely on something like that.<p>The operations part also sucks. So, given the unreliability and the inability to be consistent, I&#x27;ll just sprinkle places with StarLink terminals and have one thing fewer to think about.')
