All the wireless protocol that we use are actually &quot;raw&quot; radio whatever that means. You can use them to do P2P communication if you want to as demonstrated by this protocol.<p>The way you physically transport data can be safely decoupled from how you will encode and how you want your protocol to work. It makes thinking about the different layers easier and allow them to evolve independantly. Nothing prevents you from building an IP network using ham radio as a transport. The OSI model wasn&#x27;t developed as a purely theorical concept. It does solve a practical problem.')
