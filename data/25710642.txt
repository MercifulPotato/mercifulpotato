That is true, but it seems there is context missing to that argument.<p>It appears that the tech industry operates as a cartel that has a monopoly over almost all of the technological world. This is the real problem. Ironically, a lot of people here think it is great, because they aren&#x27;t coming for them. The only problem is, this is very shortsighted. They will come for everyone, and maybe one day, you won&#x27;t align with their views. Many civilisations already realised the problem with this type of situation, and that is why constitutions and religions and laws were formed and created successful societies.<p>The fact is that Apple and Google own almost 100% of the smartphone platform, which is one of the biggest platforms. Google owns almost 100% of the browser platform, twitter pretty much owns the short-form political communication platform, etc. This creates a different context, where they should really be governed by the rules of a democratic society, rather than of a couple of unelected billionaires.<p>Another issue here is that they are essentially destroying all of their competition. Parler is competition to twitter. When the tech giants work together, they can end every form of competition against them. Nobody here has a problem with that? It seems that everybody here has left-wing views and because the tech giants align with those views, they are turning a blind-eye to everything.<p>It is interesting that we have had months of riots and deaths from antifa and BLM, with entire blocks turned to ash, yet there was no outrage here. Suddenly, someone with a bullhorn hat on gets into the whitehouse, and it is supposedly now a green light for technological tyranny like we have never seen before.<p>Not only that, but all of this censorship is going to create extreme violence. Without a voice, your enemies have no other avenues left.')
