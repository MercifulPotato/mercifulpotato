The macOS platform is &quot;older&quot; now and more popular than when PPC was around. There&#x27;s more old applications laying around, unmaintained. Also, don&#x27;t forget that &quot;windows compatibility&quot; was a huge Mac selling point when they switched to x86.<p>So, I suspect a minimum of 8 years support, but possibly indefinitely if Windows can&#x27;t make the jump to ARM. Again, pure speculation, but what will be the deciding factor is if x86 virtualization on ARM Mac ever becomes a thing. (And I hope it does!)')
