Even if you leave waypoints, there is a chance they get lost. Backups and Redundancy come into play here. But it takes time to comment every line of code, it takes time to read through comments to get to the code the other way. How hard is it to type other way backwards to make a point? It is too hard, I didnd&#x27; tant \nwant to do that, jkust moved on.\nYou will get typos at your conflict point. You are having a breaskthrpu breakthrough just keep coing. It will not be the final, you will be able to change it later if it is the final.\nStop.\nIf it is not the final version, and you know it is not the final version, then why treat it like such.?<p>Thats the same as the war analogy. analogy. This conflict can manifest itself at many levels.\nyou do this when you rtype\ning\njust keep going, don&#x27;t stop. ssertainly don&#x27;t delere the \nwhole line\nthat will be goign to far. backtracking Vrom lost? skip\nmaze\nBesides, I don&#x27; teven know it is going to be my final piece of the code. But this way at some point I will reach my objective without sweating the small stuff. That is looking at the comparison twice.')
