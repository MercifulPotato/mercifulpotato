Use the right size for the job.<p>For minor little trips around town, I use the Fiat 500L. It has 5 seats in 2 rows.<p>For high speed, or a bit more stuff, I use the Subaru Ascent. It has 8 seats in 3 rows.<p>For traveling with the whole family, I use the Ford E-350 extended-length passenger van. It has 15 seats in 5 rows.<p>Before I bought the smaller cars, I had to drive the van everywhere. It&#x27;s a beast, 3 tons empty or 5 tons full. I think I get about 12 MPG, which is efficient per-person when I&#x27;m bringing a dozen kids. As a commuter car, the van is horrible.')
