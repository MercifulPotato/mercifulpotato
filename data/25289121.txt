The pandemic has turned endless, boring in-office meetings into endless, boring video calls. It’s also just too painful for engineering teams to wrangle with complex pull requests using a brittle string of tools like Zoom, Skype, Tmux, GNU screen, and a variety of IDEs.<p>Solution:<p>CoScreen enables pair&#x2F;mob&#x2F;team programming like no other solution and we believe it can reduce the cost of context switching by up to 80% [2] so you can focus on what actually matters - reviewing code, troubleshooting bugs, or building major new features.<p>CoScreen is a desktop app that enables multiple users to share application windows with each other at the same time. You can think of it like a shared desktop where any user can interact with any shared window as if it were their own via remote mouse and keyboard to allow them to collaborate like never before (they can even copy and paste code across windows of different users). In addition to built-in video chat, and remote control, we&#x27;re also launching a Slack integration so that you can embed CoScreen into your daily workflow. Integrations with VS Code and other IDEs will follow soon.<p>Our progress since our HN Show post last year:<p>After CoScreen went to the front page in November 2019 [3], we saw a huge interest in this entirely new way to collaborate and to get things done as a team. We’re incredibly thankful, as it helped us transition from a weekend and late-night project to a full-time undertaking with a stellar, globally distributed team. We&#x27;ve engineered the new app from scratch and we give you more control over what you share than any other tool.<p>CoScreen uses P2P whenever you and a second participant can connect directly (e.g. when no corporate firewalls or proxies are between the two of you) so none of your window and control data touches our servers. Otherwise, up to a dozen participants can collaborate using our enterprise-grade, HIPAA-compatible video infrastructure with hundreds of servers around the globe that run the awesome open-source framework Jitsi. All video data is encrypted using DTLS-SRTP during transmission and in addition, we’re planning to support end-to-end encryption soon.<p>With the help of UX experts who originally designed Slack, we&#x27;ve also created a new, minimalistic UI that never gets in your way and have done hundreds of evaluation sessions with testers of our private beta. We&#x27;re making our new macOS version publicly available today for free [1]. The Windows alpha is already in final internal testing and you can sign up for early access for it and our future Linux and web clients [4].\nCan’t wait? See for yourself how CoScreen works [5, 6].<p>What happens next:<p>A few hundred early-adopters, and our own internal team have used CoScreen for the last six months.These early insights have been instrumental to our code and design reviews, bug fixing, standups, and feature development since the pandemic hit. Now we want more teams to benefit from CoScreen and are therefore offering CoScreen entirely for free for the next six months. We’ll keep sign-ups open as long as our infrastructure allows. We’re working hard to support other platforms, offer the best performance in terms of latency and quality (it&#x27;s already much better than Zoom’s), and further reduce CPU and memory usage.<p>Thanks again to the HN community for helping us to get to this point.
