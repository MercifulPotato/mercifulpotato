The University I worked for just had hundreds of wired and wireless access points and limited staff to manage them so devices had to be registered to protect everyone.  It was self-service IIRC.  If you connected with an unrecognized device it just took you to a login page and then the device was registered to you.  I don&#x27;t think there was any tracking of what students were actually <i>doing</i> once they were connected.  Certainly not at the kind of detail that could suggest anything about radicalization.')
