However that&#x27;s frequently not the case in many large companies.<p>Many times it just comes down to something along the lines of these pages being run by non-technical folks in sales&#x2F;marketing that are just click-to-adding widgets&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;tags every week without ever removing anything. As a result, you see a lot of very low-hanging fruit make it into the final production site. It&#x27;s not unheard of to see a website of a household name brand load in multiple versions of the entire jQuery library, for example. I&#x27;ve personally seen a major site from a recognizable brand that otherwise loaded in &lt;1MB, but then proceeded to load Google Tag Manager and pull down an extra 15MB of JS&#x2F;images.<p>My point is, I think you&#x27;re discounting the &quot;AMP enforces some good best practices &#x2F; forbids some bad patterns&quot; point.')
