I could suddenly talk to people of almost any faith about their religion which had been hard before. But only as long as they held their faith kind of loosely as a cultural or philosophical mantle.<p>But I could no longer have the same kind of conversations that I used to with my old theology friends who were all still Biblical literalists. Not that every conversation devoloved into argument nor that I was even particularly insistent on my new view. But after some amount of talking we&#x27;d hit a disagreement and quickly find the root of that disagreement was some basic belief we held about the universe. Something as atheological as why people are philanderers comes down to whether you believe in evolution via natural selection or original sin.<p>And that is where America is politically today. There are fundamental facts and values we disagree about. I find writing like this to be incredibly patronizing. As if people aren&#x27;t already having polite discussions about politics. As if people are voting and do not know what they are for and against. The funny part too is that we are at a point where that is least true. Voter&#x27;s knowledge of their party&#x27;s policies is at an all time high.<p>It&#x27;s hard to accept that we just fundamentally disagree. But that is the fact. Eventually, one side is going to win or we&#x27;ll remain deadlocked and muddle on with some hybrid policies from both sides. But the polite conversation over the pot roast isn&#x27;t going to convince Nana that fetuses don&#x27;t have souls. That&#x27;s not a simple difference of opinion it&#x27;s a difference of faith.')
