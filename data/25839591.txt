If it&#x27;s stolen, I&#x27;ll take the hit on my deductible and also keep my privacy.<p>If it becomes ubiquitous, is only a matter of time before it becomes mandatory. Or, the car maker sells your data and pretends that doing so helps offset the cost of making the car, the way the TV makers  do.<p>That said, my wife&#x27;s car came with a tracker. It was free when we bought the car. Around the fourth year, we got a letter in the mail stating that it would suddenly cost $40&#x2F;month, and if we didn&#x27;t pay, we could no longer be tracked. Sounded good to me!')
