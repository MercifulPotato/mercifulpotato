Was it designed specifically for the Pi? I can&#x27;t find any reference to it on the Broadcom website, which is strange, nor any record of its use in any other device, e.g. a smartphone.<p>&gt; Sort of. The BCM2835 (Pi 1) was originally designed as a set top box SoC and was used in devices like the 1st gen Roku boxes. The BCM2836 (Pi 2), BCM2837 (Pi 3) and BCM2837B0 (Pi 3+) were designed for and only used by Pi boards. The BCM2711 was designed for and only used by the Pi 4 but it is closely related to a new BCM7211 which is for set top box usage.')
