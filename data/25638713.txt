In reality, however, it wasnâ€™t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second summary and then moved on to other things.&quot;<p>Alternatively, you can simply leave your new position off your resume and not talk about it in the interviews at all.  There is nothing wrong with saying &quot;My last gig was a software engineer at Stripe.  I left there to focus on looking for a better fitting opportunity&quot;.<p>There is no need to have your resume be a complete record of your employment. In fact, such resumes are often less desirable because they are long and don&#x27;t highlight any specific strengths. Instead, make your resume highlight your most relevant and best accomplishments.<p>I&#x27;ve only been a professional for 10 years, but I am already condensing my resume, removing descriptions from my first few jobs.  I imagine that as time goes on, I will even group jobs together like &quot;2010 - 2015 - Software engineer at Companies A, B, C&quot; to keep my resume a nice, neat one pager, and focus on the more important things I have done recently.  Like the OP, I&#x27;ve also quit two jobs shortly after I stared them during my career and those are definitely not on the list - its simply not relevant.')
