At 5&#x27;-9&quot; the overweight category starts a little over 169 lbs and the obese category starts just above 203 lbs.  Given that as a teenager I was well into the overweight category with a six-pack and very little fat from an active lifestyle and playing a lot of basketball multiple times a week, I could easily see how just eating more might put be closer to obese while still having less fat than one would expect from that designation.<p>That&#x27;s not to deny Americans have a problem with weight.  I just think it&#x27;s counter-productive to use metrics that people can easily see are problematic when trying to make a valid point.  Using controversial measurements because the are easily available is lazy.')
