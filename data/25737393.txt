The casting out of Ron Paul made me really mad. Thanks for reminding me.<p>No, no party is better really. The GOP is the same. It&#x27;s run by the same kinds of old farts. My main source of good feelings towards the GOP is that I tend to agree with their unelected members. But more and more I&#x27;m seeing those members also hate the GOP establishment. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see the party fracture heavily soon. I hope the democrat party also has the same split. There are good, decent democrats that share common principles and who I&#x27;m sure cannot stand their party leadership. I mean, the DNC is so bad, that I actually feel sorry for my left-leaning friends who also seem unable to get any representation.')
