Right now if you want to solve a problem, you need someone with a deep understanding of that specific problem to develop a solution. For a complex problem like diagnosing cancer patients, you are talking about a team of people with decades if not centuries of combined experience in oncology on top of the actual programming expertise to implement the tool. The holy grail of ML is to reach the point where someone who is an expert on making ML systems can apply the same (or substantially similar) tools and expertise to a wide range of problems - the same team that makes a cancer diagnosis system could also make a legal text search system or a protein folding system. Realistically we&#x27;ll probably never get to the point where zero domain knowledge is required, but even if the requirement is just substantially reduced to the point where the ML expert can learn what they need in months instead of years, that would be revolutionary.')
