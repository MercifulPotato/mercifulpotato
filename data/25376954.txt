However, when that faded, what remained? A large department store with high overhead, and products that were not outstanding but certainly cost more than their competitors.<p>I would go into one ever so often, but ultimately I left empty-handed, wondering: who is this store for? I make a decent salary but can&#x27;t really justify spending that much money on a shirt that doesn&#x27;t really fit or look any better than something I would get from another clothing store for half the price of less. At that price point, I&#x27;m really hoping for someone to measure me, help me find a shirt, and then send it for tailoring so I actually have something that fits. May as well just go to a smaller store for that sort of experience, no?<p>HBC probably needs to rebrand as a smaller boutique, let go of things like appliances and other products they can&#x27;t compete with more specialized retailers &#x2F; Amazon &#x2F; etc on, and push further towards emphasizing the parts of brick-n-mortar retail that still make sense: the personalized experience, recommendations, evaluation of how something looks on you, helping you try things on, etc.<p>The real question is, what the hell do we do with all this gigantic retail space, especially in relatively newer malls?')
