I think some people have said that democracy is designed to imitate revolutions without actually being violent: that if much of the populace is armed and not <i>that</i> many people have enough gear and training to make them enormously more effective than a random person with a gun, then &quot;one person, one vote; majority wins&quot; approximately reflects what would happen if there <i>was</i> a violent revolution, so people don&#x27;t have much to gain by adding violence.  If that&#x27;s true, then appeasing the mob by letting them more or less get their policies implemented may be best even if those policies are not the bestâ€”because the alternative is risking a bloody revolution followed by the mob implementing their policies anyway.<p>That&#x27;s one perspective, anyway.')
