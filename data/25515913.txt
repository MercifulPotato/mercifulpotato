(I am 35 :-o) : I was a frequent (~3-4 times a day , 5 mins each time) visitor to coupon sites [0] hoping to snag that elusive discount. It hit me that over the course of 1 year I might save ~$500 but I&#x27;d have to spend 30mins each day (so potentially 200 hours a year in time alone not to mention the context switching) to save ~$500. My time is worth &gt;$2.5&#x2F;hour isn&#x27;t it? So, I now have consciously decided to save up the extra $500 for these sort of purchases. Totally worth it!<p>[0] www.ozbargain.com.au')
