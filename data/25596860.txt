The real challenge is googling to first gain entry-level vocabulary and understanding of a complicated topic so that you can then google for what you really need. Learning to break a complex task into a series of manageable steps to be queried is a valuable skill. Googling until you actually know what you don&#x27;t know can save a ton of time. Sometimes it requires googling the same thing many times with only slight search term changes, comparing different sources, learning to tell expert from amateur opinion, and knowing when you are being sold something.')
