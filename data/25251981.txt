From this perspective things do look bleak because our foreseeable mobility window will remain in this diminishing cohort.<p>&gt;lagging behind trigger events<p>I think so too. Productivity and growth increase YoY, in theory there is potential for net good to be generated if distributed fairly (and in a sense it is for the bottom 90%). But geometric growth is not sustainable, the ceiling feels close (global warming), and eventually growth will slow down to the point where competition for resources and privileges becomes essentially zero sum. Or worse if population outstrips the productivity + 0.1% continues to aggregate a disproportionate share.')
