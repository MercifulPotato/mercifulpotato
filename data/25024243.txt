All the resources went to learning algorithms and ANNs.<p>In the human brain learning is just memory encoding, and that encoding is not an iterative trial and error process as conventional ANN model forces you to believe.<p>We have made a bit of progress since Mccullough &amp; Pitts, and Rosenblatt work. But the field is mostly stuck there in the 1940s-60s from the neuro- and cognitive modelling perspective.<p>I&#x27;ve added most of the content on SDM page [1], you can find many related developments there. Also see [2] for some old and newer memory models.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.columbia.edu&#x2F;~nvg1&#x2F;Wickelgren&#x2F;papers&#x2F;1981aWAW.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.columbia.edu&#x2F;~nvg1&#x2F;Wickelgren&#x2F;papers&#x2F;1981aWAW.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sparse_distributed_memory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sparse_distributed_memory</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cognitive_architecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cognitive_architecture</a>')
