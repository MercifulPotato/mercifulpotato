And we&#x27;ve all only trained in restaurant software, and our instincts don&#x27;t always carry over to home-cooked software. Creating a culture of home-cooked software must happen in the margins, without capital, because capital by nature goes to restaurants.<p>It&#x27;s challenging, but it seems worth trying.<p>(This comment has been percolating over the course of many conversations in the Future of Coding forum: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futureofcoding.org&#x2F;community" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;futureofcoding.org&#x2F;community</a>)')
