And I&#x27;ve never heard that its importance is in any way tied to its production.  Welles took film from &quot;filmed stage plays&quot; and literally opened up the genre.  He ripped up floorboards to get the right perspective.  He innovated direction right and left.<p>The only aspect of the film being about Hearst was that its debut was canned, distribution was shot, and he would never (really) be allowed to make another film again.')
