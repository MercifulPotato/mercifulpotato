This doesn&#x27;t scare anybody?<p>Not particularly, the UK has just concluded their approval of this vaccine and the EU and US are also reviewing it, so if there is something wrong they will most likely find it. There are enough different vaccines in development that there isn&#x27;t much incentive to ignore faults if they show up.<p>&gt;Why has this not been approved before?<p>I think it is new technology, which arrival has been accelerated by the enormous investments in vaccine technology over the past year.<p>&gt;Would an mRNA vaccine be approved under less pressing circumstances...?<p>Can&#x27;t really comment on this because I don&#x27;t know much about it, but I would guess that they would have never reached the approval state without the pandemic and the huge need for parallel development of vaccines. I think that at all times there are a bunch of technological developments that are on the cusp of being ready for broad adoption that are just waiting for some boost in funding that propels them to maturity. Progress happens very quick when the whole world has a need for the development of something.')
