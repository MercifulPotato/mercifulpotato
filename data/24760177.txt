I can abstractly talk about what I&#x27;ve done professionally, but, having solid code I did in isolation, especially early in my career was invaluable. And to that end, &quot;culture fit&quot; probably worked more in my favor than my code, it&#x27;s royally messed up, but being young-ish and a cis american white man totally gave me an unfair advantage. And those side projects probably spoke more to me as a culture fit than a technical one in retrospect.')
