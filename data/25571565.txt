Almost nobody has a natural tendency to act on violent thoughts, so playing a violent video game is unlikely to cause issues in real life. Most people will have sexual encounters at some point in their life though, so getting an unrealistic expectation of them can cause serious issues in the person&#x27;s life. For example, women who think men should always cater to their demands because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s shown in movies, or men who think that women want to be treated the way they are in porn.')
