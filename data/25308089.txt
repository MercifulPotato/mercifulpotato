The 7nm part is specifically meant for desktop computers. The part meant for laptop computers, that has graphics, uses a different memory controller, has different I&#x2F;O characteristics, and uses very different cache structures, was always meant for 5nm only.<p>They both, however, share almost the exact same CPU logic, which is why we know that performance characteristics will be essentially identical.<p>You <i>could</i> ship a laptop with the 7nm chip, and it was done with Zen 1, but then you will have very high RAM power usage, you will need dedicated graphics with Non-unified memory, you will miss out on some accelerators, and you will some I&#x2F;O issues<p>Because of all these problems, no one thinks it worth it to design a laptop against the 7nm parts, and it&#x27;s not possible to build a 7nm version of the laptop part without very high investment.')
