She can and should ask her techie grandson for help when buying an used phone.<p>There is absolutely no excuse for this purely anti-competitive behavior.<p>FWIW I&#x27;m not an Apple hater, I think their laptops and phones are the best out there.<p>But I have an android instead of an iPhone because I can&#x27;t stand not being able to install what I want in iOS, that&#x27;s a deal breaker for me.<p>And if they go the same route with MacOS I&#x27;ll switch to Dell+Ubuntu.')
