Windows has to be one of their worst, if not their worst product. GitHub and Azure are both quite good, and Office is at least OK. All their Android apps and Android integration are excellent. The new Xbox and related services are even quite good. Just every time I&#x27;m forced to use Windows (especially at work where I can&#x27;t change any aspect of it), I&#x27;m reminded of why I hated Microsoft so much.')
