OP should have compared each systems&#x27; TPU not GPU. He should redo the benchmark with a proper setup as requested in the comments here and on Medium, otherwise his post is quite misleading.<p>To facilitate Nvidia&#x27;s tensor cores OP had to use Nvidia&#x27;s own TF distr.&#x2F;image and configure it explicitly. Something PyTorch does out of the box. Nobody knows why Google doesn&#x27;t do this, maybe they want to push their own Cloud TPUs.<p>&gt; Adding PyTorch support would be high on my list.<p>Won&#x27;t happen. PyTorch needs Apple&#x27;s help bc of the lack of docs, they&#x27;ve asked already and Apple hasn&#x27;t commented or promised any kind of support, nothing. That they&#x27;ve chose TF instead of the current market leader doesn&#x27;t give me too much hope and might come from backroom deals we don&#x27;t know of.<p>Wondering why OP didn&#x27;t invest the money into a 2nd 2080 Ti.')
