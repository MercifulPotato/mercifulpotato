Society didn&#x27;t fall apart (though it may be coming...).  Online society did.  Discussion is being artificially narrowed online.  I believe this narrowing in combination with the fluidity of communities on platform&#x27;s like Twitter mean that all the venom of social conflict exist without the tempering of social dependence.<p>In other words, if your grocer is a Trump supporter, you might disagree but you still need food so you maintain some positive social tie.  On Twitter there is no stable community to be apart of and there is no risk to telling that <i>entity</i> (read: not person) exactly how you feel about them.<p>I don&#x27;t know.  I could be wrong.  But I think my idea is both familiar enough and different enough to attract an audience and to build more socially positive interactions.')
