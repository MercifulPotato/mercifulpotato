They&#x27;re not and there are trade offs.  Those trade offs may be a net positive or a net negative, but only highlighting the negative doesn&#x27;t do any good.<p>&gt;with its own politics and power struggles and debates and meetings... A union doesn&#x27;t even necessarily act in your interests. It acts in the interests of the majority of members<p>If your going to chastise the process of advocating for your views then complain that somehow they don&#x27;t get taken into account then I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.  If your concerned that the interests of other members are outweighing yours, then participate.  If you don&#x27;t want to deal with it, don&#x27;t join the union.<p>&gt;people taking a paycheck from your union dues<p>Oh my gosh, contributing to something that you get value from... what a crazy concept.  If you don&#x27;t get value from the union, then see above; change it or don&#x27;t join.<p>&gt;Right but what if your colleagues what these BS work rules?<p>Why does the assumption automatically go towards &quot;unions would be TERRIBLE&quot;?  Most devs don&#x27;t like to put up with BS, so why do you think a union made up of devs would somehow institute a ton of BS rules just because it&#x27;s a union.  Again, if you don&#x27;t want BS union rules, then make sure the union doesn&#x27;t institute them by actually participating.<p>&gt;What if you&#x27;re junior and they want pay by seniority?<p>I hate to break it to you, but that&#x27;s called the real world.<p>At the end of the day, a union is about shifting the balance of power and advocating for the things the union sees as valuable.  What are the things you&#x27;d change about tech employment if you could?  How could a union be more effective at achieving those changes?  A union doesn&#x27;t have to just be focused on pay scales and bureaucracy.')
