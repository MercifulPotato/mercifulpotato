To be sure, the comparison between the APUs found in $999 laptops should be compared to the M1. The AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS, for example, is a 35W part though that&#x27;s more of a $1200 laptop part. The Ryzen 7 4800U and Ryzen 7 4800H are both found in $999 laptops though. There are definitely cases where the M1 wins (many single core benchmarks, and efficiency) and other cases where the 4900HS, 4800H and sometimes even 4800U wins (several benchmarks that take advantage of the 8 cores&#x2F;16 threads, and the higher TDP.)<p>You don&#x27;t need to go to the high-end server chips, like the 128 core EPYC to find competition for the M1, but you do have to take a step outside of the Apple ecosystem that only has the old Intel and the new Apple Silicon.')
