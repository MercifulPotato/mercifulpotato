Sanitation and education are undeniably better. I&#x27;m almost sure physiological (food, temperature), safety, and equality are also better, though not solved.<p>Some worries both my great^70 grandparents and I share:<p>- Losing access to food, shelter, and medical care if unable to work.<p>- Occasionally fearing for physical safety of self or loved ones.<p>- Persecution&#x2F;ostracism by community for traits or actions.<p>- Abuse by power structures (governments, churches, etc.).<p>The first worry is an economic problem that could be solved <i>this year</i> if all governments agreed to guarantee it. (The social problems are harder.)')
