If, say, 50% of those parties agree that you&#x27;ve been a particularly <i>awful</i> criminal they might <i>vote</i> that your nefarious chat should be opened up for the authorities to examine, by contributing their key fragments.<p>All sorts of social consensus protocols can be built, with arbitrary rules.  Probably most of them aren&#x27;t such a good idea, but math does allow it.<p>These days we would probably use a blockchain and smart contracts to provide very strong barriers against leakage.  Imagine the key fragments locked inside a smart contract that only gives out the key when N anonymous decision makers concur that the key should be given out, as well as deciding to whom it should be given.  In some zero-knowledge protocols it would not even be possible to find out who voted, only the result.<p>It is also possible, in ideal maths world, to design systems where an AI trawls through private conversations but can only reveal information if certain conditions are detected.  That sounds a bit dark, but if the conditions are also governed by social consensus processes perhaps that isn&#x27;t so bad.  For example if the AI is instructed (by social consensus, not authoritarians) &quot;only extract a network of conversations if they show a clear pattern of $ParticularlyAwfulCrime, otherwise leave people to their privacy&quot; perhaps that isn&#x27;t so bad.  We don&#x27;t have the technology to do that now, but we may get it eventually; math is not the obstacle.')
