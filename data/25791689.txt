I never heard about it before - it looks like a great resource.<p>Another thing I want to add on - it looks like the author is lacking curiosity. I didn&#x27;t have much discipline and structure in the beginning of my programming journey. In fact, I&#x27;ve been trying to add more discipline and structure to my learning now.<p>When I started though, I had a TON of curiosity. I fiddled all the time with everything. I fiddled with settings in Windows XP to make my family&#x27;s computer faster, I fiddled with my own laptop by installing Linux and trying out tons of programs, I fiddled with the code on my computer to make it do cool things on the command line, etc.<p>I didn&#x27;t have an end goal in mind - it was just something fun to do and I just wanted to answer all the questions in my head. Being curious drove me to learn, adding discipline and structure helps to fill in some gaps in my learning that my curiosity may have missed.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxjourney.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxjourney.com&#x2F;</a>')
