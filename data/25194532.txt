Apple designs multiple layers of security into their devices and jailbreaks these days compromise some set of these, and plus the security model of iOS is really &quot;the user vs. everything else on the operating system&quot; so the concept of &quot;root&quot; is much less important. You could consider it equivalent to &quot;rooting‚Äù, however.<p>&gt; In other words, does the existence of a jailbreak like this also imply the same strategy could work for malware?<p>Yes.')
