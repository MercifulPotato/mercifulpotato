Before that I was learning how to sew so it was a sewing machine and stuff for that. I&#x27;ve been into light woodworking projects and metalwork as well and so there&#x27;s often something coming for my workshop - Japanese saws, various bits of hardware, a tap and die set, welder, and so on. There&#x27;s a constant flow of books and video games for myself and my kids.<p>Aside from hobbies I order stuff for my dog (medicated shampoos, supplements, dog treats) and lots of household stuff (air and water filters, light bulbs, lawn mower, irrigation system parts, plumbing and electrical parts).<p>For personal goods I get some clothing (shoes and socks), office supplies, batteries, vitamins, etc...<p>My car battery seems to be dying so today I&#x27;ll ordered a charger that has a repair mode and if that doesn&#x27;t work well enough I&#x27;ll probably order a new car battery from them.<p>My purchases basically fall into three buckets. Grocery store items, clothing,  and everything else is Amazon.')
