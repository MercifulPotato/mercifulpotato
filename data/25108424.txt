All ads should go away whether personalized or not.)<p>This kind of ad is called &quot;retargeting&quot;, and it turns out to be somewhat effective. If you&#x27;re looking at a product, and you&#x27;re debating whether to buy it, seeing it again makes it more likely you&#x27;ll come back and make the purchase. (And, for that matter, makes it more likely you&#x27;ll make the purchase <i>there</i>, rather than somewhere else.)')
