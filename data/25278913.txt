(hardly obvious choices for a laptop).<p>Aluminium bodies are way less prone to &quot;oilification&quot; (aka visibly shiny areas where one&#x27;s palm rests), and I have yet to see <i>any</i> Windows laptop where the touchpad is comparable with MBPs in both size and quality (palm tracking, gestures).<p>&gt; what with glued-in batteries, un-repairable designs and keyboard reliability issues that have been ongoing for years.<p>Battery replacements are possible even for someone with only moderate experience in hardware work, but I agree with you that the process is more complex than it used to be. Regarding the keyboard: get a 2019 16-inch MBP, it has a keyboard with real keys and a physical esc key.')
