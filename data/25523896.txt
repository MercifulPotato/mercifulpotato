I earn more and feel more valued at a mid size e-commerce company than I ever did previously working for FAANG or quant finance forms.<p>I think the high wage allure of those companies only applies to very junior engineers. Once you have 4 years of experience, if you’re good, lots of places will pay FAANG levels of total comp, and most won’t put you through leetcode hazing or stick you at the back of a thousand-engineer wait line for interesting projects.')
