None of the related authors would ever frame it as being about &quot;Laziness&quot;. That&#x27;s like... the last thing Dave Allen would do.<p>Also &quot;identifying the next action&quot; (which is what you&#x27;re suggesting) is also very much a Dave Allen technique. Dave Allen adds the 2-minute rule on top of that -- if it&#x27;s 2 minutes or less, don&#x27;t bother tracking it, just do it straight away... that way you won&#x27;t pay the cost of tracking a whole extra item in your task management system.')
