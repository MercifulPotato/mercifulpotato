This isnâ€™t a hack or an omission, but an actual feature that Apple built into these devices.<p>Indefinitely? How do we know it&#x27;s a feature vs a temporarily convenient oversight?<p>&gt; Our goal is not just to make Linux run on these machines, but to polish it to the point where it can be used as a daily OS. Doing this requires a huge amount of work to be done, as Apple Silicon is a completely undocumented platform. In particular, we will be reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and developing an open source driver for it.<p>This looks like the major bullet point.  The wiki is currently empty, but while it&#x27;s WIP, it would be nice to see some of the major milestones or breakdown of the goal mentioned above.<p>Best of luck to Hector and the contributors!')
