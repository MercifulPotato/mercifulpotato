It turns the world into nothing more than a petty blame-game whereby everything comes to a halt because everyone&#x27;s too busy living in &quot;aww&quot; of other peoples&#x27; behavior to keep society chugging along - hello 2020...?<p>Shaming is the opposite of productive or effective energy. It&#x27;s just a petty way to try and control others.<p>Agree with someone, disagree, don&#x27;t have an opinion, who cares. But shaming them....egh. Feels like a waste of energy to me.')
