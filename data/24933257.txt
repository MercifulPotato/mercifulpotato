Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles all have housing costs far in excess of local wages, and are pushing poorer people out of the cities. These other cities only have a tiny fraction of external money coming in, yet have very similar problems.<p>One common thing, however: building far less housing than the population is growing in the US.<p>This is the primary effect, decades of downzoning and decreasing housing production, without taking into account the needs of the population, just the desires of landlords and homeowners.<p>What this does is push up what percentile of wealth sets the  market price. And if at the top of the wealth percentiles there are 10%-20% foreign money, then it seems like a tiny number of people are having a much bigger effect than they are.<p>Cutting out the purchases of those 10-20% wont have a huge effect on prices, but they make a great scapegoat, and let homeowners and landlords continue their profit-seeking schemes for a few more years.<p>Vancouver has both vacancy taxes and foreign purchase taxes. They do not solve the real problem, but are good window dressing and help a tiny fraction of the population.')
