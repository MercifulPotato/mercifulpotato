I haven&#x27;t considered regulatory impact. On top of that, I wasn&#x27;t thinking about pharma, or a lot of formulated products.<p>That said, setting aside the regulatory burden, from the little insight into the internals of chemical processing I had, there may be larger costs in designing and tuning the &quot;build pipeline&quot; (all the coolers, valves, reactors, etc.) than in designing the formula itself. That&#x27;s just a consequence of scaling up being expensive where your production involves manipulating matter.')
