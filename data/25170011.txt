Whereas in the past he got sent to the principal&#x27;s office, today he is sent to the community support officer.  Young jimmy has a criminal record.  Higher education is now off the table.<p>The OP had three advantages that many kids today dont: he had at least two parents.  Those parents had no contact with the criminal justice system and were themselves in good health (evidenced by the fact they were allowed to immigrate).  And his parents were probably allowed to work.  Many young kids today dont have two parents.  Many young kids have one or more parents who are not properly citizens, who dont enjoy the <i>priviledge</i> of being allowed to work legally.<p>Today is not yesturday.  Poor kids today face much greater challenges than those of the past.  Direct comparisons of situations are almost always apples and oranges.')
