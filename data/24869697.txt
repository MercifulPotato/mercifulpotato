I dearly hope they keep open sourcing falcor stuff!<p>My company uses falcor exclusively for 2 years in the datalayer and it has major advantages for us compared to graphql or other alternatives:<p>- has all the features to expect from modern data layer (caching incl. invalidation and refreshing, request batching, pluggable transport protocol, error handling, endpoint stitching, delegation, handling of references, reactivity)<p>- much simpler to reason about, focus on the core features<p>- much more flexible for certain usecases, because the schema can change&#x2F;evolve dynamically (really cool for rapid prototyping etc.)<p>- the query model (paths and path sets) is much closer to javascript and json than for graphql (also no need to parse and build a fairly complex query language string ). This allows us to gernerate nearly all queries automatcally from templates. Imagine apollo, but without any need to maunually define useQuery in the head of a component. This is really THE killer feature of falcor.')
