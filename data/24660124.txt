Binance futures (their btc&#x2F;usdt perp) is most likely cheaper if you look at take fee + spread + slippage. Their default taker fee is 4bps (or 3.6 bps if you pay it in BNB). That means you can slip $4 (with BTC at 10k) and pay the same for your exec - but with most sizes you don&#x27;t slip that much, if you trade small binance is most often better (spread + slippage wise) since the tick size (minimum spread) is 0.01bps instead of 0.5bps. And on top of that you get a massive fee discount.<p>&gt; I pay a thousand a year in trading fees to my stockbroker in Australia and they don&#x27;t even offer an API.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t compare Bitmex to an Australian stock broker, I would compare it to other crypto exchanges')
