But there was significant community pushback; it turns out many people like to &quot;comment out&quot; entire modules when doing big refactorings. There are also some interesting edge cases, for example, you can use a #[path] attribute on a module to change what the path to the file is; without a mod statement, it&#x27;s not clear where that would go.')
