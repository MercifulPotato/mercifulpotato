You already have muscle memory for all of those, and even if you&#x27;re learning a new app, it&#x27;s faster long-term to learn the shortcut than to look down and hit a non-tactile spot on the Touch Bar every time.<p>For controlling <i>other</i> applications than the currently active one, however, the Touch Bar is great. I have BetterTouchTool set up to show my currently playing music, my next calendar appointment, and the weather, plus BTT&#x27;s built-in clipboard management tool. I actually miss it when I&#x27;m working on my non-Touch Bar personal laptop.')
