We know TSMC&#x27;s 7NM can make CPUs that hit 4.5ghz, the Ryzen 5000 does this. It&#x27;s also quite likely that TSMC&#x27;s 5nm can still hit the 4ghz+ range in a CPU application.<p>What we don&#x27;t know is if the M1 can actually run at those frequencies, too, or if there&#x27;s other bottlenecks that prevent the M1 from clocking higher than it does.')
