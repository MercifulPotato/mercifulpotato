We killed them by using Amazon. And I&#x27;m glad to have participated. I much prefer Amazon passing the savings of time and money to me rather than some small business owner. The small businesses I was forced to use previously were inefficient, slow, overcharging, had terrible customer service, exploited employees, etc.<p>As an example: we killed tons of movie rental businesses by switching to Netflix. Life is much better now for everyone who isn&#x27;t a movie rental store owner, which is almost everyone.<p>Small business doesn&#x27;t mean good business and big business doesn&#x27;t mean bad business. What matters to me is the net effect, and in most cases with Amazon, the net effect is very positive.<p>The same is true for Google, Uber, and Facebook and most big tech successes. The ratio of bad:good is just worse for some of them than for others, making it harder to judge.')
