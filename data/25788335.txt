However, if the command line looks scary to you... wait until you read bad documentation :)<p>My point is: yes, programming is awesome. But just like it&#x27;s hard to become a good musician if you shy away from sheet music, programming is hard if you shy away from command line and a little web searching to know what $PATH is.<p>If that is your mindset, then maybe it&#x27;s just not for you. There&#x27;s still plenty of awesome things you can do in IT without ever touching code, though. Machine learning is accessible from nice UIs now. I used that, it&#x27;s great.<p>As pointed out by others, there&#x27;s also plenty of websites where you can either try things, or build complete projects. AWS, for one, has a fully browser-based editor for Lambda. Look it up, it might be the solution for you.')
