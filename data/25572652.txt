And dense urban areas normally have decent fixed-line broadband. And pretty good LTE.<p>One edge-case application _might_ be stadiums, large train stations etc. But in practice these days these can often be covered quite adequately with small LTE nodes. And that will improve with 5G, even without mmWave.')
