He gives the impression of having read all their books (and their opponents&#x27;) not just having skimmed Wikipedia over breakfast. Besides people&#x27;s work, he&#x27;ll ask them serious questions about (say) their known interest in some kinds or Jazz, or unrelated things about characters they would have run into at MIT in the 70s, or about the Russian education system. (I presume he has people helping him prepare, but maybe he&#x27;s just like this all the time.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conversationswithtyler.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;conversationswithtyler.com&#x2F;</a>')
