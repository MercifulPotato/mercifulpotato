I&#x27;ve written algorithms that take in 2D images and produce depth maps with live visualization in OpenGL using Haskell.  It&#x27;s incredibly practical once you learn it.<p>But I also disagree from the point that if physics did what you suggested we&#x27;d be no where at all.  If they had to start with reality before producing useful models then we would of skipped pretty much all of modern physics today.<p>All models are wrong, but some are useful as they say.')
