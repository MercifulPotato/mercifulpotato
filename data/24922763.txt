If you want something to be waterproof and small and lightweight, you are probably going to trade off some service accessibility.</i><p>My watch (Timex) does not require special tools in order to replace the battery, and it&#x27;s waterproof, small, and lightweight.<p>I unscrew four small screws on the back using the same screwdriver I&#x27;ve used for years to tighten the screws on my eyeglasses. Pop in the replacement coin cell battery, and screw it back together.<p>It takes about two minutes and costs about $5.')
