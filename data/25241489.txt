Which is great! The current state of thermal management at Apple will work great at low TDPs, but they&#x27;ve procrastinated instead of improving. If they don&#x27;t ever learn how to handle heat, this arch will still have a hard ceiling.<p>There&#x27;s nothing in M1 that indicates that Apple learned how to improve thermal management, but lots to indicate that they&#x27;d still rather make thinner&#x2F;lighter devices that compromise on repair, expansion, or sustained high-end performance — the even deeper RAM integration, offering binned parts as the lower-end &quot;budget&quot; option instead of a designed solution, or offering Thunderbolt 3, fewer PCIe lanes, and a lower RAM cap as being enough for a MBP or Mini.')
