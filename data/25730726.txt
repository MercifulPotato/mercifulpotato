What we do is a major part of who we are.<p>But I mean, it&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;I think it [his architecture] is awful&quot;, or even &quot;I think his architecture had a negative impact on people&#x2F;society&#x2F;cherished values&#x2F;whatever&quot; but quite another to say &quot;I think he sought the ruination of everything good and decent because he was a demented and feeble mind.&quot; Because, yes, I do think the last one would only be appropriate if you actually knew something about the guy...<p>Edit: And yeah, of course, I&#x27;m not trying to censor anyone&#x27;s opinions. Of course you can _have_ the opinion, you can even express it. I just think that it&#x27;s not what engaging in productive&#x2F;civil discourse looks like and, depending on the venue, people may call that out or whatever.')
