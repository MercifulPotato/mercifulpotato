Just different sort of ways. If you want 64 Core, And you have max ~250W TDP CPU on a computer ( Assuming no fancy cooling ). You are effectively limited to less than 4W per core. Even less if you exclude memory controllers and Interconnect. You could argue you want 32 Core or even 16 Core, but scaling the up the clock speed curve beyond optimal level will means power increase exponentially. i.e You are still hitting the same wall.<p>And I should note, with anything per <i>dollar</i>, the question isn&#x27;t really technical per se, but function of market. AMD is pretty good at performance per dollar right now, and will be more so once they announce Zen 3.<p>Some day if I could be bothered I should write a blog post on it.')
