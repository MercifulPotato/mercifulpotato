Given your idea of a platform, I think web forums are neither platform nor publishers, so where does that leave them?<p>To be clear, it&#x27;s not fair to classify them as publishers. Newspapers and magazines are not mediums of discussions like forums are, they&#x27;re compilers of articles that people spend days to write and submit for approval.<p>To use an offline metaphor, forums are like clubs where people meetup in a room and have informal discussions about the topic of the club. Such clubs often have someone acting as a moderator, since if discussions derail from the club topic then the host of the club will become disinterested, as well as potential newcomers who have an interest in the club topic.<p>In my opinion, if a club must be classified as either a &quot;platform&quot; or a &quot;publisher&quot;, I think the word &quot;platform&quot; fits better. However, you consider platforms as being limited to communication mediums like postal mail and phone networks. If that&#x27;s the case, then I think clubs classify as neither.')
