This has never happened as far as I know, but from my reading seems to be permissible for a failure to appear.<p>There are plenty of logistical issues. I&#x27;m not sure the Sergeant at Arms even owns handcuffs, much less a place to keep people being held, and I&#x27;m sure it would suddenly become a huge scandal - but it would be very interesting.')
