Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[25095064], score=None, time=1605380766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094612, text='To reheat a &quot;decent meal&quot;†, you usually need to microwave the components of it separately, since they&#x27;ll have very different thermal masses. And if you&#x27;re doing that, each individual component isn&#x27;t going to take very long. One minute for this (2 presses), two minutes for that (4 presses). The overhead of swapping meal components in&#x2F;out swamps the button-presses.<p>Plus, if there&#x27;s any sauce in any components, you&#x27;ll need to be stopping the timer every 2.5 minutes to stir it around, lest you get a sauce that starts boiling&#x2F;burning in some parts while still being frozen&#x2F;tepid in others.<p>† As in, &quot;something better than a TV dinner.&quot; One of the main reasons (other than cost) that TV dinners generally have such strange&#x2F;unpleasant&#x2F;non-complementary side-dishes in them, is the fact that the components of the meal are chosen to all have matching reheat times. (And even then, many still have instructions requiring you take things out half-way to poke holes in plastic etc., to switch some meal-components from being both irradiated themselves while also being steamed by irradiated water, to only being directly irradiated.)')
