It is a friendly community filled with people talking about all sorts of topics.<p>If you&#x27;re seeking highly curated and specific information, I doubt it is for you (at this point in time). With that said, there are some great bots which are helping to fill the place with content from traditional social media so that you don&#x27;t miss out.

This is how I keep up with HN, and it is how I found this post.<p>New federated apps are being developed all the time, too. A federated reddit alternative exists, which may one day satisfy your need for specialized&#x2F;focused content on a given topic.')
