From the README: &quot;There will be one commit per released version.&quot;<p>They did leave Github pull requests open, for now, but I guess that is just a configuration mishap. README: &quot;For the time being, we do not accept contributions via GitHub. If you want to make a contribution, first make sure that you have signed the CLA. You can then submit patches over email by following the instructions at threema.ch&#x2F;open-source&#x2F;contributions&#x2F;.&quot;<p>Threema has by far the most responsive UI of all messengers on Android. It does not require phone numbers and has a sane security model.
