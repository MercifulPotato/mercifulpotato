It&#x27;s important to remember that Facebook can precisely measure the impact of news articles like this. And even without messing with the newsfeed algorithms, they have way more influence over consumer perception of Facebook than a few news articles do.<p>Are we 100 percent confident that FB is doing this because the math works out and not because the pressure from the board is to &#x27;do something about this&#x27;?
