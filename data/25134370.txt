So probably irrelevant.<p>I sure knows that when I&#x27;m doing the hiring, I rarely if ever read what colleges or what previous companies the candidate worked on. All that matters is what their experience is, what they learned so far, what they tell me they wanna do in the future and how they are as a person.<p>&gt; You also assume wrong that I didnâ€™t dedicated myself to apply to specific jobs<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s my fault, sorry about that. It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine how you can have time to send out 250+ applications and still have a dedicated cover letter and well-researched application for each one of them.<p>While I don&#x27;t know how the 250+ companies you&#x27;ve applied to are thinking, I can share how I think, when trying to hire someone for a position. And from your advice, only &quot;good public sample of your code&quot; and &quot;clear explanations and thought process&quot; would be something that I would care about. The rest of your advice are not only not relevant, but some are even outright harmful. Good writing absolutely helps someone (in my eyes) to be more fitting for any type of position.<p>My advice to job seekers would also be to look for advice regarding getting hired by either people who have been hired, consistently so, or by the people who are doing the hiring. While it could be helpful, chances are that people who haven&#x27;t got a high success rate at getting hired, aren&#x27;t able to give you good advice.')
