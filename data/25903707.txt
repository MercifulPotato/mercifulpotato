However traditional brands moves rather slow on EV because all kinds of their own issues. EV is the perfect opportunity for Chinese to jump in the market and take the first mover advantage.<p>When there&#x27;s any big change in any industry, the market would be shuffled, and there&#x27;s always opportunity for China to take. It&#x27;s as simple as that for the current world.<p>I believe the same thing could also be said on semi-conductors industry soon. There were very few attempts earlier and ended up pretty ugly, because it was just not economic feasible to compete with Intel or Qualcomm a decade ago - if it&#x27;s only 60% effective with the higher cost and same price nobody would buy it. But recently Apple released M1 and make everyone in industry start to reconsider alternative architectures - which may eventually led China to be an important player in the next decade.')
