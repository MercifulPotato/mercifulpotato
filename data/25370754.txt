It&#x27;s a positive feedback loop.  That&#x27;s why it is important for an external force, which pretty much has to be a government, to tax the wealth at the top and move it back to the bottom.  Otherwise the system gradually turns into feudalism by its very nature.  A government that stops taxing the richest companies and citizens is failing in its duty to protect the health of the market.')
