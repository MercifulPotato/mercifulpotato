There was a lot wrong with the USSR, especially under Stalin. And since they didn&#x27;t have a tradition of democracy and free speech in Russia, it wasn&#x27;t a good place for dissidents. For most people, though, they did a much better job of lining people up with positions and careers suiting their wants and talents than our &quot;work for rich people or you starve&quot; system does.<p>Capitalism is a system that runs on human misery, led by a class of people who are completely unaccountable to anyone but themselves, who therefore have no incentive to make things decent for the workers.')
