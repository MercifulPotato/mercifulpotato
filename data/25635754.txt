If it is supposed to be a store of value, like gold, its volatility is ridiculous.<p>Now you are retreating to stocks for a comparison. Indeed, if Bitcoin is supposed to be treated like individual stock, volatility of Bitcoin becomes reasonable, but it is still very high. That is why you do not put all your money into a single stock. You diversify, like in an index fund. Compared to an index fund, Bitcoin volatility is ridiculous.<p>Unlike with stock, there is no index fund for cryptocurrency that is substantially less volatile than Bitcoin itself.')
