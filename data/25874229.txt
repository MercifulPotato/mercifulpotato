From what I can see their business model is, minimal investment, maximum unsustainable sort-term profit, and sell or go bankrupt while floating upon pool-in-yacht.<p>Their &quot;customer care&quot; staff are assigned multiple shoppers and customers to deal with simultaneously, and they are out of country NOT trained in English or US culture, as such they are clearly unable to communicate effectively; queue lines in the thousands.<p>I spoke with one once who told me they were NOT ALLOWED to communicate the fact they were dealing with multiple customers, with people just constantly spamming them because they could not keep up; a system which will obviously bottle neck at any load increase. Oh, and, according to her the entire system is &quot;managed&quot; by &quot;If&quot; statement masquerading as an &quot;AI HR&quot; software.<p>Once the vaccine comes out in full, Instacart will most likely be no-more or sold off.')
