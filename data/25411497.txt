It&#x27;s completely nuts, and I love it. The guy obviously believes in his investment thesis, and you have to give him the credit for being the risk taker in the best tradition of The American Dream.<p>OK, he didn&#x27;t exactly bet the company on it, but it&#x27;s still a ballsy business move, if there ever was one.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Jb48Q5e4WVg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Jb48Q5e4WVg</a>')
