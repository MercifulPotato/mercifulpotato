Item(by='OldHand2018', descendants=None, kids=[25118568], score=None, time=1605564877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25116784, text='&gt; Heck my owns wifeâ€™s birthday is wrong. By a few days. We inquired about it and were told to just go with it. Multiple years of effort would be required to fix it.<p>The US Social Security Administration?  It took me years to get the IRS to tell me why they were rejecting my electronic tax return filings.  Once I found out it was the birthdate on file with the SSA, it took less than 5 minutes to fix at the SSA office in the nearest federal building (which was conveniently across the street from my work office at the time).  Perhaps it is very challenging or impossible at the benefits offices that are in just about every city and town across the US.  If you don&#x27;t live in a big city with a complex of federal offices, maybe next time you go to one bring along a bunch of documents and get it done.')
