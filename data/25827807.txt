So you&#x27;re liquid in the direction that moves the price to where it needs to be and not liquid in the other direction.<p>If the slow market is inside of the bid-ask spread, then HFT is likely to be willing to buy&#x2F;sell on the fast market and complete the other half of the trade on the slow market.  That is, they don&#x27;t snap up the slow order right away, but they will snap it up to complete trades.  Getting a guaranteed trade is better than holding the stock and not trading.  This gives liquidity in both directions.<p>The incentive to use this market for smaller orders is that you are likely to get a price somewhere between the bid-ask spread.  I don&#x27;t have recent data, but a decade ago the bid-ask spread for small stocks was around 2%, lowering to 0.6% for the top 20% of stocks.  (As you go to the behemoths, the spread drops farther.)<p>I&#x27;m sure it is smaller today, but if you are a day trader, that spread is a hidden tax that is going to kill you over time.<p>Even if nobody used the slow market, HFT would guarantee that you get no worse than the spread on a market order.  But when traders use the slow market directly, they bypass the HFT middleman and save themselves money.')
