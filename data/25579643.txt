Focus only on the incarceration system lose focus of how governmental budget works, and how society works. We don&#x27;t even have generally available low-cost higher education yet.<p>People always have this sense that we are responsible for prisoners, more than we are responsible for law-abiding citizens in worse conditions. We often ignored those who need it most among the general population, we only do things unless they become criminal, because a criminal is at least seen, tried, in court, in news report, and those non-tried people almost have zero visibility. We can see the prisoners, since they are in low-quantity, and wouldn&#x27;t be too much burden on the state fund and we can not ignore them, because we put them there. And yet we ignore those can be ignored, the homeless folks on the streets of San Francisco and everywhere else. It creates a weird system where if you are in worse conditions, you might be better off committing a crime than being a law-abiding citizen. It happens often because it cheaper to build better prisons than to offer better social welfare system for everyone, not because we have a better sense of morality, but it made us feel better about ourselves.')
