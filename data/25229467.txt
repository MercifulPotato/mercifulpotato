It minimalizes both latency and total cost of communication&#x2F;decision process, which has usefulness for both business and military. Efficient decision process allows quick and decisive power control, which often has superlinear advantages. The other side of coin is that longer and more thorough decision process could lead to better decisions, which may have long-term advantages.<p>2) Social hierarchies are not cause of struggle for power, but they ritualize and tame it. With that, they limit costs associated with struggle for power in a similar way how ritualized animal fights limits wounds, which would happen in real fights. In social hierarchy each actor acknowledges its level of power and allows surrender without destruction. Ideally, the power struggle within rules of social hierarchy also makes it more meritocratic (e.g., people with better business skills get on higher level in bussines hierchies).<p>But your institutional memory makes also sense.<p>I personally struggle with it, as i have strong emotional aversion to both submit or claim power over others, but it is not hard to see advantages (and also disadvantages) of social hierarchies on rational level.<p>BTW, looking on your nick, aren&#x27;t you by chance JS1 from abclinuxu?')
