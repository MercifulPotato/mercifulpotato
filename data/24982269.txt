Their YAML format lacks the ability to reuse common bits of configuration so you just need to copy&#x2F;paste it all over. Our project has minitest tests, rspec tests, and another type of tests. All the setup&#x2F;boiler plate needs to be copied to job section, and kept in sync.<p>Each test run depends on a huge number of 3rd party services being up. It pulls in docker images (DockerHub) and ubuntu packages (wherever the Ubuntu packages come from). It requires various azure services to be running (to use their cache and artifacts actions). It depends on github being up of course. Test runs fail multiple times per month because one of these services is down at the time the tests run.<p>Until recently their cache action was often slower than just rebuilding the assets from scratch without the cache.<p>The only compelling reason to switch to gh actions from any other CI service I&#x27;ve used is to reduce costs. you get what you pay for.')
