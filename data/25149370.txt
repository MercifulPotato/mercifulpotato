I had a familiar experience a few years ago. I was extremely tired of my job. It wasn&#x27;t a hard job, but I didn&#x27;t connect with my coworkers. Also, I didn&#x27;t find interest in what I was doing. So, it was soul crushingly exhausting. Btw, I&#x27;m not putting all the blame on my environment. It was as much me, as it was them.<p>Anyways, I took some time off to travel and unwind like you. I remember the day I came back to work-- all the stress and horrible feelings I had immediately came back like I never took a break. So, I left.<p>I didn&#x27;t quit the tech industry, but I took a year break from working. I was lucky, because I had a SO that could support me. So, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about money too much. I still missed the stability of a job though. The break did a couple of things for me. It gave me time to develop new habits and it renewed my curiosity. I started tinkering again. It&#x27;s really hard to care about new developments or technologies when you&#x27;re drowning. However, if you&#x27;re able to take care of yourself, I believe you&#x27;ll find the curiosity that led you down to being a developer in the first place.<p>If you&#x27;re a developer or if you&#x27;re in tech. You&#x27;re constantly learning. If you don&#x27;t naturally like learning, it&#x27;s going to be tough.')
