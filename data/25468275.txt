It really broke me out of what was otherwise turning out to be a good action scene.<p>I’ve been playing a huge amount of God of War (2018), really just an absurd number of hours, I’ve completed almost all the side quests, and the number of distracting bugs, glitchy character animations, etc. is zero. (It’s the closest to a perfect video game I’ve ever side, really quite an accomplishment.) This contrasting example causes me to very much notice the almost minute-to-minute minor graphical glitches in CP2077 and be very frustrated by the more frustrating ~hourly bugs.<p>Maybe if I wasn’t playing GoW concurrently concurrently it wouldn’t bother me so much, but really, CP2077 is not up to the standards of what Good Games are supposed to be like in 2020.')
