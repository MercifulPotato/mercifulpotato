Item(by='oblio', descendants=None, kids=[25817862], score=None, time=1610922016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815188, text='&gt; Android is why it is clearly wrong to intervene in Appleâ€™s secure store.<p>Why is Android wrong? The sky hasn&#x27;t fallen over on the Android side.<p>Android&#x27;s security woes are caused by lack of updates from carriers (which frequently delay or block Android updates), OEMs (which frequently don&#x27;t bother to port security updates because they want to sell the newest devices, shenanigans similar to those pulled by Apple until it changed its stance about 2 years ago or so).<p>I don&#x27;t know many people side loading apps or installing alternate app stores. The big alternative app stores are Chinese, which are there for obvious, non security related issues, and Amazon&#x27;s app store, which is used primarily on their devices.<p>So I don&#x27;t really see the problem. I do see a solid Stockholm syndrome.')
