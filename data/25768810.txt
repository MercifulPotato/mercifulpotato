Back-of-the-envelope calculation:<p>Google says\n~100 billion humans ever lived\n~60 billion since 0 AD.<p>Let&#x27;s say since 0 AD, 10% of the average person&#x27;s lifetime encounters are non-consensual, while the ancient human had 33% non-consensual.  These proportions are totally made-up by me.<p>Anyway, that would give us .33 * 40 + .1 * 60 = 19.2% of all intercouse being non-consensual.  It seems like any reasonable estimate would put the number well below 50% just given how many modern people there are.')
