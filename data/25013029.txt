My verbal reasoning is deviantly poor pretty often (I&#x27;m a special kind of retard), and I am forced to nitpick and repeat tasks more often than most people to understand things. That&#x27;s part of my human condition. That said, I&#x27;m feeling convinced I will admire your criticism if and when you choose to give it. I appreciate that you, with skin in the game, speak so kindly and carefully with me. As a matter of The Golden Rule, I will think carefully about your honorable and non-ephemeral words (and, from me, you will receive nothing but upvotes here, as well as the preservation of our relationship with me). Private or [[public|PSM]], I hold conversations to be a sacrament.<p>So, hello there, stranger. I&#x27;m h0p3. I&#x27;m glad to meet you. Up front, seriously (no srsly), I may be a delusional autistic schizo drongo madman on and off the forum, and please feel free to speak with me in a manner that is justifiably comfortable for you. I will attempt to carefully address concerns of my ignorance or malice. I apologize that I require so much patience to deal with.&lt;&lt;footnote &quot;i&quot; &quot;For [[humor]] and [[WWDD]]&#x27;s sake: I will [[aim]] to avoid needlessly chucking featherless bipeds or masturbating too often in public.&quot;&gt;&gt;<p>I would not claim it is my own digital world in every degree and kind (though I have some rights to it and obligations regarding it), nor would I agree that I should feel I have total freedom (in all contexts) to build it in whatever way suits me. I am sensitive to the particulars of this problem you&#x27;re pointing at. I suggest you know that too, and I consider your words a demonstration of empathy. I can appreciate the appeal of that line of reasoning. It must factor into whatever is justified. That is a set of many hard problems, no doubt. It&#x27;s also not a private space in many respects and to a significant degree. I suggest you know that too. I admire that you are concerned with what matters most about the truth of the matter. I&#x27;m looking for that too. I think I have a lot to learn from you about this space. Thus, it&#x27;s my exceptional honor to engage in philosophy with you. It is fortuitous that we have the opportunity to [[share]] ourselves here and now so vividly and filled with purpose. I [[hope]] our recriprocal story-telling is reconstructive, worthy of the cost of collectively interpreting.<p>As you know, like everyone else, I&#x27;m not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, and I&#x27;m not in a position to effectively guess if my words, let alone my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± pile, are sufficiently fitting for you. I aim for clarity, not obscurantism or gnosticism, though I recognize the [[infinigress]]es we face in giving foundations to our epistemologies. Even with unfortunately flawed analogies and models, I hope to see [[gem]]s, rainbow vomit, spice, [[salience]], wild gardens, and ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞ rain down and bloom in the desert; thus, I am interested in the right types of people too, and even those who I initially thought were the wrong type of people sometimes turn out to be right sort (I am [[fff]] and wrong all the time). Even where I am obligated to engage in justified ad hominem, may I [[Find The Others]]. A [[Root User]] of mine said they [[like]]d this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philosopher.life&#x2F;#2020.09.13%20-%20Prompted%20Introspection%3A%20Like%20This%20One" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philosopher.life&#x2F;#2020.09.13%20-%20Prompted%20Intros...</a>. Most didn&#x27;t care for it, understandably. I don&#x27;t know well enough what I feel and think of it. You&#x27;ll have to come to your own conclusions as best you can with what you&#x27;ve got (that is always each of our plights), and I [[hope]] to speak with you [[irwartfrr]], [[WINTCIS]] ([[ITS]]).<p>It&#x27;s great that we have so much in common there, btw. I consider your morally legitimate self-ownership rights and obligations clusters to be crucial. I can see you care about that topic in what you take to be the set of relevant problems you are solving. There&#x27;s plenty to tailor here. My assumption is that the people in your life are lucky to know you. You probably help them with some technical problems that few others can handle as well as you can. I cannot say I know how to self-host in a way that works well enough. I am pretty awful with computers, but I do like &#x27;em a lot, and I am interested in how you think about and use them. I have two offspring who must learn to be autonomous (in every sense of the word) wisely (it feels like I&#x27;m never sufficiently prepared for this task, and I doubt I ever will be). If and when you have the time, I&#x27;d like to know what you think are some of the most crucial self-hosting tools (including for the sake of secure decentralized networking) that the masses of their generation ought to practice with, how, and why.<p>Also, I wonder if the analogy, more hedged-conservatively-speaking, is strong but not perfect. It&#x27;s hella good, I know that. There&#x27;s a lot to flesh out in the claim that its &#x2F;&#x2F;meant&#x2F;&#x2F; to be very personal to you. I agree that my garden, for example, is exceptionally personal (and not just to me). I hope we all get to live in gardens among gardens. I&#x27;m not convinced they are necessarily meant to grow slowly, nor do I think each garden is meant to grow over a long long time. I will, however, agree that long-term growth is crucial to wielding it wisely in most cases, and, perhaps vacuously: the best of them grow at the fitting pace for the fitting duration. It is not clear that such gardens will (or even ought) inevitably get organized or reshuffled (or sometimes it turns out just to be details that get fleshed out), but I suggest the odds of these effects are surprisingly high in an actively maintained garden. Imho, there are countless mistakes that I must fix in my own gardening, and it&#x27;s not easy to pick out what to solve first.<p>I am interested in what it means to say The Moral Law is something we need. It depends on what kinds of creatures we are and what purposes we&#x27;re meant to serve, I suppose. At very least, I agree that we stand in relation to such a necessity, but we choose to bind ourselves to or with it as well. That contingency is part of the source of what makes us ends in ourselves (and I&#x27;m interested in the end-to-end principle there too). I suggest that the [[gfwiwcgws]], namely the good of the garden in this case, is not as egoistic, positivistic, or libertarianly neutral-appearing as personal preference, though I will agree our sensibilites and qualia are an irreducibly necessary part of computing what is ultimately good about it.')
