I think there&#x27;s still a bit of room left, but not a whole lot. The panels themselves are commodities now where many of them are close to materials cost. There&#x27;s probably a bit of room to cut in racking and in figuring out ways to make installation easier.<p>Not that any of that is really a problem. Solar is plenty cheap enough, but I don&#x27;t see a mechanism for it to keep up its precipitous decline in price going forward for many years to come.')
