This would allow developers to silently interact with ongoing git repos using the &quot;better&quot; tool. Getting wholesale migration to a new platform seems a significant challenge, but allowing developers to slowly build mind share with an improved workflow would be possible.<p>Disclaimer: I hate git.')
