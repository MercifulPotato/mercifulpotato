I love working in an office and missed my commute, having clear boundaries to the day, having good touchpoints with colleagues. I just felt completely unproductive, highly distractible, and procrastinated everything.<p>Then I took two weeks off over Christmas&#x2F;New Years and drove across the country to a new location where I&#x27;m working for a couple months, and it&#x27;s been markedly better since then. I don&#x27;t know how much was the change of scenery and how much was the vacation, but it made me realize at least part of the problem was general burn-out rather than WFH specifically.<p>If you&#x27;re like me and many people I know, you probably haven&#x27;t taken much vacation because there&#x27;s not many places to go. I&#x27;d encourage you to use some of those days and go into nature, drive somewhere far, whatever you can that feels Covid-safe and mixes things up!')
