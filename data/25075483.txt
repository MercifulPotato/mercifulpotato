It gives you the illusion that your Mac is running containers, but it&#x27;s not -- Linux containers are a Linux thing.  Some virtualization is going to be necessary unless your host OS is Linux.  One could argue that maybe MacOS should somehow run the Linux kernel.  Windows tried that as WSLv1 and it didn&#x27;t work that well; WSLv2 just uses a VM.<p>The net impact of this is not particularly high.  I always write my apps so that they can run on the local machine, and just have my CI system put them in Docker images for deployment.  But, that does require some effort, and some language ecosystems or applications make this nearly impossible (relying on details like case-insensitive filenames, OS quirks, etc.)... so people just develop inside a container to work around that.  (I would never tolerate it, but it can work OK for things like PHP where your edits take effect in the running container without having to rebuild anything.)')
