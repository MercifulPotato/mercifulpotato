I don&#x27;t disagree with that.<p>It&#x27;s just worth noting that you get significantly less than a 1&#x2F;.9 benefit in capacity when you shorten hospitalization times by 10%.  It&#x27;s a benefit, but it&#x27;s only this ideal value when things are perfectly steady state.  So sorry for the pedantry, but &quot;10% less hospital stay, means 10% more patients able to get help.&quot;--- it&#x27;s not the predicted 11% or even 10%.')
