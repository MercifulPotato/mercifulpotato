There is also a further effect on Gaba as well with a bit more time. Ron Davis and other researchers have done some work to understanding the genetic switch or mechanism but alas they aren&#x27;t there yet with an affirmation as to the root cause.<p>Alas the depression and sleep problems are just the beginning, the condition gets much worse and more debilitating than Multiple sclerosis as it progresses and the chronic fatigue and exertion intolerance kicks in. Its excruciatingly painful and poorly treated by Doctors. The news all points to very bad for Covid19 and ME&#x2F;CFS results unfortunately, it could be a much bigger contributor to loss of people from the workplace than death itself as most sufferers don&#x27;t ever work again.')
