That&#x27;s going to vary based on the problem space and the developer&#x27;s background.  Should he spend 40 hours learning the latest meme language and cobbling together an amateur-night solution rather than 20 minutes actually making something that works with tools that fit the job properly?<p>Yeah, if the only BASIC you ever used was the pack-in one on the Commodore 64, you&#x27;re probably fighting the language as much as you are solving the problem.  But a modern BASIC, with a rich library, can be a perfectly valid tool choice.  In some ways, a traditional and restrictive syntax can be a boon: you&#x27;re strongly nudged to work within the limitations rather than wandering down trendy architectural rabbit holes.')
