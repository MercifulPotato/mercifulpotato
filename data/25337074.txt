I tried it with refrigerator and it couldn&#x27;t guess. At the end, in the list of contradictions it showed the following:<p>&gt; Does it usually have four corners? You said No, 20Q was taught by other players that the answer is Yes.<p>Now, considering a fridge has four corners at the top and four at the bottom that does suggest that a lot of people answering the questions are lacking somewhat in the intelligence department. Either that or they are just completely forgetting that a fridge has an underneath (or a back) as well. (I&#x27;ll leave it to the reader to decide whether forgetting a refrigerator has a back as well as a front constitutes a lack of intelligence.)')
