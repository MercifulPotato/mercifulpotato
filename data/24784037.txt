It&#x27;s always been viewed as a low-budget, customer-friendly alternative to voting on election day. That probably should have been re-evaluated given the pandemic and the likelihood of greater numbers of early voters<p>This part of your earlier comment makes it seem like you are arguing that the early voting issues are simply logistical issues because they didn&#x27;t &quot;re-evaluate&quot; their process for the pandemic.<p>I am pointing out evidence that these problems aren&#x27;t from a lack of planning, but from active suppression.<p>If you look at any particular incident (like the long lines for early voting in this case), you can think of a lot of innocent reasons it might be happening. When you see the pattern, and you see clear and active suppression, you can&#x27;t just say &quot;well, all of these other incidents are just poor planning&quot;')
