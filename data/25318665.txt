I run (a little), but have never enjoyed it. I&#x27;ve never once experienced a &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot;--even when I ran 5-6x per week for years. I still do it a couple times a week because it&#x27;s a quick way to get my heart beating, and I do feel better afterwards.<p>Walking is different. It&#x27;s almost always pleasant, and the feeling I get after a good walk is similar to the one I get after a run (though I usually have to walk about twice as far as I would have run.) During the walk, I experience a calm, meditative peace that I really enjoy. I don&#x27;t even need to have headphones on to enjoy walking!<p>If you find yourself in the position where you feel like you have to run to stay healthy, it might be worth mixing it up with walking. And if running is overwhelming, don&#x27;t underestimate the benefits of a good walk. It&#x27;s still the most underrated way to exercise.')
