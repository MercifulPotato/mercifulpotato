The local Skywarn [1] repeater is probably the best source of immediate first-hand information when things get bad. There&#x27;s usually at least a few storm chasers out following the storms, and reports from various places in the area help you get a real feel for how bad a particular storm is.<p>Moreover, the repeater is monitored by all of the local TV and radio stations as well as the city EMA (Emergency Management) and the local National Weather Service office. So you&#x27;re basically getting first-hand information directly from the source. I always have my radio on during severe weather and keep one in my truck as well.<p>It&#x27;s not difficult to get a license, either. A reasonably intelligent person can self-study for the technician exam in about a week and you can get a decent handheld for less than $100.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dixie_Alley" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dixie_Alley</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weather.gov&#x2F;SKYWARN" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weather.gov&#x2F;SKYWARN</a>')
