If I bet a dollar, it would only cost me 1.4 cents. So I thought to myself, &quot;Why am I so reluctant to bet? It hardly costs anything!&quot;<p>&gt; So I started betting, and right away I lost five dollars in succession--one, two, three, four, five. I was supposed to be out only seven cents; instead, I was five dollars behind! I&#x27;ve never gambled since then (with my own money, that is). I&#x27;m very lucky that I started off losing.')
