Skip the fake dairy crap like soy&#x2F;oat&#x2F;etc. Find a creamy half and half or even heavy cream cut with half and half. A little goes a long way. I put two tablespoons in a 30oz travel cup.<p>I live in the northeast and find the Aldi brand heavy cream is fabulous and cheap. It is processed at ultra dairy in Syracuse, NY, shop around for a brand you like, but use the plant codes on the box to figure out who makes it â€” each dairy is different.')
