It is way behind M1 in terms of performance and battery etc but its the same kind of idea - fast ARM based ultraportable with emulation for non-arm apps. So they do at least have a &#x27;dog in the race&#x27;, even if its a slightly lame dog at this point. I imagine they will be throwing increasingly more resources at ARM in the future.')
