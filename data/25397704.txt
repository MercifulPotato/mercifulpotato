I don’t use webpack directly, only the way vue-cli bundles it, but still it’s a sort of blessing and curse. It is also dog slow for what it’s doing: even something like make can cache compilation objects and make sure that for example Bootstrap’s SCSS doesn’t need to be recompiled every time I update the background color of my app in my own stylesheet. And while speed measuring plugins exist, I am still at a loss at how to optimize a build of a simple SPA where my code all in is less than 10KB and yet it takes like 30 seconds to produce a build. And as you say, when a bug hits, good luck figuring that out.')
