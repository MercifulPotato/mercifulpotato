I&#x27;ve been playing chess for more than a couple of decades, but recently decided to stop partly because of the pandemic, but mainly because it just takes too much time.<p>Chess at its core is a battle of intellects. It&#x27;s not a relaxing thing like watching a movie, or cooking or even kicking a ball. It&#x27;s a competition and at the end of each match there will be a winner and a loser. Unlike other sports it only requires mental effort without the benefit of working out the body.')
