He used to brag to me that every employee&#x2F;team gets their own mini-fridge, which is stocked with booze and liquor. He said that a common &quot;bonding&quot; experience for different teams in the company is to exchange different types of liquor. This was in early 2010s.<p>He said drinking on the job is common, but going overboard is discouraged (for obvious reasons). But even he admitted that Zappos clearly understood that in order to attract customer service people to the company (headquartered in Las Vegas), being able to drink on the job, i.e. during the day, would be a great recruitment tool.<p>I thought it was very cynical, although it obviously worked out well for them. Too bad about Tony though, I hear he was a great guy.')
