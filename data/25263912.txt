Many times I&#x27;ve been told that whatever problem I describe, they can handle it, or my problem isn&#x27;t what I think it is and they can handle it. I feel like short term incentivisation tends to promote dishonesty - most organisations don&#x27;t seem to have feedback mechanisms to deal with a poor sales process.<p>And like most trades, I&#x27;m sure the answer is to take it more seriously, train better, invest more in the people, etc. But the reality is for most sales jobs, as a former colleague once told me, you&#x27;re never more than 2 missed targets away from being let go.')
