I used to envy my partner who raves about Slack. However, when I start using it, I wasn’t too impressed. I worked for a Chinese company in my last role, and I have to say I love their internal chat tool (which is a copycat of WeChat) way better than Slack. It doesn’t have the cool and modern interface of Slack, but it’s way more functional. For example, my favorite feature of the WeChat copycat tool is taking screenshots and able to do sketches on the screenshots. It’s integrated within the chat tool and it’s so convenient. With Slack, I have to rely on my Mac’s screenshot feature and Preview for editing, and then drag it in Slack’s chat window. Also, for shared channel, I saw that was innovated by WeChat long time ago, so I wasn’t that impressed with that feature.')
