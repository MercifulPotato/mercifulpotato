That&#x27;s how it was. After that either you tried to get out of it for medical reasons or delayed it because of University studies (at which point you could indeed apply to do it in a technical&#x2F;civilian position).<p>I was lucky that they abolished it while I was at University so there was nothing left for me to do after I graduated. I say &#x27;lucky&#x27; but I was actually disappointed as I had planned to apply for the &quot;cooperation&quot; i.e. to be sent abroad for 1.5 years in a technical capacity.<p>* I added quotes but it was really a legal order and they used to send the gendarmes knock on your door at some point if they didn&#x27;t hear from you.')
