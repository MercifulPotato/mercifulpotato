I settled on satisfying myself that I understood (enough about) every level of the computer from semiconductor physics up to GUI&#x2F;UX work. Luckily I had the semiconductor stuff already covered from my undergrad days and a friend from that time who was an EE major.<p>The rest took a bit longer than 5 years (maybe 7), and of course the learning didn&#x27;t stop there. But I do remember thinking in the early 1990s &quot;OK, I understand the entire stack at this point, what comes next?&quot; My understanding had reached a level I was satisfied with - it would not have compared with someone who spent their entire working life focused on that level, but it was far, far beyond any normal computer user&#x27;s understanding.<p>In the 2 decades and more since then, not a whole lot has changed that has invalidated the understanding I think I gained at the beginning. Microcode was a bit of a shock. The biggest shock has been watching a whole new generation of programmers who barely grasp the lower 80-90% of the system.  Maybe that&#x27;s good, but it doesn&#x27;t feel obviously right.')
