I wanted to be able to remove all links to domains I knew I never wanted to visit from all pages because I kept wasting time accidentally clicking them, not realizing where they were going.<p>I had hoped to pull it off with uBlock Origin but I couldn&#x27;t get the filters to do what I wanted. I ended up making a Firefox add-on that takes a regex and some css, searches all attribute values and&#x2F;or text for a match, and applies the css to the element with the match.<p>So, I have a regex for a handful of popular domains I never want to see and matched elements get &quot;visibility: hidden&quot;. The result is that I never see a link to Medium. In fact, I usually forget the site exists until someone mentions it without linking to it, which is almost always a post about how Medium sucks :) Same for all the other domains in the list.<p>The plugin works on Firefox for Android, so I&#x27;ve enjoyed the benefits there as well. However, I expect that to be a problem soon. I don&#x27;t do much browsing on my phone anyway.<p>It&#x27;s only designed for personal use, so the interface is terrible, but I had to submit it to the official add-on repository because there&#x27;s no reasonable way to run an add-on locally for practical every-day use, so it is available for anyone to use [1].
