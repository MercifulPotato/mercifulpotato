You made an analogy to stocks and ignored the entire universe of investments and other asset classes.<p>Doesn&#x27;t that tell you all you need to know?<p>There is a decade old meme of getting stock market gurus to comment about crypto and their sycophants repeating their predictably abysmal view of something outside of their wheelhouse.<p>Commodities traders never had an issue and volatility is also not an issue in that market. There are no “permabulls” in commodities outside of a few rare metals, and trading in those markets primarily factors in seasonal and cyclical supply and demand.<p>Buy and hold works ok in some crypto assets. But the permabulls that never traded anything else, and the stock market investors that keep a stock certificate their grandma gave them 20 years ago should just not be in this market.<p>You are conflating “good” investment vehicle with “valid” investment vehicle, where its a mixture of whether being a permabull works alongside whether enough institutions that you respect have said positive things. make your own choices about what you want to trade.')
