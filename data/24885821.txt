I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the compositing or what but it&#x27;s unusable on lighter hardware that X ran fine on.</i><p>This is crazy when you think about it. I remember running an X server, Hummingbird I think it was called, on 386 and 486 machines connecting to Suns and it was <i>fine</i>, this was a perfectly acceptable way to work. Couple of xterms, an Emacs, xbiff for email, maybe some xeyes just for fun. Developing with Tcl&#x2F;Tk and running those applications. Now we have several orders of magnitude more CPU, memory, network and Wayland doesn&#x27;t even perform as well as that! My mind is truly boggled.')
