But taking time into consideration and how things always change it&#x27;s easy to see how software development isn&#x27;t always about convergence and subtraction. You may have roles that when they are underperfoming they add work, needless work, to the project. I&#x27;m of course talking about the grand architects. The ones that during the project decide, &quot;this isn&#x27;t working we need to make our solution less coupled and this is my new kinda micro service oriented way of doing things&quot; which totally changes the work space and might introduce subtle holes that no current shape in the project covers even though they all covered the previous work space.<p>But if the grand architect is right, the change could shrink the work space and convergence sped up but then some shapes might be redundant which is another challenge.')
