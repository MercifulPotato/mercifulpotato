Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609199789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25559942, text='&gt; <i>Everyone I know who has asked for a discount has got the discount.</i><p>Just one data point, but a couple I know who lived in a 1BR in a largeish apartment building was denied a rent adjustment, despite other identical, vacant units in the building being put on the market at a somewhat lower rate.  They ended up moving into a 2BR in a nearby duplex at the same rent (plus a couple free months), but nearly twice as much space.<p>A month after they moved, my friend told me that their old building had something like a 35% vacancy rate due to similar departures.  My theory is that they&#x27;re banking on the rental market going back up by mid-2021, and, being a rent-controlled building, don&#x27;t want to allow people to lock in much lower rates.')
