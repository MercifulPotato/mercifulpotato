We need to demonstrate to the guy that the die is fair.<p>Someone else posted a link (I think) of 538 going over on how accurate they were. Whether their odds bore out. Here it is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;checking-our-work&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;checking-our-work&#x2F;</a><p>Basically what they did was bucket every prediction by odds. If they predicted 70&#x2F;30, it went in that bucket. And they&#x27;re &quot;right&quot; at about the rate of their predictions. In other words, for every 70&#x2F;30 prediction they made, the people&#x2F;teams with 70% chance to win, won about 70% of the time.<p>That shows that 538 in this case is pretty decent at calculating odds.')
