I just wanted to say that your questions about sctb seemed reasonable to me, and yes, your comments for the last year (and probably more) have been high quality.   I don&#x27;t understand your relationship with dang, but without trying to pick a winner, I&#x27;ll just suggest you not worry too much about it.  Keep posting quality things, try to stay civil, and hopefully the rest will eventually work out.')
