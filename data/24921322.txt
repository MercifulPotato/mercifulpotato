Typically wlroots-based compositors.<p>I&#x27;m really concerned about Wayland fragmentation. Will some tools work on only wlroot implementations and not others? X11 apps generally work across window managers, although the weird ones (tiling window managers like i3) may have some interesting things you have to work around.<p>If wlroots became the standard for all window managers on Wayland and everyone used it, I guess it would be fine. But if not, we&#x27;re going to see a lot of apps that have to be adapted for each and every composer.')
