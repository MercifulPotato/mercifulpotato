The answer is &quot;no&quot;.<p>Light is neither a wave nor a particle. It is a quantum thing whose formula can be simplified to either wavelike or particlelike under certain assumptions, but not in the general case. Experiments that force those assumptions will reliably turn up wavelike and particlelike behavior, while more general experiments reveal the harder case where the assumptions don&#x27;t hold.<p>This really isn&#x27;t a hard thing. This has been known for pretty much a century. People keep insisting that quantum mechanics is really just classical mechanics with an extra bag on the side, and that approach will always fail in some limit case.<p>When you accept that it&#x27;s the reverse -- that classical mechanics is a special case of quantum mechanics -- you can work with QM in a very straightforward way. It&#x27;s just not the straightforward way you&#x27;re used to.')
