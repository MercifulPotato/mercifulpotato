Item(by='charlesu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603757786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900600, text='&gt; Thanks to the SAT, my brother and I are comfortably in the top 1%. The U.S. system of &quot;meritocracy&quot; (such as it is) is extremely effective at helping us distinguish ourselves from upper middle class white people who have more cultural competency, social connections, etc.<p>I would argue that understanding the importance of the SAT is a form of cultural competency.<p>&gt; Holistic measures that limit the Asians at elite educational institutions and businesses to 20-25% may be tolerable. Measures like lotteries that would reduce Asian representation down to 5-6% would be a dramatic negative change.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t limit the number of Asians at top universities or companies. But we shouldn&#x27;t be content with a system that perpetuates a status quo built on our country&#x27;s original sin. We have to do <i>something</i> proactively. Maybe it&#x27;s reparations. Maybe it&#x27;s universal pre-kindergarten or means-tested baby bonds. But it&#x27;s something instead of nothing.')
