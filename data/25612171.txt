Took me about a year to grok decently.<p>Regarding references, the compiler does flow analysis and tries to enforce a sort of static rwlock semantic on variable level. You either have a single mutable reference xor N readable references to the same variable.<p>If b is a mutable reference to a, c cannot point to a until b reliquishes the &quot;lock&quot;, which happens when b goes out of scope.')
