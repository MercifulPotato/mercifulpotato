It was presumably less time consuming to block them all than to handle all those requests individually.  Until it blew up, anyway.  Suddenly they are losing business and scrambling to enable it for those that want it, so they backtracked on it.<p>They could have saved a lot of time and anguish if they had simply said &quot;no&quot; to those who originally wanted them blocked.')
