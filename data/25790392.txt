I had that setup once (35mÂ² dorm room with a bed, a couch+small table, cloths rack and a desk - and two 1,40m&#x2F;4.5ft speakers in the middle of the room). Yes: There is a VERY good point to arranging the room around the speakers. But that&#x27;s difficult to explain to an SO who doesn&#x27;t care for good sound and&#x2F;or who prefers a more multi-functional living room.<p>If you&#x27;re listening alone, and don&#x27;t care for a small sweet spot: In our study room I&#x27;m VERY happy using a DIY FAST&#x2F;WAW system with a large full range speaker. The 4&quot; FR (Tangband W4-2142) has some heavy beaming at higher frequencies. The sweet spot is rather small (I put it in front of my main display) - but reflections are a non-issue. The result is a very good sound stage. I implemented the cross over into a DSP (Beocreate Amp) and have one channel for each of the two drivers per side. But the only &quot;real&quot; correction I apply is at the low end (less room modes &amp; extension to 40Hz at expense of ~9dB less SPL_max. Pretty nice for 4l encased volume and two 4&quot; drivers).')
