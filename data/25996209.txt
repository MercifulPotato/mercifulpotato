The basic idea is that the user can connect live data to Splitgraph, or upload versioned snapshots called “data images”. Then we give them a unified SQL interface to query all that data, a catalog to discover and share it, and tools to build&#x2F;push&#x2F;pull it.<p>We want to hire a Frontend Engineer to contract with us and help with two projects.<p>- (a) Google sheets extension. We want to build a Google sheets extension for executing SQL queries against the Splitgraph Data Delivery Network (&quot;DDN&quot;, the public Postgres endpoint). This will probably mean sending SQL queries to our SQL-over-HTTP API [0], although if you could get an ODBC driver to work with Google sheets, you could connect directly via SQL to the DDN. We&#x27;ll also need to figure out how to integrate auth &#x2F; UI with the main site.<p>- (b) Taking over the frontend &#x2F; marketing website at splitgraph.com. This is a next.js &#x2F; react project with some custom functionality for compiling our documentation to create the static site. The code [1] is kind of messy, but you can help with it! We&#x27;re looking for someone to take over maintenance of this stack and assist with the upcoming redesign. This would be a medium to long-term project.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in either of these projects (or both), please email careers [AT] splitgraph.com. The subject line should include &quot;Freelancer - Frontend&quot; and the body of the email should include which project(s) you want to work on. Please include LinkedIn, GitHub, and&#x2F;or anything you&#x27;d like to share to convince us you&#x27;re the right person to hire.<p>[0] Example of Splitgraph API <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@mildbyte&#x2F;splitgraph-sql-api-example" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@mildbyte&#x2F;splitgraph-sql-api-exampl...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;splitgraph&#x2F;splitgraph.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;splitgraph&#x2F;splitgraph.com</a>')
