Rate codes are not sufficient to explain all experimental data.<p>Neither is learning; we know <i>some</i> things, sure, we have models for long- and short-term plasticity, but we have no idea how learning <i>actually</i> works.<p>With computation, there are many hypothesis and dendrites do indeed do more than you would think, but again, these are just small details.')
