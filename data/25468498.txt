We don&#x27;t look at everything we want to accomplish and say&quot;what&#x27;s the fastest way to get there?&quot; a 4-year university degree certainly isn&#x27;t if you want a job, money or credibility. The journey is amazing; I have 2 undergrads and a MSc not because of the material benefits, but because I absolutely loved school, especially the second time around. #3 grad school was a little disappointing but that was due to my expectations. I&#x27;m now near 50 and thinking about starting my PhD as a quasi-retirement project. Maaybe I&#x27;ll go to school with my kids!')
