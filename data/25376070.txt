When one side doesn’t argue in good faith they can hack our classic understanding of freedom of speech.<p>We need a word for flooding a space of discourse with so much noise that the truth is obscured and hidden.<p>It’s not censorship in that it’s removing speech, but it’s as effective in undermining free speech.<p>It’s obviously what is happening now.<p>I think the error in what you say is you assume both side are arguing in good faith.<p>But when one party doesn’t argue in good faith, it means they are saying things they don’t truly believe, or that they don’t respect or care about having a fair discourse.<p>Like how during the debates Donald Trump continuously attempted to talk over Biden, and essentially control the discourse via bullying.<p>Just making shit up in order to shut someone else down isn’t okay, and we need to figure out how to protect our traditional values of free speech while also combating when people attempt to destroy our freedom of speech by using this technique at a mass scale in our modern media environment.')
