But the fact remains that Twitter is a viable product <i>only because</i> it is granted special immunity from legal consequences for publishing, immunity that you or I would not enjoy if we were to publish the very same content on a personal website, or hand out pamphlets on the street.<p>In this context it is not at all that “government should be in charge of these decisions”, it is entirely that Twitter’s privileged status should be questioned, <i>given the amount of control they are exercising over the amount of content they distribute</i>.<p>Put another way: AT&amp;T should not be liable for what I publish on my personal website, but if they were dropping packets from my server because of a “content policy” then I would think differently!')
