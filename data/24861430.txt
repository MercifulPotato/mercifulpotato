Individual officers don’t have much power and aren’t members of the ruling class.<p>It’s also rarely the case that when there is a transfer of power, for the police to all be fired, which you’d think would be the case if they were the oppressors who had just been overthrown.<p>Doxxing police may be an effective strategy, but it’s also true that social media driven mobs end up killing people, sometimes in error.<p>Standing up against oppression is necessary, but it’s also messy, and nobody really smells of roses.')
