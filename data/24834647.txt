For example, VietJet forces anyone who has any type of injury, disability or is pregnant to sign an indemnity form before being allowed to board. If you read what you&#x27;re signing, you&#x27;d also notice that it goes beyond the condition and grants VietJet indemnity over anything that happens on the flight.')
