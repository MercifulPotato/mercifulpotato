Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[24803047], score=None, time=1602866190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787370, text='&gt; This is how we&#x27;ve devolved to doing more of what&#x27;s failed spectacularly.<p>This was the red flag line to me.<p>I haven&#x27;t heard anyone ever propose &quot;let&#x27;s do more of what&#x27;s failed&quot;. What I do hear is people saying &quot;we got that wrong, and here&#x27;s the minor tweak we need to fix it&quot;.<p>You wrote some code:<p><pre><code>      for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; ++i)\n           copy (src[i], dst[i]);\n       </code></pre>\nIt fails to copy the final element of src to dst. It&quot;fails spectacularly&quot; every time. Eventually you realize that you compute &quot;len&quot; as an inclusive count, not exclusive. You suggest:<p><pre><code>      for (int i = 0; i &lt;= len; ++i)\n           copy (src[i], dst[i]);\n       </code></pre>\nas a way to make it work.<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;let&#x27;s do more of what&#x27;s failed spectacularly&quot;. This is &quot;let&#x27;s make what we&#x27;re trying <i>actually work</i>&quot;. Sure, someone could come along and suggest that we use Algol or brainfuck to solve the issue instead, and that&#x27;s not a priori insane. But a clear minded reading of the situation - we&#x27;ve got a lot of stuff right, but made some mistakes - would favor trying to fix what we&#x27;ve done wrong, not stop doing what we&#x27;re trying to do.<p>The cynicism of this analysis mostly ruined the rest of the piece for me.')
