Item(by='cpgxiii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605077412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25052331, text='There are different kinds of &quot;relaxed stability&quot;, largely depending on which axes of the aircraft are affected, and the magnitude of the instability.<p>Longitudinal stability is something of a special case, in that essentially all swept-wing aircraft are vulnerable to &quot;Dutch roll&quot; instability and are generally fitted with yaw dampers. Since such stabilizers are, practically-speaking, omnipresent, regulators are OK with using them in what is now a well-understood domain. While it can be unpleasant, all of these aircraft can be flown with a failed yaw damper - notably the 707 family has a particular proclivity for yaw instability, and while almost all civilian users opted for the yaw damper, the largest fleet user, the USAF, did not fit their KC-135s with dampers until well into their service life.<p>For good reason, pitch instability is a much more serious issue, and there has been very little interest in trying to bring to market a transport aircraft that <i>required</i> active pitch stabilization. Many, if not all, modern clean-sheet airliner designs are fly-by-wire due the the safety, performance, and efficiency improvements to be had, but they are all safely flyable in an &quot;alternate law&quot; (or equivalent) fallback mode.<p>Combat aircraft, generally speaking, aren&#x27;t certified aircraft (they have no need be), for good reason - if you&#x27;re flying a modern fighter and the FBW computers die on you, it&#x27;s over, you eject. Understandably, that&#x27;s not an option in a transport aircraft.')
