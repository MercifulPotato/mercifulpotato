Charities exist. Donate to those of your own volition.<p>True, but only the market-driven transactions are capitalist.<p>&gt;He spoke a lot about money, but all of the vitriol was aimed at Judeans, who were close to Jerusalem and politically connected. I.e. ones who didn’t necessarily get their money from usual hard work, but through political exploitation.<p>Jesus said it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. He didn&#x27;t make an exception for those who earned their fortune &quot;honestly.&quot; He constantly told people to give all of their possessions away to the poor and abandon their individual identities and ambitions to the extreme of even attending their families&#x27; funerals (&quot;let the dead bury their own dead.&quot;) He said &quot;Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&quot;<p>The goal of capitalism is the accumulation of material wealth, which is clearly at odds to what Jesus and the early church were trying to preach.')
