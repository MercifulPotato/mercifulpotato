What does is actually chronic conditions: dialysis, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, chronic weight conditions.<p>That&#x27;s what we need to worry about.<p>And if there was a real market here, you wouldn&#x27;t need to shop around because all the people that do, would enforce some level of price discipline on the market.<p>Think about it. For any good sold at, say, Wal-Mart, say Gatorade, there are some people that want it a LOT, even NEED it, while others are more on the fence. There&#x27;s only one price on the shelf and it&#x27;s calculated to get a lot of people buying. So in effect, the people who are more indifferent (want it less) are actually doing a pretty significant service to the people who want it a lot, by guaranteeing the price will be set low <i>for everyone</i>.<p>There&#x27;s no reason something like this can&#x27;t apply in healthcare.')
