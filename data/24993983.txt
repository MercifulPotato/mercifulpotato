Item(by='mariusvaporware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604531049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993982, text='A software developer and football (soccer) fan who lives in an antipodean time zone, I enjoy watching games on demand the morning after they occur. Apart from watching the games of the team I support, I like to watch one or two of the most entertaining games in any given week, but score spoilers absolutely ruin the experience for me.<p>So, I created laterball.com: a web app the algorithmically determines the best games of the past 7 days without score spoilers, to let me (and you) know which games are worth spending time watching. There&#x27;s also an associated twitter bot at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;laterball" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;laterball</a> which occasionally tweets when there&#x27;s been a high-quality game.<p>Technical stuff: the back end is a Ktor server hosted on Google&#x27;s App Enginer which pulls statistics data from an API to determine the ratings. Factors used to determine ratings include goals (number, timing, swings in score, comebacks), xG, wins or draws against the odds, cards, and a few others.<p>The code is currently in a private repo, but I&#x27;m looking at open sourcing it in the near future.')
