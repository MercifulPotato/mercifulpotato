Infra co&#x27;s are  paid to be reliable neutral providers &amp; advisors - instead, it seems corporate greed here has folks actively breaking enterprise userland and misleading decisions makers in sensitive areas like gov, utilities, world-scale services, etc.<p>Like I said, I found the technical goal interesting and have been following. However, working through the year+ papertrail of RH doublespeak here makes me dread having to interact with them as an active OSS dev and in my dayjob working with big businesses &#x2F; govs. RHEL often has policy lock-in in these orgs, so I know it&#x27;ll keep happening unless the community stops it. As is, the stewards are needlessly risking putting podman and friends into a politically contentious category similar to urbit, oracle, etc., and are costing a lot of time &amp; $$$ from people who are already stretched thin.')
