My Internet connection and especially WiFi (yay Unifi!) at home are quite great though, whereas cell reception in my apartment building is quite spotty, so WiFi is the obvious no-brainer choice for when I&#x27;m at home.  And these days most of my phone usage happens at home because of WFH, so yeah, not much mobile data consumption.  Even before then though there wasn&#x27;t much; I don&#x27;t tend to watch streaming video when I&#x27;m out and about.')
