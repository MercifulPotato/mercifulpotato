But claiming that it&#x27;s a huge load of work and pretending that maintainers are drowning in spam pull requests is also very ridiculous.<p>If you don&#x27;t have the time to close a bunch of pull requests, then maybe it&#x27;s time you get someone additional onto the project that can help you out. Ask the last few people that have made high quality PRs or maybe just helped with something small, whether they&#x27;re interested in helping out more.<p>Stop whining of how hard the life of an OSS maintainer is and invite others to help you out.')
