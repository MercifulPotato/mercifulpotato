Dad bought the player in USA and brought it to Turkey and made the recordings there. When I digitized them in USA, everything sounded in higher pitch. It later turned out that the voltage difference in AC (60hz&#x2F;50hz) caused the rotation speed to change proportionally, so I slowed it down to 5&#x2F;6, and it was perfect afterwards.')
