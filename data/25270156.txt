Not every store sells gift cards, and sometimes the well-known stores aren&#x27;t the best deals.  Like, I might be interested in making fun electric gadgets, so a gift certificate to the Adafruit might seem like a good idea, but I tend to prefer to buy my stuff from Aliexpress or Banggood because the prices are significantly lower.<p>&gt; I suppose the point of the article on this point is that if I just asked my friend, they would receive the value of the gift<p>Simply asking really is the best course of action logically, but the idea of gifts being thought up on your own has been so romanticized.')
