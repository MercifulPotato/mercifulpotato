What are the secondary values and so on... And then find the language&#x2F;tool that lines up with our values.<p>I really can&#x27;t emphasize enough to go watch the talk.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2ajos-0OWts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2ajos-0OWts</a>')
