Like, if the companies that provided VM&#x27;s were different from the ones who provided higher-level services. That&#x27;s kind of how it was originally with Heroku and its add-ins, and AWS&#x2F;Rackspace. I liked that so much better and wish it stayed that way. If you want a VM, go to Rackspace and knock yourself out. If you want a hosted thing then go to Heroku, or whichever service hosts things in the language of your choice. But the point is, you make a choice, when you sign up for whichever service, what level of the stack you want to operate in.')
