FAANGs have a willingness to pay much higher salaries, even if they could&#x27;ve hired for less than half the cost elsewhere so it makes more sense for them to be in the bay area, especially since those are super high margin businesses.  YOu&#x27;ll notice that Amazon, a business where margins are important is notably absent from the bay area.')
