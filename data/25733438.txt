That’s costly. Works fine now when solar is the anomaly (what I’m doing, plugging into grid when a prolonged storm depletes stored power), but keeping 100% of current grid capacity in unused reserve for 1% incidents (heavy clouds for &gt;1 weeks) isn’t practical. At some tipping point, classic grid power is driven out of the market ... and then an anomaly hits, with no grid to back into.')
