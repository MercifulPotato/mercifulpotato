We ended up moving ETL flows to self-hosted Prefect (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prefect.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prefect.io&#x2F;</a>) instead.<p>In general, AWS excels at a lot of core features (EC2, S3, the databases) but the higher-level services feel very thrown-together, with awful documentation.
