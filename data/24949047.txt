In retrospect I think this is one of the biggest blind spots of American culture in general. We act like advice is cheap or even free, both in the giving and in receiving. It&#x27;s not. Even when solicited. I think we&#x27;d all be healthier if we were slower to give advice, even outside of such extreme circumstances.')
