Same error when they ask to find the least&#x2F;most significant set bit index, expecting some bit tricks. Processors have dedicated instructions to do these things, typically faster than smart-ass manual versions.<p>Moreover, for simple things like XCHG, BT, BTC, BSWAP compilers are aware and normally produce them from normally-looking i.e. readable code.')
