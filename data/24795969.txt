In the old days major news organizations had a public obligation to stick to the truth as much as possible.  They had fact checkers, independent editorial boards, and other firewalls against false information.<p>Without such protections people end up believing convenient lies at a much greater rate, which is destructive to society.  We&#x27;ve tried the big experiment with unfettered flow of information and it resulted in people being less informed and more radicalized.  Clearly it doesn&#x27;t work, at least not at scale.')
