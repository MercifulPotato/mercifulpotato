The average transmission risk in the household is further elevated when intense physical distancing is enforced, and for contacts that last longer.&quot;<p>the intuition is also pretty straightforward--we let our guard around those closest to us, who also happen to be those we spend the most time with. those are the two primary factors (closeness and contact time) for transmission. social gatherings are that layer just beyond the household where we are most exposed on those dimensions.')
