After seeing a bunch of good looking car deals, I called &#x2F; emailed one.. turns out, they don&#x27;t have the car, don&#x27;t know anything about the car - but they are going to pass on my info to the &#x27;actual car people&#x27; - they are just a listing agent or affiliate or something?<p>um.. no. and fbk could easily see that a car that lists for 12k on KBB and is for sale for 5k on fbook marketplace is fishy - and some listing agent that has a dozen of these deals is maybe running some kind of something shady..<p>So experiences like this, and the one an associate had with ebay recently, makes it so we don&#x27;t trust, and do not use the platform(s) on fbook or ebay.')
