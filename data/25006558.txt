Don&#x27;t bother trying to comprehend everything, just write it all down.<p>There is also nowadays Yle&#x27;s Selkouutiset (Simple Finnish news). It&#x27;s a short daily news bulletin of most important headlines read <i>really</i> patiently and while avoiding using any difficult words (i.e. only basic vocabulary. If complex vocabulary is needed the newscaster actually stops to explain what that word means in simpler terms.)<p>As a native speaker it hurts my head to listen to it for some reason when it comes on the radio. But I&#x27;ve heard from many Finnish as second language leaners that they find this public service resource really useful.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yle.fi&#x2F;uutiset&#x2F;osasto&#x2F;selkouutiset&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yle.fi&#x2F;uutiset&#x2F;osasto&#x2F;selkouutiset&#x2F;</a>')
