I&#x27;m not looking for 3rd party sellers.<p>Amazon seems to have the best shipping&#x2F;logistics (with Prime membership) and it&#x27;s not even close for any other retailer. Walmart is OK, but Target has some really confusing triple selection that is really off putting (choosing between In Store, Same Day, and Shipping).')
