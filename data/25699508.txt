It was very impressive that Michael Apted started the series at age 23 and producing a new episode every 7 years until last year, when he was SEVENTY EIGHT years old.<p>Another &quot;temporally ambitious&quot; series was George Lucas&#x27; Star Wars films, which used the real-life ageing of the actors to tell a multi-generational story that (whether you think it&#x27;s highbrow or lowbrow) has massively influenced multiple generations.<p>I wish more visionary film makers produce such &quot;temporally ambitious&quot; works. Even something as &quot;simple&quot; as taking a photo of yourself everyday for 60+ years and make a 60 second timelapse video yields impressive results.<p>Most people are understandably focused on the present and near-future, but there are some visionary artists who build really cool things over a much longer timescales.')
