It is\n  a vicious cycle. Statisticians do not know what statistical\n  work is, and are satisfied to work with computers. People\n  that hire statisticians likewise have no knowledge about\n  statistical work, and somehow suppose that computers are the\n  answer. Statisticians and management thus misguide each other\n  and keep the vicious cycle rolling. (p. 133)\n</code></pre>\nThe last time I used this in the context of data scientists. Now it&#x27;s AI. I&#x27;m seeing this at my employer now as well. They think AI will save them, and want to use it for so many things. But the problem is that most people don&#x27;t really know what to do with it, and most work won&#x27;t really benefit from it (it <i>could</i>, but not the way they&#x27;re going about it which is mostly throwing buzzwords at the wall). It was the same problem with statisticians and with data scientists.<p>Statisticians <i>could</i> help us do our work better, but not the way they did it. Data scientists <i>could</i> help us do our work better, but not the way they did it. AI will have the same problem for most businesses who choose to follow trends and fads rather than evaluate the actual value and utility of the technology and subject matter. And will be of greatest benefit to those who hire experienced people. This was the problem with both statisticians and data scientists for many companies. They&#x27;d hire to fill a slot, not for expertise.<p>In many ways it&#x27;s mirrored in companies trying to transition to DevOps as well. Filling a slot. Rather than comprehending whether the approach is valid for them, what the approach actually entails, and properly evaluating who should fill the relevant positions.')
