There&#x27;s plenty of room for landfills, honestly; this stuff can be shredded, compacts well, and if the landfill is built with proper barriers and modern design there&#x27;s no reason to expect anything leeching into the water table. If the virtue of people having sorted their garbage is maintained by burying separated plastic apart from other materials, what we&#x27;re actually doing is pre-seeding potential future fuel stock for some process that can cleanly use the plastic. After all, it burns, so there&#x27;s energy there... we just need a way to get to it without releasing a ton of gross smoke.<p>The real problem is when plastic is thrown into the ocean. Rivers of garbage in India are a terrifying sight, and absolutely need to end. The problem here is that plastic is the artifact of a more advanced society, and it rests on certain requirements in order to not be a nightmare. One of those requirements is functioning waste management system, which in turn stems from the civilizational technology of caring about where your waste goes. I assume that that develops in turn as an evolutionary advantage after repeated plagues stemming from lack of hygiene, but this evolution has not happened uniformly to all human cultures.<p>Significant improvement is necessary. Either waste management, or super-quickly biodegradable cheap organic polymer alternatives. Until that happens, probably it is the case that some countries simply shouldn&#x27;t be using plastic at all, and should return to more traditional distribution and packaging mechanisms.')
