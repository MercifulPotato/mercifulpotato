The key difference is that these were hard to find.  Early on, the most effective discovery infrastructure was based on hand-curated indexes (e.g., [1,2]).  These moved slowly and were hard to game.  Now, those same indexes are generated by algorithms, the gaming of which has spawned an entire cottage industry.<p>The parent&#x27;s viewpoint and TFA are not incompatible, as long as we don&#x27;t assume that content distribution and content discovery have to come from the same service. The open internet survived for over 2 decades without bringing down democracy.  At the same time, it would be a good idea to see a bit more editorial responsibility from services driving discovery.  Better still, if hosting and discovery are decoupled, there&#x27;s no network effects or content archive creating a captive audience if editorial power is abused.<p>Tying things back to TFA, and perhaps the point that you&#x27;re trying to make here, amadeuspagel: IPFS seems mostly aimed at providing hosting infrastructure rather than discovery.  I&#x27;ll emphasize the point again: censorship-free <i>hosting</i> has been largely unproblematic for the past two decades.  What&#x27;s been getting us into trouble now is <i>discovery</i> without editorial review (and forcibly tying discovery to hosting).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yahoo!#Founding" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yahoo!#Founding</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Whole_Internet_User%27s_Guide_and_Catalog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Whole_Internet_User%27s_Guide_...</a>')
