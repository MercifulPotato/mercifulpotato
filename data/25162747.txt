I think my earlier examples stand up ok here. The phone is bricked, and the laptop is not. There may be edge cases where it might not be clear whether we can say whether a device is &#x27;bricked&#x27; or not. That&#x27;s not a problem. There might be an edge case in furniture where it&#x27;s not clear if it&#x27;s a chair or a table, but the categories of <i>chair</i> and <i>table</i> are still worth keeping.<p>...anyway it looks like a promising ARM-based computer ;-P')
