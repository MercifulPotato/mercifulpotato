Top 10000 perhaps? (I really have no idea).<p>The 10,000th most highly paid software engineer definitely makes orders of magnitude more than her. I imagine the same is true for the top 10,000 doctor, pharmist, etc.<p>&gt; Quick everyone. Start up your own YouTube channel.<p>More like, quick everyone, be really good at your job.
