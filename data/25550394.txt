SN9 supposedly has a fix for that.<p>the biggest risk was the reverse belly flop and that went flawless to everyone&#x27;s surprise. to quote musk, the crater is in the right place, and it didn&#x27;t even properly explode anyway - the nose cone was more or less intact :) if the fuel pressure issue really is fixed and SN9 lands on the pad, it&#x27;ll be a mark of a new age of space industry - and not that long after the previous one set by the same company! the most recent NRO mission flew on a booster used four times previously; fifteen years ago you&#x27;d be laughed out of the room for just suggesting the possibility of launching a national security payload on a used rocket.')
