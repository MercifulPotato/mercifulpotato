We all have limited dollars and attention. When you advertise, you might slightly change the allocation of attention and dollar to your product.</i><p>That&#x27;s worth thinking hard about. Is advertising worth it? With most US consumers spent out to the limit of their income, all advertising does is try to move demand around. It&#x27;s thus zero-sum and a waste of resources for the country.<p>I&#x27;d argue that ads should not be a tax-deductible business expense.')
