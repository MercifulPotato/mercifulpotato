The latter is out of question for almost all of the organisations I know.<p>If I was a Microsoft or another enterprise tech company I’d hire a thousand engineers tomorrow to develop a Jira&#x2F;Confluence competitor before the grace period for server licenses ends. All that engineering money will pay itself back whent they can sell modern collab tools without tech debt from 15 years ago for a price we can tolerate.')
