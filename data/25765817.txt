They don&#x27;t want to have to deal with &quot;other peoples&#x27; software.&quot;<p>System administrators (and by extension, distribution maintainers) have to take in the bigger picture: how will this affect stability? Resources? How will this package interact with other pieces of software? They have to consider use cases in everything from the embedded to insanely large clusters and clouds.<p>It would behoove developers to try to expand their awareness of how their software fits in with the rest of the world, if even for a short while. It&#x27;s hard (I know), but in the end it will make you a better developer, and make your software better.<p>&gt; Since npm,pip,go,cargo, etc. are open source projects, would it not be simpler to add a &quot;debian mode&quot; to them?<p>This is the best fucking idea I&#x27;ve heard in a while!')
