If they tried to remove things that were obviously illegal and kept to that I would fine to accepting that. I appreciate there is now government involvement which brings it own complications especially with regards to an international business. So maybe it is just not possible.<p>&gt; In terms of debate, one thing sticks out if youâ€™ve done a lot of philosophical debates, that people are bad at it. That is to say, you need to learn how to debate. I would think moderating can suffer from the same lack of experience.<p>Funnily enough a friend who went to Berkerley University was making the same point about debate today in a discord chat. I will admit I am more of a layman but try to stay away from many of the common fallacies in argumentation. It is an interesting idea that moderation itself is something that would need experience.<p>&gt; I am not quite sure which platform you are thinking of in the first complaint you state.<p>I would say reddit being the prime example. People always bring up the really vile stuff e.g. r&#x2F;jailbait, r&#x2F;natsoc (or whatever it was) as examples, the first I would remove in a heart beat as it isn&#x27;t a free speech issue. However the list of subreddits and the posts that were being removed were often a lot less controversial IMO.<p>However one of the other comments, somewhere else in this thread I responded listed a lot of &quot;right-wing&quot; content in itself is somewhat objectionable. People have to remember that includes centre right libertarian types (like myself, I am a free market capitalist) and people who just believe in more old fashioned traditional values.')
