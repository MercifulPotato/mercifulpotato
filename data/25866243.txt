Among the highly relevant, when it comes to AWS decision making, AWS evangelists like Jeff Barr and Andy Jassy use Twitter to communicate with customers. AWS itself has a Twitter account for status updates. There&#x27;s just a ton of stuff on Twitter that is absolutely fine and would be collateral damage were Twitter shut down.<p>In the realm of taking down providers for copyright violations, the courts recognize a standard of &quot;substantial non-infringing use&quot; as a way to minimize that collateral damage. A provider like YouTube, which had a ton of both legal and illegal content prior to the Google acquisition, was allowed to stay up whereas a provider like Napster was shut down because they found it to be almost entirely copyright violation.<p>It seems like directly equating Twitter and Parler is a false equivalence. Twitter is a generic platform that some users use for problematic political discussion. Parler is a platform specifically targeted at problematic political discussion. You can&#x27;t target the problematic stuff and expect the same protection as someone who casts a wider net.')
