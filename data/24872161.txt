Just last night I was talking with a developer who works for me: &quot;This way will require 5 queries instead of 1.  Can you help me figure out this whacky ORM API to do it in 1?&quot;; &quot;Just do it as 5 right now and, as we learn more about the ORM API, we&#x27;ll fix it later...&quot;  Tech debt: we get the product done faster; we&#x27;ve got a 1-5 line change to make (when we know how to make it); and we&#x27;ll do so in a few months.')
