I could definitely see the argument that $20 was undervalued, but it&#x27;s plain to see that the short-squeeze is now part of the calculation of value.<p>There is no way that GameStop has an <i>actual</i> fundamental value of $300 per share. That price is clearly inflated, and in a few weeks will decrease, probably to somewhere above $20, but not that much higher. The market will eventually correct, but $300 is an over-correction for sure.')
