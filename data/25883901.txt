I worked on a transaction processing system that was entirely based on a in-house memory mapped database. All reads and writes went through mmap. At startup, it read through all X gigabytes of data to &quot;ensure&quot; everything was hot, in memory, and also built the in memory indexes.<p>This actually worked fine in production, since the systems were properly sized and dedicated to this. On dev systems with low memory and often running into swap, you&#x27;d run into cases with crazy delays... sometimes a second or two for something that would normally be a few milliseconds.')
