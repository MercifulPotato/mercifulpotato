Spoilers on the article:<p>&gt; Rebuilding our seller tools, which previously took almost a minute on every request, now takes under 30 seconds when weâ€™re starting a fresh compiler, and subsequent requests take only a second or two.<p>According to [0], esbuild is orders of magnitude faster than we pack. The speedup advertised is from 60s to hundreds of ms. The article talks about 12k js files, while according to [1],  4 year old hardware could handle an out-of-date check in less than a second on the entire code base if using a tool like make.<p>Im coming at this from an outside perspective, but even the results sound like they could be substantially faster? That said, it&#x27;s an interesting article and I enjoyed reading it!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esbuild.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esbuild.github.io&#x2F;</a>.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;david.rothlis.net&#x2F;ninja-benchmark&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;david.rothlis.net&#x2F;ninja-benchmark&#x2F;</a>')
