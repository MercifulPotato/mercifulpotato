Many good programmers will argue that &quot;actual debugging tools&quot; are mostly useless and that logging the execution of your program is a more productive use of your time.  In some sense, time spent inside the debugger is lost forever.  On the other hand, the time spend writing good logging code is really worth, and will be especially helpful to detect future bugs that you have not yet written.<p>I&#x27;m not a good programmer, but I can say very proudly that I&#x27;ve never used any debugger (except for assembly language, where the debugger is more like an interactive shell).')
