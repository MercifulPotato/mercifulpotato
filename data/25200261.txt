I don&#x27;t mind walking relatively long distances (and I&#x27;m fine with taking the NYC subway) but on my typical NYC visit I never use anything other than my feet to get around. The same is somewhat true of London though I&#x27;m more likely to get on the tube there.<p>Added: It depends too on where you&#x27;re going in the city. There are a fair number of US cities where walking works fine so long as you restrict your travel mostly to the city core, which people often do on a short trip.')
