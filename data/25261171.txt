Granted they are expensive with the current 64 core CPU part coming in at $5800 and the whole machine easily closer to 8k but if prices remain similar the top end mac pro will probably perform less ably than a machine based on the AMD part and cost about $15k.<p>Apple will of course retain its crown as the fastest OEM of hardware that runs its own OS since it will remain the only one legally allowed to do so.')
