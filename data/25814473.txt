The amount of code bloat on those pages tends to be related to tracking and advertising, so not running JS on those pages makes sense.<p>On the other hand, web applications that provide full-featured experiences are only possible because of the full spectrum of web technologies. Choosing not to run JS and claiming that Google Docs should work without JS is ridiculous.')
