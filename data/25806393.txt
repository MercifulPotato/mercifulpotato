Apart from not symmetric, which is a problem in its own right, for small o and small omega it&#x27;s not even reflexive, which does not prevent the = users from using it also for those. Which amounts to using an equals sign to highlight how two functions <i>differ</i>.<p>And what do people gain with that? It&#x27;s not as if a set membership symbol, which works just fine because big O, small o, the omegas and their ilk define sets of functions, doesn&#x27;t work just fine and take the same space without being confusing.')
