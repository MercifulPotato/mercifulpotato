And once I&#x27;ve discarded that huge chunk of code, I immediately know what else I broke, rather than having to find it by testing manually.<p>If I have to write 100 lines of code to implement a feature, it really doesn&#x27;t take me twice as long to write another 100 to test it. In most cases, writing the test alongside (or even before) the code helps with writing the code. I&#x27;d say writing a test adds maybe 25% to the time.<p>Knowing a year later than that code is still good, because that test still runs successfully, is easily worth that 25%<p>Of course I&#x27;m not saying 100% code coverage is worth it. Just the critical bits.')
