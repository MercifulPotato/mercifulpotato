There are other commenters saying &quot;but it&#x27;s expensive!&quot;, but your comparison should be Heroku vs. a Devops person (or yourself), not Heroku vs. &lt;cloud_service_that_you_manage_yourself&gt;.<p>My one complaint is that their support seems to have gotten worse over the years - they used to have great support engineers across the board, but have hired poorly recently, specifically in off-shore markets, so depending on what time you send in a ticket request, you may get someone who doesn&#x27;t fully read your ticket or comprehend the situation, and just fires back a canned reply.<p>This usually gets solved if there is enough back-and-forth as they then seem to escalate it properly, but I have noticed that the initial reply to support tickets are not as good as they used to be.')
