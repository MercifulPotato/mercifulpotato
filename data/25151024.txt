For podcasts that also posts youtube videos, I just use youtube since it lets me see reactions when I want to from podcasters.<p>I never understand HN Crowd complaining about ads on YouTube. It literally costs(1 month sub) less than typing a comment like this for most people on HN (At least in opportunity cost).')
