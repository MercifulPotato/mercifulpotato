That means we can up the shutter speed to the point where rolling shutter is negligible.<p>I have a nikon d7000, which has a rolling shutter. Its only really noticeable when I&#x27;m recording video, or when there is _lots_ of movement inside the shutter time. at 1&#x2F;3200th of second, thats a lot of movement.')
