I grew up in places like that, some of my family lives in places like that, and some friends who used to live in cities, but moved out for more space, also live in places like that.<p>Get too far outside Seattle, Portland, the SF bay area, greater LA, Chicago, Boston, NYC, DC, Austin, Dallas, Nashville, and even many smaller cities, and there really isn&#x27;t much to write home about when it comes to food. And for some of those cities, &quot;too far outside&quot; can be as little as a half hour drive.')
