Item(by='takeda', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611273254, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25866257, text='&gt; But forcing people to make cakes they feel morally icky about sounds like a guaranteed way to get some really ugly, half-assed cakes. Whether we like it or not that they feel that way doesn&#x27;t seem to matter because an ugly cake that validates me is still an ugly cake.<p>I don&#x27;t know the details of the case but I think there is a clear line between refusing to do usual service because somebody is from a protected group. Like a ordinary wedding cake only because the person ordering is gay.<p>vs<p>Refusing to create a wedding cake because it is offensive. Like customer asking for a cake in a shape of penis or something offending the artist.')
