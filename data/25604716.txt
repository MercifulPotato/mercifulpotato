Were they helicoptered or &#x27;free-range&#x27;[0] kids? I was free range. I&#x27;ve never been in a substantial leadership role, but I have a solid sense of self awareness, self confidence and agency. I can set a goal that is realistic for me and then work towards it, even if it&#x27;s a 10 year effort.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious that knowing what you&#x27;re capable of can only be learned if failing is part of the program. You can&#x27;t know how much you can dead lift until you&#x27;ve tried to push more than you physically can. You can&#x27;t know how accurately you can shoot without missing. You won&#x27;t know how much you can learn in a semester without poor test scores. Once you know the limits, those limits are another point to draw on when planning your life. Free range parenting serves that purpose better than helicoptering.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.todaysparent.com&#x2F;family&#x2F;parenting&#x2F;the-one-thing-about-free-range-parenting-nobody-talks-about&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.todaysparent.com&#x2F;family&#x2F;parenting&#x2F;the-one-thing-...</a>')
