I was quite annoyed.<p>All this stuff about offending people with jokes just boils down to how much drama and trouble you can create by bullying the creators and whether or not the ideologues in the media will amplify your message.<p>In the west, particularly in the USA, there&#x27;s a weird assumption that &quot;protected classes&quot; extend to jokes too. Jerry Seinfeld highlighted this absurdity with the &quot;anti-dentite&quot; episode. Since profession is not a &quot;protected class&quot; joking about it is ok. This makes no sense because it&#x27;s entirely possible a dentist or programmer would not feel good about being stereotyped, and so it has nothing to do with being sensitive or anything like that, it&#x27;s just an illusion that these specific groupings are not allowed but all other groupings are allowed.<p>I think the world would be a much better place if we all learned to laugh at each other, and ourselves. This selective cancellation and different rules for Borat and Apu are just exposing the absurdity of this type of thinking.')
