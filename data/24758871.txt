Item(by='forgot-pw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602533240, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757453, text='My wife and I got into an argument about this when it was time to switch our kids car seat so I pulled up their recommendations and read their sources. Their cited evidence doesn&#x27;t support their recommendation at all (nor did it when they first made the rec in 2011).<p>Their 2011 rear facing recommendation is based on a retracted article and their 2016 rec is based on the same article&#x27;s data except using a smaller dataset which they acknowledge is not statistically significant. The only other data cited looks at rear facing Swedish children compared to _unbelted_ Swedish children.<p>I went back and reread it to make sure I was remembering right. I&#x27;m dumbfounded that this was allowed not only to stand as a rec, but was increased (deepened? made stronger?) when they had even less data than they did before. I get that it feels like it should be safer, but that&#x27;s not science and I would have expected a group making medical and safety recs to maintain a higher standard.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pediatrics.aappublications.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;142&#x2F;5&#x2F;e20182461" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pediatrics.aappublications.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;142&#x2F;5&#x2F;e201824...</a>')
