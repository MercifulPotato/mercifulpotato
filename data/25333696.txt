The only reason why you need to is because the credit card companies have developed a flawed system that makes transactions very easy without any security. But they designed it this way so that payments are frictionless.<p>If this is the system they want, they should deal with the consequences. The burden of fraud, etc should rest on their shoulders, and it currently does. The more burden they put on our shoulders, the less it is for them. It’s like boiling a frog. When they implement PIN numbers, then they will be able to completely put the burden of liability on our shoulders. They want the convenience of quick payments with none of the liabilities.<p>What you’re talking about is presumably hundreds of virtual credit card numbers being distributed, which is even more of a burden for us. And then figuring out which number to cancel etc.<p>Credit card companies currently have a lot of incentive to catch fraud early because if you need to cancel a card, you will switch it to another card from another company, presumably.<p>Let them handle it.')
