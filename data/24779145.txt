Item(by='pp19dd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602696216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24778981, text='Thanks, I&#x27;ll put this as an option when creating a new game.  As for myself, I definitely like the feel of nailing a larger crystal of empty space and get that Pavlovian sound.<p>What&#x27;s funny is that most of the server code is already in place in dev, it&#x27;s just disabled.  I just need to carve some time to pick a direction and work on it.  When a board is generated, there&#x27;s already an algorithm that locates the center of the biggest empty space on a board, and if it exists, it assigns its address to game.clearest_tile.<p><pre><code>    &#x2F;&#x2F; first click, surprise!\n    if( game.click_count === 1 &amp;&amp; game.clearest_tile !== false ) {\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; sigh, this is too inelegant\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; game.board.private[payload.parameters.address].mine = false;\n\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; sigh, and this looks like garbage when shifted\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; this is what i get for picking a hexagonal board\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; game.shift_mines_to_center(payload.parameters.address);\n\n        &#x2F;&#x2F; todo: fixplz\n    }\n</code></pre>\nObviously I can just clear that tile on that first click and be done with it.  Or, highlight the emptiest tile on game board render.  But the shift_mines_to_center algorithm is something that needs tweaking.')
