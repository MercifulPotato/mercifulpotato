Because often what the buyer is asking for is simply not what he needs. Of course, bidding laws makes it illegal to contact the bid writer and if you try to anticipate anything not explicitly written, you&#x27;ll end up with a more expensive proposition than your competitor.<p>The IBM Phenix payroll system is a prime example of that, but there are many more.')
