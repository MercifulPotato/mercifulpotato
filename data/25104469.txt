California law covers everything you do outside of the work hours  without employer-provided equipment, including things in the employer&#x27;s areas of business. What California does allow the employer to do is to have a conflict of interest provision that will allow it to discipline or sue you if you do something outside of work hours that could cause conflict with the employer&#x27;s business. They won&#x27;t own your IP though.')
