I LOVE ruby, but have been anti-rails for a while and I am not sure I am right for that.<p>I got into Ruby programming through Rails... but in 2005. Rails was brand new (I think I was on version like 0.12 or something?), and I slowly moved away from it to things like Sinatra and Sequel. Rails had some huge performance issues, and active record was pretty unusable at any sort of scale unless you did a lot of custom SQL.<p>I know it has come a long way in 15 years, I should try again')
