Compare <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24798617" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24798617</a> for my thoughts on how to filter for authoritarian followers of whatever political persuasion.<p>How can &quot;would score high&quot; and &quot;accepting of divergences from their beliefs&quot; not be disjoint?<p>As far as I can tell, the author is not advocating to &quot;cure&quot; people for not voting his way, he&#x27;s advocating to &quot;cure&quot; people who are tempted to use the bullet box instead of the ballot box[3] to make him live their way. I&#x27;m pretty sure classical liberals, being live and let live, would score very low on this test.<p>Thanks for reassuring me about Dreher and Evola[4], I was introduced to them via HN, so I have no idea how widespread their thought may be offline. Agree that Toole was writing a parody version of the question of political or theoretic lives which was treated in a serious manner by Boethius in <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> and Hesse in <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Dr. Talc (a substance useful when changing diapers?) didn&#x27;t also have elements of self mockery.<p>[1] did I forget to mention that apparently former CPSU members scored highly on RWA? Examples of questions I think left wing authoritarian followers might score highly on in the current context: 1, 5, 7, 17, 19, 22. Maybe for the current times the author, who notes in the first chapter that in the early twenty-first century the times of quoting Chairman Mao were long over, ought to ask about the appropriate use of <i>Madame Guillotine</i>?<p>[2] In the context of online cancellation mobs, moving from &quot;harassment&quot; through &quot;punish&quot;, &quot;maim&quot;, and &quot;torture&quot;, on to &quot;liquidate&quot;. To me it seems the easiest way to address mob cancellation is to only allow termination for cause, but even that wouldn&#x27;t have saved the NYT editor (who had published Cotton&#x27;s OpEd sight unseen).<p>[3] bullet box metaphor lifted from an FBI indictment. For my sanity, I should stop reading those things. (but they&#x27;re horribly fascinating: over here people bring rifles to the range, not to demos.)<p>[4] I get Ubuntu from Evola because he&#x27;s always rabbiting on about the atomisation of modernity. I&#x27;m not sure quite what he&#x27;s <i>for</i>, as he seems to take it for granted his readers already do, but given the expressed love of hierarchy, I think he&#x27;s big on social relations:<p><pre><code>    Left wing ubuntu: symmetric, transitive, and reflexive \n    Right wing ubuntu: antisymmetric, transitive, and reflexive\n</code></pre>\nnot to mention keeping relations up not only with those alive today but also with those of our Tradition.')
