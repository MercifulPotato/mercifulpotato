So every $100 increase in stock price is a 10x increase in losses.<p>If someone re-entered at ~$300, a $100 increase would be a 30% increase in loses.<p>The scale of these is massively different.<p>I have absolutely no doubt that other firms have entered short positions.<p>Claiming that &quot;Melvin may have re-entered afterwards&quot; is obviously a possibility, but is not the same as having lied about exiting in the first place.')
