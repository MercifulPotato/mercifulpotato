Just as the authorities have to know an identity to freeze an account in a criminal matter, if they know your identity then they can compel you to give up your Bitcoin stash. You can refuse, but then you&#x27;ll go to jail. It&#x27;s no different than some drug lord burying their money in the desert somewhere and refusing to give it up to the feds when they come.<p>People keep pretending Bitcoin&#x2F;cryptocurrency is magic and immune to real world pressures, and keep getting rude awakenings when they learn it&#x27;s not.')
