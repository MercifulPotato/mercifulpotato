The Supreme Court actually agreed to hear an appeal of the Lotus ruling back in the 1990s, but, with one justice absent from the case, the high court deadlocked 4-4. That allowed the Lotus ruling to stand, but it didn&#x27;t make the ruling binding on other appeals courts.<p>A 4-4 tie could happen again this time around, as there is currently one supreme court seat vacant just as there was for Lotus vs. Borland.')
