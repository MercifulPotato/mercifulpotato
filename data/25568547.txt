Various stats tables give clues which plan will be best, but there will always be queries where the stats still don&#x27;t lead to the optimal plan...<p>Therefore, I believe all query engines should allow the changing of a plan mid query.    Ie., when a query or subquery is not producing matching rows as rapidly as predicted, the query should be paused, a new plan selected, and the query continued with the new plan.<p>My testing of this on a fork of postgres found some queries can see a 1000x speedup, especially ones with tens of joins.<p>This leads to some complexity around cursors, but in my view, this complexity is worth it.')
