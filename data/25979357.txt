They&#x27;re in a confined space, have big cores to drive them and they need to supply a blanket of airflow to get things cool.<p>Higher efficiency components and a good implicit airflow design affects much more than the fans themselves, since there&#x27;s not much space to optimize the fan design itself compared to the airflow as a whole inside the server.<p>Moreover, more intelligent system management solutions with more sensors both inside the chips and on the motherboard allows the BMC to see the whole picture and manage these fans in a more informed manner.')
