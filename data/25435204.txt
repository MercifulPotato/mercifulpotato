You have 0 interest in considering the merits of the police accountability movement. You trying to discredit the movement by pointing to the minority of opportunists who have sprung up.<p>No, the people who protest in a productive and lawful manner I genuinely support. They are the victims of opportunists who riot, and make it so that the former cannot peacefully assemble. When a protest turns into a riot, and a curfew or dispersal order is issued it is the opportunists and rioters who deprived the legitimate protestors of their opportunity to speak. That is part of why it&#x27;s so important to detain and charge rioters: it&#x27;s not just the direct harm of violence, it&#x27;s also the indirect harm of inhibiting peaceful demonstration.<p>But back to the original point, referencing a sharp increase in arrests while ignoring a sharp increase in riots is just willful ignorance. That&#x27;s really what it is. What were the biggest riots we had in 2019? In 2018? Were they even remotely as big as the summer 2020 riots?')
