At least most of the stuff I use notebooks for is either one off or difficult to test. One off stuff might be some exploratory analysis or glue code to do simple tasks like loading and formatting data. Numerical tasks like ML are frequently very difficult to test because the author doesn’t know exactly what the output should be. If you don’t know the answer it’s hard to test for it.<p>For these reasons, formal tests rarely make sense in notebooks. If the code expands its use to being used repeatedly then clearly the notebook should be refactored into scripts and packages that have tests for the glue code and maybe some attempt at boundary the behavior of the numerical code.')
