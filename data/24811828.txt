And then even more variations if you&#x27;re trying to transfer money internationally.<p>Part of that problem is the continued existence of insecure-by-design systems that should have been forcibly retired many years ago. Another part is that even where safer alternatives exist, as this very story unfortunately demonstrates, it&#x27;s all too easy for an honest person to be misled about whether they are using one of them.<p>Both of these problems are directly attributable to the financial services industry, which continues to make a fortune from the status quo even as lives get ruined and businesses go under as a result of preventable crime. Sadly, I can&#x27;t see this changing until someone in a national government grows enough of a spine to regulate the industry properly, by which I mean setting out a realistic timetable for fixing the problem and then imposing crippling fines on any banks and other professional actors that don&#x27;t step up.')
