If I allowed their scripts on all those websites, holy moly, the profile they could build about me ... Best way to protect your privacy is to not let the data be collected in the first place.<p>I am no lawyer and do not wish to read many pages of their legalese. However, if they somehow managed to convince me, that they are not building profiles, that they are not transferring or selling data to anyone else, and that none of the software they use does so behind their backs, then I might trust them. Now that is very difficult to do of course, almost impossible. I would rather trust a single entity, that is not present in any requests to any other website I visit. That seems to be much lower risk than putting data all in the hands of a single party, which is present on many many websites.')
