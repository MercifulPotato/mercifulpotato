If people stop paying for their products, they cease to exist.<p>Corporations are also accountable to governments, as this story illustrates. If US courts and&#x2F;or legislators decide they want it, Google ceases to exist.<p>Economists think of this in terms of &quot;Exit vs Voice&quot;.<p>With governments, you have a voice - one vote for deciding who&#x27;s in charge - but no way to exit, even when your side loses.<p>With corporations you can exit - stop shopping at Target - but no voice in how Target is run.<p>Both models have pros and cons, and it&#x27;s good to understand how they differ, and what situations they&#x27;re suited for.')
