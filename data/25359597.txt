Even on Cellebrite&#x27;s own website: For example on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cellebrite.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;android-acquisition-simplified&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cellebrite.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;android-acquisition-simpl...</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cellebrite.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;iphone-extractions-5-questions-to-unlock-more-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cellebrite.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;iphone-extractions-5-ques...</a>.<p>There are definitely some workarounds for encryption available. For example, it appears that even for some newer phones Cellebrite supports an approach of brute-forcing the PIN without locking the phone due to too many retries. But those workarounds don&#x27;t seem to be the primary benefit &#x2F; use-case of Cellebrite: It seems that in lots of cases people surrender their passwords when asked and the main benefit of Cellebrite is in extracting and presenting information from a phone once it&#x27;s unlocked.<p>Once unlocked data from iPhones is relatively easy to extract with a local backup. Android is much more limited in terms of which data is available as backup and the common approach appears to be to use ADB for extraction. Either by downgrading an application or by automated screen-scraping of the data (or by using exploits on outdated Android versions). For WhatsApp it appears that the &quot;downgrade&quot; approach might be used, which downgrades to an earlier version that makes extraction easier. That&#x27;s the same approach that&#x27;s also used by consumer backup tools such as Wondershare Dr.Fone.<p>Regarding the more complicated approach to extract data from Android: Starting with Android 11 and API level 30 Android is starting to ignore the allowBackup manifest attribute, thereby allowing to locally extract data from applications via ADB even if the applications don&#x27;t allow that (source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;android-11-force-app-local-backup-restore-handicap-cloud-backup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;android-11-force-app-local-ba...</a>). While definitely a benefit for users, I wonder if another motivation for that change was to simplify data extraction for law enforcement.')
