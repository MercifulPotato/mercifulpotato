(For &quot;three-season&quot;; winter&#x2F;snow hiking and, especially, camping definitely takes more.) But so long as you don&#x27;t care how it looks, are fine with coated nylon rather than something like Gore-tex, and are OK with somewhat heavier gear, you can get started for very little money between thrift stores&#x2F;eBay, Walmart, cast-offs from friends, military surplus, etc. Even hiking boots, you could probably at least consider work boots from a discount store.')
