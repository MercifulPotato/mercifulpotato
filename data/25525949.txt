First off, the checksum would catch it.  Second, the file is compressed, so flipping a bit turns it into complete garbage.  Third, BAM uses a length-prefixed coding in several places.  A flipped bit in any length field would mess up the decoding.<p>Those bits could still flip in memory, which isn&#x27;t BTRFS&#x27;s fault.  That&#x27;s still unlikely, because you&#x27;d typically get segfaults, not silent corruption.  So, it&#x27;s probably bad software.<p>&gt; those algorithms should be deterministic, right?<p>Combine bad code (samtools) with multithreading, and you will quickly become convinced that your computer is possessed by an evil spirit.')
