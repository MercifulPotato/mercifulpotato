I don&#x27;t disbelieve this kid and that wasn&#x27;t my point - I was defending him- there&#x27;s just a bit of a gap between &quot;noticing you have privilege&quot; and helping to found an organisation to help other kids do experiments. The latter claim might start to set off &quot;too good to be true&quot; detectors, so I&#x27;m merely saying that even if that&#x27;s not 100% true the fact he&#x27;s talking about it is a positive thing since some young talented people do seem utterly oblivious to their own privilege.')
