Item(by='lawl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606379361, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25214097, text='&gt; Advertisers seem to be so focused on shoving ads in front of eyeballs that theyâ€™re forgetting why those eyeballs are there in the first place.<p>The thing is, you actually <i>can</i> combine both of those things. I&#x27;ve seen some youtubers do this quite well where an entire video is sponsored, but I still want to watch it because the essence of why I watch that particular youtuber is still there. I.e. it&#x27;s not completely watered down.<p>One recent example of this done reasonably well that comes to mind is from Michael Reeves[0] and the entire video is a gigantic ad for an amazon show I have absolutely no interest in ever watching. But i still watched the entire video because it was still (mostly) a Michael Reeves video.<p>So imo ads can be done rather well, but you have to put in the effort and not slap a news site full of banners.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zrrs9LGIfyQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zrrs9LGIfyQ</a>')
