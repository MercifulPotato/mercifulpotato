It&#x27;s not just whether you agree with their mission but also their social dynamics.<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;best setup&quot; here; it&#x27;s whatever you&#x27;d enjoy most.  It&#x27;s hard to help people if you&#x27;re unhappy doing it.  You may prefer a &quot;show up, help, leave&quot; deal, or something more like a social club that meets over drinks to plan events and chat about life.  So don&#x27;t feel discouraged if your first group doesn&#x27;t feel right.')
