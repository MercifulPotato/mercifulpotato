There are many payment systems which don&#x27;t do that (e.g. SEPA credit transfers in EU, and various other &#x27;giro payment&#x27; schemes), and can do fast and cheap payments that are actually known to be fully cleared right after receiving them.<p>The key thing for preventing money-forwarding scams, however, is that <i>all</i> the commonly used payment systems in your society must be &quot;reliable&quot;. If some are, and some are not, then the intersection of these payment systems opens people up to an &quot;arbitrage&quot; of sending &quot;reliable money&quot; after receiving &quot;unreliable money&quot;; you won&#x27;t eliminate this type fraud by making a better payment system accessible, that will happen only after systems like cheques are driven out.')
