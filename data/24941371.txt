Writing games involves a lot of math, image processing, and similar, and 2020 computers are fast enough kids can do that without writing optimized assembly. It&#x27;s nice if games can be physically embedded (Arduino&#x2F;Micro:bit).<p>Right now, there&#x27;s a collection of projects, but they don&#x27;t play well together. The level of contortions one must go through to move a sprite from being a numpy array to an image in whatever library, to an image in another library, is well beyond what most kids (or even teachers) can handle.')
