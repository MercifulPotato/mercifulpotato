There are too many threads, too many moving parts, and trying to stop the world to make sense of it is too invasive; you&#x27;ll muck with timings and waits and timeouts and GC thresholds and all sorts, and your effort to figure out what&#x27;s going on will have changed what&#x27;s going on. And that&#x27;s if gdb doesn&#x27;t crash.<p>IMO not enough people download and build the source. It&#x27;s primitive, but adding logging or printfs to existing source, combined with strace if necessary, can be effective in a brutal way, where gdb - or any debugger - wouldn&#x27;t get you far.')
