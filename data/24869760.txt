Are there mature (or at least pretty stable) code generators?  Test generators?  What&#x27;s inter-operability like?  (Is it easy&#x2F;possible to generate clients and server stubs in different languages that will work together?  Can I write a service, publish my API spec, and expect people to be able to use it to write clients?)')
