Preindustrial CO2 levels were at around 280ppm. Nowadays we are at 415ppm and no sign of any slowdown. 30% of the CO2 in the atmosphere came from burning fossil fuels. We are just a few decades away from doubling CO2 levels compared to preindustrial times.<p>On the order of millions of years the earth is a self correcting system that always tries to release as much energy as it absorbs. If you disrupt it in mere centuries you&#x27;re going to see mass extinctions. Humans can adapt but often that just means they migrate to more hospitable locations. It means more refugees than we already have. The negative effects on agriculture will make it harder to feed 8 billion people so eventually civil wars will break out.')
