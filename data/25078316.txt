Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=[25078345], score=None, time=1605236434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077968, text='&gt; The most recent Amendment took 202 years to ratify, and that was nearly 30 years ago<p>This is a deceptive picture to paint. That amendment was an outlier in respect. There are only 3&#x2F;27 amendments that took more than 3 years to pass and 2 of them were passed faster than 4 years. The mean is 8.94 years and if you remove the 27th the average was 1.44 years. We also have an average of 8.2 years between the amendments (counting from 1789).')
