Any serious lung infection can result in the symptoms you describe. No shortage of people who report similar for two years after flu induced pneumonia. But with the flu it&#x27;s people who get seriously ill who need a long time to recover. With covid the extraordinary claim is that a significant percentage of people who catch it but are mildly symptomatic throughout still experience major loss of lung function, fatigue, etc. I find it hard to believe that perfectly healthy people get a debilitating &quot;long covid&quot; illness after a very mild covid infection.')
