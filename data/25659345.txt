CLRS, etc., are nice books, but if you&#x27;re seriously considering a senior role at Facebook presumably you already know the basics and just need to memorize all the tricks for LeetCode problems.<p>For system design, though, it actually is worth reading through &quot;Designing Data-Intensive Applications.&quot;')
