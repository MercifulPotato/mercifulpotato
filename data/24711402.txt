It&#x27;s just that 10% of NZ$100k and US$400 is 4x the difference in absolute terms<p>I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. For two reasons:<p>1) I earn the equivalent of just under the median household income on my own, and 100% of my income is eaten by our expenses. It&#x27;s really my wife&#x27;s income that&#x27;s left over after all that has been paid for, so none of mine is spare.<p>2) There must be hundreds of thousands of people who live in the bay area that don&#x27;t work at FAANG and don&#x27;t  make anywhere near that, but still manage to live on the city somehow. It&#x27;s not like if you make $360k you&#x27;re barely scaping by, right!? Else basically everyone else would be homeless there.<p>I ran the numbers and I&#x27;d be able to save a lot more.')
