The west has invested a lot into the Chinese economy hoping to translate the corresponding equity into growth. I wonder if the Chinese are really long term interested in honoring the equity.<p>Meaning - take the money now, grow the businesses and the economy and then at some point say &quot;It&#x27;s stupid that we&#x27;re letting foreigners have 20% (or whatever) ownership of our economy&quot; and just deem it illegal &#x2F; confiscate that equity.<p>Obviously it will prevent future foreign investment but if China is in a place where they don&#x27;t care about that, it would be the move.')
