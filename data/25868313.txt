An apples to apples comparison puts 200 MQ-9 for 8 billion vs 600 F-35’s for 400 billion.  So about 40 Million vs 667 Million.<p>But that’s just the start, the MQ-9 costs about $3,600 per flight hour vs ~35,000 per hour for the F-35.  Though that slightly favors the F-35 because training an F-35A pilot costs a little over 10 million dollars.<p>That said, the MQ-9 is designed for a very different role so per aircraft numbers are deceptive.  F-35’s have a much higher payload, higher top speed, stealth etc.')
