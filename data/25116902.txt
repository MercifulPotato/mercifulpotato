If you allow your stomach to contract, you will feel full from less food. Some people accomplish this by mechanically shrinking their stomach (gastric bypass surgery) but it is a natural process.<p>Basically, eat enough food to provide the energy you need. Nothing more. It&#x27;s far less than you think, especially with fat reserves. Your stomach will adjust.<p>Competitive eaters do the opposite: They deliberately expand their stomachs to fit more (of course), and so that they don&#x27;t feel full when competing.<p>Downvoter person, read more about stomach elasticity if you don&#x27;t believe me.')
