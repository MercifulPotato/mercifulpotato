I can imagine the big businesses colluding with the government for some short-term gains, but a lot of the free press in the US has nothing to do with big businesses and it is impossible for me to imagine all of them falling in line with the government.<p>Also I don&#x27;t see how pandering to the government is always a win-win situation for big businesses in the US. The tech companies have their own interests which do not always align with either political party.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to get at is that the US Constitution certainly doesn&#x27;t rely on the lousy assumption that all winning politicians will be honest and all private companies will be &quot;responsible&quot;, by some definition of responsible. It&#x27;s more about leveraging self-interest to preserve a check and balance at all levels so that not a single power runs wild.')
