It gathers them all together, but when I&#x27;m going through the configuration, I&#x27;m not only modifying the telemetry&#x2F;privacy stuff but other preferences too, so it might not save all that much time.<p>(That UI is a little reminiscent of the Group Policy Editor, although I think the extra layer of ambiguous &quot;slider buttons&quot; make it even more confusing at first glance --- e.g. if the &quot;App access to camera disabled&quot; setting is red, does that mean the setting is not applied and apps <i>can</i> access the camera, or does the red mean the <i>camera access</i> is disabled? A &quot;[*] Allow app access to camera&quot; checkbox would be far more straightforward. That said, gpedit.msc&#x27;s mix of enable-to-disable and disable-to-enable isn&#x27;t much better either --- it&#x27;s almost as if they are trying to mislead you.)')
