I don&#x27;t know if this is normal- maybe everyone brings their own?- but sleeping on an upholstered plank (billed as a &quot;couchette&quot;) did not make for a restful night. I don&#x27;t think I slept at all.<p>The joke was that I had a sleeping pad with me, but I didn&#x27;t dare try and dig it out of my pack in the dark cramped shared compartment.')
