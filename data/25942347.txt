I&#x27;m not so sure.<p>I think it&#x27;s very risky for the investors but I don&#x27;t know whether the SEC has stuff that would cover this.<p>And even if there were a law, if you somehow have your thumb on the social media hype button then how would you enforce that law? Makes me think nothing unruly is going on, just a bubble that will inevitably collapse and make Musk etc. rich once more just like during the dot com era.
