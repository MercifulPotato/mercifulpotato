But AFAICT it&#x27;s the best on-ramp to the Unifi ecosystem.<p>It&#x27;s a new system, and it shows â€“ plenty of rough edges. For example, ethernet connection drops between my Thunderbolt dock and the UDM (resolved by sticking a switch in-between).<p>There&#x27;s a learning curve for sure. It will be tough if you aren&#x27;t already strong with basic networking concepts.<p>It&#x27;s also frustrating to run into Ubiquiti forum posts that don&#x27;t apply to the UDM, because it doesn&#x27;t expose the same low-level config tooling as their other products. I can&#x27;t fix my VLAN-mDNS troubles due to that.<p>Over time, I expect to replace the router&#x2F;gateway responsibilities with Protectli hardware and OPNsense. But at least now I have solid WiFi to build upon.')
