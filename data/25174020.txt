Not only the pandemic, but also the severe state of the long-term debt cycle, and the increasing automation, as well as existing social inequality, all make basic income necessary if we want to avoid more extreme levels of homelessness.  And it seems unlikely that significantly higher levels of homelessness will be tolerated without large increases in entitlements.<p>We also need much more effective tax policies related to corporations and wealthy individuals.<p>But I also believe that when people on the other side say that we can&#x27;t pay for the basic income, they are correct.  The income of the government will still not add up to be able to give everyone a livable floor to start with given the high cost of living in the US.  And even with dramatic improvements in tax collection, its not going to come close.<p>So I believe that either we will end up creating a new type of high-tech money, or quite possibly have a global war where we try to defend the US currency.')
