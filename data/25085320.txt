I&#x27;ve started contributing quite a bit to Wikidata as part of some work that uses it as a data source, and it&#x27;s really the first time in more than a decade that I work in an environment where my work gets public scrutiny.<p>Shame is a really strong emotion for me, and I feel terrible when anyone spots a mistake. At one point, I left the site and didn&#x27;t return for three days because I saw there was a notification for me. Which turned out to be positive feedback.<p>I feel far worse about my own mistakes than about those of others.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is people doubling down on obvious mistakes. Show some contrition and your standing will net benefit from you screwing something up. Trust me on this: I&#x27;m German and we have made that principle semi-official government philosophy. Whenever I see, say, Turkish nationalists deny the Armenian genocide, or Polish wikipedia deleting articles about local anti-semitic incidents, I wonder if they seriously believe their actions won&#x27;t make them look both guilty <i>and</i> somewhat stupid.<p>Oh, while we&#x27;re at it: Only by participating have I learnt what a vast enterprise the whole of Wikimedia actually is, and how almost all of it is open to the public. It&#x27;s the only non-profit organisation at FAANG-scale (except Amazon I guess), and you might want to check out, for example, what Graphana looks like at scale: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.wikimedia.org&#x2F;d&#x2F;000000605&#x2F;datacenter-global-overview?orgId=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grafana.wikimedia.org&#x2F;d&#x2F;000000605&#x2F;datacenter-global-...</a>')
