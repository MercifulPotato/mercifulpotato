Move a few Kms and they speak German, go South and they speak Italian and you will still be in small Switzerland.<p>Where many people are naturally bi or trilingual.<p>Adding English as a third&#x2F;fourth it&#x27;s very easy for them.<p>Eventually everybody will learn some English, undoubtedly, but it&#x27;s gonna be foreigners&#x27; English, that it&#x27;s different from proper English and sometimes it&#x27;s pure nonsense for native speakers and viceversa.')
