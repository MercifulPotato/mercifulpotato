Then the idea is, once you&#x27;ve grown as much as you can and it&#x27;s too hard for others to compete because of your entrenched network effects, you can reduce sales and marketing to a a reasonable, highly profitable level.<p>That&#x27;s it in a nutshell and it works in any market with strong network effects, which AirBNB <i>strongly</i> fits into, in facts it&#x27;s a poster child for the concept. Yelp is another good example -- sign up all the restaurants before a competitor does.<p>There are a lot of different business models out there, which you can study (and MBA programs teach you). This is just one model, and it&#x27;s a legitimate one. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple all have different models from it (and all drastically different from each other as well).')
