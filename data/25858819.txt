Funnily enough, he wasn&#x27;t saying anything like this about the Capitol Hill rioters...<p>I think one of Trump&#x27;s biggest flaws (if we put aside megalomania), is that he wants to be loved by <i>everyone</i> - I always got the impression he&#x27;d say anything to anyone if he thought it would get them on side, regardless of whether he actually believed it.')
