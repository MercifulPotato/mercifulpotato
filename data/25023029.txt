I don&#x27;t remember the issue under the Obama admin.<p>&gt; No single position is without tradeoffs, hence the debate.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between a debate and an Executive Order. Donald Trump isn&#x27;t &quot;debating&quot; putting people in cages. He <i>is</i> putting people in cages. He, personally, <i>changed policy</i> to put people <i>who otherwise would not have been</i> in cages.<p>In fact, this policy was both so unpopular and legally tenuous that Trump was forced to roll much of it back due to intense pressure from, well, pretty much everyone else. <i>Even the CBP</i> said that the zero tolerance policy trump adopted was bad.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a borderline ad hominem attack - my opponent is evil, therefore I can dismiss his concerns without ever really addressing them.<p>Yes well, if you don&#x27;t want that, you shouldn&#x27;t have Stephen Miller write your border policy.')
