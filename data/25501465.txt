(I can feel the Eagle vs Washington&#x27;s Head pretty well. But the 50-states and stuff are too much for my fingers to memorize. Give me a few minutes with the coin beforehand, maybe I can learn on the spot... if the back is distinct enough from Washington&#x27;s head).<p>Its a fun party trick, to remind people that you need to let the coin bounce on the ground if you want a fair toss. If you let someone &quot;catch&quot; the coin, you&#x27;re prone to all sorts of shennanigans.')
