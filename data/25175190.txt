There&#x27;s small amount of spam, like few mails per week, nothing to worry about. I can receive and send mail just fine.<p>Though I admit that for someone who did not tinker with UNIX for years, configuring this kind of setup might be daunting.<p>Personal mail could be solved by some kind of daemon which provides SMTP, IMAP, built-in spam detection, DNS checks, some simple administration web interface and works with 0 configuration for typical use-cases. Maddy could be this project, so I would be happy to replace all those daemons with a single binary. I hope that they&#x27;ll implement spam detection, as rspamd is a separate daemon which requires redis, so in the end it&#x27;s still a complex setup with lots of moving parts.')
