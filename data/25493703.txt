There are teams of people at the better funded companies working to arrange interviews, plant stories, have influencers promote things and so on... all in an attempt to build awareness and eventually help them increase sales.  It&#x27;s basically an early stage marketing strategy until it&#x27;s known how big the market is and how big a piece of it a given company is able to get and then more traditional marketing approaches take over.  Worst case: the company runs out of money which will also turn off the hype machine.')
