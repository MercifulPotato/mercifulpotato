I think it&#x27;s a bit obscene when kids teabag each other in some middle-east inspired CoD map when a few thousand kilometers from where they&#x27;re playing people wearing similar garbs kill each other in similar places with similar weapons.<p>It&#x27;s something fairly unique to videogames too. Imagine the outrage if some American propaganda war movie Ã  la Black Hawk Down showed American military personnel engaging in 360 noscope kill streaks, trying to rack up headshot combos.')
