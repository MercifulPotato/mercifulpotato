Think LXDE vs XFCE vs KDE vs Gnome as desktop environments, or nano vs Sublime vs Code&#x2F;Atom vs IntelliJ as text editors, for example.<p>However, when it comes some software areas prone to capture, there&#x27;s not only no choice, but rather a multitude of incompatible-by-design options. Due to WFH, I need to have four different bloated chat&#x2F;videoconference software on all the time which all offers the same features to me. When I want to watch a live stream, I need to open YouTube or Twitch or Facebook Live which all offer the same basic functionality but no one is interested in standardizing their interface so I can just point my familiar video player to it (at least without it breaking all the time due to cat-and-mouse fights between the platform and open source developers).<p>I&#x27;m not generally in favour of regulation, but mandating some basic degree of interoperability so platform and software can compete separately seems like the only option.')
