Joined a regional credit union, moved across the country.<p>I can use the ATMs of the regional credit union in the new area for free if I need an ATM, and my original credit union has been more than happy to facilitate everything else I need via phone and email. And the &quot;phone&quot; agents are literally just the same staff I&#x27;d be talking to at the branch I opened the account at, not some call centre, so there&#x27;s no real need to go in to actually get customer service.<p>On top of that, the accounts are completely free. I pay $0&#x2F;mo for a handful of accounts (one for general monthly bills, one linked to my debit card, another for savings, etc) with unlimited transactions&#x2F;transfers&#x2F;etc.<p>The _only_ thing I&#x27;m missing is the ability to deposit cash. Which has yet to be any sort of issue for me.')
