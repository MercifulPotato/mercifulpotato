Most are very lightly used items that were returned, and in some cases it&#x27;s just that the packaging was damaged. If you&#x27;re ok with this, it&#x27;s not uncommon to find items with over 50% discounts. In the few cases where I got a bad item, returning it was a breeze.  My main complaint has been that the items are very hard to browse, so I decided to make my own website for this.<p>The website is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dealforager.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dealforager.com</a>')
