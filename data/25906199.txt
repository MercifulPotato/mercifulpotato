IMO this is about as high quality as you should go without real studio soundproofing and lighting. I chose the a6400 because it&#x27;s not crazy expensive and has some of the best&#x2F;fastest autofocus around, which is extremely important when you can&#x27;t touch the camera. Here&#x27;s a list anyways, though:<p>Mandatory: Ring light and&#x2F;or cheap amazon LED panels, proper placement and setup of lighting+mic+cam. Minor attempts at soundproofing are also encouraged.<p>Low end: Logitech c920, random USB mic from Amazon<p>Mid end: Sony a6000* (up to a6400* OK) with kit lens (or go body only and get a vintage manual lens for cheap), Shure SM7B (or Rode NT1&#x2F;NT1-A). Blue Yetis are also okay but require moderate soundproofing. If you&#x27;re getting a mic better than a Blue Yeti, you should also get mixing equipment of some sort. You can also just stick with a cheap microphone at this level as long as it doesn&#x27;t sound awful.<p>High end: Blackmagic pocket cinema*, Shure SM7B<p>Highest end: Hire a production company, this is the big leagues now<p>* = Requires capture card<p>For lighting setups, soundproofing, and optimal cam+mic usage, you can maybe check out YouTube in order to learn a bit. You will probably need more than is just on this list, but this is just the bare minimum.')
