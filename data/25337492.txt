After a few weeks it&#x27;s all second nature so you don&#x27;t have to do much to adhere to the guidelines and just do it while writing the code in the first place.<p>To me ignoring style is kind of like slipping a PR&#x2F;diff&#x2F;cl through without unit tests. Sure, that individual CL won&#x27;t be the downfall of the codebase, but repeated offenses will destroy the codebase without an easy way to fix it all. Of course, without unit tests you end up with an unmaintainable fragile codebase, and without style you end up with an ugly, hard to read codebase.')
