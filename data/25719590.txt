If he isn&#x27;t, though, I should be able to let other users whom we both know grab a copy to pass on to him later, or maybe have a &quot;deaddrop&quot; server or a &quot;pub&quot; where I can stash messages and have them get picked up by someone else later.</i><p>Scuttlebutt is built around enabling this as a (the?) primary feature.  It&#x27;s not just &quot;supported&quot;, the entire ecosystem does this by design.  It even calls that kind of server &quot;pubs&quot; (they&#x27;re normal peers, they just auto-follow anyone who asks).')
