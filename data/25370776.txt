Overvoting causes the ballot to go to adjudication. At that point the person adjudicating gets to choose which results are submitted and tabulated.<p>Is that supposed to be evidence of fraud? That&#x27;s exactly what I expect from adjudication: A human has to read the ballot and choose whether to disambiguate it or remove it from the tabulation.<p>Not to mention the physical ballots are not changed. Unless the same person adjudicates the same ballots the same way, this kind of tampering is incredibly easy to catch.')
