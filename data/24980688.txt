Item(by='Scarbutt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604418535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24980167, text='Clojurescript creates lots of overhead on the runtime, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for UIs that need to do more than very lightweight processing on the client and be really snappy. A 50k LoC codebase(as in Dark) in Clojurescript will be a nightmare. To scale a Clojure(script) codebase to that size requires lots of documentation and discipline(and lots of tests!), it can me made but it&#x27;s not easy.')
