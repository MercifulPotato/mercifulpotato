You can take any current program&#x2F;file, &quot;encode it&quot; to lego blocks, and it would be a one-dimensional string. This probably arises because our foundational layer is one dimensional binary.<p>Tree Notation&#x2F;2D&#x2F;3D languages are like a higher dimensional binary. Where you can traverse the program in multiple dimensions. Where physical layout matters.<p>Now all our current languages can be represented in this way. And that&#x27;s what most of my stuff focuses on now.<p>But there are things that you can do with these languages and this style of 2D&#x2F;3D architecture that you just cannot do with our current 1D register technology. (I mean maybe you could do them, but it would take billions of years to compute).<p>Wait, am I claiming that 2D&#x2F;3D computers would be as big a development as Quantum computing?<p>No, much fucking bigger. Quantum computing is a fucking joke compared to this.<p>(pardon my french, I just find the occasional f-bomb as a good way to communicate my excitement about the OOM I am seeing)')
