It doesn’t need to also affect the presidency.<p>And I would argue that it is already not functioning properly so I’m not as worried about hypotheticals of how it could go wrong. We just had 4 years of ineffective populism thanks to the electoral college. It continues to elect presidents without popular support and a gridlocked congress with historically low approval ratings.')
