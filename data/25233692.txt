His comment below the video reads:<p>&gt; Guys I’m not salty, I’m sweet :3<p>&gt; But for real, I think this company is super promising. Most FANG company have their own in-house system for hiring labelers, and I know that it’s extremely valuable for any ML team. Getting trusted, reliable and cost effective labeled data is not easy for smaller companies. I actually feel honored that I even got to interview for them in the super early stages.')
