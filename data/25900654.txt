In the end that&#x27;s the question that needs answering. Very soon, you&#x27;ll be paying extra to buy a petrol vehicle. And that&#x27;s before you drive it anywhere and get to deal with taxes, fuel cost, and maintenance cost as well.<p>In any case, a typical EV would have about 50KWH of battery; more than enough to power a house for a while. The more EVs there are, the more stored KWH of energy will be around in any area if a blackout happens. Much more useful than oversized SUVs burning up all the remaining fuel in your area while fuel logistics are being disrupted.<p>For your parents, an EV and vehicle to grid technology could have seen them through those 3 days. More, if you drive it to some fast charging access point in between to top it up for 10$. It&#x27;s perfect especially for remote setups. Add some solar panels to the mix and you are basically not dependent on the grid.')
