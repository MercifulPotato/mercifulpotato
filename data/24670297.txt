I didn&#x27;t like the default font for signature they offered, so I picked some other, script type of font. Everything was fine until I saved it. And suddenly, the signature switched to some completely different serif font.<p>The document wasn&#x27;t really that important to me, so I let it go like that, but doesn&#x27;t look like something I would trust currently.<p>EDIT: HelloSign people are obviously reading this. Instead of down-voting me, the proper approach would be to ask for details and fix your bugs. For example, I just tried another document on Windows and it worked properly. For the problematic one, I was using Firefox on macOS, so maybe you should look into that. I can also send you the document ID hash if you ask nice.')
