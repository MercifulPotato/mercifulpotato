In fact, it already is a protected class in CA. But that doesn&#x27;t matter, because parler doesn&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t claim to be republican, and wasn&#x27;t removed for hosting republican points of view.<p>The protected class argument doesn&#x27;t make sense until Mitch mcconnell and Mike pence are being deplatformed. And they aren&#x27;t, because this has nothing to do with political affiliation and never did. That&#x27;s just a mask the bad actors wear.')
