The only details you can know about the spotter is the following:<p><pre><code>    enum irsdk_CarLeftRight\n    {\n         irsdk_LROff,\n         irsdk_LRClear,   &#x2F;&#x2F; no cars around us.\n         irsdk_LRCarLeft,  &#x2F;&#x2F; there is a car to our left.\n         irsdk_LRCarRight,  &#x2F;&#x2F; there is a car to our right.\n         irsdk_LRCarLeftRight, &#x2F;&#x2F; there are cars on each side.\n         irsdk_LR2CarsLeft,  &#x2F;&#x2F; there are two cars to our left.\n         irsdk_LR2CarsRight  &#x2F;&#x2F; there are two cars to our right.\n    };\n</code></pre>\nAnd detailed positional data simply isn&#x27;t available through the live API either. The closest you get is how far along the track a car is, as a percentage of the total track length. I recall reading some time ago, though I don&#x27;t remember where, that this is a deliberate attempt to curb any form of cheating. Live access to information like ride height, tire pressure, and tire temperature is likewise not available.')
