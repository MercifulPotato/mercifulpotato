Especially since it seems both high-class and low-class people were involved. I have the impression many were disappointed in how much conversion to Islam helped their status; it&#x27;s not about what you claim to <i>believe</i> (like the christian&#x2F;muslim concept of religion), it seems like what matters is what everyone else <i>knows</i>.<p>There were indeed lots of kingdoms, a whole continent&#x27;s worth, but for the most part I didn&#x27;t think the political units much influenced the rules of these things, aside from sometimes incentivising conversion to islam. I don&#x27;t think there was anything like the european squabbles over who gets to be pope, or whether your country&#x27;s church follows him, because there&#x27;s no idea of centralised doctrinal command like that.')
