The full comment was three one line paragraphs: &quot;basically the same as nazis&quot;, &quot;nazis gave the jews free healthcare&quot;, and &quot;so&quot;, and it was in 2014.<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA or &quot;Obamacare&quot;) had started in 2010, and every election after that it became an issue. Some wanted to replace it with single payer systems, or expanded government run systems (e.g. Medicare for all). Others wanted to get rid of it completely, and not replace it with anything.<p>Those who want a more expansive or comprehensive system than ACA often cite the systems of other countries as potential models for the US. Those opposed to that point out what they perceive as flaws in those systems.<p>Wikipedia tells me that the Nazis did actually have a healthcare system [1].<p>I could see someone saying some particular system is a good approach for the US to take, and someone who disagrees seeing that it has some similarities to the aforementioned Nazi system, and so dismissing it as &quot;basically the same as nazis&quot;.<p>The rest of the comment would then be meant in a &quot;look how bad that turned out&quot; sense with the (ridiculous) implication that if the US gets free healthcare we too will end up committing large scale atrocities.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Socialist_People%27s_Welfare" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Socialist_People%27s_...</a>')
