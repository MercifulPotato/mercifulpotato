I can empathize with the readers of your previous story. I haven&#x27;t made peace and often when I see stories of people younger than me dying I reach in every direction for an explanation for why that wouldn&#x27;t happen to me. &quot;Oh they must have done a lot of drugs. They must have not exercised.&quot; etc.<p>What I think I want to know about from older individuals (like 80+): are you afraid of dying?  My grandma went last year (92) and her and I had long wonderful conversations knowing she was weeks out. She talked about how much of a wonderful life she had and that she was not in the slightest scared.<p>That&#x27;s a mental gap for me. I can&#x27;t grok the concept of not being afraid to death like that. I would love to learn that the overwhelming majority of older people don&#x27;t fear it, suggesting that it&#x27;s very likely I won&#x27;t fear it either if I make it to old age.<p>As for dying early... I think it&#x27;s best not to think about it any more than to build a sufficient motivation to live life well.')
