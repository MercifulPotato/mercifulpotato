We are developing a batch process that runs multiple stages over multiple hours on a huge cluster producing some kind of numerical results. We also can not deploy to production on a whim, due to regulation. It is impossible to test all developer changes on a full process.<p>So we put highest risk changes under feature flags&#x2F;configuration values. If certain things do not work as expected in testing - we disable them with configuration without creating a new build artifact. It is also a common occurrence that another team has to validate numerical results Coming from a certain feature for a while before it is enabled in production.')
