Its entitled &quot;learning from quibi&quot; but what did the author learn? I have no ides after reading it.<p>At most i think the author is saying a succesful company is based around finding something bad in the world, and doing it better, and that quibi thought they were doing that but were actually deluding themselves. Which sure, in retrospect is pretty obvious, but its hardly an insight to say that a business which failed because nobody thought their product was worth it, essentially had a bad product.')
