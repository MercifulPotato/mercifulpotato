The scale that Intel operates at means this product is going to be a drop in the bucket in terms of revenue which makes their enormous investments in dGPUs look a little silly. It fits in this really weird place where you want a little bit of extra GPU power for co-processing, but really <i>very</i> little extra power. I literally can&#x27;t understand how this product justified the engineering effort. Which leaves us with the fact that this must be a first release of something much more significant, which means that they&#x27;ve been forced to rush it out the door because their main effort is behind (well &#x27;technically&#x27; we did ship the first series of chips in this project in Q42020). However, if you watch what happens a lot in Intel - they release a compromised first version of something, that ties them to a concrete failure (this isn&#x27;t going to make any money) which then allows the executive team to can the project.')
