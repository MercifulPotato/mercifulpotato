I just keep my closet organized by type of item (pants together, button down shirts together, etc).  A stuff is worn&#x2F;laundered, they go to the left.  Stuff that rarely gets worn slowly moves to the right as worn items displace unworn.<p>Every few months, I look to the right and if I see things I never wore (and have no plans to wear), I donate them.  Obv I don&#x27;t do this with out of season items, but generally, work shirts are work shirts (if it&#x27;s cold, I add a cardigan or blazer).<p>Unlike the blog author, I don&#x27;t track underwear.  First, all my undershirts are the same - I&#x27;d have to label them to differentiate.  I tend to simply chuck them all in the &quot;rags&quot; bin once a year and replace en masse.  And underpants last for ages, so I don&#x27;t see the need to bother.<p>I should track shoes, just to see what happens.  They&#x27;re so specialized and seasonal, I haven&#x27;t bothered.  Chukkas for winter, loafers for 3 season wear, boat shoes for the worst of summer, etc.')
