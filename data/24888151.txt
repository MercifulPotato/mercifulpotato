I find it a weird measure, and certainly not one in which to base all trust, but it does seem to correlate reasonably with many outcomes. That other factors also have an influence on these outcomes, and that IQ is not purely measuring intelligence, does not discredit it as a (limited) predictor. Taleb&#x27;s article would be much stronger if he could point at better predictors.')
