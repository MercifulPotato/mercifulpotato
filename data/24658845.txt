I think there was 256 entries in  When the ship rotated it stepped through the rotation table by three entries at a time, and took advantage of the 8-bit accumulator wrapping around. Then the value was used as a look-up in a table. The ships direction was a value of 0x00 to 0xFF, and that was used as an index in to the rotation table. I would need to read through the disassembly again to refresh my memory.')
