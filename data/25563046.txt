Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=[25564482], score=None, time=1609188478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562611, text='&gt; Also, many poor people aren&#x27;t starting with $0... they are starting with negative money<p>This was addressed in my comment - although perhaps I added that portion in while you were typing yours.<p>&gt; You leave out having kids, and the childcare support that is needed if you can&#x27;t afford daycare.<p>Definitely. There are many subtopics in this thread and my intention was to focus on only one, which was the expense to move to a cheaper city. With children, it&#x27;s a lot more expensive, but to be frank, as per the original comment in this thread - you couldn&#x27;t afford to live on minimum wage with dependents even in the 90&#x27;s - that aspect has not changed and only gotten worse.<p>I was referring to a single person with no debt and a small amount of cash.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying <i>anyone</i> who is poor can get out of it easily (or even at all). I&#x27;m saying <i>some</i> definitely can. Nor am I saying there aren&#x27;t institutional problems that make it harder for people and easier to get into debt (predatory advertising and loans, for example - heck - the whole credit system). In many ways being poor in the US is worse than in many&#x2F;most developed countries. I acknowledge that.<p>But there&#x27;s a difference between a bad situation and an impossible one.<p>I merely want to push back on a sentiment I see often on HN and other places (and usually only by people earning good amounts of money) that it&#x27;s a bad idea or incredibly difficult to leave a coastal city to move to a cheap one and do better there than here. I see it time and again on these threads, and for me it&#x27;s a huge cognitive dissonance, as I&#x27;ve lived in both places, and have encountered several people in both places who made the move. It&#x27;s not easy, but as I said, the success cases far outnumber the failed ones.<p>The last set of people I know who moved from my city to a cheaper one were low income workers (cooks in a restaurant who were treated poorly). They had families with kids - some did not have a working spouse. They saw cheap houses in Ohio (under $100K) and immediately made the move. Granted, they&#x27;re now living in shitty neighborhoods (the only place you&#x27;ll find such houses), but they have positive cash flow. And now that they&#x27;re successful, their so called social support they had here is now considering making that move as well.<p>My scenario in my original comment was about getting a decent apartment. I&#x27;ve seen people come in to the cheaper city I lived in with not enough cash to make any kind of deposit. Yet most were still successful in the long run. The exceptions were people with some kind of chronic problem: Drugs, health issues, crime related issues, behavioral issues (can&#x27;t handle bosses) etc. They&#x27;d usually find some charity&#x2F;religious institution who would provide them a roof for a fixed period of time and in that time they&#x27;d find a job and then move out to a real apartment. Most of these cities will have places that will rent you a room for fairly cheap. Crappy neighborhood, etc.<p>The contrast is with staying in an expensive city where <i>no matter what they do they will not get positive cash flow</i>. Whatever your views on the topic, keep this one fact in mind: <i>The baseline we are comparing against is staying in a city with negative cash flow</i>.')
