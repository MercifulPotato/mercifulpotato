Normally, people aren&#x27;t going to go through the post history of someone who says &quot;look at these muffins I baked&quot;, and find they posted in an unsavory sub years ago. But with masstagger, anyone who posted in T_D got a big ol flare calling them out. But, the only reason <i>I</i> went there was to say &quot;hey, you guys are stupid racists&quot; to some posts. But the actual content of my posts weren&#x27;t discussed, merely the fact that I filthied myself by even going near that sub. For Matrix, it would be like someone going onto a firearms room to talk about increasing gun control laws in the US, but then that means that all of the sudden your global reputation includes &quot;firearms&quot;, and people on cooking topics will call you an asshole who supports murdering children, even if you are the most anti-firearms person in the world.')
