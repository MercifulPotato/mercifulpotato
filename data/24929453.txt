To me, SPAs blur the line between what&#x27;s happening locally and server-side, so my impatience with slow functions on an SPA page is much greater than the same thing happening on a SSR page. Maybe it&#x27;s just my conditioning to expect things on a single page to work much quicker as opposed to moving between pages.<p>IMO, well-designed SPAs should make use of the context-switching function of a complete page fetch in situations where the user might need to wait a relatively longer time for something to load instead of loading bars&#x2F;spinners.')
