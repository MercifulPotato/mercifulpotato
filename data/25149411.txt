A dedicated attacker can still overcome this, and once they do, they can impersonate you readily.<p>We need to lock people out of their own computers to protect them from social engineering?<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think most websites will bother, but those that care sure would love to be able to do so.<p>In practice, this will end up just like the abomination that is SafetyNet on Android, where if you take control of your own device, you can&#x27;t use Netflix, Snapchat, Pokemon Go, Super Mario Run, Android Pay, etc.<p>&gt; keeping their system in secure mode<p>Really? &quot;secure mode&quot;?
