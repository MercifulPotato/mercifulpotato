The whole thing is a lie.<p>As a former EE, I can categorically state that absolutely no bench I have ever seen is that tidy when debugging hardware. It&#x27;s usually a complete snake pit of cables, mess and hell. And half the equipment that they would actually need to support what they have out on display is not actually there. Also no one is going to sit on those god awful chairs while working.<p>And on top of that I guarantee that there are PCs in their real laboratories that do the CAD and debugging work. Zukon, SolidWorks, Catia and Altium don&#x27;t run on Macs.<p>PCs design Macs. Discuss :)<p>Edit: in retrospect I think it felt like a Scientologist recruitment video.')
