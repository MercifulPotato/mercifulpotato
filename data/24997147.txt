There are a lot of industrial&#x2F;logistics processes where by far the biggest energy usage is in heating&#x2F;cooling. In a recent refrigerated warehouse 40% of the electricity is coming from solar panels on the roof. Going higher than that is not economical because energy will be sold too cheap to the grid and batteries are still too expensive. But there are solutions starting to appear to store cold while the sun is out and then release it over the night as needed. If we can get a lot of these types of loads working like that switching the grid to solar can go even faster because of not having to wait for cheaper grid-scale storage.')
