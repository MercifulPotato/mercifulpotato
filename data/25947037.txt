These people have been especially vocal. Sometimes they include people who have kids, other times they include people who get their social interaction in at work. I think the office <i>should</i> accommodate them as well as remote workers.<p>The biggest challenge I&#x27;ve faced being on a remote team (read: not necessarily WFH) is that people who are at the primary physical location are acutely unaware of their remote colleagues. On VCS systems they&#x27;ll shout and have conversations with each other, they won&#x27;t focus conversations in chat or make equivalent channels for hallway conversations, and they&#x27;ll assign work to themselves first.<p>I&#x27;d like to have the option for remote work to be available to me in the future and if we&#x27;re going to do that then that means people who go into primary locations <i>must</i> learn to play ball with everyone.')
