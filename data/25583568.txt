Not knowing the overlap, 10-22k&#x2F;30k is 27-59% of deaths involving drunk driving or speeding.<p>If it was on the high end of that, then to do better than speeding and&#x2F;or drinking alone, you have to be at least 2.5x safer than human.<p>I wish there were better stats on the safety of the sort of driver you would let drive you around (e.g. you wouldn’t get in the car with your drunk friend behind the wheel).')
