While using the browser, you can&#x27;t close the extra window for the controller.<p>2) On the browser, you go to a localhost website that has an invalid TLS certificate (you can a &quot;Not Secure&quot; warning) and have to click through to the unsafe website (and it&#x27;s still like that in my current Unifi version).<p>3) The login page doesn&#x27;t let you use the Chrome password manager, so you have to type it all in each time to access a local program.<p>4) In the web UI, the icons are not intuitive, and some combination of circles and rounded rectangles.<p>5) The new UI makes it seem like you can configure things that can&#x27;t actually be configured outside your router.<p>6) Speaking of your router, Ubiquity&#x27;s own EdgeRouter routers aren&#x27;t supported in the Controller UI. They require a completely different interface.<p>In case anyone thinks the problem with the certificate is something to do with my own setup, it&#x27;s not.
