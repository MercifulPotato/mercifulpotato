Making less money and getting high ratings means they like the cost&#x2F;benefit ratio you give them. Your coworkers who make more but are less skilled probably get worse ratings, and probably will be out the door faster if the company struggles. You will likely join that group if you push for more money. That may still be the right move, but you should be aware of the broader context of such moves.')
