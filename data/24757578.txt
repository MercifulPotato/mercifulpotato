I don’t like the term “engineer.”  It doesn’t fit, and I hate that we have adopted it, I think mainly because it makes people  in the business side take programming more seriously.  Like we have to justify to people that our job is actually difficult and requires some level of skill.  It doesn’t convey the level of creativity, programmers use on a regular basis.')
