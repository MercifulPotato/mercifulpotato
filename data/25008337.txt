He handles that.<p>Maybe it’s different inside the EU compared to outside of it, but I have a few .es domains and I didn’t have to provide a scan of any ID to reg them, I did have to provide the ID’s number.<p>Now it might be that the ID number might be more easily queryable between EU states removing the need of a scan compared to counties, I’ve never looked into it. But it’s still a piece of information MM can just hold on to and handle when required for you.<p>I’m just sharing my own experiences with .es tlds, one thing I will say having a 3rd party like MM monitoring and handling your .es domains is they are now responsible for renewing them, if you miss the emails about your domain expiring because auto-renew failed due to an expired card and you fail to renew in time there is little to no grace time compared to other tlds. That one almost bit me on the arse once :-(')
