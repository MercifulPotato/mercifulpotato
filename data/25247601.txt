It&#x27;s not even going to cannibalize iPhone sales; the opposite if anything, although I&#x27;d imagine most people who are serious about shooting video on their phone have a 12 Pro in their pocket already.<p>But mostly, it would give an obvious upgrade path to get into cinema-quality and real lenses, for customers who cut their teeth on what the iPhone has to offer.<p>It&#x27;s a natural fit for Apple, although I think I understand why they haven&#x27;t: it&#x27;s hard for that company to get out of bed for less than a million units sold, of anything.')
