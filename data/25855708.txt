Item(by='CaliforniaKarl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611206196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25855242, text='Here are the experiences of three people I know, with pronouns changed to &quot;they&quot; so as to not reveal their preference.<p>Person #1 is an adjunct instructor in the midwest, and is struggling with the low # of courses and the # high of students in each course, in addition to the additional workload that comes from doing everything online.  Their income level is not as high in 2020 as before.  They are an artist, and so try to take time (and buy materials) for their art, as they need some form of release.<p>Person #2 lives on the west coast (not a good part of the west coast), works in retail, doesn&#x27;t have a car (in an area that requires one), and isn&#x27;t in the best living situation.  They have a full-time job they&#x27;re doing well in, but it&#x27;s not a high wage (it&#x27;s below $15&#x2F;hour, though more when they gets bonuses), so it&#x27;s difficult to save up.  They&#x27;re smart, but it&#x27;s difficult to maintain 150% motivation every. single. minute. of. the. day.<p>Person #3 lives in the midwest and is unemployed.  After being furloughed, they left the food service job they were in: they were transferred to a remote location, likely because they were asking about why health insurance hadn&#x27;t been resumed.  The next job they found was a job selling insurance to businesses, a job that only pays when you make a &quot;sale&quot;.  Until then, your wages are zero.  And it&#x27;s a workplace that doesn&#x27;t wear masks.  A license to sell insurance is required, but the workplace (who is supposed to facilitate that) didn&#x27;t lead them through the correct paperwork, so their ability to lean (and to sell) is limited.  They are actively looking for a new job, ideally something that matches their degree.<p>There are three examples of the latter, just from me.')
