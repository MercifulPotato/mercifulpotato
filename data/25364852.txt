In other words, there&#x27;s zero reason it should be a factor in the legal outcome.<p>At most, there would be an IP issue -- e.g. would the spun-out IG be <i>permitted</i> to have a stubbed FB backend, and vice-versa -- but that&#x27;s easily solved by providing those permissions as part of the separation agreement, with a timeline to remove them (e.g. 2 years).')
