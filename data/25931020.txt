One of the projects available to me was the Shell Eco Car marathon[0] challenge, where they sponsored teams and gave prizes to contest winners (I didn&#x27;t choose that as my project, sadly).<p>They&#x27;ve been active in green&#x2F;alternative energy research for decades and have made some huge bets on hydrogen. Sure, they&#x27;re in oil and gas which makes them somewhat inherently slimy, but as far as I can tell they&#x27;re the energy company making the best efforts to stop (or greatly reduce) their production and extraction of fossil fuels, and TFA only reinforces my opinion on that.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shell_Eco-marathon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shell_Eco-marathon</a>')
