Someone can search for health insurance if their company doesn&#x27;t provide it. The plans are expensive for most people and the deductibles are much higher than most employer plans.<p>The cost of supplies and services are not going to go down overnight if we decouple employers sponsored insurance.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think universal healthcare is the correct option or a viable one in the US. The existing government plans should be expanded to lower incomes (way above poverty line), self employed, and allow unemployed people to float until their next job. Also add a percentage of your salary structure similar to what wikipedia says about Swiss healthcare.<p>It would be nice to have the option to buy in to government plans if your employer doesn&#x27;t offer anything or you are retired. Everyone already pays into theses plan and a small increase combined with a % of salary structured buy in isn&#x27;t going to bankrupt people.<p>Swiss healthcare costs are more similar to the US than other countries. The private system is also similar to the US. I still think the expenses need to an overhaul. It&#x27;s way past time for the government to step in.')
