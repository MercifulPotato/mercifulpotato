In fact, I think the Oxford vaccine has 2 potential design issues, 1 of which is shared with all other vaccines.<p>The first issue is what you pointed out. Adenovirus delivery is potentially more risky. I&#x27;m incidentally also HLA-B27, and I will personally stay away from it.<p>The second issue, shared with all other vaccines, is that IMHO they should not have vaccinated us for the whole spike protein, but just for some fragment. The spike protein contains some mimotopes to confuse the immune system, and I&#x27;m worried that this might also be a source of autoimmunity in very rare cases. Naturally, because vaccines had to be rushed, this was not easy to account for.<p>Nonetheless, they all seem safe. Theoretically, mRNA ones might be safer, unless there&#x27;s gene transfer&#x2F;integration of mRNA into cells. But this is a very exotic issue unlikely to cause problems.')
