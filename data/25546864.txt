Now that I have gigabit fiber with unlimited data, and a WiFi 6 router, with less congestion, the quality of the streaming has been superb. I honestly can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m streaming. And the convenience of just starting immediately back into a game, no download or install, no updates, freedom to change screens at a whim, from PC, to TV to phone, to iPad, etc.<p>The only thing missing is for it to have much more content, and for some guarantee from Google that it won&#x27;t be killed off.<p>I tried other similar services, like GamePass and PSNow, but they don&#x27;t work as well, the streams are lower resolution, seem to have more artifact and the latencies are higher. So whatever Google is doin seems to be working, that said the game selection is so much better on PSNow and GamePass, and the option to install the games (which gives the best image quality and lowest latency), they still compete with Stadia.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m just hoping some more reliable company then Google comes up with a service that&#x27;s just as reliable, maybe Amazon Luna will be it, or GamePass streaming could get a lot better, or PSNow, but the one I&#x27;m most hoping for is for Valve to get onboard and offer a Steam streaming service.<p>Edit: I also wish they added RT support, I feel a cloud gaming service should offer best graphic settings at all time, since that&#x27;s one of the advantage I&#x27;m looking from it, paying monthly for hardware that gets kept up to date.')
