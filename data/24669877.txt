I watched &quot;The Social Dilemma&quot; with my fianc√©e last weekend, and she deleted hers after (time will tell if it&#x27;s permanent, I certainly hope so... she&#x27;s kept Instagram for the time being but I&#x27;m hoping to convince her to get rid of that as well).<p>I thought about writing a point-by-point rebuttable to this, about the obvious lies and wilful misdirection ...<p>But then I realized that I just don&#x27;t care anymore. I love being free of this company and I <i>almost</i> got sucked back in to writing  flame war comments about [thing that gets more attention].<p>Folks, just give this company up. You&#x27;ll be much happier, I promise.')
