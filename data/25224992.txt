I&#x27;m not sure how accurately non-covid deaths were tracked to compare against deaths currently attributed to covid given that flu&#x2F;pneumonia, cancers, heart disease can all be risks to the same elderly patient. I&#x27;m also interested in the number of deaths reduced from changing in behavior like eating out less, driving less, and any other lifestyle changes that has happened due to lockdowns and quarantining.<p>All in all, I think that the main takeaway from this article is that covid affects those who have other health concerns, and that with our lifestyle changes, we are lucky to be breaking even, as catastrophic as this pandemic is.')
