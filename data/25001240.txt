Very, very good lawyers are quite affordable at that point. It&#x27;s hard to imagine someone with $1B in drug money, for example, just handing it over to the feds.<p>A very quick search for &quot;largest cash seizures&quot; shows a couple in the $200-300M range. In both cases, the authorities found and seized the physical cash. I don&#x27;t see any precedent for someone handing it over.<p>I wonder what made this situation so different. Is it the illiquidity of Bitcoin at that scale? Or did Hacker X just not retain a lawyer&#x2F;know what to do?')
