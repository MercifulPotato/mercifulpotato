Sure I look for a big bull but I have no idea if the one I took was a &quot;stronger&quot; or &quot;weaker&quot; one. Half the time im just happy to find one. Im sure wolves also go for young bulls or even cows. I also think you are grossly over estimating between the difference between the stronger and weaker bulls in a herd.')
