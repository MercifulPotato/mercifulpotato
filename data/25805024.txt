If they decide to use different backoff strategies for different classes if errors, that&#x27;d be great. But it&#x27;s an easy mistake to make, and a very hard one to catch in testing. Sure if they wrote the code better (or been less &quot;lazy&quot;) this wouldn&#x27;t have happened, but that type of feedback isn&#x27;t constructive imo. This wasn&#x27;t a conscious decision that was made, it was written this way by default because of some combination of their team&#x2F;framework&#x2F;api client&#x2F;testing&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;etc. Talking about why those led to this is much more interesting I think.')
