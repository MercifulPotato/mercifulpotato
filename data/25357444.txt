Item(by='emilburzo', descendants=None, kids=[25360675], score=None, time=1607512445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357111, text='Hey, since I removed all tracking from the app I&#x27;ve felt a bit blind if people are happy with it or more like just drive-by trying-it-once, so it always makes my day to hear genuine feedback (even more so when it&#x27;s positive), thank you for that!<p>&gt; I only realised the other day that the tracking link didn&#x27;t automatically change between activations (I now realise I can do it manually).<p>Hmm, good point. I wouldn&#x27;t automatically reset it for each session since there are people using it for multi-day stuff.<p>Would having a &quot;link last reset at&quot; timestamp in the main screen would have helped you realize that earlier?<p>&gt; When meeting up with someone in the middle of nowhere recently, I noticed that it&#x27;d show their location on the map, but not mine. As I didn&#x27;t know where I was, having a blue dot of my location so I can estimate their distance would be really handy.<p>Initially I thought that might be sketchy -- &quot;why does it want to know MY location? I just want to watch&quot; -- but perhaps making it a button&#x2F;setting would be a good compromise? So something like a toggle for &quot;show my location&quot; on the webpage?<p>&gt; When you&#x27;re all about an hours drive away in different directions it&#x27;s really handy to keep track on people&#x27;s progress without disturbing their driving.<p>This is perfect because I&#x27;ve been trying to build a feature where you can combine multiple tracking links into one, and you see everybody on the same map. Where I always get stuck though is the UX.<p>On a computer it&#x27;s pretty easy to have a page where you paste all the links and it generates a combined one, but I can&#x27;t figure out a good UI&#x2F;UX for doing this on mobile.<p>So if I can pick your brain for a bit... do you have any insights here?<p>How do you usually send&#x2F;receive these links?<p>Would pasting them all on a page work for you on mobile?<p>Any better ideas?')
