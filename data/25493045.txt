That&#x27;s not true. But it was not very known at the days. I guess only Linux changed that, using it as default shell in many distros.<p>tcsh had the reputation of being more usable than Bourne shell. (The quirks related to programming meant the cautious people used it only interactively.) So Bourne again did never sound like good marketing to me. It took me years to try it even after the years I had not even heard about it.')
