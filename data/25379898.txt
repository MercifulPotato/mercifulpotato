This was well into the streaming era, but we still received box loads of CDs every day, from all over the world.<p>Some of these packages were exquisite. Some were terrible. Some came with elaborate gifts. What they all had in common was that none of them got heard. They piled up in the corner of the office and every week the area would get cleared out.<p>Myself and some of the other developers called it &quot;the corner where dreams went to die&quot;.</i><p>To me, that is really emotive. If your dialogue with HN users in any way helps you to address that sad problem (by way of optimisation of pricing&#x2F;functionality&#x2F;whatever) on behalf of those with whom you seem to empathise&#x2F;resonate then that will be a happy outcome.<p>Good luck and best wishes.')
