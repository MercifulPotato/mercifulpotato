There is definitely no money to be made for a start-up in this space, it is way too conservative. Maybe the hobbyist intellectual challenge of working on some hard problems like constraint solving or formal property proving? There is a massive task of writing a SystemVerilog parser before you get there though and the SAT solving and property proving problems are present elsewhere with lowers barriers to entry.')
