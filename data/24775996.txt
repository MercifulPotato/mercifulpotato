Sigh.<p>One can be paraphrased as &quot;because the vendor code that reads the trackpad reliably and accurately sucks, and of course Linus won&#x27;t merge sucky code&quot;. Uh. If that&#x27;s so then I&#x27;d love to know how those hardware vendors get good results year after year, because IME sucky code is (equals!) unmaintainable code, and writing from scratch every time is not a good way to ship often.')
