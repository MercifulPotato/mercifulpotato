Item(by='Mindwipe', descendants=None, kids=[25851577], score=None, time=1611174434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25851359, text='&gt; Given that this request was completely fraudulent, no matter your take on whether youtube-dl itself is legal the project itself is not an unauthorized post of copyright material, doesn&#x27;t this give groups like the RIAA a free pass to do whatever they want until someone challenges them?<p>The takedown request didn&#x27;t claim the project was an unauthorised post of copyright material. It claimed it was a DRM circumvention measure, and US law is sufficiently vague on that matter it really can&#x27;t be said definitively one way or another if that&#x27;s correct unless someone is willing to litigate it.<p>Nobody does, in this case. Certainly, describing the request as &quot;completely fraudulent&quot; is wrong. It may or may not have been valid, but the legislation is sufficiently vague in most of the US and Europe that it&#x27;s entirely possible this could go to court and the RIAA would win.')
