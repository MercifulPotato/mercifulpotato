Though it&#x27;s about the same story, just with slightly lower sales for Nintendo.<p>Or, for that matter, the same basic story as the prior generation as a whole: PS1 sold about 100 million, N64 33 million, Saturn 9 million. The Saturn got undercut by the Dreamcast but both were clear also-rans while Sony just ran away with the market.<p>Thinking about Sega kind of straddling the generations also just drives home how many moves in a row for them just didn&#x27;t work: the 32X, the Sega CD, the Saturn, the Dreamcast.')
