I&#x27;m sure some percentage of people are developing similar symptoms as a non-viral consequence of lockdown. However, for me, my lifestyle didn&#x27;t really change and I don&#x27;t mind lockdown at all. I got sick quickly one day in mid-March, mostly recovered after a couple days, and then just never got all the way better. The only physical symptom I have to show for it are much larger dark circles then normal under my eyes. I can exercise hard and everything works, but I pay for it later with a week of worse fatigue afterwards. I can say with certainty my symptoms are related to whatever virus I came down with in March. One of many anecdotes for you.')
