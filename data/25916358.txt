How does that impact the effects of fake news?<p>Case in point, NYT effectively reframed The 1619 Project well after it was published, after they ignored a significant number of criticisms from some of the best historians, and after winning a Pulitzer Prize.<p>I&#x27;m going to guess that most people are completely unaware that they eventually acknowledged that it was fake news.<p>I ask because I don&#x27;t see social media posts about the project labeled as &quot;disinformation&quot;. Is that because it&#x27;s self-acknowledged at this point, despite already establishing itself as &quot;real&quot;? Is that because the fact-checkers are unaware of the updates?<p>I&#x27;m very curious how a more complicated scenario such as this affects people&#x27;s understanding of the fitness of a piece of work.<p>Any insights or studies that I&#x27;ve missed?')
