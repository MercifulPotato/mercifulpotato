From where I&#x27;m standing: one side believes that our society is fraught with invisible power structures which reinforce inequity, and our highest duty is to dismantle those structures through any means necessary. The other side is skeptical of the extent of these power structures, and believes that freedom of speech is the higher ideal.<p>Each belief is to some extent unfalsifiable. There&#x27;s no scientific or first-principles reasoning that tells us which value should take precedence in a given situation.<p>The actual nonbelievers are the ones who have no interest in the war, and will go along with whichever position their social circles deem acceptable.')
