I&#x27;m working on a hobby &#x2F; side project involving hacking together a basic <i>imaged base</i> golf launch monitor.  A launch monitor is a sensor that can track the launch trajectory (and possibly spin) of a struck golf ball.<p>I&#x27;d like to see what kind of results could be obtained for a budget of ~$2000 USD.  Commercial imaged base products on the market are between $6k - $20k.  I&#x27;m software engineer by trade for about 15 years, so I feel comfortably working across most levels of the stack, though I&#x27;m probably least familiar with embedded work.<p>Main Question:<p>Does anyone have camera &#x2F; cmos sensor to recommend that would provide the following?<p>1. Ability to transfer (over wire) or write to disk images <i>near</i> 1000 fps<p>2. Out of the box driver &#x2F; connectivity so that I can focus mostly on the image processing &#x2F; detection side of things as opposed to dealing with the raw data transfer &#x2F; buffers &#x2F; devices etc.<p>I&#x27;m very thankful in advance for any discussion &#x2F; help &#x2F; commentary that your help and this thread will spawn.')
