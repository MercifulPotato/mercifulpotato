The build in shows the next instructions within the cockpit &amp; HUD.<p>It has no access to the wheels, and in tunnels the GPS will simply not work where as the build in sort of does.<p>The build in depends way less on healthy Internet access (yes there are parts of Europe that I drive though with cripple G2 at best).<p>Mind you, I SWEAR by Google maps for driving (in Europe) since it is so current and predicts &#x2F; reroutes better then anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>Paying major money for updates of the build in also is a real pain.')
