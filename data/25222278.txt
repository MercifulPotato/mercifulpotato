I bought a new Audi A6, it&#x27;s a quite massive 3.0 diesel (210kW &#x2F; 282 hp), I was actually surprised it&#x27;s a hybrid when I went to register it and pay the &quot;tax&quot; - I got 50% off because it&#x27;s a hybrid. I had to actually look it up on Google. It turns out most new Audi cars are MHEV, which is basically only used when the car is &quot;coasting&quot;, the motor is decoupled from the rest and if you don&#x27;t disable Start-Stop then it will also be turned off. Now in this special circumstance there is an additional battery + small electric motor that will only help to start the engine again. That&#x27;s it. The motor doesn&#x27;t really pull the vehicle. It does save some fuel especially on the highway, but not in the city. Audi mentions up to 0.7 liters &#x2F; 100 kilometers for Audi Q8. I see it mainly as a benefit for the driver, in most EU countries you pay a lot money for bigger (more kW) cars.')
