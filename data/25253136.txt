It&#x27;s important to separate the natural phenomenon of language, which has been going on for perhaps 100000 years or so, from the general understanding of the term.<p>In the general sense language indeed has to be standardized, because that&#x27;s what is needed to have a functional nation-state that has (ideally) high internal homogeneity. Nation states are however a modern and artificial construct. If you go back a few thousand years (or even a few hundred in some places) you will see much more of a continuous distribution of languages [1]. Even today you can see traces of this in, for example, the Western Romance languages [2].<p>Again, in the natural sense of the word, there isn&#x27;t even a clear separation between languages. It&#x27;s all a continuum of different ways of speaking that flow into each-other.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dialect_continuum" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dialect_continuum</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Romance_languages#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Romance_languages.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Romance_languages#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:...</a>')
