That&#x27;s pretty good.<p>I&#x27;m an ex-omnifocus user. Omnifocus has lots of bells that make you feel productive, but ultimately I now use Things 3 as it is better designed and also gives me more confidence that things don&#x27;t get missed (i.e. things can get hidden in a perspective in omnifocus if you aren&#x27;t careful).<p>I suspect this is why Omnifocus&#x27;s latest apps are actually reviewed quite poorly on iOS - 3.8&#x2F;5 compared to Things 3 at 4.8&#x2F;5')
