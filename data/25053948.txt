However they were much less likely to believe any of it with 63% of Democrats labeled it somewhat or completely inaccurate while only 24% of Republicans did.<p>This also seems to be another strike against the idea of &quot;shy Trump voters&quot; because I think there is a bigger social stigma against QAnon than Trump.  Although I guess maybe the Republicans who are saying they aren&#x27;t aware of or have no opinion of QAnon could be &quot;shy QAnon believers&quot;.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morningconsult.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;social-media-qanon-poll&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morningconsult.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;social-media-qanon-pol...</a>')
