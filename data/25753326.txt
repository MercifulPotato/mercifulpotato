Another ongoing pain with Thunderbird is the inability to switch between HTML and plaintext when composing a message. Outlook lets you do this, in Thunderbird you have to copy the message, discard it, start a new one in the right mode and paste.<p>On the other hand, yes, Outlook Web Access is hilariously bad. It&#x27;s hard to understand how Microsoft flubbed it so bad considering that their consumer outlook.com has a radically better webmail. Different teams, obviously, but you&#x27;d think they would have shared notes.<p>All in all, it feels a lot to me like Microsoft had a really good MUA in 2003 and hasn&#x27;t done much with it since, while Mozilla had a not-quite-done-yet MUA in 2003 and hasn&#x27;t done much with it since. Both feel bolted together out of spare parts but in a way that&#x27;s subjectively a bit different.')
