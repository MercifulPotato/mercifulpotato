The $20 dollar one is on a custom board that interfaces with adafruits existing kits (Raspberry pi or &quot;StemmaQT interfaces).  They even supply &quot;Circuit python&quot; libraries to drive the thing, which is a their value add.<p>If you were mass manufacturing a screen for your custom board you&#x27;d order the part direct, but for a quick hobby project screen its not completely crazy.<p>Having worked for a company that had custom electronics hardware built with components, certainly we ordered direct from Chinese suppliers, it was much cheaper  (with the associated lead times).')
