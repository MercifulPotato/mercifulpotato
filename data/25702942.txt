Broadly speaking, the general American and Canadian accents omit the &#x2F;j&#x2F;, and the rest of the world includes it. But a particularly fun fact is that certain singing styles can alter adopted accent also: the classical singing style uses the &#x2F;j&#x2F;, so that even Americans who would say “noo” will sign “nyew” when operating in the classical&#x2F;opera style.')
