But I have given few presentations in my career to somewhere around 5 to 50 people. And I am not that good at general communication and presentation.<p>I have lot of ideas that pop-up in my head. I want to do a startup with one of these ideas. I try to implement them and then realise that I lack three other very important skill-sets that a startup founder requires: marketing, sales and finance(at least in the initial stages of the startup). It is not important to just build things. One should be able to market it, sell it and manage the finances. Finance I will be able to manage, but marketing and sales requires going out(or even online) and talking to people, negotiating etc. These are the skills that I lack to some extent.<p>So here is what I was thinking. I should take an entry-level job at an organisation that requires talking to people on a regular basis. And recently I stumbled across an entry-level job that requires talking to people(from various companies, labs and R&amp;D divisions) across the world and collecting information from them and then presenting it to internal and external stakeholders for business viability.<p>If I take this job, my whole career trajectory will change. Also, as this job is entry level the salary is very low(more than 50% pay cut).<p>I am thinking of going for it(I have not yet applied). But what do you think, does this strategy make sense?')
