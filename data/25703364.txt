Item(by='demifiend', descendants=None, kids=[25704051], score=None, time=1610218842, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703131, text='&gt; The question is how do we go back to the old more free internet, or if anything how do we free ourselves from the yolk of the likes of Zuckerberg?<p>I&#x27;m already free from Zuckerberg, Dorsey, and their coterie of techbros nostalgic for the dominance of AOL over the internet ordinary people used. I have my own website, that I built myself on a domain I&#x27;ve registered, and my own email at my own domain. It&#x27;s my HN username dot org, if you care.<p>The free internet is still here. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from building your own website, registering a domain, and renting a VPS to host it. Nor is there anything to stop you from rejecting GMail and Outlook for personal email and going with a provider that will let you use your domain. There&#x27;s nothing stopping you from using RSS feeds to keep up with other people&#x27;s blogs, or just bookmarking your favorites and visiting people&#x27;s website&#x27;s periodically.<p>All of the old tech is still here, waiting to be used. The only thing stopping you from taking advantage is you.<p>After all, Alex Jones still has infowars dot com. stormfront dot org is still online, offering a safe space for fascists. There&#x27;s nothing stopping 45 from giving his kid a couple hundred a week in exchange for registering a domain and firing up a blog where he can say whatever he likes and nobody has to listen if the don&#x27;t want to.<p>The problem is that the free&#x2F;open internet isn&#x27;t &quot;good enough&quot; for people who aren&#x27;t content with free speech but think they&#x27;re entitled to an audience. That&#x27;s why the culture war has consumed social media. Right-wingers think they&#x27;re entitled to an audience, and left-wingers think they have the right to set themselves as arbiters of who deserves to have their message distributed.<p>What neither side can agree on is that EVERYBODY has the right to speak and NOBODY is entitled to an audience. They don&#x27;t understand that an individual&#x27;s right to speak ends where everybody else&#x27;s right to ignore him begins.')
