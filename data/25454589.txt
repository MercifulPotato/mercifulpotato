People can go through their entire lives not realizing they&#x27;ve been stereoblind. The world seems as real to them as to anybody else. It&#x27;s not obvious to me VR is such a huge game changer.<p>Suppose we had 2 computer games.<p>One that perfectly reproduced real world &quot;graphics&quot; and &quot;gameplay&quot;, looks like a real life high resolution video. Everything is life-like but you use fairly standard controls and a regular display.<p>Second that comes with perfect VR integration including physical resistance somehow, unlimited running space, ability to taste foods and whatnot. But the mechanics and graphics would still be off (current-gen).<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear to me #1 would be way more immersive and the bottleneck is game&#x2F;simulation tech, not VR tech.')
