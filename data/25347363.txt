Many purchasers will try these out in a store and be amazed by the incredible sound.  Probably most will have never heard headphone sound of that quality.  They will plunk down their card and bring them home.  They will then enjoy an entirely new experience with all their favorite music and more.  Given Apple&#x27;s history of very high customer satisfaction numbers, most of these customers will have a positive, enjoyable experience and be happy with their purchase.<p>Could they have had a great listening experience with a more established audio name?  Sure, but so what.  Those companies failed to reach these customers.  Apple will sell them a new listening experience (for them) and they will love it.  If they don&#x27;t love it, they will return the product.  That&#x27;s how it works.  No good or evil, just products and customers.
