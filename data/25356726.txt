No idea Python was THAT popular for Emacs users. I primarily use C# with Emacs and if I just use it as a text editor then it&#x27;s fine, but doing an entire C# project in Emacs imo is straight up impossible. I still have to use Visual Studio for project management, adding NuGet packages, unit tests, builds, SVN for work (I just use Magit for my own stuff), and whatever Microsoft-made BS that comes up (had a JSON parsing error yesterday, tried to fix it for 20 minutes without success, blindly ran the project again and now it&#x27;s magically fixed). I can see why C# is at the bottom of the Emacs usage list.')
