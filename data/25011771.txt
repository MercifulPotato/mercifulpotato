(X475DN?)  It was amazing!  No warm up, 1-2 sec. first page out, fast printing, low energy use.  But if you didn&#x27;t use all the colors on the whole page width at some point, it they would start to clog.  Eventually it only printed black reliably, and all the other colors were clogged and useless.  Then, like seemingly all modern HP printers, it developed a weird software or controller problem and had to be replaced.<p>Switched to a lexmark color laser which prints very well, doesn&#x27;t produce a first page very quickly, but then it started having BSODs.<p>Replaced with monochrome laser printers (Samsung) and that has gone pretty well.  I&#x27;m still nervous about HP being involved, but it seems to be Samsung&#x27;s show with HP just doing the fulfillment.<p>Edit: just noticed that the HP Laserjet 4+ was introduced at $1,839 in 1994; about $3,230 today.')
