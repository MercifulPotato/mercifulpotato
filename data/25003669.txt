The only way it&#x27;d work is if they all worked together. And you&#x27;d have to do that for a couple counting stations in many given polling stations... That sounds like an inside job you couldn&#x27;t keep secret for long.<p>Because one thing I forgot to mention: counting is done at the polling station, it&#x27;s not centralized, only results are.')
