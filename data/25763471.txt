I&#x27;m still a user -- the price is still a couple of notches below marginal utility. But I no longer recommend it.<p>Something similar happened to Evernote -- I stopped liking the brand when I started to feel price-gouged. And then I quit on them shortly after when the apps were not snappy and well-organized to my liking (at the price they were charging me). I was a bit of an Evernote evangelizer too.<p>For a while I was storing <i>fiches de police</i> (what&#x27;s the name for that in American? Light cardstock with lines?) in shoe boxes, but I ran out of shoeboxes. I&#x27;ve begun using cans from canned peaches and pineapples.')
