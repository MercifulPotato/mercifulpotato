Item(by='grayrest', descendants=None, kids=[25482663], score=None, time=1608405245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25477879, text='I&#x27;ve spent a good amount of time this last year playing around with WASM options in anticipation of it being a major runtime environment for cloud computing.<p>Rust has the most developed ecosystem but the best experience I&#x27;ve had otherwise was with Zig. It&#x27;s reasonably easy to write and can produce excellent final wasm size. The only problem is that the compiler is currently exporting every public symbol in the standard library but when I hacked up the compiler to only export a hard coded list of symbols I got ~150 bytes for add (the WASM hello world) and easily sub 1k for the type of modules the post is discussing.')
