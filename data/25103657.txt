It can be great for quick prototyping and checking out new services where you don&#x27;t know yet what to expect. An absolute no-go however is that the management console sometimes uses functionality which isn&#x27;t available as an official API! One of the most prominent examples for that is probably that the management console does support U2F tokens, while the official API doesn&#x27;t [1].<p>CloudFormation lagging behind in terms of features is mainly a matter of priorities and I agree, feature parity from day 1 on would be great. However the way they do it allows them to ship features more quickly, so that&#x27;s something as well.<p>In the past CloudFormation support was even worse as the CloudFormation team was responsible for implementing the support for new features of all services in CloudFormation. And with an ever growing list of services and features, that was something which simply didn&#x27;t scale. From my understanding that changed however, so that most service teams are now responsible for CloudFormation support of their service themselves.<p>&gt; One of the other problems with AWS+CF though is that it doesn&#x27;t support every option from every service, e.g. populating secrets was a hassle when I used it.<p>That&#x27;s because creating a secret in AWS Secrets Manager is not a control plane operation (which is what CloudFormation usually implements), but a data plane operation (which CloudFormation usually doesn&#x27;t implement). However in this particular case it has been apparently painful enough, as creating secrets can be necessary to be able to deploy other resources (e.g. for authentication to the Aurora Data API), that AWS implemented this data plane operation in CloudFormation [2]. The same is true for creating parameters in the SSM Parameter Store [3], while it&#x27;s still not possible to create objects in S3 or items in DynamoDB without custom CloudFormation resources.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;aws-cli&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3607" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;aws-cli&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3607</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AWSCloudFormation&#x2F;latest&#x2F;UserGuide&#x2F;aws-resource-secretsmanager-secret.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AWSCloudFormation&#x2F;latest&#x2F;UserGui...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AWSCloudFormation&#x2F;latest&#x2F;UserGuide&#x2F;aws-resource-ssm-parameter.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AWSCloudFormation&#x2F;latest&#x2F;UserGui...</a>')
