Mail-in voting is more convenient which would likely increase participation, but missing signatures, naked ballots, late or undelivered mail, etc can prevent those ballots from being counted.<p>When there is a major difference in voting patterns between the two political parties, then polls may not actually be inaccurate. In this case, Democrats chose mail-in voting and Republicans, by and large, chose in-person after being directed by the president.<p>Also, some percentage of mail-in ballots may not have reached their destination because of possible election interference through reduced post office efficiency--in particular, fewer mail sorting machines, lower hours, deprioritized mails, etc.<p>In short, the polls don&#x27;t take into account election interference in the post office or unsuccessful delivery. If most people from both parties were voting in-person, maybe we might have had more parity between the polls and election results.')
