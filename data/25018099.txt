Mail-in voting is more convenient which would likely increase participation, but missing signatures, naked ballots, late or undelivered mail, election interference, etc can prevent those ballots from being counted.<p>When there is a major difference in voting patterns between the two political parties, then polls may not actually be inaccurate. Some percentage of mail-in ballots may not have reached their destination because of election interference through the post office.<p>In short, the polls don&#x27;t take into account election interference in the post office or unsuccessful delivery. If most people from both parties were voting in-person, maybe we might have had more parity between the polls and election results.')
