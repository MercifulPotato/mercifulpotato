I was stubborn and thought &quot;Why would I be an intern? I was managing two teams at my last job&quot;, but didn&#x27;t realize that FAANG interns actually made equal or more money than I did, and an entry level FAANG offer was much higher than the role I had accepted. I just didn&#x27;t know, and I had nobody helping me.<p>So, here I am, mid-30s, making less than my peers at a trading company for the same work because I didn&#x27;t come from FAANG. This is actually a big reason I&#x27;m ready to quit tech. It just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. A little over a year ago, I was hiring someone, and the internal recruiter slipped up on a phone call with me while talking about putting together an offer. They mentioned what an indirect report of mine made as a comparison. His base was more than my total comp. After that, I pretty much checked out for a year and did the bare minimum.<p>At this point, the only way for me to increase my comp is to move companies, likely to FAANG, and from what I hear, I&#x27;ll be &#x27;down-leveled&#x27; coming from outside of FAANG, and in a similar position I&#x27;m in now. At most non-FAANG companies, my next comp package will be driven off of my current one, so I&#x27;m pretty boned. It feels like the only option is to get competing offers from multiple top-tier companies, which I just don&#x27;t have time for. My day job is already super draining, so I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll have time to prep for interviews to the level that will get me those multiple offers.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of text to say I&#x27;m underpaid, and have been for most of my career because I didn&#x27;t know what I should be getting paid.')
