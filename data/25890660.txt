I really appreciate it.<p>The current search box is a wrapper around Postgres phraseto_tsquery [1] whilst the Discovery tab uses plainto_tsquery, so you could play with either as an ersatz for some of these features for now, although special characters might get stripped or parsed incorrectly.<p>Do you know where the people you are talking about hang out online (for example, subreddits)? I&#x27;d love to get in touch with them once the features are built and for more general feedback.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;12&#x2F;textsearch-controls.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;12&#x2F;textsearch-controls.html</a>')
