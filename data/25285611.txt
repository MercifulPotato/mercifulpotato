Since you’re trying to bleed off all of your delta-v in one pass, your margin for error is much lower due to the high energies involved. Aerobraking is much less risky but way slower, taking months to decelerate and so much less feasible with human passengers.<p>For landing on earth you only need aerobraking and parachutes. For the moon all you need are the retro rockets (we’ve already done it). To send humans to Mars you need retro rockets, a heat shield, and a parachute. The combination of systems makes the whole procedure a lot more complicated and error prone, increasing risk.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sicsa.egr.uh.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;sicsa&#x2F;files&#x2F;files&#x2F;projects&#x2F;deceleraters.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sicsa.egr.uh.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;sicsa&#x2F;files&#x2F;files&#x2F;projects&#x2F;dec...</a>')
