I know there are some similar applications in that area, However, I thought I could make some things a bit simpler from  UX perspective and draw some attention to it.\nI&#x27;m looking for some helpful criticism &amp; feedback for my application and my store listing?\nWhat could make you choose some flashcard application over anki and some familiar names?\n Are there any features you wish were in anki?<p>Thanks')
