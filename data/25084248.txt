At least according to Leibniz.<p>&gt; Ever watch an ad that manipulated you?<p>I think the question comes down to this, as opposed to what you wrote. The problem is not when you know you are being manipulated, but when you don&#x27;t. It would be naive to think you&#x27;re above this, considering that ads <i>do</i> work, considering that they&#x27;ve been a worthwhile tool for companies for hundreds of years and have been the basis for trillion dollar companies that exist today. It certainty warrants questioning if you have gained or loss freedom with this system in place. This clearly limits your choice or maybe more accurately heavily influences the weights on the decision set. I believe Leibniz would consider this a reduction of freedom (as do I).')
