Or do you honestly expect that your iTunes &quot;purchases&quot; will still be viewable in 5 years? I don&#x27;t.<p>And yes, while $30 is expensive in comparison to other companies&#x27; rental prices, I remember that many new movies (e.g. Deadpool 2) are at first only available for sale on iTunes and only later do they add rental options. Plus, for movie fanatics - who tend to be main buyers in the first 1-2 weeks, Disney is not competing with online rentals, they are competing with 4K Blu-Ray.<p>So if they can provide an experience that lets me watch a movie at 4K with HDR and a decent bitrate on my offline TV, I&#x27;m in at $30.<p>I feel like Tenet is seriously screwing up here. I&#x27;d love to see the film and I&#x27;m OK with paying $30 for the whole family. But Cinemas are closed, there are no streaming options, and they don&#x27;t even have a Blu-Ray release date yet.<p>With that in mind, I&#x27;m not surprised that some of my friends have opted to watch a low-quality illegal cam recording of it, instead of waiting 5+ months. Warner Brothers could have monetized that impatience, but they screwed up. Let&#x27;s hope Disney will do better by offering paid legal downloads on day 1, even if it&#x27;s as expensive as cinema used to be.<p>And if you don&#x27;t believe that impatient movie fanatics are a market, consider this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cinemablend.com&#x2F;new&#x2F;New-System-Allows-You-To-Stream-First-Run-Movies-In-Your-Home-for-20-000-22106.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cinemablend.com&#x2F;new&#x2F;New-System-Allows-You-To-Str...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;sciencetech&#x2F;article-3464839&#x2F;The-35k-Netflix-billionaires-box-shows-films-come-cinema-500-time-rumoured-Kim-Kayne-one-new-home.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;sciencetech&#x2F;article-3464839&#x2F;The-...</a>')
