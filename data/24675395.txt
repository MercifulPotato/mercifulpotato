So that means most of the countries that would be involved in that are out, that includes China, Russia, India, US, Europe, 5-eyes. That leaves most of Africa as a possibility,except that most countries there have internal strife. Most of central Asia and Middle-East also have internal and external strife.<p>Some non-aligned countries in South-East Asia are comfortably advanced and relatively strife-free: Malaysia, Indonesia. Some South (not North) Pacific countries are also possibilities, some South American countries are possibilities. The problem with all of these is that they are too small and powerless to be secure in a global conflict.<p>The most isolated country is New Zealand. It is advanced. It is not wracked by internal strife. It&#x27;s main problem is that, being one of the 5 eyes, it will almost certainly be drawn into a global conflict. On the other hand, it is possibly sufficiently isolated to escape most of the conflict. Then again, it is very powerless and could easily be over-run by a dedicated task-force while its more powerful friends are kept busy elsewhere. (Think of what happened to Holland in WW2.)<p>As I said earlier, no country in the world meets my criteria at present.')
