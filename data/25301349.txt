Item(by='nemo44x', descendants=None, kids=[25301684], score=None, time=1607083005, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25299176, text='The author goes out of their way to suggest fans of GoT are uninformed&#x2F;gullible by believing the story is their best source of medieval culture (its fiction - who thinks there is any historic reality? There’s dragons and magic in it.) and that critique of their critique is childish (the grownups can read on....) - not a great way to start. I mean, is it reasonable to assume anyone who thinks GoT is in any way based in historic reality is even going to read the blog?<p>Then the blog goes into wild assumptions about the fictional lands climate and assumes the land the Dothraki roamed should somehow be similar in climate to Kings Landing and uses this to critique not only their clothing but the broader Freman myth that the ideal tough man can withstand harsh conditions like cold while being scantly clad in leather. Again, we know next to nothing about the climate they lived in or the planet they are on if it is even a planet like ours.  Because it’s fantasy fiction. We can only assume the Dothraki know what clothing is best for them.<p>The article continues with the same pattern - assume people are misinformed and that they think GoT is based on historic realities and that GoT is responsible for continuing to push these false stereotypes.<p>So if the point here is that GoT is not anywhere near historically accurate then to that I say: it’s fantasy. It has dragons and magic. It’s not based in our reality or history even if inspired by it. They don’t even respect our physics in the way they make swords (the fires they make could never be hot enough to cast with) so how can we assume nearly anything else?<p>Yes, Martin claimed the Dothraki were based on his understanding of certain historic cultures and sure maybe his understanding is uninformed. But we don’t know specifically which parts informed his creation of the Dothraki and it’s a bit silly to pick the things you want to assume and pick that assumption apart.')
