My &#x2F;usr isn&#x27;t required for any of my customers&#x27; projects to run, and it probably shouldn&#x27;t be - I have environments and VMs and containers for all that stuff.<p>But this is an SBC. It&#x27;s likely to be configured to run its specific task forever.  It should automatically log into the default user&#x27;s account, and automatically start whatever software you want it to run. Software for it is likely to come from cross-compilers and to be sent over SSH.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have hundreds of gigabytes of high-speed storage, the entire OS needs to be copied from a microSD card on every boot, so you don&#x27;t want to have multiple toolchains on it.<p>I really like the DietPi [1] environment for these purposes (though it doesn&#x27;t currently support have the Jetson Nano), the setup scripts make it easy to configure the OS for exactly the tools you want.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dietpi.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dietpi.com&#x2F;</a>')
