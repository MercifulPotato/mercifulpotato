It’s 2am, I’m in my childhood bedroom on the Sony Vaio computer I received for my 13ty birthday. I’m hooked up to AOL on a 28.8 modem through a 50ft telephone wire connected to my older brothers phone line in the other room. I’m listening to Same In The End by Sublime through Winamp. I’m in an IRC channel with a bunch of script kiddies talking about building AOL Progz in Visual Basic. My computer is running a little slow because I’m burning some music on my 2x CDR through Roxio. I have a programming question so I try searching on Web Crawler. Just as the results come in I’m disconnected because my brother just got home and picked up the phone.')
