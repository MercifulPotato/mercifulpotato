Bluetooth sucks power from my phone. Sonos connects over wifi and the phone isn’t involved in the streaming. I can remote control sonos from the spotify windows app or webapp on my laptop. Also the multi-speaker functionality is great. I don’t use it often, but if doing work around the house it’s nice to hear the audio stream just continue. Not a gamechanger itself though.')
