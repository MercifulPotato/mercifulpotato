The project is called xserver. It contains several display backends. The one based on the model inherited from XFree86 is called xfree86 in the code, but the executable is named Xorg (to avoid stepping on the XFree86 trademark, if memory serves). Its other backends you might encounter include Xvfb for an in-memory virtual framebuffer; Xwin and Xquartz, for running nested under some commercial OS&#x27; display servers; Xephyr and Xnest, for two different approaches to running nested under another X server; and Xwayland, for running nested under a wayland display server.<p>So when I say Xorg is abandoned I&#x27;m very specifically referring to the xfree86 code, to running xserver as _the_ display server.')
