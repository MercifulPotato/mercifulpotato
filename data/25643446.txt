I don&#x27;t know what type of resin these wind turbines use but if we assume it is an Epichlorohydrin+Bisphenol A [0] based epoxy resin the material inputs are basically oil (or any other relatively pure mixture of carbon and hydrogen) and salt for the chlorine.<p>Oil is treated as a consumable in cars and ends up in the atmosphere. Salt is used in food. Why would anyone want to recycle these materials? They are considered &quot;worthless&quot; by the rest of society. If you bury them they at least stay in the ground instead of ending up in the atmosphere.<p>Glass fibers are just SiO2 (glass). The two most common elements on earth.
