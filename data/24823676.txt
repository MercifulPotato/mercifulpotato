Again , it&#x27;s w.r.t what the market is willing to pay.<p>I regret that the safety standards on vehicles in the country are appalling, at-least things started to change last year with Tata &amp; Mahindra cars getting good ratings in GLOBAL NCAP[1] for the first time. I hope the COVID impact on the automobile sector, doesn&#x27;t revert the progress.<p>I presume this is the case with all the developing economies.<p>[1]<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalncap.org&#x2F;results&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalncap.org&#x2F;results&#x2F;</a>')
