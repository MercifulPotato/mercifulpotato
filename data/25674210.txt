No state anywhere can change laws without going through the legislature. Only the legislature has  the power to write law. The executive branch, which runs elections, always has leeway on how they implement  and interpret laws. If someone had a problem with how the laws  were interpreted, they could sue in state court - many people  did, all the suits were dismissed by the state courts, meaning that the courts did not find any violations of the state constitution. So, &quot;the fact they changed their laws the way they did&quot; -&gt; they did not change their laws. &quot;is a clear-cut violation of  the constitution&quot; -&gt; nope, courts determined over and  over and over that this is not the case.')
