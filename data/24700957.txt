What is commonly understood?  I don&#x27;t think there is much common understanding associated with this.  Except maybe that we should treat individuals as individuals, rather than make strong distinctions based on group membership, regardless of any underlying distinctions in the groups.  At least that&#x27;s the noble intent -- I don&#x27;t think any lies are layered on this.')
