Item(by='serf', descendants=None, kids=[25223517], score=None, time=1606424021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25222830, text='&gt;For you to be right, this must be a planned deception.<p>Sure, you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s conspiracy theory -- but one doesn&#x27;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to predict further anti-consumer action from companies that have a long and sordid past with anti-consumer actions.<p>Apple , quite literally, wrote the playbook for establishing  gilded cages and vendor lock-in within the (modern) computer industry.<p>I mean.. most companies in the world don&#x27;t generate enough ire that the public get together and maintain a wikipedia page about the criticisms that apply to the company separately from the parent page.[0]<p>But absolutely, I agree -- it&#x27;s conspiracy theory. The problem I have personally with conspiracy theory regarding Apple is that over the past 30+ years i&#x27;ve seen <i>a lot</i> of it turn into fact gradually over time.<p>I have very few doubts that the trend will continue onward. -- as such I have little problem with entertaining conspiracy regarding Apple, as long as it&#x27;s not absolutely insane.<p>Apple seems to be masterful at the magicians&#x27; game of misdirection. That&#x27;s the best way I can put it.<p>&#x27;Ignore the man behind the curtain.&#x27;.<p>The most modern example?<p>Let&#x27;s talk about how fast and cool and battery conserving their new processors are without taking into account the vast amounts of software breakage that came along with the architecture change and the future software landscape reform that&#x27;s going to take place that will establish Apple customers even more firmly into territory they can&#x27;t ever hope to leave.<p>...and this is coming from someone who , historically, has loved ARM. <i>MY</i> problem with it is that the architecture change, IMO of course, is going to undoubtedly be used to leverage and strong-arm customers into Apple-centric &#x27;app-store&#x27; interfaces, pulling the market apart just like in the PPC days between Apple OK-d software and the rest of humanity -- for the sake of a lot of quick bucks for Apple and a lot of additional developer&#x2F;customer friction for the rest of the world.<p>We&#x27;ll see, I guess. I like the new M1 on paper, I just trust Apple about as far as I can throw them.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Criticism_of_Apple_Inc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Criticism_of_Apple_Inc</a>.')
