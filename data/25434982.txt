People tend to overestimate their skill and ability when risks are low, but underestimate them when they are high.  An average person is pretty sure he&#x2F;she can walk on a path that is 2&#x27; wide without error ....but if it crosses a lava pit, the instinct changes.  Suddenly you don&#x27;t have confidence, unless you are around lava pits all the time.<p>Then a second complicating factor comes in: most people interpret egoic&#x2F;social peril like physical peril.  For most of human history being ostracized by the community meant death.  So we are willing to believe whatever we can get away with in a social context ...but not more.  And the winners of a social egoic competition benefit from this.  Competitors self-limit.<p>There is an illusion that confidence confers skill when what is actually happening is that a diminished ego has impeded basic functioning, and artificial self-estimation counteracts that somewhat.<p>Even if you aren&#x27;t in the top 10%, you may be able to solve the problem b&#x2F;c the average person is impeded by an artificially diminished ego.')
