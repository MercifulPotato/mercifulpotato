Let me use an analogy:<p>Imagine looking at the source code of a game. It&#x27;s technically possible for a reader to technically understand what the program is doing and understand what the game is about, how it works, it&#x27;s rules and goals.<p>However, if you pass the sources through a compiler (whose behaviour you also can well understand) what you end up with is a game you can run and <i>experience</i>.<p>Reconstructed pronounciations are a bit like that. You get to &quot;experience&quot; rules that are otherwise coded in an abstract language. The effort of translating those rules into something you experience actually requires a lot of effort and expertise. You can in theory become a &quot;compiler&quot; and learn how to do it yourself (aloud or in your head) but it&#x27;s hard; what&#x27;s wrong with outsourcing it?')
