Many such people still have driver&#x27;s licenses, and you only really get punished for a DWI when you actually do kill or injure somebody.<p>So if that is the standard society has, we should apply it to COVID-19 to be consistent. If someone dies of a Covid case that is traceable to your own negligence (e.g. going to work with symptoms and no mask), you should be held liable for manslaughter.')
