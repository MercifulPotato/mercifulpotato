But some specific things relevant to this story:<p>Market makers are allowed and expected to run naked shorts in order to ensure liquidity. We want a system where you can just buy or sell an item &quot;into the market&quot;, and then everything will get sorted out eventually. We optimise for the case where shares can be found because it&#x27;s overwhelmingly common.<p>Stock borrowing is routine and transparent. People often have no idea if their stock has been lent out or if they own a borrowed stock; the reason for this is because the system has been designed so it doesn&#x27;t matter. Shorting is common and accepted.<p>The volume of transactions is enormous, and the system began to freeze up under the weight of its own paperwork in the 60s and 70s. To work around this, a policy of stock immobilization was implemented to ensure that stocks don&#x27;t need to physically change hands. As a result, almost all stocks in the US are <i>actually</i> owned by a small, obscure partnership called Cede &amp; Co. As the excellent writer Matt Levine wrote a while back:<p>&gt; Nobody owns stock. What you own is an entitlement to stock held for you by your broker. But your broker doesn&#x27;t own the stock either. What your broker owns is an entitlement to stock held for it by Cede &amp; Co., which is a nominee of the Depository Trust Company, which is a company that is in the business of owning everyone&#x27;s stock for them. This system sounds convoluted but actually makes it easy to keep track of things: If I sell stock to you, I don&#x27;t have to courier over a paper share certificate, or call up the company and have it change its shareholder register. Our brokers just change some electronic entries at their DTC accounts and everything is cool.<p>Dematerialization has been extremely helpful, but at scale, it moves us even further away from a system that deals with concrete items. Hence, eg, Levine&#x27;s hilarious story &quot;Banks Forgot Who Was Supposed to Own Dell Shares&quot;, from which my earlier excert comes from: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2015-07-14&#x2F;banks-forgot-who-was-supposed-to-own-dell-shares#footnote-1436883540292" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2015-07-14&#x2F;banks-...</a><p>Or for another even more hilarious story (also by Levine), &quot;Dole Food Had Too Many Shares&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2017-02-17&#x2F;dole-food-had-too-many-shares" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2017-02-17&#x2F;dole-f...</a><p>And so forth, and so on. The system, at every level, is not one where it makes any real sense to say &quot;the company has issued five hundred thousand shares, I own twenty of them, I keep them in a drawer in my office, look, here are the serial numbers&quot;. It&#x27;s more probabilistic than that, very much by design.')
