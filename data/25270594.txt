I just think from a business point of view the smart watch business is all about the top end, because the real estate is <i></i>so valuable<i></i>, literally on top of someone 24&#x2F;7, that the focus should be on how much value can you deliver to that person, and target a 1% of their income price point (hopefully delivering a much greater benefit than 1%). But absolutely, this is an awesome development, to have a $20 smart watch, and I agree if Wyze is getting more people wearing these things, that will be a huge win for the world.')
