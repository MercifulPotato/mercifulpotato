Meaning that you could for example have Help&#x2F;Technical Details&#x2F;Stacktrace buttons. Or you could interactively expand an error to -v or -vv verbosity level.<p>In logs this can be partially achieved by logging additional details with a low logging level. With errors coming from exceptions in particular, I like to log the error message (exception message) separately from the stack trace for that reason.')
