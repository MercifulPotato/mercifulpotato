You realize even a small bet at the right time could be life-changing.<p>Let&#x27;s say instead of buying a Latte every working days at starbucks over the last five years you had invested it in tesla stocks. Or maybe for every starbucks latte you drank, you invested the same amount in ETF and in Tesla (pay 3 latte, drink one).  Where would your life be? Would you still be at your 9-to-5 or would you go work for that non-profit? Or would you just be lazing around on the sofa or at the beach sipping pina-coladas?<p>Anyway, sometimes it takes a lot of energy to deal with the KIMO (Know I Missed Out).')
