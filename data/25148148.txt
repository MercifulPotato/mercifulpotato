They were presented as these mythical entities that magically reduce the energy requirements of certain reactions, using a clumsy key&#x2F;lock metaphor that didn’t really explain anything.<p>It was much later in my 30s after buying a book on cellular biology that I learnt that enzymes work by using electro-static forces to bend target molecules to increase their probability of breaking at lower energies. It’s this pattern of +ve and -ve charges on the enzyme that matches the target molecule and provides the basis of the key&#x2F;lock metaphor.<p>This realisation was so beautiful, astonishing and illuminating that I can’t for the life of me understand why it was left out, particularly as we were learning about the physics and chemistry of the related concepts anyway.')
