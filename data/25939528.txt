And source code is hard to read, system dependent - you can&#x27;t understand it without being familiar with hardware which may not even exist any more -  and may be impossible to access.<p>This isn&#x27;t really about history. This is about ideas <i>which could still be useful today</i> but which have been forgotten, for a variety of reasons.<p>Most CS departments don&#x27;t have anyone who specialises in this. And academic historians have other priorities.<p>Calling this dumbing down doesn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s not about historians &quot;dumbing down&quot; CS, it&#x27;s about not understanding the difference between what historians do - create narratives - and what archivists and researchers do, which is more closely related to continuing research and development.<p>Physics actually has the same problem. Anything outside a limited mainstream is forgotten very quickly. Math seems less prone to it, perhaps because math is made of academic papers and nothing else, and there&#x27;s more of a tradition of open exploration and communication.')
