You can pretty well reduce it to just text.\n Somehow though, Reddit doesn’t feel very community-oriented. Out of my many years there, I don’t know any other users by their handle. I haven’t got to know anyone. I miss that about message boards.<p>Same here, actually.<p>I fondly remember car forums where you get to know the regulars.<p>IRC rooms still seem to have that aspect to them, but the IRC protocol makes it hard to have asynchronous conversations. I really like Matrix&#x2F;Element protocol-wise, but there are issues there too.<p>Edit: I really like what Discourse is doing. I wish it had a lower barrier to entry and better community discoverability.')
