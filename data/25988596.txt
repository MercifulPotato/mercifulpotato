It looks like the static content of the disk, including CURRENT.UF2, is all at the start, so the only time you could have a mix of CURRENT.UF2 content and the uploaded uf2 in a single page cache entry would be the very last of CURRENT.UF2 and the very start of the new flash content.  I&#x27;m tempted to wave my hands and say that will work out fine (since that content would be overwritten <i>again</i> when reaching the end of the uploaded uf2) but it does seem like a potential problem and it would be nice to know why it&#x27;s okay..')
