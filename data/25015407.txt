I could have different cells that  set a blob of data to different states, and try tweaking regexes or splits or whatever without having to restart or save intermediate files.  And if I mess something up I just rerun the appropriate cells to get me back to where I was.<p>My biggest complaint is the way it handles automatic parentheses and quotes, it&#x27;s just always a bit off.')
