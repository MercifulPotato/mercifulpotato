Unfortunately it backfired and now the web is even more shit. Easy tracking, particularly via Google and ad networks, is considered so important to basically everyone that deploys it (metrics, revenue), that they feel it&#x27;s acceptable to put the banners up, rather than develop a different way of gathering and managing the data they want.<p>The fines aren&#x27;t large enough. Google Analytics is on 50% of all web content (I should research the actual figure). The fine should reflect the effect that has on Goog&#x27;s revenue, rather than this pocket-money sum.')
