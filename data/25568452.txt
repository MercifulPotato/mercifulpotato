Every kid is different and there is no magic trick (at least that I&#x27;ve found!) to get them to sleep more. Mine are 4 and 6 and I&#x27;m trying to reframe my mind to not see sleep as a battle. \nWhat is killing me is that they won&#x27;t come downstairs alone to play, though once here they can play unsupervised. I am looking forward to the days getting brighter so it isn&#x27;t the dark that stops them.<p>Even taking out my 2h45m (total) commute time, I&#x27;m more tired than ever. I&#x27;m sure a lot of mine is due to stress and low level depression - I have a lot on now but so does pretty much every person you interact with.<p>Before lockdown I was starting to get some arduino and electronics projects in during my commute, but I&#x27;ve barely even had time to watch videos of other people&#x27;s projects.<p>I just remind myself that in time this will change, that I&#x27;ll find time again for myself. Over Christmas I&#x27;ve been trying to go for a walk alone each day and also to step away from my phone more. But it is hard - but that is OK.')
