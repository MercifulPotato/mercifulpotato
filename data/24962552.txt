Lots of people don&#x27;t properly use the styles feature of Word (aka don&#x27;t learn the tool basics) and then scream and yell at it. I&#x27;ve cranked out some rather long docs with it without hardly any issues at all. Just like people who rule out emacs or vim, 95% of them don&#x27;t take time to properly learn the tool that they are using. That said I still prefer TeX&#x2F;LateX for my own stuff and when I get a choice (I using don&#x27;t get the chance because it&#x27;s using collaborating on a Microsoft document online these days).')
