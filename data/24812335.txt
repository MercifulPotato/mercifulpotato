Your ISP is your default VPN.  For example comcast sells traffic data to marketing firms.  And because they sell that data to adtech, private investigators, the govt and creeps can also buy the traffic log to whatever is in your house.<p>At least with VPN services, you can change it easily AND you can make it all they know about you is a coarse IP set via paying cash (see mulvad) vs. a fucking billing address.  And changing VPNs is a lot less work and has far more options than changing your ISP.')
