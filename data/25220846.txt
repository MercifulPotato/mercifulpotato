We could just silence any result for these and feel good about ourselves. We&#x27;ve removed offensive elements from Alexa.<p>But imo censoring these results will only serve as further reinforcement to the askers of these question that there is something they shouldn&#x27;t know, and thus they are on the right path.<p>It&#x27;s the same simple solution like twitter putting a label next to every one of trumps tweets.
