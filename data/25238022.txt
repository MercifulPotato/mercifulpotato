You only go to work there if you don&#x27;t have a better option (Google, Facebook, etc) or have some specialty skill they&#x27;re willing to pay for. Pay is below other FAANG companies and the work culture isn&#x27;t great (toxic even some would say).<p>edit: They also had the most disorganized and de-centralized interview approach from all the FAANG companies I talked with. Which isn&#x27;t growing pains this far in, it&#x27;s just bad management and process.')
