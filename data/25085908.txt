As the bureaucracy grows, actual contributors are increasingly disincentivized from participating in the governance because it becomes such a distraction to actually producing content. At the extremes, these communities end up with highly-political community governance that spends much of their time with political maneuvering and focusing on a handful of fringe issues, while the actual content creators end up operating largely independently.<p>If you ignore the politicking and realize it&#x27;s mostly a distraction, there&#x27;s often good work still happening on the core content.')
