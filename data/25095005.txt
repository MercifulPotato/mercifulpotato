What&#x27;s the top 10% of FAANG outcomes (for Harvard grads) after 5 years? 500k, maybe? The jump to MD in finance makes 1M+ something like 10-20% of outcomes (for Harvard grads) after 10 years. I&#x27;d be very surprised if it were that common in tech (over the next 10 years, I know that it was better in the 2000s). I think quickest to MD at Goldman was 4 years.')
