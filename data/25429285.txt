Inspired by a paper on PubMed (so this isn&#x27;t entirely anecdotal) I tried it and it works for me.<p>Food also helps but not 100%. IME it does not seem to &quot;soak up&quot; all of the excess acid. Vitamin C is also not 100% but IME more effective than food.<p>I&#x27;m not a frequent or high dose user of NSAIDs, I just seem to have an easily irritated stomach.')
