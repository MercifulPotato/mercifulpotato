Not everybody in a team has the same level of expertise.<p>Shared-memory concurrency is pretty much always buggy, IME, even if your team thinks they&#x27;re experts.<p>&gt; And Rust is not an interpreted language. IMHO, interpreted languages should just drop to a compiled one to keep it KISS. Instead of going the async road, just to discover in production, it is unstable because back-pressure was not taken into account.<p>WTF? Switching to a compiled language doesn&#x27;t magically make your threads nonblocking. Maybe you can serve 10x more users with a compiled language, but if we&#x27;re talking about slow network requests then async can make your throughput thousands of times higher.')
