Why can&#x27;t the static type checkers like mypy and pyright do this for us?<p>Because JSON is external data, mypy and pyright operate on Python code.<p>&gt; They can tell you if you&#x27;re assigning a string to an int, but not if you&#x27;re assigning 200 to an int whose type allows only numbers in [10, 100].<p>Mypy can, in fact, do that (via a union of literal types), though the UX is horrible for that specific case and it only handles simple literals, but that&#x27;s actually enough for JSON semantics. Of course, to validate JSON with it, you&#x27;d have to turn the JSON into Python code with type annotations and validate that.')
