Oftentimes, when an individual is targeted by the mob, their employer doesn&#x27;t particularly care about the views, beliefs, or words of the target outside the workplace. Sometimes, sure, but usually, if it doesn&#x27;t impact the business, it would usually not result in career-ending consequences.<p>What currently happens, however, is thousands of angry mob members effectively DDoSing the employer&#x27;s phone system, customer service and HR representatives, inboxes, etc. Regardless of how little the employer cares about their employee&#x27;s outside-work views or activities, they end up with no choice but to pay the ransom to make the problem go away. And the ransom is the economic devastation of the target.<p>It is a DDoS, and conducting one ought to carry approximately the same legal consequences as renting a botnet and extorting a ransom.')
