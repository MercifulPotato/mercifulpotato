There were 60+ cases involved here across five (I think) state jurisdictions and federal courts, and variants of this evidence was submitted and ruled on in quite a few.<p>It is <i>also</i> true that most of these were tossed for things like standing.  But the idea that courts &quot;refused to hear the evidence&quot; is exactly the kind of fake news &#x2F; Big Lie argumentation that spawned the cases to begin with.<p>Court cases contesting elections are routine and normal.
