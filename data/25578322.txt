And the studies I&#x27;m finding measuring this exact concern don&#x27;t seem to show particularly significant impacts on fuel efficiency &#x2F; emissions for ICE vehicles (a couple percent, tops, and that&#x27;s assuming small cars w&#x2F; tiny engines <i>and</i> some pretty comically inefficient DRL implementations - hardly relevant for creating a new standard that can mandate e.g. dedicated LED-based DRL systems).')
