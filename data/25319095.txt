Item(by='teddyh', descendants=None, kids=[25319174, 25319185], score=None, time=1607207847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25317896, text='The idea of land-value tax strongly reminds me of the often cited, and much maligned, so-called fiduciary duty to shareholders which CEOs and&#x2F;or board members reportedly have.  This duty creates, it is said, an incentive towards naked short-term greed, which is often described as a bad thing.  Now, even though this duty is also usually derided as fictional, the argument, if this duty did exist, is reasonable.  But does not a LVT create the same incentives in landowners â€“ in essence forcing landowners to always use the land in a way which extracts the maximum amount of money from it?  Why then is a LVT a good thing while the duty thing would be bad?')
