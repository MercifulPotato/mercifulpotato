Relatively minor cost for actually mitigating external frictions seeing as how the only remaining land border India&#x2F;Bhutan is causing so much shit show now not to mention SCS disputes. Or China would be in a better position had they not acceded to Mongolian independence.<p>&gt;hates the party with deep, deep passion<p>I mean... what else is new? Not many countries with widespread support for their government, especially now, times are hard for almost everyone, everywhere. Citizens in multiparty systems hate their politicians too, they just also happen to hate rival parties more. Modernity + capitalism is stressful, personally preferable stress than being subsistence farmers. Maybe some prefer if China was contained and stagnant in an agrarian society. Most of my extended family hates the CCP, lost everything during cultural revolution. Some got fucked again during Xi&#x27;s corruption crack downs. More lament at their kids future because competing in the world&#x27;s largest country isn&#x27;t easy. Most of them could also sell their tier1 city condos and retire comfortably in any western country as millionaires. These are people who benefited enormously from the system. People aren&#x27;t rational.<p>&gt;virulent Xiism<p>I wasn&#x27;t a fan of Xi, but he inherited unfavorable geopolitical conditions and in retrospect seized the right opportunities. US pivoted to Asia before him, the relationship was always going to devolve into competition. Hide and bide was on last legs, and Trump didn&#x27;t help with setting new truculence. They managed situation OK considering how this wildcard US admin was stacked with China Hawks. Pompeo isn&#x27;t sailing carriers groups through the Taiwan Strait anymore, and the weapons sales are a pittance compared to the 90s.<p>&gt;They blew it all<p>US anxiety and to rise of China threat was always going to be triggered by a combination of Chinese economy eclipsing US and scale of Chinese military buildup commiserate with 14T economy. It&#x27;s inevitable. But economy and military reformed are basically at a level of appropriate competitiveness and regional deterrence to address shifting US foreign policy. Maybe another few years would help with the IC &#x2F; turbojet situation, but US was cracking down on MIC2025 since Obama. 20 years ago, Chinese hated the government, worshipped the west, and couldn&#x27;t dream of a world outside of western hegemony. Now they&#x27;re somewhat confident about the government and recognize the west are not untouchable. Hate + confidence is an improvement. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d live to see the day where comfy Chinese diaspora in the west or international students want to go back, but those conversations are happening.')
