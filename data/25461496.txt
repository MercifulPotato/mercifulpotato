If you are not ok shape in middle school, it leads to learning issues. One problem begets the other<p>- Shifts in parenting. When I grew up in the 1980&#x27;s, our family ALWAYS ate dinner at home, together as a family. My mom got home early from work when me and my sister got home from school and started dinner before my Dad got him from his job. We RARELY ate out and it was looked as a privilege, not something that happened often.<p>- The shift from the nuclear family. Most of my friends are married and both parents work full time, their kids are heavily involved in sports, and after school activities. Less time for family, less time for organized meals, less time to prepare good food for your kids. The basic idea now is &quot;just get <i>something</i> in them and get them to soccer, hockey, gymnastics practice, etc.&quot;<p>Likewise, the parents have little or time to properly feed themselves either. Same thing, grab something fast, shovel the food into your kid, then get something fast on the way home before you have to jump back on your laptop and finish the last bit of work you didn&#x27;t get done because you had to get little Bobby to practice.<p>This is a situation that never gets any better. Your kids have <i>more</i> activities, you constantly have <i>more</i> work to do. The go go go go attitude of our culture has left the nuclear family and our nutrition in the dust.<p>Humans are lazy by nature. Make it easier to eat unhealthy foods and we&#x27;ll do it. Its all we&#x27;ve done for the past 40 years.')
