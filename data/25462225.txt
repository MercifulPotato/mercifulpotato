We even stayed with ezjail, which is dead simple, because we were so comfortable with it and could understand how to manually fiddle with stuff when there was a need.<p>There are very very few things that cannot be told to bind to the real jail IP address instead of localhost. Most stuff will just work. And that&#x27;s it. But there are also added benefits here:<p>* Parts of the filesystem cannot be altered, period. You update your base from your jailhost and every jail takes the change. That was an added security benefit.<p>* Pkg software can be individually installed per jail, goes into &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local. FreeBSD has already been brilliant in separating the base system from the third party software.<p>* For minor and major version bumps, we developed a simple set of steps and tools to upgrade a jailhost but leave the jails in their previous versions, maintaining multiple versions of base, like &#x2F;var&#x2F;jails&#x2F;basejail104, &#x2F;var&#x2F;jails&#x2F;basejail113, and so on. So the downtime is minimized, and each jail can be upgraded later in its own pace. This was a huge relief compared to having to upgrade everything only to find that some piece of software doesn&#x27;t quite work correctly in the next version. And rollback is possible, by just copying the jail.<p>* Jails can likewise be very easily copied between jailhosts with a couple of rsync commands and some simple script.<p>Have used iocage and zfs and it is brilliant, but even without the benefits of zfs clone and snapshot, jails were (and I believe still are) a very pleasant experience to work with.')
