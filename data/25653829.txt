They like seeing that you&#x27;re curious and passionate about the field.<p>If you explore languages that they haven&#x27;t explored yet, then they might be excited about the chance to learn something from you.  If you&#x27;ve explored the same trendy language they&#x27;re already exploring, then their ego might feel validated by seeing others on the same bandwagon.<p>Either way, they&#x27;re probably frustrated by various examples of not having buy-in from management or architects to do various things they&#x27;d like with the existing codebase.  So they might see you as the right kind of mindset, someone hungry who will be an ally in pushing for improvements.<p>On the OTHER hand, it will often worry managers and architects.  Who have enough stress on their plates dealing with the business stakeholders, and don&#x27;t want to hire another kid who will throw a temper tantrum when they&#x27;re not allowed to re-write the entire platform in Rust.<p>So if you DO decide to put various &quot;personal interest&quot; languages on your resume, then make it a point during phone or F2F interviews to highlight your professional maturity.  How you understand the need to balance risk.  In other words, that you explore languages on your personal time to make you a better developer, not because you really have an expectation of using Brainfuck on your employer&#x27;s projects.<p>Even with that said, by the time you&#x27;re 5+ years in the industry, I&#x27;d be a little wary of putting too much on your resume that isn&#x27;t genuine professional experience.  I include Lisp and F# on my resume just for the occasional conversation-starter... but if I really had a list of 12 hobby languages, then I would probably try to mention that in the interview, rather than listing them all on my printed resume&#x2F;CV.')
