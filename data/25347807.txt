Unable to rehabilitate Pepe’s image, Furie killed the frog off in a comic—but by that point, he’d effectively lost control of Pepe’s image. Furie would go on to sue InfoWars’ Alex Jones, who had been using a Pepe image to sell posters. (Jones used the lawsuit to increase the price of the posters—eventually, InfoWars settled with Furie.)    \n\n  &gt; Furie’s attorneys estimate they have issued between 75 and 100 successful legal challenges halting the unauthorized use of Pepe. But the damage remains: Despite his best efforts, Furie will forever be associated with a toxic symbol of white supremacy.  \n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s hard to judge from a distance, but it sounds to me like there is a lot of time, effort, and money being spent trying to enforce rights, and yet it&#x27;s a game of whack-a-mole where the alt-right never gets the message.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thedispatch.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;alt-right-culture-rittenhouse-blackrifle-coffee" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thedispatch.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;alt-right-culture-rittenhouse-blac...</a>')
