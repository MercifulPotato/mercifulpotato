On the other hand part of why you&#x27;d choose RDS over deploying MariaDB yourself to an EC2 instance is to shift some of the responsibility of testing &amp; configuration over to AWS. If AWS is disabling features on instances that don&#x27;t work, this is actually a benefit that they&#x27;re providing to their users, as you can better trust that any feature enabled on a given product &amp; instance type will &quot;just work&quot;.')
