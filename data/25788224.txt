Why are there problems that a majority find important but arenâ€™t incentivized or paid to work on (e.g. why does it take so long and so much energy for negative externalities such as climate change to be recognized and regulated)? The tempting default seems to be inaction when there is a consensus on need but no consensus on approach.&quot;<p>This is so true, and it&#x27;s crazy how simple some of these solutions could be. For many things, it&#x27;s a matter of pricing in negative externalities into the cost of products.
