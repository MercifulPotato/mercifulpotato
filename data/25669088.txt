The problem is the product is not versatile to be adopted in a more general sense. The Engineering accomplishment of the company are great, but it does not have a broad enough market and hence reflected in the cost of the product. Similarly, you can compare that to technical books and why they cost so much as the expected sales volumes are not high enough unlike a fictional character book, prime example Harry Potter, it also became a big screen hit with fans.')
