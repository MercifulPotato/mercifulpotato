Your objections are pedantic and irrelevant to the author&#x27;s purpose in relating it.<p>The author posted it in a comment on an article about Neanderthals who might have had the ability, never before observed in humans, to slow their base metabolic rate to withstand extreme cold. And they suggested those North Koreans were likely doing the same.<p>In my modified version, their body temperature stays within the normal range and they&#x27;re conserving energy by limiting movement, but their base metabolism stays the same and they still have to eat regularly, i.e. they&#x27;re not hibernating.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s just &quot;nitpicking over the exact phrasing of the story&quot;, but it&#x27;s also the only way in which the story is relevant to TFA.')
