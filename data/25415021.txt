I had to spend extra 3-4 hours per day in order to deliver in time; and sometimes it was not enough for management (good people overall, but way too embedded in this culture of unaccounted time.)

But if it&#x27;s eating you away, then switch jobs as soon as you can.<p>P.S.: I&#x27;m not a fan of articles published via tweets.')
