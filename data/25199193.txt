There are a number of graphic novels that I considered purchasing but didn&#x27;t because I wanted them to look more like the original comics. Graphic novel reprints published during a certain timespan thought it a good idea to go with semigloss paper and re-did all the colours to be super-saturated and dayglo like someone had visited a highlighter marker factory and was excited about the experience.<p>As an aside, who exactly was the target viewing demographic for Garfield? Garfield was never funny for me as a kid. Never.')
