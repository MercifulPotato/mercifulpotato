Neither of them are going to be swayed by you claiming you increased user engagement or cut costs by X%. The administrative person is going to ignore it as it&#x27;s beyond the scope of what they&#x27;re doing, and the technical guy will laugh at it.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine a situation where this would realistically make you look good. Maybe if you&#x27;re applying to a small&#x2F;micro company who has no technical staff at present time, and the owner is non-technical and looking at your resume themselves? Basically a company that lacks anyone qualified to evaluate you, and they&#x27;re looking for their first developer to build something that will help their business. Then you might be able to sell yourself by claiming you improved business metrics.')
