The meaning is clearly that there shouldn&#x27;t be a gaping hole on the top of a 5 story building that people can access. Or at least that you shouldn&#x27;t walk around a building you&#x27;re not familiar with at night.<p>Anyone who thinks there&#x27;s no meaning to take from these kind of events is wasting a huge opportunity to learn that small things like a gap in a roof can mean life or death<p>And he goes back at the end!
