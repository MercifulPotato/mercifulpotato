Dropbox additionally shoves all sorts of features I don’t want down my throat (no, I don’t want a password manager or hellosign integration, thanks) while depriving me of basic security features because they’re “enterprise” like password protecting a Dropbox file url.<p>The only part of Dropbox palatable nowadays is the desktop sync, which still is pretty invisible. I can’t even open .org files as plaintext in the Dropbox iOS app right now. The same app opens to a default pane not of my files but of Dropbox paper files, a product I’ve never used ever.<p>I renewed my Dropbox membership this past year mainly out of laziness: but not next.
