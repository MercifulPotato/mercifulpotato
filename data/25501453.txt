The IoT startup I work for in New Zealand was struggling with fuzzy-matching routes with Google Maps and ESRI. When I tried GraphHopper, it gave excellent results, and when I had more questions, email replies were extremely punctual. Another friend in Germany is using GraphHopper for some research on tram lines.<p>So just to echo what karussell says: GraphHopper seem like a great team, with wonderful tech and friendly people. So if you have an interest in maps, it&#x27;s worth chatting to them!')
