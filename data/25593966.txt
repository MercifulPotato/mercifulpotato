I recommend it highly.  (At least this summer Springer was giving away a PDF - not sure if that&#x27;s still true.)<p>To me, Goodfellow et al. spent the first hundred and fifty  pages on stuff which is important, but covered better elsewhere (e.g., probability theory, numerical methods) and didn&#x27;t belong in their book at all.  Simultaneously, I didn&#x27;t get that much out of the &quot;core&quot; chapters on RNNs, CNNs, etc, relative to what I got out of other books.  I think the book is somewhat overrated, frankly, but YMMV!')
