I  love le Carré&#x27;s books so I was really intrigued by this, and asked him if <i>he</i> ever got recruited to MI6.<p>To my surprise, he said yes. But it was done in a very le Carré-esque style. My professor had an interview with MI6 which he thought he bombed, and then didn&#x27;t hear back from them, confirming his assumption... until he got a completely out-of-the blue job offer from an obscure UK government agency that involved lots of travel to Norwegian fisheries. He told me with a smile that it wasn&#x27;t until he turned down the offer that he realized that he <i>had</i> gotten the MI6 gig, but he failed the final test!')
