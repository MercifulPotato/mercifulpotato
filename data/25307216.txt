You can&#x27;t generalize 1 error out of 3 to 66%.  Statistics of small numbers.  Knowing how ML works, I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t give any indication of low confidence.<p>Not to give DeepMind too much credit, but it&#x27;s also entirely possible that &quot;both are correct&quot;.  By the nature of how targets are selected for CASP, year over year there is higher likelihood that &quot;pathologically difficult&quot; proteins are presented for the competition, for example - a protein that exhibits polymorphic structure where the technique (say Xtal vs NMR) biases the &quot;solved&quot; fold in a huge way.  I believe CASP tries to weed out proteins that we know are polymorphic, but you can never be sure, and again, as time marches on, those are the proteins that fundamentally are harder to solve, so it&#x27;s likely they will be enriched in the test pool.<p>An extreme example is insulin.  The structure of insulin is has been solved for 60? I think years, but when it&#x27;s in the environment of its receptor, it looks TOTALLY different (solved 5? years ago).  Having said that, doubtful that DeepMind could ascertain that structure, since the environment is super-super different.<p>I think that the modestly high error rate is an indication that deepmind is mostly interpolating and has solved the broad protein folding heuristic.  It probably will get better.')
