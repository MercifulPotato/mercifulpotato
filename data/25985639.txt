Large collection of the Impressionists, from Van Gogh to Monet, to post-Impressionist Seurat to Georgia O&#x27;Keefe. And that doesn&#x27;t even scratch the surface. It&#x27;s a great place to spend the day. Very cool that they&#x27;re opening up their collection to the Internet, especially during a time like this.<p>&gt; Using our open API, people outside the museum have done some pretty awesome things, like allowing Alexa to browse our collection and creating a text message service that sends you a randomly selected Art Institute artwork. You can even add works to the video game Animal Crossing using the Gettyâ€™s Animal Crossing art generator. (Just click on Import using IIIF under Step 1. Manifest URLs can be found on our open-access artwork pages.)<p>I hope this inspires other museums to follow suit.')
