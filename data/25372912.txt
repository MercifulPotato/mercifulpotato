As an example: we&#x27;re in the process of switching from Digital Ocean to Hetzner for a project, that will increase infrastructure performance (roughly memory&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;storage) by 4x and decrease costs by 4x. And no driving to the colo center is neccessary, as it&#x27;s their dedicated server, so their on-site engineers do the hardware replacement.<p>Also, if you are not okay with your site being down for a few hours, you can always buy two, like you would with a sensible cloud setup. It&#x27;d still come up way cheaper (+ get more perf if you can do load balancing for your usage).<p>Also, I don&#x27;t look at it from &quot;colo is cheaper&quot; point of view. To me, it&#x27;s &quot;I can have several times more performance <i>and</i> hire a full time sysadmin to worry about it, for the same price&quot;.')
