Aside from the fact that I’d be skeptical of any drug that was rushed to market (especially if it was the first of its type to ever be brought to market), I simply don’t trust anybody involved to be honest about its safety. Even the reporting on how the roll out is going is highly questionable. All reports of potential side effects are disclaimed with weasely statements “no evidence it’s linked to the vaccine”.<p>If I were in an at risk group I might have a different perspective, but as it stands I’m happy to wait and see how it goes. If I end up never having to take it, even better.')
