Item(by='qeternity', descendants=None, kids=[25639137], score=None, time=1609797920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638571, text='&gt; Do you realise that in two successive comments, you have literally just claimed that hospitals are not really filling up, then claimed that reports from front-line staff working in those hospitals don&#x27;t prove anything?<p>Um, what? That&#x27;s exactly right. Hospitals are not filling up. The NHS own data shows this. The fact that doctors think the hospitals are filling up is irrelevant. People&#x27;s estimates of things are notoriously incorrect, especially when they are under pressure. I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;ve taken issue with.<p>Are you disputing the NHS data that hospitals are not filling up?<p>&gt; There is a reason for the saying that an army is run by its sergeants. All the plans made by generals aren&#x27;t worth squat if you don&#x27;t have boots on the ground who know what they&#x27;re doing to implement those plans.<p>Right, Sergents run the implementation, not the planning. What we are talking about is the planning. But the bigger issue with this logic is that this isn&#x27;t a medical plan. It&#x27;s a social one. The people who should develop a strategy around a global pandemic are not the same people who intubate the casualties of said pandemic. It&#x27;s like asking a car mechanic how we should build safer roads...they&#x27;re just not the same thing.')
