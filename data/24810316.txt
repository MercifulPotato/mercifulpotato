Nothing wrong with some job changes in your CV.<p>I think that for those who struggle with getting complacent, I would say that they should look at internal job transfers. Different team, different project, something that gives you the change of work&#x2F;scenery in the company but the constant hopping between different places doesn&#x27;t look good to someone interviewing you.<p>As a manager, you&#x27;re thinking, &quot;I&#x27;m taking a risk on this person. Will they be around here for our multi-year project vision?&quot; Someone who job hops likely won&#x27;t be around long enough for you to execute on the big picture and you&#x27;ll be back to hiring&#x2F;training a replacement too soon.')
