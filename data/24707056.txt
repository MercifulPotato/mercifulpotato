They are built for commercial use.\nIn Norway they can be bought at the big consumer electronics shops.\nI plan to buy their cheapest commercial dishwasher DWCBI231.W during Black Friday in November. They also have the industrial DWCFS5936.S<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static18.asko.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;default&#x2F;Nordic&#x2F;Professional&#x2F;475268_Professional%20Brochure%202019_Nordic%20version_NO_spread.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static18.asko.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;default&#x2F;Nordic&#x2F;Professional&#x2F;...</a><p>I am very pleased with their washing machine WMC743PS.\nIt has shock absorbers. The drain pump makes the most noise. This machine is not afraid of unstable loads such a single wool sweater. It is fascinating to look at the door getting tossed around while the the rest of the machine is stable.\nIn most consumer machines this  heavy wool sweater would come out soaking wet as the safety features of the control board would stop the machine.\nCheck out the door seal on ASKO compared to normal washing machines. It is very hygienic unlike the common deep rubber seal that will get moldy over time.\nI managed to get it for ~1700 USD.<p>The ASKO Professional vented tumble dryer does not reverse the spin direction, so I got the Miele T 8302 vented tumble dryer instead. I toss the exhaust hose out a window, temporarily. It had to be vented, non-negotiable :)<p>Miele Professional was too expensive.')
