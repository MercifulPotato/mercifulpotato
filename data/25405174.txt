That&#x27;s why in UK law minor speeding offences attract a fine and points on your license[0], but no criminal record, whereas offences of pedophilia result in prison time, a criminal record, and addition on the sexual offenders register.<p>The line of thinking is superficially similar, the weight of the offence isn&#x27;t, and we shouldn&#x27;t trivialise serious offences by drawing false equivalences with those that are considerably less serious.<p><i>[0] This is generally the case, but if you accrue too many points you can of course lose your license. Similarly, more serious speeding offences attract more serious penalties, and may even result in jail time. There are plenty of other examples but, see, e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-england-northamptonshire-34744459" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-england-northamptonshire-34744...</a>. The level of stupidity on display here is truly monumental.</i>')
