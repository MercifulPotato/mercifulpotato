You get more conscious about the time you&#x27;re wasting.<p>Visual Studio is the perfect example to me. I begged dad to upgrade the computer to 64&#x2F;128MB of RAM to get VC++6 to run. It was feature complete then and maybe a bit earlier. Sure supported languages and syntax of come and gone but the core product feature set (editor + intellisense) has not changed in over 20 years, yet the current version takes an order of magnitude more memory and is slower despite having a desktop more powerful than anything I could have imagined back then.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not a matter of being text based, it&#x27;s a matter of getting useful stuff done, and fast.<p>Sometimes this is about being composable and scriptable, text based generally helps here.')
