(One of the cases the court turned down raised a Section 230 issue.) He begins by embracing a particular idiosyncratic version of the platform&#x2F;publisher distinction (although he uses the word distributor instead of platform):<p>Thomas&gt; Traditionally, laws governing illegal content distinguished between publishers or speakers (like newspapers) and distributors (like newsstands and libraries). Publishers or speakers were subjected to a higher standard because they exercised editorial control. They could be strictly liable for transmitting illegal content. But distributors were different. They acted as a mere conduit without exercising editorial control, and they often transmitted far more content than they could be expected to review. Distributors were thus liable only when they knew (or constructively knew) that content was illegal.&quot;<p>Thomas&#x27; argument is essentially repeating what all Internet providers have been saying for my lifetime: &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot the messenger, we&#x27;re just the tubes.  We don&#x27;t exercise discretion over the content.&quot;  The courts looked favorably on that argument for practical reasons.  Back then though, providers were typically trying to avoid censoring, due to the fact they were hosting objectionable, possibly illegal content.  These same providers are now arguing that the unbearable costs of censorship that they can not possibly withstand for <i>illegal</i> content... well, they in fact can manage to bear for voluntarily censoring <i>legal</i> content.  And that particular legal, political content in this case is actually <i>mandated</i> with equal access provisions under election law by all other mediums.')
