Don&#x27;t burn out.<p>If you want a suggestion, I&#x27;d keep learning Vulkan on a side, but chose a higher-level graphics library for actually programming a game. Just to keep yourself interested and to see progress quicker. There are so many decisions and design choices in making a good game, so keeping graphics simple and small can give you more creative freedom. (If that&#x27;s your final goal.)')
