At work, I&#x27;ve seen IIT grads fare no better than other people. Sure, there are some brilliant people among IIT grads but that&#x27;s to be expected with a filter that selects the top 1% of any population.<p>A less known aspect of IITs in the past is their gaming of the GRE&#x2F;US grad school application process, ranging from straight out cheating in the GRE (in the paper-pencil version, IIT students were given a single block of time for all sections rather than having time-limits for the sections, a blatant cheat made possible by their self-proctoring), to creating GRE question banks by collectively memorizing the test, to using the Australian time zone (ahead of India&#x27;s) to find out the questions on the GRE. When applying to grad school in the US, IIT students would divvy up the schools among the graduating class so that no more than 1-2 would apply to top schools and claim to be in their class&#x27; top 10%, regardless of actual standing.<p>So, anytime I see an IIT grad at work, I&#x27;m not really impressed by that aspect. The fact that Satya isn&#x27;t from an IIT is of no consequence and actually makes him more credible in my eyes.')
