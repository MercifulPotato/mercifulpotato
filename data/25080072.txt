Android has had code signing ever since it was released, but you always generated the certificate yourself, and the purpose was simply to stop someone else from making an apk with the same package id that would install over yours and gain access to its data.<p>The thing Apple does, on the other hand, with trusting themselves more than the user, is disgusting. I&#x27;m mostly libertarian, but if I ever become a president, this would be one of the first things I&#x27;d make illegal, right after shortening the copyright term to like 3 years.')
