Too big to fail, etc.<p>There&#x27;s something more precise and outside the scope of &quot;economic equality&quot; when we have Pelosi with a fridge stocked with $100 ice cream and nothing to show in Congress in terms of relief while Americans are missing rent payments. I&#x27;ll use Pelosi as an example cause she&#x27;s visible but the same argument is easily applied to McConnell and everyone else too.<p>Cause at the end of the day, Pelosi doesn&#x27;t really represent industry. There&#x27;s a world of difference between, say, Amazon and the US govt. I&#x27;d trust Musk or Bezos to get me a vaccine or working covid test any day, over the mess we get from the federal govt.<p>She represents truly useless and asinine government that constrains and leeches off ordinary people. Not only is there historic debt spending, but there&#x27;s practically nothing to show for when Americans need help the most; what&#x27;re we paying fortunes for?!')
