The US top end tax rate is 37%, plus California is .... what? 13? You&#x27;re already up to giving away half of what you make in California.  Meanwhile you have to pay taxes on physical property like your house, and your house is valued at 7 figures if you live in the Bay Area. Finally, there was a VAT the last time I lived there. Meaning pretty much everything you buy with your money is also taxed. So yeah. France. Except the wine and everything else is shittier and costs more in California. France also has a functioning social welfare and medical system, and somehow manages to keep the electricity on and the air breathable. Pretty sure the murder rate in France, terrorism and everything, is significantly lower as well.<p>Oh yeah: completely ridiculous criminal things like this basically don&#x27;t happen as often in France:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;SFPDTenderloin&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334245062780153857" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;SFPDTenderloin&#x2F;status&#x2F;13342450627...</a>')
