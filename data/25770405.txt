At first glance, Elixir&#x27;s syntax is much nicer and prettier (whatever that means).  However, Erlang&#x27;s syntax is both more terse and consistent.  It has much fewer special cases, syntactic sugar and all.  It is the syntax, once you know and understand it it&#x27;s simple.<p>That is really my main issue with Elixir.  And I can understand if I&#x27;m in the minority, but I&#x27;m more comfortable typing a bit more for a consistent and predictable syntax.')
