Unless I talk with the restuarant, I have no idea about availability, time to prepare, etc...<p>And frankly, I can get my food.  I know what it costs for someone to do that and not be way underpaid, and would rather not see people underpaid.<p>And let&#x27;s be honest:  they will do everything they can to capture traffic, and will end up handling deals that would have gone to the resturaunt and will then leverage all of that.
