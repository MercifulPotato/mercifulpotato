It&#x27;s pretty obvious to me when people talk about &quot;leaving political topics out of the workplace&quot; they mean &quot;topics which are unrelated to one&#x27;s work&quot;.<p>Arguments like &quot;abortion is highly related to site reliability engineering&quot; are pretty overtly disingenuous in a very clear-cut fashion.<p>&gt; Here I have to say, I&#x27;m more likely to give the point, that those topics are not professionally relevant, but neither is sports.<p>Sports don&#x27;t cause the same degree of strife in the workplace. No one is demanding anyone&#x27;s termination because they like a different sports team or because they were caught in a photograph gesturing in a way that looks vaguely like the hook &#x27;em horns gesture (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hook_%27em_Horns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hook_%27em_Horns</a>).')
