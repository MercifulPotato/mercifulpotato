Explain to me why you or I should take the tiniest bit of risk of becoming a statistic, instead of wearing a mask. You talk as though even a few weeks of suffering is nothing, compared to the agony of wearing a mask in public.<p>There&#x27;s no heroism in contracting a disease. We&#x27;re not fighting a war. There&#x27;s no point being &quot;brave&quot;. Getting corona isn&#x27;t like falling on a grenade to save your buddies.<p>&gt; Whereas herd immunity is inevitable. Either we reach it naturally or we wait for a working vaccine.<p>There are already documented cases of reinfection,[2] so everyone has to either contract corona or get the vaccine, in order to protect those vulnerable to reinfection. Waiting for a vaccine will cost far fewer lives.<p>&gt; That is clearly better than forcing everyone to isolate themselves for months.<p>Or the alternative: wear a mask, socialize outdoors or in well-ventilated areas. Strictly isolate the truly vulnerable.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02598-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02598-6</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02948-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02948-4</a>')
