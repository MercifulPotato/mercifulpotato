The Mac is the PC from the company that more or less defined the Post-PC era. Would it not be the first to be sacrificed for the new future?<p>This to me is one of the really big but less talked-about implications of Apple Silicon. 12 months ago - before M1, before Big Sur, before the Mac Pro reboot, before the MBP 16 - the Mac had atrophied. Hardware quality had gone down, the software felt neglected (the UX update in Yosemite felt like a half-hearted skin). The Mac felt like a side-project. It felt unimportant to Apple; there was speculation that it might be turned into an iPad with a keyboard, or be dropped altogether with the all the new energy surrounding the iPad Pro. Apple seemed like it might just exit the workstation business completely.<p>In the past year that trend has been turned on its head. First they fixed the keyboard and refreshed the MBP form-factor and internals. Then they came out with the radically-powerful (and expandable!) machine that pros had been asking for for years. Then, most importantly, they came out with a <i>huge</i> financial commitment to the future of the Mac, making it a seriously compelling workstation again, and the cherry on top is a new UX that, for the first time since OS X (nearly 20 years ago!), looks like it was designed cohesively from the ground-up. No matter how you feel about Big Sur&#x27;s design choices, it shows that Apple <i>cares</i> about the Mac again. And they&#x27;re just getting started with the new silicon.<p>For an ecosystem that asks a lot in terms of commitment, it is hugely encouraging to see such an unambiguously renewed focus on this product line.')
