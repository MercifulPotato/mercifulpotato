I only claimed that EU law does allow you to lend a game. However the points you&#x27;re raising now are different issues.<p>I cover some of those points in a more detailed post here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24929034" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24929034</a><p>As for your point about copying to RAM, you have to bare in mind that the law talks about intent and human impact rather rather than scientific specifics (be that physics, computer science, etc). This is a trap many techies make on here (since we&#x27;re trained to think technically) and a point I&#x27;ve touched on before with regards to comments some made about youtube-dl. With regards to your specific point: if your playback software copies the file into RAM then that is considered playback (because that is the intent) not copying. The fact the playback requires copying is irreverent so long as the playback isn&#x27;t used with the intent to copy. However the fact that RAM is volatile reinforces that intent (otherwise we&#x27;d have an issue with almost all tech, old and new. eg LCD panels buffer image data to be displayed).<p>&gt; Also, given that Windows is sold with a limited number of installations (license activations) allowed, even in the EU, I&#x27;m not sure that the copyright case is as simple as you claim.<p>That&#x27;s a little different there because the license activations grant additional permissions rather than adding limitations (generally speaking, of course). eg if you&#x27;re licensed to install on two machines then that&#x27;s more copies than copyright law normally allows. It&#x27;s a bit like how GPL et al grant additional privileges that normally wouldn&#x27;t be allowed under the default copyright laws. The thing to remember is that companies can grant you additional rights but they can&#x27;t remove any rights you already have. So a company can say &quot;this license allows you to install on 3 computers&quot; but they can&#x27;t say &quot;this license doesn&#x27;t allow you to install on any yellow computers&quot;.')
