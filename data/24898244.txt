I hypothesize that the entire reason is, these things reduce profit.<p>For example, you used to be able to pause Google Maps.  You can&#x27;t now, and therefore, if you have &#x27;history&#x27; off, you have to stop, and manually re-start your destination by typing it in.<p>Well, history profits them.<p>And pausing is not the best, because then, you&#x27;re not active 100% of the trip.  Having you active lets them determine all sorts of things, like traffic patterns, where you go, who you&#x27;re near, and so on.<p>There are lots of little things like this, which seem to be gone from earlier versions of Maps.  Again, I presume, all to make more $.<p>Which is logical, and fine, but it gets a bit tiresome and sad at times.')
