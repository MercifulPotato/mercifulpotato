Apple isn&#x27;t a monopoly in phones because of Android. And Google&#x27;s search is so inherently tied to selling ads as a business model that separating them is a difficult argument -- plus search competitors are just a click away, as evidenced by how much Google pays Apple to be the default.<p>But these aren&#x27;t the complaints being bade, at least not the ones in the lawsuits we know of so far.  The Google lawsuit, for example, targets its practice of paying companies to make it the default search engine in order to maintain it&#x27;s monopoly on search.  It isn&#x27;t seeking Google divest from its ad business.<p>That being said, there&#x27;s no reason search can&#x27;t be separated from the ad business.')
