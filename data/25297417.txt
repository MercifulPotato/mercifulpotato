At the level at which they compete (similarly speced Intel Mac sold until recently, Surface machines, PC laptops of the same price) they obliterate them.<p>&quot;meh at the prosumer level&quot; for a consumer level machine is kinda like saying that an AMD Threadripper &#x2F; 64 cores is meh as the mainframe level.')
