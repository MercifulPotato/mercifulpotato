Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=[24933607], score=None, time=1603995014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24933291, text='This is information that is trivially verifiable and has been verified by numerous sources.<p>There&#x27;s already been leaks such as a video of Hunter Biden smoking crack while receiving a footjob (edit: if this seems crude, I&#x27;m mentioning it as something that makes it very clear that the info is real) so unless you think it&#x27;s a deepfake - or that they hacked it from his iCloud account and made up the story about the laptop repair shop - then you cannot deny the veracity of the story.<p>It&#x27;s also been corroborated by people like the aforementioned Bobulinski. If this were truly a false story it would be trivial for the Biden campaign to deny the allegations.<p>The reason this story is not being reported is not because it&#x27;s not &quot;verifiable&quot;; even ignoring that it is verifiable, the media had no trouble publishing the unverified story of Trump&#x27;s tax returns, the unverified and now completely debunked Russia collusion hoax (if you&#x27;re not read up on it, please don&#x27;t reflexively downvote - with what we know today it is now certain that it was actually a manufactured hoax and not just an innocent misunderstanding), etc. So there is absolutely a double standard at play and it&#x27;s very plain to see if you go look for it, but if you just stick to CNN and other mainstream media you will literally <i>never</i> see the full story (or even a fraction of it).')
