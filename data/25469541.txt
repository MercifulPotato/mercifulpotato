Companies want to attract talent, so they&#x27;ll highlight the best parts during the hiring phase. Employees may also be reluctant to express any frustration to a candidate too, since they might convince the candidate to turn away, which could get that employee in trouble.<p>On the flip side, getting feedback from sites like Glassdoor might give the wrong impressions too. Some employees may have left on bad terms and leave scathing reviews that may not reflect the common experience of the other workers.<p>That said, for future opportunities, be sure that you get a chance to talk to employees who either have or have had your position, plus managers. Ask them how often they attend meetings, how much time they get to work uninterrupted, how they have advanced at the company, how much control or how much of a voice they feel they have, what their biggest accomplishments at the company have been, etc. Also find out why that position is open now. That can say a lot.<p>Finally, ask to see the working environment if you haven&#x27;t. For me, during my last job, I ran through the interviews without seeing the office space and ended up accepting the offer. The workplace turned out to be a warehouse that was converted into a gigantic, cacophonous open office. They had a ping pong table too, so when someone would play, that&#x27;s all that the 50+ people in the room would hear.')
