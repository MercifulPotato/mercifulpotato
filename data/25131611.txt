Can you just keep adding more and more dishes, as long as you please, each one pointing at one satellite, with zero interference from any other of your ground dishes? No, I rather suspect not. When you are uplinking, there&#x27;s probably going to be other satellites also getting some of your signal, especially as we move from 1000, to 10,000, to beyond numbers of satellites. This is not my field, but I feel like there are some very interesting limits to uplinking, a lot of constraints, that the sky itself can only hold so much uplink capacity, and it&#x27;d be interesting to me at least to have some more back-of-napkin discussions on what those constraints really look like.')
