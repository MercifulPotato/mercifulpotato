If you email info@state.gov and offer to sell it to them, it auto-replies with a warrant. They&#x27;ll definitely take it, but they will not pay for it.<p>Better to sell it to some random American who thinks they won the lottery.<p>Edited to add: I guess a Russian warrant wouldn&#x27;t mean much in the article&#x27;s case. She basically paid a premium to not deal with a government.<p>Edited to add: best to not steal it in the first place, obviously. Obviously don&#x27;t steal state secrets, don&#x27;t loot your capitol, and just be cool.<p>I&#x27;m trying to get into her headspace so I can understand her. I think what she did was bad.')
