Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25904237], score=None, time=1611588367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901651, text='&gt; you should be allowed to do EVERYTHING which doesn&#x27;t affect others without their consent<p>People don&#x27;t exist in vacuums. Nearly every decision you make is going to affect society somehow. If you decide to eat fast food for every meal and become obese, that isn&#x27;t happening in a vacuum. Sooner or later you will start putting strain on the healthcare system and if enough people do the same, the &quot;joy-destroying overlords&quot; are going to start taxing sugar and fat (or other agency-limiting measures) to save you from yourself. Is that the world you want to live in - where the government has to increasingly limit everyone&#x27;s agency in order to save more lives?')
