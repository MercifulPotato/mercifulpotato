All this does is criminalize the use of e2ee for everyone, which solves the whole &quot;crime&quot; problems for exactly no one. Your kids aren&#x27;t any safer, but everyone who needs e2ee (journalists, activists, vulnerable&#x2F;opressed groups) now needs to engage in criminal behaviour. That&#x27;s the opposite of solving the problem.')
