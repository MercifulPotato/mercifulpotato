That&#x27;s an incredible story.<p>I wonder if this thread might have gone differently if I&#x27;d used dentists or physicians as an example. Still plenty of corruption and cartel building in the AMA.<p>My point about lawyers is that when you demand that software engineers act &quot;like professionals&quot;, you&#x27;re demanding that they behave as if they have a professional status that they actually don&#x27;t have. That doesn&#x27;t mean software developers shouldn&#x27;t take that stand - all employees should - but we&#x27;re just employees. If we attempt to behave as professions bound by a code of ethics that goes beyond &quot;ordinary employee&quot;, this does mean we&#x27;re taking on the obligations without the benefits.<p>But that aside... if I point out that lawyers can not report to non-lawyers and can bar those who do from practice, and that this is a component of what help lawyers <i>do the right thing</i>... well, I can&#x27;t really claim that the conversation has taken a tangent when people respond with <i>are you kidding me</i>. Sometimes it&#x27;s fair enough that the analogy overwhelms point.<p>People might (reasonably) take this line if I&#x27;d used physicians as an example, but I do think it probably would have been a better choice that distracted less from the point I was trying to make.')
