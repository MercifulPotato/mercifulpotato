It&#x27;s that most auditors - especially once you leave the &quot;ship a physical product with verifiable physical properties&quot; sector - instead look like E&amp;Y, which I trust less than most of the companies they have audited.<p>You eventually need to have someone who will be substantially at risk if the audit is insufficient - &quot;skin in the game&quot; to use the modern idiom - controlling the audit. In the case of UL that&#x27;s insurances companies (which are highly regulated by... the government), for other NRTLs it&#x27;s the government directly.')
