There are often experimental or very expensive treatments that the provincial health care systems don&#x27;t cover, and so every few months I hear about some medication for a rare disease or cancer that someone is struggling&#x2F;lobbying to get covered.<p>One historical example is Herceptin, for treating breast cancer. It took six years to get the Ontario gov&#x27;t to finally cave and cover it, meanwhile some people were traveling to Buffalo or other places in the US and paying out of pocket to get it. See this old article from 2005: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;ontario-makes-herceptin-widely-available&#x2F;article1122113&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theglobeandmail.com&#x2F;life&#x2F;ontario-makes-herceptin...</a><p>On average, yes, it is better to be a cancer patient here than in the US, especially if you&#x27;re working class or poor. And I believe last time I looked the life expectancy and recovery rates statistics etc. bore that out.<p>But there are definitely medications and treatments not covered, still, and having extra insurance coverage is important enough that people I know have struggled to keep their jobs so they could continue to pay for their partner&#x27;s treatments.<p>In general, in Canada, medical care is covered but prescription pharmaceuticals are not. Which needs to be remedied.')
