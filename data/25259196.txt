Item(by='kodah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606771628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259127, text='In my observation this is just the way that people debate these days. They know that there are one or more contenders in the room but at least one that is in stark contrast to their view. They arrive at the most maximal conclusion possible, apply a moralistic impetus (everyone will die because of <i>you</i> and <i>your</i> ideas), we accept the proverbial threat and move on. If someone who isn&#x27;t in stark contrast to their opinion continues to object then they just find a way to shove them in the box of whatever that stark contrast group is and follow the normal rules. The really creative part is when their contender also does this. At this point it&#x27;s a race to the bottom of describing their opponent with various pejoratives and unrelated adjectives or sometimes it&#x27;s as simple as having the best meme.')
