It was touch-and-go on declaring it a national disaster but in the end it wasn&#x27;t, and it fell to volunteers to clean up the surface evidence of the spill, at least what hadn&#x27;t made it down the fox river and out to sea.<p>Quite a bit more of that kind of thing expected with the increase in extreme weather events from climate change. In Westland alone there are another 12 at-risk old landfill sites. It&#x27;s estimated that the cost of preventing further spills from the one already-open landfill alone is ~2.3M. In an economically depressed region like Westland it won&#x27;t be funded, and they&#x27;re far from the only region in NZ that&#x27;s facing this problem. Just the first to have experienced a spill event.')
