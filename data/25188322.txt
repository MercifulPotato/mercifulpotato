It&#x27;s a medium for discussion. You&#x27;re on Twitter, having a conversation with a set of specific individuals. Some of them disagree with you and you are trying to convince them of your position. <i>You</i> are responding to public claims that <i>they</i> made <i>about you</i>.<p>Now Twitter decides that you&#x27;re guilty of crimethink and you are invited to start your own website. But who is going to go there? The things you write there don&#x27;t appear in anyone&#x27;s feed as a rebuttal to the dubious claims being made against you on Twitter. If one person shows up to engage with you, they find no community and no multi-party discussion happening there, so they leave, and so does the next person.<p>And the people making the dubious claims against you are happy to see you go and have no reason to follow, because now they can preach to their audience of millions without encountering any criticism from anyone who disagrees with them. Meanwhile someone builds anti-Twitter which has all the same problems but a different political alignment, exacerbating the polarization of the country by preventing anyone from engaging with anyone who doesn&#x27;t share the same set of preconceived notions, because both sites ban anyone who disagrees with The Preferred Party and there is nowhere that people with genuine disagreements can hash them out without one of them getting booted.')
