The science is solid:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;righteousmind.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;righteousmind.com&#x2F;</a></i><p>&quot;The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion?&quot;. Hmm...<p>So, from your comment, I&#x27;m guessing that the answer in the book to the question in the subtitle is that there is some baked in &quot;morality&quot; in us, that evolution gave us? If so, that&#x27;s extremely misguided.<p>If there was such a thing, it would be at least somewhat similar across all human tribes and cultures. That&#x27;s not the case at all. It&#x27;s vastly different throughout history and across cultures because these things have everything to do with power dynamics and resource distribution.<p>&gt;<i><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;meiU6TxysCg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;meiU6TxysCg</a></i><p>And? Monkeys have hierarchies. If they repeated this experiment but swappped the monkeys, it would turn out differently. The experiment is designed and orchestrated to show some sort of &quot;equal pay&quot; nonsense. What is happening is that the monkey on the left is socially higher than the one on the right... and hence it is used to claiming better food for itself first. When it sees the other one gets it, it gets pissed off. When these higher ups get injured, get sick or get old, someone else claims the status. It&#x27;s all power dynamics and fight over resources. It has nothing to do with &quot;morality&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>What kind of unhinged philosophy are you smoking? Objectivism? Marxism? Freebasing Solipsism?</i><p>I don&#x27;t know what your western intellectuals call it but if I were to translate it to English, it would roughly translate to &quot;reality&quot;.')
