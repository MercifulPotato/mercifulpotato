It means you can&#x27;t educate your children, it means you and your family are vulnerable to all the social ills that afflict those who are in poverty. Being poor gives you the short end of the stick in almost every way that matters.<p>It&#x27;s not like everyone (or anyone, really) can live like the family in the film &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, isolated in the woods, yet somehow thriving, more fit, and better educated.
