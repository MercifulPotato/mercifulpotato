Most criticisms of Tesla are superficial comparisons.<p>Yes the paint and interior aren&#x27;t as good as a comparably priced BMW or Audi, they had to cut corners somewhere to hit their price point. I&#x27;m glad they chose a simplified interior and crappy paint over compromising the power train or telematics.<p>It&#x27;s like complaining that a 26.73gram gold nugget isn&#x27;t as shiny as a brand new silver dollar.')
