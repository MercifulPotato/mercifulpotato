Cool. The c-suite plus your accountants are going to prison for the next five years and we&#x27;re seizing the X billion you actually owe plus a punitive fine.&quot;<p>Seems like this is a bit on the difficult to enforce side. Incidentally, profit is what is taxed, so the easy way to avoid tax is to simply not be profitable. Individuals pay tax on all of our income from interest and employment so this difference always feels somewhat unfair. The very laws that allow companies to avoid paying income tax are usually created as incentives: do this (HQ in Ireland), and in trade, you get to pay less in tax. The C suite and lawyers are usually guilty of meticulously obeying the law, which really makes the whole thing feel even more unfair. Reality is that the system is working as coded, but there are bugs in the code.')
