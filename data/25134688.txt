On the scale of &quot;much more than we need&quot;. Then they should also heavily subsidize carbon capture and possibly also tech to turn it into liquid fuels again.<p>Getting petrol cars off the road is just not going to happen on the time scale it&#x27;s needed. If the 10 years until the ban would be spent building enough solar, carbon capture and fuel generation, we&#x27;d be in a much better state. We&#x27;d literally have a knob that controls the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.')
