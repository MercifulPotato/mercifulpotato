I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s how it has historically worked. I don&#x27;t profess to know how far things will fall.<p>I will note that historically the busts take time to play out just like the booms do. Dot-com 1 burst around April 2000 but I don&#x27;t think the rents fully bottomed out for nearly two years.<p>Anyway you&#x27;re right that things don&#x27;t come back ever exactly as they were before. I just think more breathing room will open up.')
