But that&#x27;s not contradictory with what I described. Tandy released a lot of business software; basically, its counterparts to the prepackaged turnkey systems for accounting&#x2F;word processing&#x2F;inventory that system integrators&#x2F;VARs were by 1977 starting to assemble around CP&#x2F;M S-100 systems. Tandy didn&#x27;t mind third-party development as long as it was the publisher, and its stores only sold products with the Tandy Radio Shack logo somewhere.<p>As I mentioned, independent computer stores—the Byte Shops, the Computerlands—didn&#x27;t bother to carry TRS-80 products, despite the huge customer base, because they understandably didn&#x27;t think they could compete against Radio Shacks everywhere. Same with toy and department stores that after 1980 became the primary home-computer sales channel for Commodore and Atari. Since company-owned Radio Shacks couldn&#x27;t carry anything without the Tandy logo, <i>80 Micro</i> and other magazines became the <i>only</i> way for third-party developers who didn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t get approval for resale by Radio Shack to reach customers. And since corporate policy prevented Radio Shack clerks from admitting that third-party magazines or products existed (even while a Tandy executive wrote a regular column for <i>80 Micro</i>, and the company regularly advertised in its pages), the only way a TRS-80 or Color Computer customer knew of this gigantic ecosystem&#x27;s existence is if a friend told him, or he happened to walk by a newsstand with <i>80 Micro</i> or <i>Rainbow</i> magazine.<p>Compare this to Apple. A very important factor in the II&#x27;s early popularity was school districts buying it to run educational software from MECC like <i>Oregon Trail</i> and <i>Lemonade Stand</i>. But this was not inevitable. A teacher or administrator in a rural school district in 1979 looking to purchase computers would naturally look to the Radio Shack in town, but would only have found incredibly crude Tandy-published software. Even with such handicaps Radio Shack had a substantial portion of the educational market, which after 1980 quickly eroded until 1985, when Tandy had an unexpected second computer boom driven by the PC-compatible Tandy 1000.')
