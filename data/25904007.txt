Intermediaries are desirable: they solve problems so that the end users don&#x27;t have to do it. It&#x27;s fundamental to programming, in fact: you don&#x27;t handwrite machine code, you use a language with libraries that gets interpreted or compiled to run on an operating system that provides lots of useful facilities and abstractions so that you don&#x27;t have to care whether the machine is connected via a 3Com 905b or a Lucent Orinoco, and the same code that worked over those obsolete interfaces still works over a 10gig fiber NIC.<p>In particular, intermediaries allow people to fix mistakes. And people make mistakes all the time.<p>People like banking; it&#x27;s individual banks that they hate. Better regulation fixes that. Unregulated transactions are terrible: the entire history of finance proves that people will lie, cheat and defraud each other if given half a chance.<p>Financial safety comes from the ability of a trustable third party to adjudicate and correct mistakes and disputes.<p>If you want to compile a credit rating, you need an accurate history of transactions. Blockchains don&#x27;t give you accurate histories, they give you timestamped signed logs of entries that are really really difficult to amend. &quot;This landlord reported that I was late on rent but I&#x27;ve never lived in that state&quot; is a complaint that a credit agency must accept and evaluate.<p>Eliminating notaries: the purpose of a notary is not just to say &quot;this event happened at this time&quot; but to say &quot;I witnessed this event happening at this time&quot;. A blockchain can&#x27;t do that. You need to trust the notary as well as the notary&#x27;s log, and random people adding entries doesn&#x27;t make them trustable.<p>Record of private property and deeds: you literally want a single authoritative database here, where every write operation is done by a trusted person.<p>Each of these cases is not &quot;we need a blockchain&quot; but &quot;it&#x27;s good to have a signed, difficult-to-forge journal that can be inspected and verified&quot;.<p>Your last point is basically &quot;we don&#x27;t know what cryptocurrencies are good for.&quot;')
