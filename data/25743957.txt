It eventually landed on a ship, and the ship turned to gold, and sank.<p>It defied my intuition, from where I sat only the plank on which it fell should be turned to gold, not the entire ship, for if the entire ship did, apparently it&#x27;s power could transfer simply to objects pressed close enough to that which it touched, and that was inconsistent with past portrayal.<p>Clearly however the ship as an entire identity satisfied the intuition of the script writers, but my intuition felt that the plank was a single identity, not the ship.<p>There are no definitions and rigor here — it is simply every man&#x27;s individual intuition.')
