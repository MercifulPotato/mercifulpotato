I&#x27;m far better off not owning a car than if I had one, for instance, whether you measure in money or aggravation. Public transport here is lovely, rentals of multiple flavors plentiful, and maybe I&#x27;m strange, but when I owned a car, I knew what it cost me to own per mile or per day of ownership. It was routine for me to mentally estimate the cost of a trip.<p>But on the other hand, I own a lot of specialty tools that probably only see a few minutes of use per year each, if that. Not having them means waits, sometime long waits, or making something to make do.<p>Someone who chose to have kids probably prefers the car. What makes sense to own depends on what you do.')
