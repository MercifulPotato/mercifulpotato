Item(by='tuatoru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604837247, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021562, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve been wondering why &quot;audio interfaces&quot; are so expensive.<p>They&#x27;re a minority interest. Designing good DACs is a subtle art and the engineer costs are amortised over small production runs.<p>The design of the ancillary circuits (analogue preamps, headphone monitoring, phantom power, input and output protection), and mechanical design and integration are also time-consuming and tricky (=expensive) to make reliable and within design goals. And marketing costs are probably as large as engineering.<p>You certainly could do it yourself, but the component cost is the least of your worries. You&#x27;ll need a fair bit of bench gear - oscilloscope, function generator, various power supplies, DVM, ...  but even that&#x27;s not the problem.  You need a lot of knowledge about component selection and circuit design and layout, and a lot of experience with the tools of the trade.<p>Making something like the Presonus (but probably six or ten times as big, because I can&#x27;t do an all-in-one circuit board with all those functions on it and have it work in any reasonable timeframe), getting it to a state where I would let an unknown mic or computer be plugged into it, or let someone else use it, would easily take me more than three hundred hours.  If you&#x27;re new to this, multiply by n (n &gt;=3).')
