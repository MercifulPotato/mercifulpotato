I recommend using a language that forces you to do type checking like haskell. Haskell is super hard so just use it until you see the light and understand why typing is better.<p>I would say get good enough with haskell to write a 2 human player tic-tac-toe game by following some online tutorials. Then you&#x27;ll be able to pick up types in python like it was nothing.<p>Otherwise if you have used a type checked language... Python types are really straight forward. I never needed a tutorial. Whenever I needed a feature (such as type variables) I would look it up via google.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t actually know if you&#x27;ve ever played with a type checked language but I&#x27;m assuming you haven&#x27;t because python type checking is pretty easy to pick up without a tutorial based resource if you have had prior experience in other languages.')
