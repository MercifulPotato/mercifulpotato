If I&#x27;m using Element&#x2F;Matrix and a colleague is using WhatsApp, or Signal, or Telegram, or Briar.  Can they reliably send me messages?  Can I reliably send them messages?<p>I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s possible, but more than one person I know has tried and failed.  Is it common?  Reliable?
