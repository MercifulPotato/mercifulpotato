Where I work now, all of our PMs are subject matter experts.  Some of our software relates to chemicals and our PM for that project is a former research chemist, for example.  Their input is invaluable, since they know both the problem domain and the software development domain.<p>In a former job, at an agency, we didn&#x27;t have that but still the PMs were the ones who dealt with cranky customers and sat through long meetings with sales etc.  Also, good PMs will tell you when something doesn&#x27;t matter so you don&#x27;t waste time on it.<p>In either case, they handle all the difficult stuff and get us the info we need to do our jobs well.  If I was to go back to freelancing or consulting, I&#x27;d hire a manager right away to handle all that stuff so I don&#x27;t have to.')
