Crime is down, policing is working: stop expanding police force size, keep budgets in place, and see what happens. We have no idea if it&#x27;s &quot;more&#x2F;higher paid cops&quot; that&#x27;s causing the reduction in crime, or other societal factors.  At a certain point it&#x27;s diminishing returns to continue investing in something to try and move those last couple percentage points. You&#x27;re never going to have a 0% crime rate, no matter how much money you throw at the problem.')
