Cutting soda (I was drinking diet soda) out of my diet has really changed how I taste.<p>I used to love crappy sour gummy candy, and I can&#x27;t stand it anymore. It&#x27;s far too sweet, and there&#x27;s not really a remarkable flavor beyond syrupy sweet and a vaguely fruit-like flavor. It doesn&#x27;t even taste like really sweet fruit to me, the sweet and fruit flavors seem disjointed.<p>I do have a sweet tooth for fruit smoothies, though, which are probably not a ton better in terms of sugar content. I do no sugar added, but there&#x27;s still a ton of sugar in enough fruit to blend and fill a cup. Hell, even cheese tastes sweet to me sometimes, depending on the kind of cheese.')
