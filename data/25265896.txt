In our conversations with user researchers we found that researchers often know what they want to ask, but they end up breaking it up into loads of different (often vague) questions in order to retrofit their research objective into survey format. Because you&#x27;re less limited in scope with an open-survey like OpinionX, you&#x27;re able to much more directly set the direction and question of a survey. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s up to the researcher to write the best question possible, but we feel that OpinionX gives more breathing room and allows them to ask more directly if needed.')
