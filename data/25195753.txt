When there&#x27;s no clear set of criteria for a permit and people get denied for this or that or maybe no reason at all.  Just try getting a (unrestricted) LTC in Boston, near impossible -- unless you &quot;have friends&quot;.  This is how LTCs (License To Carry) work in Massachusetts, it&#x27;s city by city dependent on the Chief of Police.<p>The criteria should be clear and contestable in court.  Like it or not, it&#x27;s a constitutional right and the law should be &quot;shall issue&quot; (unless good reason not to -- and I&#x27;m all for reasonable &quot;good reasons not to&quot;).')
