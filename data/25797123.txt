It&#x27;s not the greatest language in the world, but understanding it&#x27;s interpreter and how to use it from your system side is pretty easy as these things go.<p>It&#x27;s really REALLY well suited to be embedded into whatever system you need it in.  The whole runtime is like nothing.<p>And it runs damn fast for an embedded language, there&#x27;s like 10 opcodes or something? compared to pythons 100+ (at the time we did the comparison like 10 years ago).<p>Further context, I think we ported our android luaJIT to windows phone 7 in like, a day?  It was super trivial.')
