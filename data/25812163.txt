They’re all huge, all growing, and all outpacing the growth of traditional non-“cloud” hosting providers by a long shot. They’re also all greatly beating out any other cloud providers who aren’t them, e.g. IBM Cloud (nee Softlayer.)<p>They’re essentially dividing up the hosting market together, like any good cabal.<p>Compared to the growth all three of the big cloud providers are experiencing, the <i>relative</i> growth margins they use to claim that one of them is “the biggest” are basically noise.<p>To put it another way: I’d much rather invest in all three of them, than in just one of them.')
