Discord servers often go down and I&#x27;ve found myself having to switch to central or whatever to get it to work.<p>My real-world experience is that mumble servers go down more often and for longer - you&#x27;re usually at the mercy of an individual hobby sysadmin. In theory Discord&#x27;s uptime is pretty bad, but in practice it actually does beat the alternatives.')
