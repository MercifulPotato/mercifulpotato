However, Despite following Dat since about 6 years ago, the general organization has always been lacking. I took a break from following it and all “tech” for all of 2020 as I needed a breather and focused on other offline interests. The new Beaker Browser v1 was finally released which was a big milestone and this news hit my radar. It inspired me to delve back in to this particular technology and went down the hyper rabbit hole. I read about the change from Dat to Hyper and spent the last week or so trying to grok all the reorg and docs. It’s dizzying. I’m both very interested in using this tech again and sadly also frustrated with the org issues which seem not so much better than previous but just different.<p>On a high level, there are improvements from rebrand to abstraction and generalization of components to allow for a better path forward. I can def see a developer who never followed Dat having a lot of problems grasping Hyper Protocol without investing a lot of upfront time... since it’s been difficult for me who has used Dat pretty extensively and followed all things Dat prior to 2020.<p>I think they are going about this the right way, though, and it will just take time for it all to get calibrated and be more cohesive. I’m sure they will take all the help they can get so hopefully more people will get involved because the tech has def improved a lot and IMO is a big deal in p2p.')
