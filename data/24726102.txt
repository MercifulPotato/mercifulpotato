IIRC from the company meeting we had with an attorney who specializes in this subject, taking a political stance can fall under the category of indirect participation in a political campaign. If you&#x27;re using company channels to make a statement, you&#x27;re effectively campaigning under the official badge of that company, even if you&#x27;re only talking to one other person who happens to work for that same company. You don&#x27;t want to provide any ambiguity, however slight, to allow regulators to make a case for removal of the charity status. That can be the death of the company in many cases. What sounds reasonable to a layman and what sounds reasonable to a lawyer can be miles apart here.')
