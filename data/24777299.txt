It was one of the best courses I ever took.<p>Prior to that, my writing was abysmal. My high school English teachers were helpless. And I even managed to get through Princeton barely understanding the mechanics of putting together a coherent argument. Start a paragraph with a topic sentence? No one ever told me that.<p>It was so bad that I sought this course out. To the best of my recollection, it wasn&#x27;t offered in the business school, so I had to make a special effort to take it.<p>It paid off. I wish I could take it again, just as a refresher.')
