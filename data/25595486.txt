Item(by='darawk', descendants=None, kids=[25603783], score=None, time=1609439487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25593584, text='&gt; Do you have anything to back up this wrong claim? It very much seems like this is a matter of perspective.<p>It&#x27;s pretty straightforward economics, and the rest of my comment explains it, I think.<p>&gt; Again this seems like perspective. The taxpayers as a group may be subsidizing themselves but the individual making enough to support themselves would be subsidizing others. So from their perspective they are paying for a companyâ€™s unwillingness or inability to pay a living wage.<p>The question is: where does the economic benefit of the subsidy flow? And the answer to that is primarily back to consumers, not to companies. It flows to companies primarily in the sense that it allows some companies to exist that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise exist. But it&#x27;s not clear exactly how making them not exist would benefit anyone.')
