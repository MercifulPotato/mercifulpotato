The argument makes no assumption even about plasma confinement.  It&#x27;s all about the limits on areal power density at the reactor walls.<p>The conclusion he reaches, that fusion reactors will have a volumetric power density at least an order of magnitude lower than a fission reactor, is not contradicted by ARC.  The volumetric power density of ARC (from the ARC paper I linked to elsewhere in these comments) is 0.5 MW(th)&#x2F;m^3 (counting the volume of the entire reactor, not just the plasma) vs. 20 MW(th)&#x2F;m^3 for the primary reactor vessel of a PWR -- a factor of 40 worse.<p>His suggestion to look at aneutronic plasmas didn&#x27;t pan out, as you note, but that doesn&#x27;t save DT fusion.   I&#x27;ll note that it&#x27;s his PhD student Todd Rider who shot down the non-Maxwellian schemes that aneutronic fuels would have needed.  After that, Lidsky switched to working on fission for the rest of career and life.')
