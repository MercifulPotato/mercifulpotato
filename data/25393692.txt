I suppose it depends on how frequently it pulls how quickly the price goes up and how expensive such a pull is in reads.<p>In Fauna we have temporality as a first-class citizen. You can get efficient and cheap changesets by leveraging temporality since you can just ask: &quot;what has been added&#x2F;removed in this collection or index match after timestamp X&quot; and can combine that by writing an index that delivers you the answer to &quot;what are the updated documents in a collection after a certain timestamp?&quot;. That brings you very cheap pull-based CDC.<p>We recently introduced a second possibility that allows for push-based streaming for documents. Document-based streaming allows you to open separate streams for multiple existing documents to get updates on those. This is only the first phase, sets (such as index matches or whole collections) are coming up. Streaming becomes cheaper if you want your data to be really life (&lt;1s) which is excellent for UI redraws but could potentially also be used for CDC (probably in combination with the temporal features if you need to restart streams). Both push-based as pull-based are strongly ordered.<p>I describe how to get the query for the pull-based approach here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.fauna.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;example-custom-subscription-function&#x2F;267" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.fauna.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;example-custom-subscription-funct...</a>\nAnd a blog on the streaming API can be found here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fauna.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;live-ui-updates-with-faunas-real-time-document-streaming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fauna.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;live-ui-updates-with-faunas-real-time...</a><p>Once set streaming (next to document streaming) is out as well, we have two strong solutions and you can choose what suits you best and what is most efficient for your use case. Do you want instant UI redraws? Use push-based, are you pulling a changeset every houre? Use pull-based.')
