Since then, the additions seem (to me) to be more academic and interesting to computer scientists, so I haven&#x27;t really found the need to keep up. I think C++11 hit the sweet spot. Threading, Smart pointers, std::unordered_xxx hash tables, strongly typed enums, lambda functions, are great and useful. Tuples, initializer lists, range-based for loops, type inference are convenient, I don&#x27;t see how they hurt. R-value references and constexpr are neat academically, but I&#x27;ve so far failed to see the practical killer app for them, or how they could improve my existing code. The rest of C++11, I either haven&#x27;t looked into or just haven&#x27;t been convinced make my code better than without.')
