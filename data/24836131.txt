There are some parts that just wouldn&#x27;t work without ownership (like guards), and many that are far less ergonomic than they could be with GC (like iterators).<p>If you make a language GC by default with opt-in ownership, what does your standard library look like? It either isn&#x27;t usable in ownership code, or it&#x27;s crippled for GC code.')
