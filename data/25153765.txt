Important thing to note here is we use Cloud as an IaaS only. We have our own stack which sort of prepares the hosts before it is ingested into clusters as usable capacity.<p>We actually recommend not using custom cloud providers Databases or any other value added services.<p>Why not completely either way (on prem vs cloud) is something that happened way before I joined the group but I think the main reason is to have a tactical edge in the long run such that we avoid lock in.
