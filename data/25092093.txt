Now with Big Sur a deal breaker for me has been the redesign of the menu bar. There&#x27;s so much wasted space, menu bar is too much transparent with less contrast and the widgets are completely useless. The whole thing looks like a bad attempt at standardizing macos with the rest of the ipad&#x2F;iphone echo system.')
