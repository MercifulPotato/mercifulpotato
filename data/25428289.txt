It is associated with a significantly heightened risk for multiple mental illnesses and suicide.<p>It would make sense that someone would want to get rid of gender dysphoria, not the other way around.<p>&gt;&gt;I&#x27;ve been forced to not transition, and it was utter hell.<p>How were you forced to not transition? Did someone threaten to punish you in the event that you made an attempt to? Or was it just a matter of the procedure not being available to you?<p>Anyway, would it be hell to not transition, if you didn&#x27;t have gender dysphoria?<p>&gt;&gt;Development of such a treatment would be immediately followed by it being forced on people.<p>This is speculation, and your speculation on how such a treatment would be used doesn&#x27;t create a moral justification to exert totalitarian force on others to prevent them from developing the treatment.')
