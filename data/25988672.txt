Every time I started a new project or a PoC, I required some sort of networking layer with some specific functionality: client&#x2F;server, p2p (via proxy), mesh, rpc, reconnect mechanism, custom auth, e2ee and most importantly to be able to run on browsers with a relatively low footprint (currently at: 24kb)<p>This library is still a work in progress, I know there is still much work to be done, but I wanted to ask for some feedback.<p>What do you think about it?')
