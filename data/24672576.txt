Python has challenges from the fact that its standard library is big - the interfaces (and so design) for a lot of these things are locked in place and you get stuck with suboptimal situations. And a lot of maintenance is required by the core team. Python 3 used the opportunity of backwards incompatibility to fix the worst issues, but that&#x27;s a one time opportunity.<p>Rust consciously decided to keep the standard library minimal due to the backward compatibility guarantees they want to give, and then provide an excellent packaging story so that it&#x27;s easy to pull in more capabilities. This allows for much faster iteration and improvement on what Python might consider &#x27;core&#x27; capabilities.<p>Lots of the modules provided here are not the first attempt to achieve what they&#x27;re doing. They&#x27;re in the list because (the author considers them) the best. If they were in the standard library, maybe we&#x27;d be stuck with a worse version?')
