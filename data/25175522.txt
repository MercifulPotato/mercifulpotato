It always was opinionated, and imho for many applications the classic full-page-reload cycle is still good enough, or a js client-side app doesn&#x27;t bring any benefits besides being the cool thing to do. The docs were a problem from the beginning, but that improved a little with the official guides. As someone who used it on and off since version 1.x, it is obviously familiar and I am biased. Though it still feels like not really getting in my way when doing things and I can just write a feature and be done with it, when following the rails way.<p>In the past I spent a lot of time in the freenode #rubyonrails channel, and a lot of beginners would have benefited greatly from understanding how a MVC app works, and along with it stuff like request-&#x2F;response cycle. Especially since this also translates well into API&#x2F;client-side apps.<p>Sorry if this is a little incoherent, I am a little sleep deprived and back to the baby now :-)')
