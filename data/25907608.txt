Connect that trigger to a workspace (reduce the amount of distractions from trigger to effective work) that tracks your productivity ( no exact formula yet - was thinking about app category, apm, usage time and focus switches)<p>I hope that will help me and maybe others 1. load memories about the context they are starting and dump info about old context as in the doorway effect. 2. provide less distractions and enough data to reflect on the process.<p>Currently have a very rough MacOS demo - hoping to get it to a shareable version in 4months.')
