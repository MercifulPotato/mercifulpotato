There has been a ton of bad luck for me this year, which is mostly unrelated to covid. Including health issues, multiple legal issues, roof leak, car repairs, work performance seems lower, and a bad year for all of my hobbies (bees, garden, etc didn&#x27;t do well).<p>The luckiest thing that happened was finding a couple pounds of grifola fondosa. It&#x27;s pretty common around here, so it&#x27;s not even that lucky.')
