Item(by='obvthrowaway195', descendants=None, kids=[24888487], score=None, time=1603645376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887448, text='The reason why the validity of IQ as a measure of intelligence (and even the concept of &quot;intelligence&quot; itself in some cases) is so vociferously denied by many is precisely due to its very important implications for social policy (answers to the &quot;So what?&quot; question). That IQ is a valid measure of intelligence, is rooted in an individual&#x27;s genetics, and that individuals and ethnic groups vary in their IQ (or average IQ, for the latter), would necessarily have to imply a complete re-evaluation of the interpretation of social inequality, and of the approaches towards mitigating it.<p>I personally think that this re-evaluation is absolutely necessary, because the current model of social inequality, in which any differences between individuals and groups are attributed to environmental or cultural factors, cannot hope to ever lead to constructive policies aimed towards helping all people - regardless of their genetic potential for intelligence - to achieve their best. Even worse, certain policies which are now being advocated - such as the elimination of standardized testing - are actively harmful.<p>To answer your categorical imperative: yes, I would much prefer to live in a society where genetic differences in the intelligence potential between individuals and groups is acknowledged, because it would lead to far more sensible social policies which would benefit all - high IQ or low IQ.<p>Finally, even if you consciously choose not to care about IQ, eventually reality will rear its ugly head and force you to take it into consideration if current social policies cause a lowering of average IQ. If there is such a drift towards a lowering of IQ of the general population, whether through higher reproduction rates of the low IQ segments of the population or immigration, many of the amenities which you take for granted, such as a functioning infrastructure, which can only be supported by a population which is above a certain IQ threshold, will start to deteriorate to such a degree that the IQ problem will become impossible to ignore.')
