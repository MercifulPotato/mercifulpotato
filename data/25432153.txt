Item(by='generalk', descendants=None, kids=[25435169], score=None, time=1608051672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431792, text='I don&#x27;t have a horse in the Flash race -- it had a ton of issues but also enabled many content creators to deliver over the web in a way straight HTML&#x2F;JS was incapable of -- and yes, Flash had its time and that time is now over, but yeah. Agree. Disturbing.<p>Flash games and animations were a treat of the early&#x2F;mid-2000s web, and many folks got their start as creators there. Adobe hasn&#x27;t just stopped distributing a player&#x2F;plugin for Flash content, they&#x27;re <i>blocking</i> the existing players from playing existing content. Even if you were an archivist there&#x27;s nothing to do.<p>So yeah, this is disturbing. I can go to my city&#x27;s library and browse microfiche if I want. I can install a Gopher or a Usenet client and connect to those widely-unused protocols that still serve content. But Adobe&#x27;s reaching back and making all Flash content completely unplayable, even with players that should support it.<p>Wow.')
