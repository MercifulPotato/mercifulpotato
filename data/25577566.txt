While I hate &quot;canceling&quot; as a tactic, tit-for-tat is a dominant strategy for ensuring cooperation in repeated games. Cancel culture only works because, like the Gestapo&#x2F;Stasi&#x2F;NKVD&#x2F;KGB, the targets are seemingly random and the agents show up in force. But they don&#x27;t torture or kill, and they don&#x27;t really possess the level of asymmetric power of actual totalitarian <i>state</i> actors.<p>As such, canceling the cancelers would likely be useful under the following constraints:<p>1) Publicly state your intention to cancel anyone who cancels you; and\n2) Only cancel people defensively, never on offense;\n3) If the canceler professes a change of heart, cease the cancellation, accept the apology (forgiveness&#x2F;mercy and relatively simple reintegration for offenders is one asymmetric advantage the free speech side has going for it);\n4) Form a mutual-aid alliance with likeminded people, such that the cancelation of one implies the cancelation of all;\n5) Never under any circumstance apologize or &quot;bend the knee&quot; to a cancel mob, even if you are not completely in the right - you are not dealing with people who want to treat you as an equal, but totalitarians who want to control you.<p>I think if people who are in favor of free speech (myself included) followed those rules, cancel culture would at least plateau. A couple of prominent cancelers like Anima Anandkumar getting stung would probably allow cooler heads to prevail.')
