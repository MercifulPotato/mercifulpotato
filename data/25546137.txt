Until I pressed it one day and it told me that the &quot;EXTRA&quot; service (whatever it was), was terminated a couple of years ago.   Well, no big regret there, but I find it ridiculous that buttons on your remote become &quot;obsolete&quot; and perform no function apart from telling you that some service or other (which you never even knew about) is no longer available.')
