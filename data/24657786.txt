Item(by='thaumaturgy', descendants=None, kids=[24658080, 24659045], score=None, time=1601600890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24657693, text='Here are some of the reasons I more often read comments before articles now:<p>1. The site doesn&#x27;t render at all (I get a blank page) on my main browser because cookies are disabled on it. Reading the article requires copying the URL and switching over to another browser to load it there.<p>2. The site renders, but despite using uBlock, it&#x27;s still laden with &quot;Sign up for our mailing list&quot;, &quot;accept cookies&quot; (on my cookies-disabled browser), &quot;Buy a subscription!&quot;, or, &quot;you can&#x27;t read any more articles from this site&quot; popups. In the latter case, there&#x27;s maybe one paragraph of content available.<p>3. The articles themselves are trash about half the time and on HN specifically it&#x27;s not unusual to find comments that offer a little more depth on whatever the subject is.<p>4. Skimming the comments first is a low-effort-high-return signal for whether the article is worth clicking on anyway.<p>5. I don&#x27;t care <i>that much</i> about the subject anyway, and all I really want is a two-minute update on the topic before I drag myself back to whatever I&#x27;m procrastinating on.<p>In truth, there&#x27;s been a concerted effort from a lot of different sites over the last year-plus to discourage me from reading their content directly.')
