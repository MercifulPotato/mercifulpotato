It seems to me the problem is the human who makes a decision based on flawed evidence. This is likely to happen based on other investigative methods as well and not just facial recognition (e.g. &quot;the old lady across the street was sure she saw you breaking into that house the other day&quot;).<p>&gt; Facial recognition has also time and time again proven to be racially biased[1][2].<p>If we know about the bias, we can correct for it. First in training and decision making and then through improving the facial recognition models.<p>And again, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s racial bias in other investigative methods as well.<p>&gt; Not to mention how easy it is to create a surveillance state with facial recognition[3].<p>So long as you have the ability to install millions&#x2F;billions of cameras throughout the state and put them under centralized control. If that&#x27;s legal in the US, the problem is that the law allows it, not facial recognition. In most European countries, such a thing would be incredibly illegal.')
