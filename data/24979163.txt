It was also about $550 in 1994 dollars, or something like $900 now. That was the smallest LJ model, targeted at individuals and home offices, and one of the least expensive printers on the market other than dot matrix: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Slor0f3LJIU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Slor0f3LJIU</a><p>I don’t think I’ve spent a total of $900 on printers since then.<p>If one is willing to use a laser instead of an ink jet, quality still exists.

It’s wonderful and works flawlessly, including duplex scanning to macOS. It’s a far better price:quality mix than the LJ 4 was. It was $250, though, not $50, and as an inexpensive laser, it only prints in monochrome. If one is willing to spend $200+ and accept monochrome, good printers still exist. Today’s $900 printer will shine your shoes.')
