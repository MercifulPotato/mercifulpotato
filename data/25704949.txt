I feel like it isn’t a sustainable situation and these farmers unions are either misleading or foolish if they believe these measures will be both temporary and successful. They also seem to have a weird line about the zeitgeist against refined sugar (maybe the article mentions this as a reference to honey but honey bees aren’t so badly affected by this chemical as bumble bees are) as if they are suggesting they aren’t producing refined sugar and that they are some important part of the future desired by the people who support the neonicotinoid ban.')
