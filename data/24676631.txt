Many—if not most—of their acquisitions over the past decade only really make sense if they were intending to leverage Intel&#x27;s supposed core competencies to not just get Intel into new markets, but grab a lot more market share in those new segments. And then being part of Intel ended up not really helping those companies, because Intel couldn&#x27;t deliver on their core competencies.')
