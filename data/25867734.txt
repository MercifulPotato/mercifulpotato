They can&#x27;t just emit control characters to terminal, they must call this WinRT function first. This isn&#x27;t something you can fix, for the reasons you listed, but it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s true.<p>As a side note, Windows Terminal (the app) is absolutely fine letting programs emit and handle VT100 escapes without them issuing any particular opt-in call themselves... And upon looking, you&#x27;re the person who enabled this feature! Thanks for that, but, why is it good for terminal but bad for conhost?')
