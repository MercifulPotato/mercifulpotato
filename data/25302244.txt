Item(by='grishka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607090308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300063, text='Some people consider me a senior, yet the only sorting algorithm I actually remember and can write from scratch without consulting anything is bubble sort. And maybe insertion sort. And that&#x27;s it. Both horribly inefficient. In real life I use whatever the language provides, for example Collections.sort in Java.<p>The more general problem is just how far removed from reality are all these questions. I once tried interviewing for Google, just for fun because they sent me an email about it. They asked me about quicksort, I said that I&#x27;m able to implement it in any language I know given an hour and the ability to google things. They were apparently not very satisfied with this response.<p>Why do you need to recite things from memory on the interviews while you&#x27;ll be able to consult whatever the hell you want on your actual job? No one knows.')
