I wonder at the server architecture that can&#x27;t handle HN traffic. In this awesome, far-future science-fictional year of 2020, it should not be a feat of engineering to write something that can handle a few thousand pageloads. I&#x27;ve had posts visit the front page a couple times, and from the traffic numbers I saw, it&#x27;s not like you have to handle ten thousand concurrent connections. <i>Ten</i> concurrent connections would do it.')
