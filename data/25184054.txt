The problem is when you have a disease and there&#x27;s only one treatment around,  you&#x27;ll literally pay whatever it costs - because not having it means you&#x27;re dead.<p>These companies then turn around and extract as much money as they possibly can.  They&#x27;re monopolies, pure and simple.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this with my son&#x27;s diabetes as well. The costs continue to rise (insulin, Dexcom sensors&#x2F;transmitters, etc.)  I&#x27;ve turned down jobs because their health benefits only covered a lousier insulin pump &#x2F; glucose monitor due to an exclusive agreement with their chosen health insurer.<p>The problem is if you or a loved one isn&#x27;t sick, this doesn&#x27;t affect you one damn bit.  My dad (an italian-born immigrant) has always complained to me about our healthcare system (and he had a great healthcare plan as a GM employee.)  I didn&#x27;t really paid it much attention because I was young and healthy.  Now, quite a bit older and with family members with a variety of health issues, I realized that he (in my opinion) was right.')
