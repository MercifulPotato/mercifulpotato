And since it&#x27;s generated at build time, everything is visible to the IDE.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of reflection magic but it&#x27;s not the wild west like Ruby can be because there&#x27;s limits on what you can do to a class file once it&#x27;s loaded. It&#x27;s mostly limited to peeking at annotations on fields and methods and calling those methods or reading fields.<p>You can&#x27;t redefine the methods or fields on an object at runtime, which prevents a lot of misguided insanity.')
