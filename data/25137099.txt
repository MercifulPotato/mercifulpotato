They aren&#x27;t completely useless (yet), but I don&#x27;t think their return on value during an active shooting war against a peer state is worth it.<p>If South Korea was serious about using their proposed carriers in the manner you mention, they&#x27;d be replacing their remaining F-35A order with F-35Bs.<p>China is also in a position where it can use carriers like how the US uses them - as a big stick to punish third world countries that can&#x27;t fight back. Most other countries aren&#x27;t in that position.')
