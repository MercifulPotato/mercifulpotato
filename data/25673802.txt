A minimal static site generator would keep internal links and boilerplate consistent.  Connecting that with markdown, Org mode, or reStructured Text would help with the ergonomics.  But then you lose the goal of having no necesary tools.<p>Anyhow, if there&#x27;s one general purpose tool that predates the web and will probably be around when it&#x27;s replaced by some other content publishing standard, it&#x27;s Emacs.  You could do a lot with a minimal SSG in Emacs and Org Mode, and it would be forward compatible with whatever is in the future, as well as backward compatible to whatever you like.')
