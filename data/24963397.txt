After that it  was $X per hour with $XX minimum charge. Alternatively client could always sign for a year of support at $xxx per year.<p>Currently I have a contract where they simply pay me flat fee per year with the clause that each side can terminate it with 1 month advance notice.<p>But in my long career I&#x27;ve had all kinds of contracts. Including getting licensing fee while I maintained and own product (I paid for development myself)')
