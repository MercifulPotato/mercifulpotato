No one is expecting FAANG-level salaries with lifetime tenure.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s not hard to see how 1-year contracts at $50k&#x2F;year chase people out of research. Heck, you can&#x27;t even <i>stay</i> at this level for many years--a ton of postdoc funding has time-since-PhD limitations. It&#x27;s either up or out.<p>Funding some staff scientists  at (say) ~75k&#x2F;year with 4-6 years between renewals might enable more and better science. There&#x27;s even evidence this improves trainee outcomes too....')
