Surprised there&#x27;s nothing mentioned about it.<p>IIRC (I haven&#x27;t done LSD since 1987, although I used it quite a bit before then), it&#x27;s not so much that LSD has an impact on the heart, it&#x27;s the speed (methamphetamine) that&#x27;s often added to LSD that can negatively impact heart function.<p>In fact, I don&#x27;t recall any issues with tachycardia when using &quot;clean&quot; LSD, while that wasn&#x27;t unusual on LSD with speed.<p>I&#x27;d add that negative interactions while under the influence of LSD (i.e., &#x27;bad&#x27; trip) can certainly cause some tachycardia, as that circumstance can cause anxiety and fear.<p>However, as long as one remains in a supportive, positive atmosphere, that&#x27;s generally not an issue.<p>I did a cursory look around and found this study[0] from July 2020 which did mention tachycardia in passing, but notes that:<p>&quot;LSD use can lead to hypothermia, piloerection, tachycardia with palpitation, an elevation of blood pressure, and hyperglycemia.<p>The autonomic reactions listed above are not as significant as the mental and behavioral effects of LSD on the body.&quot;<p>However, it&#x27;s not clear whether those responses were observed or self-reported.  This is important since, as I mentioned, LSD is often (by those vending it, rather than end users) &quot;enhanced&quot; with methamphetamine and it&#x27;s also unclear whether or not such responses are limited to &#x27;bad trips&#x27; or not.<p>All that said, my experience is (obviously) anecdotal.<p>If there are other studies (sadly, since LSD is a Schedule 1[1] substance, studying its effects is rare, at least in the US) with more direct observations, I&#x27;d love to see them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK482407&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK482407&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dea.gov&#x2F;drug-scheduling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dea.gov&#x2F;drug-scheduling</a>')
