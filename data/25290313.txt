I would classify myself as Boglehead and I believe in the fundamentals of investing in stocks because in all it&#x27;s technicality (and given the buy-and-hold strategy), you are investing in a business by owning a part of it which naturally means that you will and do get the returns on it, both in terms of profits (dividends) and and value growth (appreciation of the stock value). And conventional wisdom of lending also applies to bonds.<p>That being said, again, why would cryptocurrency ever be considered as a good investment vehicle? Isn&#x27;t it analogous to me investing my money in buying USD or the British Pound (or a well diversified currency ETF), something I don&#x27;t see a lot of value in as well.')
