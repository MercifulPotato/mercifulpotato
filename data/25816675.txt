So continuous functions on curves, curves in space. And everything pertaining to functions, sets, and spaces is always in reference to curves.<p>What would be something that teaches general topology WITHOUT reference to curves? This is because I want to understand what topology has to say about structure in all different kinds of contexts (logic, information, etc...) not just geometry.')
