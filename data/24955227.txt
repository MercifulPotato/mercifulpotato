Writing functions that receive other functions as input can lead to over complicated code that&#x27;s really hard to read. It&#x27;s literally the same thing as dependency injection just with functions instead of objects.<p>Use sparingly. I would avoid altogether except for common ones like map, reduce and filter.<p>Functional programming promotes the idea of composition of morphisms and point free programming. I would use this in place of Object composition&#x2F;dependency injection&#x2F;higher order functions or whatever you want to call it.')
