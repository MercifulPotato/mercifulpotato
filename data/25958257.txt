I&#x27;ve found the community welcoming and helpful in my limited interactions. The standard library code is pretty easy to read, which somewhat mitigates the dearth of tutorials, howtos on the internet.<p>The reference capability stuff can be a bit hard to wrap your mind around, but mostly in a good way, and the compiler errors are generally pretty helpful. If you come from an OO or procedural background, there will be a sharp learning curve. My experience of learning pony reference capabilities is roughly similar (in terms of forcing you to think differently about data sharing) to learning how to work with the rust borrow checker, despite them having different goals and operational models.')
