In my family we&#x27;re keeping the tradition going, but the gifting part is getting harder as we&#x27;re getting older. The stuff we want is becoming increasingly utilitarian so we don&#x27;t want to wait, we&#x27;ll just buy it on the spot. I&#x27;m planning to convince them to do either a secret Santa or a white elephant gift exchange next year.')
