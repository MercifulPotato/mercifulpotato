For many cases they are used as a cheap excuse not to care about or even deter non-Chrome browsers at all, even when they do work mostly or completely fine. Demos, in comparison, tend to have much narrower requirements due to various constraints (many D3D demos only worked with specific graphic cards at least in the initial release, for example).')
