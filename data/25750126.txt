The main point of his thread, is that maps aren&#x27;t good at saying where voters are and are fundamentally biased (“You can be a Biden voter in a Trump household in a Biden precinct in a Trump county in a Biden district in a Trump state in a Biden country. Then what color is your land? Dirt-colored, I guess! Not only does land not vote, it doesn’t even have a preference.”).
