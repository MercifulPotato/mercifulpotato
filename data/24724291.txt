When there&#x27;s one player in town (Java &amp; Android in the two examples I used), any competing ideas never get a chance to succeed: we&#x27;re still using variations of Java, probably at this point for historical reasons, and Purism etc. is having a real rough go of it. Look at the failed attempts at competing OSes that various phone manufacturers put out. There were some duds, but I mentioned two that could have given Andriod a run for its money if there were more fragmentation in the market - and I think that would have been better for consumers.<p>&gt; arguing that there is less innovation in programming because you don&#x27;t own the rights to function names is ridiculous<p>I applaud the rhetorical flourish, but I think it misses the point. It&#x27;s not the cause of the fragmentation, but the fragmentation caused by the lost rights that improves the innovation.')
