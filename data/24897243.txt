Some of these problems were fixed in Windows 8, but it was probably too late by then.<p>(These two points are based on my own experience with Windows&#x2F;CLR&#x2F;JVM in the mid&#x2F;late 2000s and some anecdotes I heard second-hand. So I can&#x27;t really cite any public sources for them)<p>I&#x27;m sure the fact that you can customize Linux to the extreme and the lack of .Net on Linux in those days probably had a lot to do with the choice of Java, in addition to the above.<p>However, based on my reading of blogs like Mechanical Sympathy [1] a while ago (~8-10 years), there does seem to have been some demand for .Net-based solutions in the HFT space. They had code for both Java and C# in their public code.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com&#x2F;</a>')
