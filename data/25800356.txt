Class actions have the advantage of enforcing rights as long as there is a lot of money involved regardless of whether regulators want to pursue the issue. In other systems e.g. onbudsmen will decide to take on issues or not, but you might not have much control yourself. I guess many systems are more of a mix rather than one extreme. Regardless, no one system is best.')
