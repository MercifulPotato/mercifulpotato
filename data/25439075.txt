I didn&#x27;t want to give anyone the wrong impression. It&#x27;s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, too, where it&#x27;s hard to justify the expense of an audit if few people use the library, and it&#x27;s hard to find people to use the library when it isn&#x27;t audited.<p>Here&#x27;s the tracking issue for a first security audit: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brycx&#x2F;orion&#x2F;issues&#x2F;21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brycx&#x2F;orion&#x2F;issues&#x2F;21</a>.<p>Near the bottom of that issue, an employee from NCC reached out and said that they may be interested in funding an audit for Orion, though it&#x27;s been a couple months and that hasn&#x27;t gone anywhere (that I know of).')
