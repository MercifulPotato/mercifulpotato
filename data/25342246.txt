They are still widely used there for legacy reasons, however demand for AS&#x2F;400 developers (which implies proficiency in RPG language, since, as I understand, most legacy applications are written in RPG: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_RPG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_RPG</a>) is tiny; so, it&#x27;s a good language to know to potentially expect a relatively high salary or consulting rate (hello, Delphi!), but a dead end for IT career growth. I would also venture to guess that some (many? most?) companies currently using AS&#x2F;400 plan to migrate their legacy applications to the cloud.')
