Most of the criticisms from, say, 5 years ago, are being addressed.<p>For example, if by &quot;operator overloading&quot; you mean &quot;symbolic method names&quot;, then those have largely fallen out of fashion. sbt has seen huge improvements (some people dislike it, some people like it, but it&#x27;s one of the most powerful build tools out there). Compilation times also have improved.<p>As far as I am concerned, it is my favorite language, and there is so much going for it: great tooling, the upcoming 3 version, binary compatibility improvements, rock-solid JavaScript compilation, native compilation under development, and, of course, all the benefits from a language with one of the most powerful types systems around.')
