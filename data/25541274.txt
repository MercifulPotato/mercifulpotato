Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608955441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25536283, text='Their &quot;subuser standard&quot; has the following license [1]:<p>&gt; Creative Commons Zero, public domain<p>&gt; With the following exception:<p>&gt; Only standards documents identical to those released by Timothy V Hobbs(timthelion) or another person or party whom he nominates may be presented as defining “the subuser standard”. In other words: you cannot edit this document and then claim that your new standard is the official one.<p>That&#x27;s legally incoherent. You cannot have public domain with an exception. Either something is in the public domain (no copyright) or it is not (copyrighted). If it is copyrighted, then you can license it under &quot;X with the following exception&quot;. Most commonly, those exceptions grant extra rights compared to the base license (e.g. Classpath exception), occasionally they aim to take away rights compared to the base license (e.g. the notorious &quot;Commons Clause&quot;). But you can only have an exception to a copyright license if there is a copyright to be licensed, and putting something in the public domain means there isn&#x27;t.<p>CC0 is a bit of a hybrid in that it contains both a public domain dedication for those jurisdictions which recognise that, and a permissive fallback copyright license for those jurisdictions that don&#x27;t (e.g. Germany). The author claiming to make an exception to CC0, it makes sense for the later but not for the former. Does this mean the exception is only legally binding in the jurisdictions in which the fallback license applies? Or does the attempt to impose an exception nullify the public domain dedication? I don&#x27;t know, IANAL. (But I imagine many lawyers won&#x27;t know the answer either.)<p>Now, what the author aims to do here could be achieved by trademark law – claiming (or registering) &quot;subuser standard&quot; as a trademark, and then saying that even though the copyright of the standard is relinquished to the public domain, the trademark is only licensed under certain conditions. But while that would legally make sense, it isn&#x27;t what the author has actually done.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subuser.org&#x2F;subuser-standard&#x2F;standard.html#subuser-standard-licence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subuser.org&#x2F;subuser-standard&#x2F;standard.html#subuser-s...</a>')
