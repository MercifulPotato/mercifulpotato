Another advantage of the MacBook line is that I can carry one Anker USB-C &amp; A charger and charge everything I have.<p>I was looking into buying the new MacBook Air. Anybody has any particular alternative to recommend? I am looking for a new laptop and haven&#x27;t found anything similar to the MacBook Air (I hate the touchbar) for a similar price (the 16GB of RAM model, if expandable better). Anything similar is either a lot more expensive or the build quality is a lot worse.<p>Any recommendation is more than welcomed!')
