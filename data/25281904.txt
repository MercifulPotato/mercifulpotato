Unless you have all the physical variables - roll speed, angular velocity, height, shape of die, air resistance, air movement, temperature, etc to work out where it will land. So randomness is more a lack of knowledge. Randomness <i>is</i> that you are not sure.<p>And I don&#x27;t know enough about quantum mechanics to even comment on that, but that&#x27;s some weird shit too!')
