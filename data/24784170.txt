Noting the expectations for &#x27;hard tech&#x27; vs normal and breaking down the traction metrics discretely was huge for me. We&#x27;ve contemplated retaining an experienced &quot;Outsourced CFO&quot; to help us nail which metrics and models need to be conveyed in a pitch deck but this article shores up so many of the questions that we&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;m now fairly confident that I can carry on with QuickBooks and Excel in churning a deck like this out in-house.<p>Thank you!')
