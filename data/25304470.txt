We are reading the same essays.<p>More and more I am starting to think that people who are decrying pg&#x27;s writing should come clean and say whether or not they&#x27;ve started a business, and if so, what was the outcome. The outcome isn&#x27;t as relevant, but I bet there are very few people out there who have reached, lets call it &quot;Fuck You&quot; money through running their own business who would read this essay and go &quot;Hah he&#x27;s so out of touch he doesn&#x27;t even see it anymore&quot; and toss some link about Dunning-Kruger or whatever.<p>For people who are in the business of making money through getting shit built, I think what he&#x27;s saying will resonate just fine. But then again it&#x27;s one of those things where the people who need it the most are the least likely ones to take it, and vice versa. It&#x27;s akin to the &quot;It&#x27;s a good problem to have&quot; crowd when you say how you&#x27;re sick of dealing with clients on the phone even though you have a 200-person company, and they look at you sideways because they have no idea why you are complaining.<p>He&#x27;s talking about billionaires and interviews in this one, and he starts off saying how the two threads are connected. But what he&#x27;s really talking about is building-a-business-by-convincing-people-you&#x27;re-not-full-of-hot-air.<p>And unfortunately, when I see people tearing his essays apart, their ramblings strike me as nothing but hot air.<p>I think it&#x27;s HN who is out of touch more than pg is, because I don&#x27;t think the vast majority are here to build businesses whatsoever.')
