Part of the reason we share family videos, educational content, and other things is so it&#x27;s, well, shared. For me, the reasons to use Youtube-dl are:<p>1) People in bandwidth-constrained settings. If I post my videos, and colleagues in some countries can&#x27;t watch them, I&#x27;m going elsewhere.<p>2) Remixing. If I can&#x27;t make collages of family videos, I&#x27;m going elsewhere.<p>Youtube can serve masters like me, where it&#x27;s an effective platform for sharing videos I want people to watch, and where the goal is dissemination. It can serve masters like the RIAA and the MPAA, where the goal is monetization and control. It will have a hard time serving both.<p>I suspect if it tries, people like me will go to someone who caters to us. A YouYesYouNoNotTheRIAAYesYOUTube.
