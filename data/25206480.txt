What we&#x27;re seeing is migration out of cities, full of dense, energy efficient, apartment buildings, served by public transit, to suburbs and towns, full of low-density, energy intensive, housing, with just cars for transportation.<p>SF and NYC for example appear to have already lost 10%-20% of their population.
