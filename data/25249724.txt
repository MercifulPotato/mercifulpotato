Item(by='Gene_Parmesan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606698274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25248615, text='I share your pain, as someone who messes around with game engine dev as a hobby and has also read through that book. He sure made geometric algebra sound like it _should_ be useful, but man is it clear as mud to me.<p>Of course in general I&#x27;m not surprised; for instance I&#x27;m not surprised that this paper doesn&#x27;t have many practical examples. It&#x27;s higher level math, of course, and for people in that space, showing a small example where you use the geometric product to solve an abstract linear algebra problem is about as close to &#x27;practical&#x27; as you are going to get.<p>But I found it much more aggravating in that book. It&#x27;s specifically a practical book after all, meant to help lay foundations for renderer and physics engine dev -- but as you said, that section is completely devoid of any real examples of how you could integrate it to make Problem A or B easier, or how it simplifies your transform code, or literally anything. The complete lack of code examples or any such real-world applications make the chapter feel a bit out of place, maybe even tacked on or gratuitous. (Which is a shame because he kind of builds up to that chapter, dropping hints here and there about how it will fundamentally shift our understanding.)')
