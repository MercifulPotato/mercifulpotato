They fill the same high $$$$$ light duty niche that wealthy ruralites like to buy as a daily driver.<p>Ford is introducing hybrid trucks which I predict will not only become the new default, but also beat the other manufactures to market. Rivian will not ship more than 1000 trucks in 2021, and the cybertruck, at this moment, is complete vaporware.')
