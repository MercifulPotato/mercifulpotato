They ran multiple sets of experiments with much larger sets, cross-correlated their result sets, ran a solid confirmatory factor analysis, ran sub-assessments (like attachment style) to make sure they weren&#x27;t rediscovering an already known factor, and reran the same inventory assessments with each group. I mean it is only one paper, but for a Social Psychology paper the math and methods are pretty solid. Given the institutions involved in the paper, I would expect this paper to at least pass the smell test for its own field (even if the results are garbage). I&#x27;m normally quite bearish on Social Psych as well, btw.')
