China has had several bank failures reently because of this.<p>- The CCP tarnished China&#x27;s mfg. reputation, and exports are down by 80 % in some cities in 2020. A lot of those factories are relocating home or to Vietnam&#x2F;India&#x2F;etc.<p>- half of their population makes $2&#x2F;day, if they make anything (farmers are being short-changed, which is bizarre when considering China imports 30% of food even in good times, and that&#x27;s between 50%-60% in the next year.) The CCP&#x27;s average wealth targets have fallen apart, and those peasants subject to flood and locusts are ruined.')
