I don&#x27;t think it is reasonable to suggest these people think their health care is &quot;worthless.&quot;<p>The mistake here is conflating price with value. The price people are willing to pay is relative to their means. The value, on the other hand, is relative to the utility they derive from it. Moreover, there is an additional external utility accrued to society from having a better educated, healthier population.')
