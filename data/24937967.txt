My great grandmother (his mother-in-law) died of a kidney infection in one about 15 years ago.<p>He had a heart attack in 2019 that crippled him, so he was in a physical rehabilitation facility because he could barely move on his own. He was making progress right up until the pandemic started. No visitation, and then the staff neglected him, which resulted in him developing pneumonia from laying in bed so much. He recovered somewhat, but then the pandemic hit the facility. He died a few weeks later.<p>I&#x27;ll miss the time that stubborn man and I spent together. Rest in peace Pépère.<p>Hopefully by the time my parents are unable to care for themselves I&#x27;ll be financially well enough off to make sure they never end up somewhere like this unless I truly can&#x27;t provide the care they need.')
