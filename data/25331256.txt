This wasn&#x27;t because people suddenly realised the slaves weren&#x27;t having fun, or suddenly after millennia of religion someone decided to take the &#x27;be nice to people&#x27; dogma seriously. Neither of those things take centuries to figure out.<p>The change was the industrial revolution that let relatively ordinary people create enormous amounts of wealth if left with their freedom. Slavery is a great example of liberating people to do things being much more impressive than bans. Banning slavery was a big step that sped the whole process up by a few decades, but the writing was on the wall once it became obvious just how much wealth a motivated free person could create.<p>&gt; let people do heroin for example. would be very impressive.<p>Yeah, it would. Countries should have some faith in their people to figure out what a mistake looks like without the police arresting people. I&#x27;d applaud any government that can get to that level of enlightenment.')
