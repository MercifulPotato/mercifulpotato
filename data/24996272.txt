Item(by='ksec', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604560578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993187, text='&gt;This is a really confusing product for me.<p>1. Discrete GPU sells, Discrete = better than Integrated. ( Forget about the actual benchmark for the time being ) Especially true in market like China.<p>2. I would not be surprised if this was giving out for free with or for very little cost compared to just buying TigerLake. ( Or you know, normal price but with Intel Xe Max Marketing budget rebate )<p>3. The sole purpose is likely a Marketing exercise to address the world &#x2F; market. We ( Intel ) now have a discrete GPU too. And they are good. ( You will always need to solve the Chicken and Egg problem with continue investment of GPU, revenue generation and demand for a product new to market segment)<p>4. Nearly 80% of PC sold are now Laptops. You need something to generate volume, view, exposures, Xe Max seems like well positioned.<p>5. You also need product volume to push developers to develop for their GPU &#x2F; OneAPI. Just like Apple tells you e.g 60% of Active Devices, or 600M are already on iOS 14. Developer should plan their App upgrade with new API usage accordingly. Same with OneAPI and Intel Xe Max GPU. It is easier if you have a Total Addressable Market.<p>Q: So this is more or a marketing move than anything?<p>A: Possibly, Intel are <i>exceptionally</i> good at sales and marketing. Despite their Technological incompetence in the past years, I have to give them credit for that.')
