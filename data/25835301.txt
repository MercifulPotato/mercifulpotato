Bush flying in remote areas... firefighting flying as someone else mentioned.  Ag pilot is also pretty awesome on video but the exposure to chemicals is concerning. There are a lot interesting piloting jobs other than commercial. But even with &quot;just&quot; commercial at the majors the travel and salary is amazing (after a lot of crappy pay at regional outfits).')
