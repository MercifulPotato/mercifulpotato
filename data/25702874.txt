Large synchronous machines on the other hand, in practice, can have a 95% efficiency.<p>Here’s a study without the “carbon pricing”: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energy.mit.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;MITEI-WP-2016-01.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energy.mit.edu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;MITEI-WP-2...</a><p>Again coal is much cheaper.<p>I’m sympathetic to your agenda but it’s deceitful and unfair to presume agreement given the unique circumstances theses results affect conclusions. A place like Nigeria has to worry about what’s happening to their people in the next month rather than in the next 50 years, thus they’ll have different trade offs to make.')
