Eventually you&#x27;d come to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to just... run imperative commands when you can&#x27;t guarantee that the other end is idempotent, so you&#x27;d arrive at:<p>- (optionally) take a lock on performing changes<p>- Check existing state<p>- Perform your changes based on existing state<p>- (optionally) release your change lock<p>And voila, we&#x27;re at complexity. I&#x27;d argue that this complexity is essential, not accidental given the goal of making an easy to use system that ensures state.')
