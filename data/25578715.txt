But the amount of torque is not.  When it&#x27;s treacherous out even 5% of a normal cars HP&#x2F;Torque is plenty.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the FWD + snow tires beats AWD + all seasons before and personally I don&#x27;t believe it, but it&#x27;s a pretty subjective thing.  The big win for AWD is predictability and control, not that I want to go around corners sideways at 100 mph rally style.  Having control over the car, even when sliding, without any rear or front bias just makes for a MUCH more controllable car.<p>My Subaru forester with AWD and all seasons handled numerous treacherous conditions, sometimes so bad that every highway around me was closed.  I used to do 6 7200 foot passes every weekend, often in the middle of storms dropping 2-3 feet.  My main problem on the roads was others that don&#x27;t know how to drive and block the roads.<p>I&#x27;ve driven roads so slick that going too slow would cause you to slide off the road.  I&#x27;d have to apply torque, while sliding, to keep the 10-15 mph required to avoid sliding to the inside of every banked turn.  Which would be MUCH harder with FWD or RWD.<p>Amusingly at chain control points, often the workers would look back in the line, see my Subaru and pull me out of line and let me go through with a smile and a wave.  Presumably because there are (or weren&#x27;t anyways) any non-AWD Subarus (this was before the BRX) and Subarus aren&#x27;t the typical cars getting stuck and causing problems.<p>Sure AWD and snow tires is even better, just seems overkill for the highways in the high sierras.')
