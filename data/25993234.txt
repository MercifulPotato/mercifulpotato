It seems like this should be a problem for cases where not just one person owns all the stock but for any fairly illiquid stock: if someone holds 40% of outstanding shares, the brokerage loans it and then it&#x27;s sold, if there&#x27;s some kind of takeover or aggressive purchase then it seems like a collection of others who now hold 61% and aren&#x27;t listing their shares would also cause this &quot;lost share&quot;, right?<p>Isn&#x27;t this also a loophole that can be used to &quot;steal&quot; stock from someone who otherwise doesn&#x27;t want to sell: their share is loaned by their broker to B who sells it to you, and then you just refuse to sell it back to be returned, and some random middle man is on the hook and you&#x27;ve managed to purchase shares that weren&#x27;t for sale?')
