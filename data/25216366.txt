Sure many linux distros will install a desktop environment for you. FreeBSD will require you to install a package for the one of your choice which should also install all dependencies. As noted elsewhere, X pretty much works now with no additional config update unless you have a very unusual setup.  That shouldn&#x27;t be too high a hurdle as even on linux you will need to know how to install packages at some point too.<p>And if you don&#x27;t want to do that, you can try something like GhostBSD which is based on FreeBSD with the MATE desktop.')
