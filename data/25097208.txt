At the top levels of consulting most of your job and a good portion of your comp are tied up in sales&#x2F;profitability, and client&#x2F;account management with a pretty crappy lifestyle and work&#x2F;life balance to match.  It&#x27;s significantly more grueling and less of a &quot;coast to riches&quot; path by far than big tech, although you&#x27;re right that take-home comp can definitely be higher if the aforementioned job type is up your alley.')
