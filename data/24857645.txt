Even though it’s not explicitly stated, it helps serve as a proxy for people to figure how closely to align themselves with another.<p>When I was a child, I wondered why people who didn’t believe in the assumptions of a religion or act according to them still stated they belong to that religion or performed certain rituals and traditions relating to the religion.<p>I came to learn it’s because it helps serve as a signal to where your political allegiances might lie and helps manage your priorities and subtly inform others.<p>Non “religious” societies may have weaker tribal bonds or allegiances with each other, so in times of conflict, they may be unable to create the group dynamics that enable them to survive and&#x2F;or thrive.  Of course, my whole theory might be wrong and maybe there are better signals nowadays.')
