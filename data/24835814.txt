What I&#x27;ve done in some cases is just thrown an HTTP&#x2F;2 proxy in front of these and saw an immediate and very user-perceptible performance improvement for the user. So much so that people kept asking why using the proxied version I stood up was so much faster than going directly to the origin server.')
