I suppose if we are exact with CS terminology, currying means converting to 1-argument functions, so that&#x27;s out.<p>But the threading macros do partial application in that they put the threaded-through value as an implicit argument. Look at the first examples in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clojure.org&#x2F;guides&#x2F;threading_macros" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clojure.org&#x2F;guides&#x2F;threading_macros</a> - the -&gt; (thread-first) macro needs functions like assoc and update to take the map as the first argument.<p>And of course explicit use of partial application is also pretty common and argument order matters similarly there, just like it would eg in Python.')
