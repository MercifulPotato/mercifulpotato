I was overwhelmed with how bad Mac window management is in a multi-monitor setup.  This is compounded by Apple&#x27;s apparent hatred of keyboard shortcuts and power users.  Speaking to my longtime Mac-loving coworkers, they displayed Sapir-Whorf-like inability to understand why the missing features&#x2F;behaviors are even a problem.<p>In a the Covid&#x2F;WFH world, I&#x27;m happy to let the 16&quot; MBP collect dust while I use computers that adapt to me, rather than forcefully adapting myself to one particular computer&#x27;s eccentricities.')
