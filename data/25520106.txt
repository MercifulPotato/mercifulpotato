Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</i><p>If you wanted to measure the effect of protocol, you could compare requesting with support HTTP&#x2F;N to requesting with support for HTTP&#x2F;N+1.  Since this is all synthetic testing it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to run a controlled experiment instead of a correlational one.')
