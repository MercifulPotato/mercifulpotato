The problem is that the colormap is divergent and replaces white with a dark color, not anything intrinsic to jet. If you map this image with BWR or roma you end up with similarly unappealing results.<p>IMO roma is actually the worst of the bunch, despite being the most &#x27;scientific.&#x27; Whoever decided that deep, saturated blue and dull brown-red are equally distinct from beige needs to reevalute their model of color perception.')
