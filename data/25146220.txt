When a 3000 sq ft house costs considerably less than your 1 bedroom apartment, you realize that your cost of living didn&#x27;t just drop by more than 20%, but that standard of living went way up.<p>As a counter-anecdote: I moved from the Florida panhandle to the SF Bay area, and while certain things like housing and taxes were quite a bit more expensive, most things really weren&#x27;t. The California salary&#x2F;equity increase meant my relative standard of living and (most importantly) ability to save went way up. Without going into specific numbers, in 2019 the amount I was able to put away into 401k, IRAs, and other tax advantaged savings accounts exceeded my entire Florida gross salary in 2009. And I&#x27;m not even getting one of those wild outlier high-level FAANG engineer compensations. It&#x27;s a world of difference.')
