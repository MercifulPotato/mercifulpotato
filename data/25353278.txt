I would say that the order in which people should be better protected (w.r.t. the legal system) is:<p>1. Prisoners, from abuse by prison staff (and to some extent from inter-prisoner violence.<p>2. Detainees, from abuse by police and prison staff.<p>2.1 Your average joe.<p>2.2 Poor and minority detainees. Case in point: George Floyd. But there are lots and lots of deaths:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journalistsresource.org&#x2F;studies&#x2F;government&#x2F;criminal-justice&#x2F;deaths-police-custody-united-states&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journalistsresource.org&#x2F;studies&#x2F;government&#x2F;criminal-...</a><p>... and I&#x27;m guessing a lot of non-lethal violence.<p>2.3 People of political significance. Major case in point: Jeffrey Epstein, whose extremely suspicious death has made many suspicious of foul play:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heavy.com&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;who-killed-jeffrey-epstein-theories-death&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heavy.com&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;who-killed-jeffrey-e...</a><p>3. Judges and such.<p>Why? Those people who attack, who hurt, who punish, who bind - at best, what they do is a necessary evil. But they are acting from positions of institutional power. The more you are considered out-of-order, abnormal, criminal, you are generally weaker, have less recourse, less able to protect yourself and more tempting to abuse.<p>----------------<p>I also disagree with the judge&#x27;s conclusion on the question of means rather than ends. Instead of giving judges special protection, I would rather US society did something about its horrible gun culture. The number of killings in the US is spectacularly high. And always it seems that the solution they opt for is _more_ violence, militarization, retaliation through superior firepower, body and vehicle armor etc. US police is already heavily militarized, being fed a nearly-infinite supply of military surplus equipment. Now we&#x27;ll have fortified compounds where judges are isolated from people? No. That actually does reminds me of Judge Dredd, even if not of the exact details.')
