Item(by='jnxx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605004310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039561, text='The most important advantage of Emacs and vi are, these\nare open systems, which come out of an open culture,\nnot just &quot;open source&quot; but really free software, with\nno strings attached. Granted, open source is having its\nsuccesses, so companies are trying to jump onto that\nbandwagon, but this has mainly the consequence that the\nstrings attached are less visible - like &quot;telemetrics&quot;,\ninacceptable spyware, waste of attention, artificial\nobstacles to competitor languages &#x2F; systems,\nunwarranted and empty hype, and so on. It is important\nto recognize the tone of that, and to listen to it, and\nto think about it, because it can warn you before\nmaking bad decisions.<p>Also, Emacs has top-notch documentation.\nWhile basic commands are not that hard to learn, there\nis certainly a lot of stuff one can learn, so much that\nit takes some amount of conscious effort to learn a\ngood fraction of what is relevant to certain\ntasks. That said, Emacs also makes fantastic use of a\nundervalued property of the human brain, which is\nautomatic decluttering, forgotting and blending out\nthings which are not in use, like a diligent and\nfriendly housemaid which brings anything which you\nhaven&#x27;t really used in the last year into the attic ;-)<p>But, jokes aside, exactly like learning the Linux\ncommand line well, learning some Emacs is an\n&#x2F;excellent&#x2F; use of ones time as a programmer, because\nthe half-life time of the knowledge you gather is much\nmuch longer than when you just learn the latest\nIDE. Chances are that your IDE du jour will be mostly\nforgotten five or six years from now. Chances are high\nthat the basic command-line tools and Emacs commands\nyou learn now will still be useful twenty and thirty\nyears from now.')
