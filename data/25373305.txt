The DSP and amplifier is not a headscratcher for any serious EE.  The DSP chips themselves are only $10.<p>I haven’t looked into this space in a few years and I am of the “budget hi-fi” variety.  At a glance, it does look like open source choices exist [0].  My last (finished) DIY audio project was an ODAC+O2 and that has been rock solid for 5 years.<p>Realtime corrections sound nice at first glance, but I’d be wary of the actual effect.  It’s best handled with servo in the analog driver.  DSP really shines with room and loudspeaker compensation, especially to linearize phase response (at the cost of delay).  Room acoustic issues led me down a rabbit hole that ended with me working on a triple BA IEM with a teensy powered FIR crossover.  I gave up on soldering wires to a tiny SM connector.  It’s on my revisit list.  I’ve been knocking some things out this year, so maybe it’ll be up in another year or two.<p>If only I could just play with toys instead of working :p<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohdsp.weebly.com&#x2F;dsp-adau1452.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ohdsp.weebly.com&#x2F;dsp-adau1452.html</a>')
