If, however, this news came with a grant of all the patents into the public domain, then it would be another story.<p>Could a startup set up a commercial balloon based mesh network without running into patents now held by google? Probably not.<p>THIS is the problem with these &quot;skunkworks&quot; type projects from megacorps. They suck all the air out of the room and prevent others from innovating.<p>Loon didn&#x27;t fail, Google&#x2F;Alphabet just decided they were going to discontinue funding. Now they hold a pool of patents they don&#x27;t intend to do anything with. Now they will point that funding elsewhere and do the same.')
