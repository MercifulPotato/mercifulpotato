However, in tech, these businesses get crushed by larger platform plays see for example Firefox  vs. chrome, slack vs teams, Aws vs digital ocean.<p>There are a few factors at play here, but I’ll call out a few I’ve observed.<p>1) If you hire good engineers and give them autonomy, branching into new markets is cheaper than you think. “Focusing” engineers tends to just cut back on autonomy, both lowering productivity as well as limiting the quality of engineering talent one can attract.<p>2) Unified, integrated solutions, with great default options are preferred by nearly everyone on the market.

For any given monitoring feature there are dozens to hundreds of small, high quality point solutions targeting one market niche or another - but most customers will simply purchase their preferred all in one solution and forget about the other options.')
