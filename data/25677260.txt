It is an established scientific fact that smoking is harmful to anyone doing it. Why are you confident that social media is also harmful or goes against people&#x27;s self-interest? People choose to use it; they connect with people they know on it. Is there some study I&#x27;m missing that shows social media causes clinical depression or some other adverse affect?<p>editing: rereading what you wrote and it sounds like your issue is not that FB is harmful but that it is purposely addictive&#x2F;getting people to do something they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise. Hmm...when people talk about addiction like alcoholism, gambling, drug use etc. it&#x27;s always connected to adverse affects -- like overdose, job-loss, divorce etc. The addiction interferes with a person&#x27;s ability carry out their normal responsibilities. People are not becoming homeless because of Facebook addition. You could make a similar argument about caffeine which causes chemical addiction to change people&#x27;s behavior but is widely accepted. BTW how do you feel about World of Warcraft addiction?')
