Instead expose views and stored procedures which insulate the internal details from the outside world. This allows you to change the internals of your schema and maintain backwards compatibility. It also keeps your code easier to refactor, and provides a natural way to do API versioning.<p>Which is, you&#x27;ll notice, the same best practice used for decades by DBAs who need to serve multiple applications connecting to the same database.<p>(Also, it&#x27;s not exactly uncommon that a data store API would have a single client which you control - eg. a single webapp, an internal application... in which case you can go nuts with breaking changes.)')
