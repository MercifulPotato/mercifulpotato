Item(by='daenz', descendants=None, kids=[25601451, 25601260], score=None, time=1609476818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600870, text='&gt;I think that you want people to draw a conclusion from this story.<p>Yes, that conclusion is exactly what I already said, which I worded very precisely: &quot;some companies bias positively towards people based on their race and&#x2F;or gender&quot;. So we should not automatically <i>assume,</i> as the person I was replying to suggested, that someone will be biased against because of their race or gender for affirming work boundaries.<p>You reading into that to try to sniff out hints of racism and prejudice says more about your motives and your intentions here than it does mine.<p>&gt;You believe these companies &quot;bias positively&quot;. Which may or may not be true.<p>I didn&#x27;t say &quot;these companies&quot;, I said &quot;some companies.&quot; And &quot;some companies&quot; <i>is</i> true, because I have personal experiences at &quot;some companies&quot; that show backroom positive biases towards employees and interview candidates, without their knowledge, explicitly because of their identity (both race and sex).<p>You seem to disagree that my experiences are valid, and if they are valid, that I must be sexist or racist for even sharing them.')
