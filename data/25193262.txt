Making stuff <i>work</i> is only maybe 20% of the work required to build a product... sometimes less.<p>I&#x27;ve been yelling about that for years and years and very few people seem to get it. Free as in freedom got conflated with free as in beer years ago, and FOSS today is not much more than &quot;waaah gimme free stuff!&quot; It&#x27;s not a gift culture. It&#x27;s a &quot;take culture.&quot;<p>Anyone who suggests any change to FOSS culture to remedy this problem gets shouted down. Any license that tries to remedy it gets attacked as &quot;not OSI compliant&quot; and restricting peoples&#x27; rights.<p>Meanwhile commercial closed source and SaaS vendors have the resources to leave FOSS and open ecosystems in the dust in terms of features and user experience. While the license purists yell about &quot;restrictive licenses&quot; taking away rights, the gravity of the walled gardens becomes more and more powerful.<p>The choice is between free and freedom.')
