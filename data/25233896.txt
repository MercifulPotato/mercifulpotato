It&#x27;s driven by extreme corporate greed which is way too skewed in the wrong direction. I always thought there was something nice about lifetime or career companies. Again, if both employer, management, employees and community can create a culture and company that is in balance in all aspects, the author&#x27;s position is justified in my opinion.<p>However, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just empty words that maintains the status quo of Silicon Valley, then I don&#x27;t agree with the author. We need less selfish egotistical thought leader CEOs following the trends and more down to earth and humble leaders who want to do meaningful work.')
