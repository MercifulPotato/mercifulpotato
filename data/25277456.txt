Item(by='jahaja', descendants=None, kids=[25278686], score=None, time=1606924298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277025, text='&gt; So your position is that Day labor and&#x2F;or independent contracting is only predatory?<p>Yes, especially when the primary USP is just to lower labour costs compared to having them as employees.<p>&gt; That people are incapable of looking at a situation and making a choice for themselves if the situation is good for them or not? They must always be protected by the government &quot;for the greater good&quot;, and that government regulation is inherently good and noble?<p>Yes. People in a shite economic position and without any support from a welfare state are rarely in a position to refuse an exploitative relationship.<p>And yes again, the government is most likely far more &quot;good and noble&quot; than an employer in day labourer relationship - whose primary motive is not one&#x27;s well-being but profit.<p>&gt; because after the state of CA passed a law prohibiting independent contracting for a whole host of jobs, many lost 100% of their income, many others lost flexibility in the jobs and other adverse consequences from moving from Independent contracting to employee<p>A lot of people would lose their job in the insurance industry if universal health care was adopted. But it&#x27;s still the right thing to do. Furthermore, the only reason why you can use that argument &quot;Ah, it&#x27;s horrible! They&#x27;re losing their income!&quot; is because there&#x27;s no welfare state to help them out in between jobs and&#x2F;or (re-)education.<p>&gt; Many people PREFER to be independent as it affords them flexibility and well independence they could not get if they were employee&#x27;s<p>Maybe some, sure. Not sure why that&#x27;s relevant or mutually exclusive to not regress to day labourers.<p>&gt; it is foolish and ignorant to claim that I have &quot;low empathy with the less fortunate&quot; simply because I prefer less authoritarian government, less regulation and more personal freedom (and responsibility)<p>A hand-in-hat existence has <i>absolutely nothing</i> to do with freedom, if anything it&#x27;s its opposite. Freedom for capital, or market freedom etc, does not automatically translate to freedom in its literal sense to the willing or unwilling participants.<p>The boss is usually the most authoritarian relationship that most people experience from day to day, worsening the less fortunate one are. This would only increase the intensity of that.')
