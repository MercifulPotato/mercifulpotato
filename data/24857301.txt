Item(by='IkmoIkmo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603370034, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857029, text='&gt; You&#x27;re making the same assumption that people with the same skin color will have the same culture.<p>He said ethnicity, not skin colour. Ethnicity is a quite broad and fluid concept which you could assign to any distinguishable cultural group which has some shared history, shared norms or values etc.<p>As such, it&#x27;s entirely valid to say that if you belong to a certain ethnicity, statistically you&#x27;re quite likely to converge personally on many of its norms and values. That doesn&#x27;t mean all muslims are alike, but two muslims are more alike, ceteris paribus, than a muslim and a non-muslim.<p>That also doesn&#x27;t exclude that there can be many different ethnicities at play at the same time, e.g. there are asian (e.g. Indonesian) muslims and african (e.g. Moroccan) muslims. And again, a muslim moroccan is more alike a Moroccan jew than perhaps an Indonesian muslim. Because Morocco has a culture, and Moroccans as an ethnicity converge to many of its norms and values, just like Indonesians in Indonesia.<p>And so indeed, Black Americans are a distinct ethnicity from African Americans (for lack of better terminology), agreed. And within those ethnicities its willing or unwilling members converge on the norms&#x2F;values in those groups. I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s controversial. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re all copies or mindless drones. Nor does it mean the members cannot have other ethnicities which they also converge on.<p>I&#x27;d say the fact members of group A statistically tend to be more likely to exhibit than outside members, the characteristics of group A (i.e., converging weakly or strongly to norms&#x2F;values of group A), is so obvious that it is almost a truism that isn&#x27;t worth stating, and hardly controversial or thinly veiled racism.')
