In many cases they traffic in &quot;Minor&quot; amounts to support their own addictions which just creates more addicts and spreads the sickness to other victims.<p>In a perfect world, all drugs would be legal and more importantly free for anyone who wanted them. This could be possible while still requiring addicts to visit medical providers for their fix. This would quickly remove the profits from the illegal drug trade and keep the addicted from being exploited in order to feed their addictions.<p>I have seen first hand the destruction caused by so called non violent drug offenders and can attest it is just as bad if not worse on the lives of those around them. In my case it started with small things disappearing from our household, like heirlooms and collectables but ended with a selfish addict telling lies and extorting money from myself and others. My particular situation finally ended with the addict overdosing and all the misery that came from that, being thrust upon those who still loved and depended on them.<p>I bounce back and forth between being angry at myself, then the addict and sometimes the people working in law enforcement and the justice system(Who have managed to build nice little lives for themselves through policing and punishing the addicted under the guise of making the world a better place.)<p>So IDK if freeing a bunch of drug users who were aware what they were doing at the time was criminal, is going to solve the root problems caused by drugs any better than the current system of keeping them locked away from the rest of us until they figure out how to toe the line.')
