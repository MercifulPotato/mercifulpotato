The gold standard for bitcoin is using multisig, where multiple (<i>m</i> of <i>n</i>) keys are required to access the bitcoin.<p>For example, anyone can setup a 3 of 5 multisig which requires 3 of the 5 keys to spend or move the bitcoin. These keys would be stored in separate hardware wallets stored in vaults anywhere in the world.<p>In the case of MicroStrategy, one could imagine them using multisig, so that if Michael Saylor dies in a tragic boating accident, board members of his company would be able to access the bitcoin the company owns.<p>Multisig has been available almost since the beginning of bitcoin but only recently became more mainstream as the value of bitcoin continues to increase.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Multisignature" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Multisignature</a><p>[2] 10x Security Bitcoin Guideâ€”<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;btcguide.github.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;btcguide.github.io</a>')
