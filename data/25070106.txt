I don&#x27;t even know what language it&#x27;s in.<p>So it&#x27;s a little hard for me to compare it to Netlify, which does have backend support in the form of lambdas, and a database in the form of FaunaDB. That&#x27;s fairly limited, but it&#x27;s also very easy.<p>Clicking through to the github page, it looks like the examples are in Go... though I also see a Dockerfile. For me, I&#x27;d be more interested in having your blurb page focus more on how one writes the back end, since that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re really selling.')
