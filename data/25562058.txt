Although, the conversation has shifted and will likely continue to do so, as we have realized that animals have many of the feelings that we have, even if it isn&#x27;t exactly the same.<p>&gt; Is the &quot;moral&quot; expectation that a chimp would value chimp life higher, a dog would value dog life higher, and a human would value human life higher?<p>Yes, most likely. Although the world would probably look very different if other animals were capable of discussing such things :)')
