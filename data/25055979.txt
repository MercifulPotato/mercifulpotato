I think you may have a very incorrect idea about who is being burdened here.<p>A major effect of these changes is to make it <i>simpler</i> for anyone (&quot;makers&quot; included) to securely implement devices which expose web services, by making web browsers refuse to allow external web sites to send arbitrary requests to those devices.<p>Most network devices have no need to receive such requests. No action is necessary on their part; these changes will make those devices stop receiving those requests.<p>The few network devices that do need to receive those requests can opt in to receiving them by responding to a CORS probe (an OPTIONS HTTP request) with a specific HTTP header. This is not complicated to implement.<p>Web browsers already implement complex CORS policies. Adding this is not a huge burden upon them, and may actually obviate the need for other more complex defenses.')
