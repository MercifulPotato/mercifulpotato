Slaves aren&#x27;t an effective asset in this century. After a generation or two there&#x27;d be basically no slaves left because nobody would want one. Cost money to maintain with very little payoff versus alternatives.<p>Look at Apple, AWS, Google, etc, etc vs some slave-run plantation in wherever-they-have-slave-plantations. Which one would people rather invest in, just from a greedy capitalist perspective? All the money is in owning productive capital and businesses made up of motivated employees.')
