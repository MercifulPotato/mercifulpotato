CA deliberately defines anybody who is in CA &quot;other than for a transitory purpose&quot; as a CA resident (for tax purposes). So if you happen to reside in TX but come to Redwood City for a couple weeks and work there, for example, CA can come after you. I am fairly certain this will happen more often once increasing numbers of people vote with their feet.')
