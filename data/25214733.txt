It&#x27;s big, it&#x27;s powerful, it&#x27;s a bit slow to get moving, but (1) it can carry just about anything (2) once it gets moving, it tends to stay moving. There&#x27;s a lot of value in having a &quot;do it all&quot; project management system.<p>That being said, there&#x27;s also value in alternatives that are more tailored towards specific needs.')
