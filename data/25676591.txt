That&#x27;s still meaningless to less skilled users and there&#x27;s no way to tell if the user has gone forever or if they&#x27;re just offline for a bit.<p>Anyway, my point is that WhatsApp shouldn&#x27;t silently accept messages for a non existent user no matter what weak signals you get. When you send a text message to a non existent number, you get an error. Same for an e-mail.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think it&#x27;s a way to deter users from leaving WhatsApp.')
