If you have deep pockets, and there is tons of action on a bet that is very +EV for you, you will just let the action keep coming in rather than adjusting the odds to encourage balancing action on the other side.  That would reduce variance (potentially to 0) but at the cost of EV.<p>In your case, at the end of the day you make money iff you get people to make individual bets that are unprofitable to them.  If &quot;there are plenty of suckers in the game,&quot; then you&#x27;ll be able to do that. The other problem you&#x27;re talking about is just variance control -- it won&#x27;t affect your profits.')
