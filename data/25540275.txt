They&#x27;re amazing animals.  Fisherman have a connection to nature that just can&#x27;t be appreciated unless you have spent significant time on the water.<p>Fish are SMART, they&#x27;re capable of amazing things I wouldn&#x27;t have even considered possible.<p>I once had a large trout swim UP a (short, about 4&#x27;) waterfall with my lure in his mouth and I could SEE him swimming up it as if it were just normal water.<p>When we let nature die a part of us dies with it..')
