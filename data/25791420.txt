In hindsight, I don&#x27;t know whether I was over-exaggerating the feared stigma in keeping with our cultural expectations, or as an expression of the depression itself. Either way, I can tell you that the experience was painless. Getting appropriate medication also made a world of difference, to such a degree that nowadays, when things deteriorate, I can qualitatively recognize &quot;those&quot; thoughts and feelings as not belonging to my normal palette, though there are grey areas that sometimes sneak up on me.<p>I don&#x27;t speak up on my behalf, as you&#x27;re right - I&#x27;m just a stranger on the internet, and we&#x27;ll forget about each other soon enough. I&#x27;m speaking up on behalf of the people in your life that you&#x27;re currently telling yourself will be better off without you. Because they won&#x27;t be better off, and they&#x27;ll carry the pain of your absence as a wound that doesn&#x27;t heal.')
