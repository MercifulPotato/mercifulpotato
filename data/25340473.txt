Item(by='mattashii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607391204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25340026, text='&gt; Combine that with the fact being that gun ownership is a Constitutional right--that means the chance that anyone can have a gun is above 0.<p>This chance is always above zero, unless you&#x27;ve just full-body-and-orifice searched the person.<p>I am not american, but isn&#x27;t there some constitutional clause on bodily integrity or something like that? And isn&#x27;t that more important\nthan this right on owning guns&#x2F;pointing guns at people that might own guns, and&#x2F;or carry said guns?<p>&gt; So as long as guns are as easily available as they are currently, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect a law officer to start the interaction in this way which is a manner that protects the officer the most.<p>Going into a home gun-first is something I would expect from armed burglars, not from police that are there for a digital media search warrant.<p>[edit]<p>So, after a search, TIL: the USA does not have constitutional bodily integrity, but does grant you the right to own a gun... <i>What</i> ?')
