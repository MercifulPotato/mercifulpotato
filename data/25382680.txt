Passenger aircraft are routinely struck by lightning, which isn&#x27;t entirely the same but is relatively similar. Given warning, I don&#x27;t see airlines taking the risk, but that&#x27;s driven by perceived liability rather than real risk.<p>Civilian FBW systems (essentially all of which are digital at this point, analog would likely be more vulnerable) are multiply-redundant which provides reasonable protection against upset events. The primary threat from solar events is the induced currents, not direct radiation that is a bigger threat to transistorized digital electronics. Flying aircraft are obviously electrically isolated from the electrical grid (which is where the real damage would take place), and relatively small (compared to hundreds of km of power lines), which would limit the range of induced currents in the airframe.<p>The real risk to aviation would be a loss of air traffic control which would risk mid-air collisions in busy areas.')
