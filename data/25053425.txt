The knowledge that subscriptions are a constant drain on your income (no matter how small) means I am extremely reluctant to pay.  I think the same goes for a lot of people.  I think this article don&#x27;t get when people want to pay for subscriptions.<p>People prefer a subscription when it offers a blend of value and convenience (Costco&#x27;s savings, Amazon Prime&#x27;s faster shipping for cheap, and video game bundle subscriptions instead of buying outright) or offers something that&#x27;s hard to replicate without a subscription (paying for phone insurance so that you&#x27;re never out more than the $50 deductible if you break your phone).  Toothbrush subscriptions don&#x27;t fulfill either of those categories: you&#x27;re probably going to the store anyway so you can get a toothbrush there, the savings are small, and a subscription doesn&#x27;t simplify your life.')
