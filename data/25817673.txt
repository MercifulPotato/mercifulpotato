Do they really understand the hobby?  They should, but seeing as how they turned over much of the monitoring of the ham bands over to volunteers a few years ago, but maybe they do not.<p>My understanding is that most of the planning for the Capitol assault was done on Facebook groups.  Some of those who stormed the Capitol were using walkie-talkie software on their phones.<p>If the FCC has proof that hams were using amateur radio for the event then they should tell us.')
