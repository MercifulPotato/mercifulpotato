I am not a routine person, but for me showering, opening up Slack, and switching Chrome profiles is how I transition from &quot;home&quot; to &quot;work&quot;.  I don&#x27;t do &quot;home&quot; things during work hours, and I don&#x27;t do &quot;work&quot; things during &quot;home&quot; hours.  Even though I&#x27;m at the same desk.  For me, it works as well as commuting did, without 30 minutes of being frustrated at the subway.<p>(I admit that I do do some &quot;home&quot; things at work, like laundry.  That mostly involves turning on the machine and tending to it in an hour, so not a big time commitment but nice to get done during the day.)')
