And I&#x27;m glad to see a high-level language embrace it.<p>-------<p>I probably should note some other languages of this model: CUDA, OpenCL, ISPC, OpenMP, OpenACC. Most of these other languages are low-level, where you manage memory directly (and GPUs have very little memory per thread. So manual memory management is still hugely important)<p>But for speed of development, prototyping, and higher level reasons, a language like Julia that implements this &quot;mindset&quot; is going to be hugely important moving forward.<p>------<p>The fact that parallel fork-join scales from 2 CPU threads all the way up to thousands of GPU-threads... or CPU + SIMD (such as AVX512), is proof that this methodology is useful. I feel like people are sleeping on this model: its hugely useful for scaling on what I believe to be the computer of the future.')
