Item(by='kebman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606312613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207855, text='&gt; Historically agricultural workers were slaves or at best serfs. In any case, a brutal lifestyle, generally for someone else&#x27;s benefit.<p>Not really. It&#x27;s a myth that farms were made solely to support &quot;the 1%.&quot; In fact research suggests that work hours were often less in those days than in modern times.[1]<p>To be sure, part of the farming produce was taxed in various ways (legitimate or not) during a lot of history, and there were disagreements about how big that tax was supposed to be that sometimes even lead to revolt, but then there were no real alternatives either. In short, farming was <i>the best</i> possible life to be had during most of history for most people, unless you were part of the nobility or some trading class. For most that just wasn&#x27;t attainaible in any meaningful way, except perhaps through the participation in wars, or for some, marriage.<p>Indeed, until very recently <i>most</i> farms were &quot;subsistence farming&quot; (historically speaking, of course), but that isn&#x27;t to say that it was necessarily a &quot;bad&quot; or gruelling life, considering the technology that existed at the time. At best that assertion is anachronistic. <i>Of course</i> the farming of yesteryear is worse than more modern farming methods! On the other hand you have to remember that living in a society where most people do <i>something else</i> than farming is a very recent invention. This means that most people grew up on—or close—to a farm throughout history.<p>Living in a family, perhaps close to a village, while growing plants and tending to livestock, was an integral part of life for most people. Thus, the way of structuring life on a farm was the main bearer of culture and tradition to new generations in those societies. I&#x27;m of course not speaking of &quot;high&quot; or &quot;fine&quot; culture here, which was the domain of the cities and various courts, but the traditions, social rules, and work ethics instilled in farmer families, who then brought it into the cities; much of it coming to pass exactly because there were no safety net like a welfare state back then. So you either worked your farm, or subsided to begging or famine. In that sense you could say that there was a rather strong selection towards that kind of ethics too.<p>Today, most of that &quot;folksy&quot; ethics and culture is dying out, if it&#x27;s not dead already, as more and more people are solely living in cities over multiple generations. This is why so many are completely out of touch with how things like dairy, meats or grains are even produced. Moreover they never got to take part in the family cooperation required to run a farm successfully, which both requires a certain kind of morality and work ethics, and not least an up-close and personal knowledge of how nature works. All that vanishes when agriculture becomes just another market share for the industrialist.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s all bad. Certainly the most obvious gain is that more people, at least in theory, should be able to work less to get food on the table, as it were. But there are also certain very healthy and good things that are lost in the process too, and I think it&#x27;s important that people are at least aware of it.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;mac&#x2F;users&#x2F;rauch&#x2F;worktime&#x2F;hours_workweek.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.csail.mit.edu&#x2F;mac&#x2F;users&#x2F;rauch&#x2F;worktime&#x2F;hours_w...</a>')
