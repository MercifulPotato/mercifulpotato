Already been tried. Doesn&#x27;t work.<p><i>&gt; It&#x27;s about time we think outside the box.</i><p>Cosmologists have been trying out of the box ideas for decades. All of them failed. That&#x27;s why we have the models we have now: they&#x27;re the only ones that survived that process.<p><i>&gt; I get it, both make the calculations work out, but they&#x27;re basically &quot;we have no clue what this actually is, here&#x27;s our best guess&quot; kind of variable.</i><p>For dark matter, you are correct: we don&#x27;t know what it is, and the term is basically just another way of saying &quot;whatever we need to add to our model to make it match observations works basically like ordinary matter does in the equations&quot;.<p>But that is <i>not</i> true of expansion itself. All of the alternative models that have been proposed to eliminate the need for dark matter still have an expanding universe. The expansion itself is a much more solid conclusion than dark matter is.')
