Cross datacenter&#x2F;region might be eventually consistent, but you will only see it rarely since the same-datacenter replicas are fully consistent with each other.<p>The main downside is that you have to pick one datacenter as the main datacenter at any given time. This can change if the old one goes down or due to business needs, but you can&#x27;t have two of them as the main datacenter at once for a given dataset.')
