That lab is there because Wuhan happens to be a hotspot for dangerous novel tropical diseases. Regardless of the direction of causality for COVID, the original reason the lab was put there was to look for things like COVID. Your implied argument is bad. Link bombing with some random powerpoint may support direction of causality between the lab and COVID, but it does nothing to support your insuation of the lab being there in the first place.')
