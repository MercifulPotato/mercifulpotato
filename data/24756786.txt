With as many security experts are constantly looking at the big apps like Messenger&#x2F;Insta, you think someone would notice huge packets of audio data if this was happening.<p>I think what&#x27;s much more likely is that machine learning algorithms are so good right now, they&#x27;re able to determine what people are interesting in based on browsing habits and other metadata. Either that or they&#x27;re using your location data and tracking what adverts people are physically seeing on signs&#x2F;billboards.<p>So you may think your app is listening to you because you get an ad for something you talking about, but you don&#x27;t realize you talked about it because your brain subconsciously registered a billboard over and over again.')
