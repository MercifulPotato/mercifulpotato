The problem was AMD couldn&#x27;t compete on volume. An individual could go buy an AMD chip at a great price, but AMD couldn&#x27;t fill a large order from a PC manufacturer. Furthermore, we suspected their margins were too slim to keep investing in themselves.<p>Remember that DIY pc building is a niche. Something that makes perfect sense when you&#x27;re building a single PC may not make sense when you&#x27;re making thousands of laptops.')
