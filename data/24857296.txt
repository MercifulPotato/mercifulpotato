YAML has multiple ways to define the same output and since it makes almost anything legal there’s not a way for a tool to disambiguate.<p>For example, if you double-indent something, YAML will just silently assume you wanted a nested data structure but Python will throw an indentation error. That causes issues in many editors when copy-and-pasting.<p>That pattern continues where Python uses indentation to force clarity and consistency but still has syntax which removes ambiguity. A key one is that Python requires quoting data, avoiding all of the common data loss in YAML when people happen to enter data with meaning in YAML (country=no, names with equal signs or colons, etc.), and you have to open and close structures with syntax rather than just indentation.<p>The most analogous Python bug is when a statement immediately after an if, nested def, etc. is one level of indentation than intended. That definitely happens but a fair fraction of the time it’s immediately obvious because it usually fails due to something like a variable not being in scope. YAML consumers are more likely to ignore extra elements so it’s easier to miss things like that for a while unless you have an unusually strict validation stage.')
