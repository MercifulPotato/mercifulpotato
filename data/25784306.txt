Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610665913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25782686, text='&gt; Maybe not the writing, but the spirit of the permissive FOSS licenses is not to end up being swapped into a non-FOSS alternative...<p>Well, you can argue the spirit all day, but in practice, permissive licenses mean what they mean. Once a version is released with that license it stays that way, but subsequent versions can have a new license.<p>Basically, you do keep the fruits of your labor - you get Elasticsearch 7.10 and all previous versions. But you have no right to Elasticsearch 7.11.<p>Note: In practice I agree it&#x27;s a dick move to go to a more restrictive license, and I strongly disagree with Elastic&#x27;s decision to do so. It&#x27;s just a greedy move that won&#x27;t even make them more money in the long run because it will cripple the momentum ES has.')
