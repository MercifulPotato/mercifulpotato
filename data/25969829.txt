Mainly we don&#x27;t bother. That&#x27;s part of why dynamic languages like Python and Ruby are so popular. Correctness takes a back seat to convenience.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with Pony making these choices. Let a thousand flowers bloom. But when I look at a new language or tool, my first question is, &quot;What kinds of problems might it be good for?&quot; From this quote, plus a number of other things, it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that they&#x27;ve chosen a relatively narrow domain, one I do very little work in.')
