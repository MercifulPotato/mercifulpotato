The study group is not reflective of you, and you might after dosing find yourself meeting the exclusion criteria.<p>Another point:\n3) participants stayed drug free for 3 months before the study<p>This means that these results are less reflective of you if you continually microdose, as they do not account for tolerance etc over time.')
