I can say that I agree with you. The people (both business side and dev side) in the trading portion of the company were much more likely to be assholes than in the non-trading areas, such as client facing areas. It seemed like the closer people got to being a trader or portfolio manager, the more likely they were to have a mindset of &quot;I&#x27;m better than you. I know more than you, so do what I say.&quot;, even when they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.')
