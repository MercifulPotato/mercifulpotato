Further, Republican legislatures in three states forced through new rules this election to block the counting of mail-in ballots until after election day making it impossible to have instant results.<p>And it&#x27;s bizarre to indict our vote counting system based on the fact that it&#x27;s hard for the media to guess the winner from incomplete data. Nobody wins any electoral college votes until the Secretary of State certifies the results. It takes a while because they make sure all the votes are counted first. This is a feature not a bug.<p>There are some real issues in election administration in the US, but this ain&#x27;t it. If it were up to me, I&#x27;d ban the release of uncertified election results, at least for a few days. The problem he identifies is one of expectations.')
