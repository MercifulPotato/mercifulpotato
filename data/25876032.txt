I&#x27;m no semiconductor expert, but it seems weird to me that although node size is measured in a physical unit, nanometers, it does not correspond to any real measurement that exists [1]. Each transistor in a 5nm chip is actually between 28 and 36 nanometers in width. It&#x27;s called 5nm because of a theoretical calculation based on transistor density [2].<p>If Tesla advertised a new &quot;200kWh&quot; battery, I would be very disappointed if it turned out that the battery only held 95kWh, but the marketing department had decided that improvements in the charging network have made it &quot;like 200kWh&quot; compared to earlier models.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;5_nm_process" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;5_nm_process</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikichip.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;technology_node#Meaning_lost" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikichip.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;technology_node#Meaning_lost</a>')
