You can&#x27;t opt out of that and create your own private immigration law based on your own opinion.<p>You are free, however, to lobby and convince others to change the immigration laws. That is doing politics. You are free to even advocate for open borders if you want. It&#x27;s a legitimate view. Reasonable people hold this view, although the same people understand you can&#x27;t have a welfare state with porous borders. But it&#x27;s not a view that most people agree with. Most prefer the generous welfare state and border control. Most people are perfectly fine with removing those who enter illegally back to their home countries.<p>If you think this is the embodiment of evil, then lobby to have the law changed, but don&#x27;t try to enforce your own private immigration law. That&#x27;s not doing &quot;politics&quot;, that&#x27;s throwing a tantrum. Politics involves working with the political system to convince a majority coalition to back your views. Throwing a tantrum is saying &quot;ICE bad!! No business with ICE&quot;. Decide whether you want businesses to act like adults or like emotional children.')
