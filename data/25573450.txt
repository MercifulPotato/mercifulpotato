Item(by='nsajko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609268594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570278, text='&gt; Not to mention the fact HRC called for the assassination of Assange and his treatment has been characterized by the UN as torture.<p>The claim of Clinton calling for Assange&#x27;s assassination seems to be a completely unsubstantiated rumor.<p>Your &quot;torture&quot; claim is plainly false (even if it were true, what&#x27;s the point in appealing to the authority of UN?), the &quot;characterization&quot; is by Nils Melzer, UN special rapporteur on torture (so he&#x27;s just something like an independent consultant).<p>More importantly, basically everything Melzer said about Assange is bullshit. I read the interview of Melzer that seems to be the source for all of the absurd claims; and all of Melzer&#x27;s claims there are vague, unsubstantiated, unverifiable or nonfalsifiable; except for one:<p>Turns out that Melzer&#x27;s only concrete accusation is based on a misreading of evidence at best; the one against the Swedish police, of how they supposedly tampered with (even <i>fabricated</i>) one of the testimonies. The evidence for that is inconclusive, Melzer was possibly confused with the format of the Freedom of Information documents released by the police, but in any case Melzer is making a big fuss out of nothing and downplaying rape with his other comments at the same time.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22209868" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22209868</a><p>Also see the comment by one of Assange&#x27;s alleged victims:<p>&gt; One of the women interviewed by Melzer later sharply criticised him and demanded his resignation. She said that by defining how a &quot;proper rape-victim&quot; would have to act, Melzer was engaging in victim blaming and that his report was partially &quot;untrue and defamatory&quot;<p>I think it should be pretty clear that Melzer&#x27;s word is worth very little.')
