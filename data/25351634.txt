Estimates also need to capture the level of uncertainty.<p>I still believe in frequent status updates with the manager, but those should be informal and (often) initiated by the individual&#x2F;team.<p>When driven by the employees, the act of breaking down tasks, estimating, and reporting status can do a lot to build trust in the eyes of management.  However, that autonomy first has to be granted by management first.<p>This work style isn&#x27;t just for senior engineers either.  The scope of responsibility should be smaller for junior engineers, but the level of autonomy over that scope should be relatively constant.<p>The best managers I have had hate micromanagement and generally refuse to put up with employees who require it long-term.')
