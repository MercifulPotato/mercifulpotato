It&#x27;s the first new console I bought since the Playstation 2. I only bought it after seeing a friend&#x27;s indie games library, and seeing that the Switch actually has a pretty decent library of reasonably sized games. This is after a year or two of having written this console off, too, based more or less entirely on people I know talking about <i>Breath of the Wild</i>&#x27;s epic size.<p>(The first games I bought for it were <i>Untitled Goose Game</i> and <i>Curse of the Obra Dinn</i>. I was not disappointed.)<p>It&#x27;s not to say that there&#x27;s anything inherently wrong with games being big. But it&#x27;s always seemed to me that most big games end up being big because the game designers didn&#x27;t (or weren&#x27;t allowed to) stop when they were done. And I&#x27;m sort of &quot;once bitten, twice shy&quot; about it. Since games tend to front load all their best ideas, you&#x27;ve got to invest many hours into a game before you find out if it&#x27;s going to sag out. Games reviewers certainly won&#x27;t tell you, except in cases where it&#x27;s <i>really</i> bad. I assume because the only people who could stand to review AAA games for a living nowadays are people who don&#x27;t mind this sort of thing.')
