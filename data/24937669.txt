Permanent ban for even the slightest offence.<p>No, the solution is to make all censorship illegal on large platforms, because otherwise the unsolvable question of &quot;whose standards&quot; it is that determine &quot;offensive&quot; arises. Right now Twitter employees consider themselves this high court and they will ban you based on their own political leanings, which only 50% of the country agree with.')
