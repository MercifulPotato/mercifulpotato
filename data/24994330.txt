Something as banal as trying to converse with a woman wearing headphones is now often considered harassment. A manâ€™s chances of mating success increase when he approaches many women, but so too do his chances of a gaining reputation as sexist, exploitative, or immoral. To take a fraught example, how does a man know that a woman is genuinely consenting to sex? A lack of ability to pick up on cues can incur catastrophic costs.<p>I don&#x27;t buy this. Social norms are a product of the group to which the apply. In this passage, that group is &quot;all single people&quot;. For argument&#x27;s sake, lets say heterosexual men make up 40% of that group. The author&#x27;s claiming that a typical member of that subgroup will not understand the rules? This seems like an extraordinary claim, and I&#x27;d really need to see evidence of such a thing happening any time in the past to believe it is plausible.')
