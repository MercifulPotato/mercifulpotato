I did give a look at Inertiajs just because Laravel was friendly towards it. Looks sweet.<p>Right now the &quot;glue&quot; I came up with is a silly connection between the server side router and the &quot;Entry&quot; component of Svelte. It works, it&#x27;s 10 lines of code, it&#x27;s clean and the website is super fast. But, both Inertia and my solution feel somehow &quot;hackish&quot;. Not a proper pattern.<p>But really, anything to avoid client side routing, state management and auto-magic code splitting.')
