The presupposition is that Apple is inherently motivated to actively lock things down, because that&#x27;s what they do with the iPhone. This glosses over that Apple has no reason to actually do so, only has reasons not to do it on the Mac, and has gone on record saying they won&#x27;t treat the Mac as the iPhone. It&#x27;s based on the notion that Apple would be against free booting <i>a priori</i> for some reason.<p>Mind you, not all bad faith arguments are unwarranted. I kind of get where it comes from. But it&#x27;s important to recognize that&#x27;s that what it is, and there&#x27;s no reason to actually believe it.')
