The one annoyance I have is related to editor tooling: In languages that use braces to denote blocks, I can paste a block of code wherever and have my editor autoformat it to the correct indentation level, while in Python I have to be more deliberate with increasing or decreasing the indentation of a pasted snippet, and sometimes I&#x27;ll make a mistake in the process that isn&#x27;t caught until later.<p>I dislike significant indentation for configuration because the nesting tends to get deeper than for programming languages and it can be harder to see what&#x27;s going on.')
