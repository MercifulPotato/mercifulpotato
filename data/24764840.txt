Item(by='unnouinceput', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602591421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764718, text='In Romania when you go and apply for engineering usually is like this. Computer Science is like 66% of a class is girls, then Electronics is like 50&#x2F;50, Electrical Engineer is like 25% girls and Mechanics is like under 10%. So the most prestigious of them all is still girl dominated. And is not like the boys don&#x27;t want CS, it&#x27;s because they can&#x27;t get in there. The fight for a place is like 25 students per place, and girls beat boys hands down. Also usually they are very beautiful too, so if you made it to CS, you&#x27;re drowning in both beauty and smart. Good times.')
