If there is an unfair mechanic, well you had best be executing it better than the competition<p>3) the meta rewards people who can follow and execute, and significantly less towards experimenting new approaches. The game has only so many degrees of freedom so it’s not like there is much more you can do better than the meta.<p>4) related to 1, everyone does the meta. It’s the way to play.<p>Eventually things get stale and boring, and only people who can Stomach&#x2F;enjoy the meta get ahead.')
