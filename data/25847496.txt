Some of these people will become friends.<p>You keep friends by contacting them at least once a year. I have a lot of my friend&#x27;s birthdays in my phone calendar. I text them on their birthday and sometimes on Christmas. It&#x27;s the little things like calling them when they&#x27;re in the hospital. The current plague is depressing, text your friends a tell them you&#x27;re thinking of them and bring their spirits up.<p>I have a vendor that I buy my hardware from. I bring them cookies now and then. (I make cookies and will eat the whole batch if I don&#x27;t give some away. I thank them for &quot;taking a cholesterol bullet for me&quot;.) I expected nothing from them but they are friends now.<p>If this sounds like a lot of work, be prepare to not have as many friends. And that&#x27;s OK too.')
