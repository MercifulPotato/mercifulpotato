Tesla left other automakers in the dust &quot;in some markets&quot; -- and by &quot;some&quot; I really mean just one: the US.<p>Tesla is the leader globally, but the article claims that other automakers <i>aren&#x27;t even a threat</i> to Tesla, and goes further to argue that the reason they aren&#x27;t a threat is because they haven&#x27;t built out charging networks. I don&#x27;t see how one can reach that conclusion when in the two biggest EV markets, China and Europe, Tesla is no longer the market leader.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that Tesla doesn&#x27;t have 28% of the global EV market anymore (that was H1 2020). As of October 2020 Tesla comprised 18% of 2020&#x27;s global market [1]. Still the clear leader, and almost the only contender in the US, but globally other automakers are threatening their lead.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;tesla-tsla-market-share-global-ev-sales-change&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;tesla-tsla-market-share-globa...</a>')
