Sure it uses ARM IPs including the ARM instruction set. But it doesn&#x27;t really use the ARM provided IP-cores as far as I know.  So the M1 is ARM in the sense that AMD chips are x86 ;=)<p>This seems to be a pointless differentiation but the M1 chips are inherently different from other ARM ISA using chips using ARM IP-cores. Probably the main difference is that they have special hardware support for x86 emulation allowing fast x86 emulation on a ARM ISA CPU which is normally not possible otherwise.')
