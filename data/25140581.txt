That&#x27;s why so many people switched to it.  But now it&#x27;s mediocre at best.  I can only shake my head and wonder how some of the so visibly obvious spam messages get through.<p>In keeping with the spirit of the OP, I&#x27;m not going to recommend a better option.  They&#x27;re out there.  And with GMail getting worse by the month, it&#x27;s worth keeping your eyes on the competition to see when you might want to make the switch, too.<p>Google Search is also supposed to be terrible.  I don&#x27;t use it, but my wife does and she complains about it all the time.<p>Recently she was searching for information about drinking white wine with beer.  It&#x27;s supposed to be a thing in New Orleans.  She wasn&#x27;t able to find anything but ads and places selling white wine and&#x2F;or beer.<p>Right now, searching Google for &quot;white wine and beer&quot; and &quot;new orleans&quot; I get a blog post about Christmas in Australia, &quot;Beer Drinking African American&quot; stock photo, Pinterest spam about beer buckets, and a bunch more blog spam.  Nothing useful.  I see no reason to go back to Google for anything.')
