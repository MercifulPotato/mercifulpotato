Shutting him up was a much more effective approach than &quot;we think you should read this&quot; links offering more information to people who didn&#x27;t want it.<p>And that&#x27;s trump. Who is crawling into the depths of social media to win arguments on &#x2F;r&#x2F;TheDonald etc? No one. Partly because its exhausting and partly because they&#x27;ll ban you. Bit mainly because talking bs is easier than disproving bs by an order of magnitude. It&#x27;s asymmetric warfare. It&#x27;s simply not practical to &quot;win the argument&quot; anymore.<p>And winning the arguement doesn&#x27;t actually change anyone&#x27;s mind anymore. No one open minded and rational supported Trump after the last 4 years, yet his vote count went up by 7m.<p>I feel like we&#x27;d never apply this to any other social issue. No one says we should not ban kids from smoking, but instead win the arguement on it with them. No one says we should permit drink driving but win the argument with every drunk arse hole and convince them not to do it. So why is this different?<p>We&#x27;re reaching a point where you can have social media without any fact checking OR you can have democracy. But not both.<p>I don&#x27;t expect the right answer to be easy. But I has to be possible and practical. This looks like the only option that fits that criteria right now.')
