I do not like when they do it to Alex Jones not because I like him but because I dont like the precedent to be set for other more valuable sources in the future. But the mechanism is exactly the same, if you dont defend &quot;the untouchables&quot; now, dont expect people to defend &quot;your team&quot; in the future.')
