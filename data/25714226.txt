But there are many other problems. One is that it’s very hard to save up money and start a business or retire early. Another is that you see very little “high risk &#x2F; high reward” economic activity, like really innovative companies. It’s a system that definitely has strong benefits if you live in “the mainstream of society”, but at the same time can feel like “halfway on the road to serfdom”, especially if live a bit differently and don’t really value the benefits.<p>Source: I’m a Swede living in Sweden since forty+ years.')
