The first will be the devs who build a free SDK to make building such things really easy. Think mediasoup but w&#x2F; all the rooms, permissions, servers, state management, etc easy to build with via API. The second team will garner adoption by putting in the effort into putting those pieces together and running&#x2F;moderating the thing.')
