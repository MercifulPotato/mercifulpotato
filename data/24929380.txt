Take BLM for example: how are Floyd&#x2F;Blake policing incidents related to removing entrance tests from the super-elite schools and colleges, or shaking down super-elite art galleries until they show more POC artists? Or having a nominally black VP who’s made a career out of prosecuting black criminals?<p>Or the populist conservative movement appealing to the “non-elite” working class, who the progressives used to represent. This is happening all over the western world.<p>TLDR: Elite vs. non-elite seems exactly right, but let’s not confuse it with “brainy” please')
