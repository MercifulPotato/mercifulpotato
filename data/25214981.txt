If that&#x27;s good enough for all the other omnivores and carnivores in the food chain, it&#x27;s good enough for humans. There are certainly a lot of problems with the sustainability and humane-ness of our livestock farming, but I don&#x27;t see &quot;become vegetarian&#x2F;vegan&quot; as the only solution, or even necessarily a desirable one.  But getting into a meat vs. no meat debate here isn&#x27;t ever going to be productive, so that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say.<p>I had not known that male chicks are killed after birth in such numbers, and the practice does make me sad.  But I also recognize that a lot of people just don&#x27;t have any kind of emotional response to this sort of thing, and that&#x27;s ok too.  It&#x27;s great that people are building new technologies to allow us to keep doing what we&#x27;re doing, but with better treatment of the animals involved, and less waste.')
