Item(by='Blikkentrekker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607966900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419965, text='&gt; What professionally inappropriate information do you have published about you by academic institutions and former places of work, or alternatively by you in your masters thesis?<p>So pretty much the “I have nothing to hide”-argument?<p>There is nothing “professionally inappropriate”; I simply do not want arbitrary persons to be able to look up where I work or what my master&#x27;s thesis was about and many other things.<p>What if I ever were to find myself having a stalker who can now easily look up my place of employ to accost me there? What if others realize what my field of expertise is due to reading my master&#x27;s thesis and use that to nag me for assistance?<p>&gt; I am not a proponent of &quot;if you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear&quot; (quite the opposite, in fact), but disclosure of your information under academic and professional context is not only unavoidable, but actually beneficial. As long as the information is reported honestly, it serves as a public record of your positive reputation. This allows all the participants of the job ecosystem to make better decisions about hiring&#x2F;accepting job offers, because it reduces the risk of the unknown. It&#x27;s to be embraced, not avoided.<p>And I could surrender my master&#x27;s thesis voluntarily if I were to go job hunting to my benefit.<p>But in my jurisdiction looking up the name online of potential employees is already not allowed, though obviously it can never really be stopped, they can&#x27;t reference what they find in there without opening themselves.<p>You say you are not a proponent, but this is absolutely a case of “I have nothing to hide.”; you decide what information is beneficial or not. Even if it be positive information to you, it might not be to others.')
