Item(by='abraae', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601588447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24653116, text='In New Zealand, your criminal record consists of solely those crimes you have been convicted of in court, and is automatically clean slated if you have gone &gt;7 years without an offence (unless you have been convicted of a serious crime in which case it&#x27;s on your record for life). In fact it is an offence for most employers to ask for your full (non-clean-slated record.<p>We also have a system known as police vetting, which is a far more intrusive background check, and includes not just actual convictions but also mere encounters with the police, warnings, etc. Police vetting can only be requested for roles that involve working with vulnerable adults or children.<p>In all cases the candidate must (a) consent, and (b) be supplied with a copy of the results. Overall I think this is a good system though there are some areas for improvement.')
