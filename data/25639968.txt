I forwarded them to customers because it was a convenient way to show their comments then follow up.<p>Then I noticed that some of the text was wrapped in a tokenised link to the platform managing our reviews, bypassing the login screen. Support said they could not revoke these tokens. We had to close the entire account and migrate everything.')
