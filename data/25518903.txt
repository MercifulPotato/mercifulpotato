Look into Tailscale, it makes it incredibly easy for me to ssh into my mac or a VPS. As for apps for iPad, I highly recommend the following:<p>1. Muse: awesome workspace app.<p>2. Ulysses: best MD app hands down.<p>3. Gladys: good clipboard.<p>4. Kodex: best ipad code editor.<p>5. Prompt: best ipad ssh client.<p>6. Working copy: good git client.<p>7. Kaleidoscope: diffing files.<p>8. Jira: pretty well done.<p>9. Documents: good for ftp.<p>10. Copied: good for bookmarking.<p>11. Goodnotes: best notebook app.<p>I’m seriously thinking about selling my imac because I haven’t used it since I got my ipad pro. I think I’ll sell it and build a RaspPi machine, ha.')
