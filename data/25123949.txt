If you bundle the JRE feels wasteful and if you don&#x27;t it feels uncaring for the less technical. Didn&#x27;t JavaFX, beside being &quot;Swing 2&quot;, consist of some native launcher component that would connect with an installed JRE if available (and sufficiently modern) and guide the user through download&#x2F;installation if not? Memories are faint.<p>Many similar approaches have been done, but none became a conveniently dominant go-to solution. Perhaps AOT compilation will finally bring a JRE bootstrapper component that is sufficiently &quot;java&quot; to find a wide footing in the java dev community and sufficiently friendly to end-users to end all &quot;but maybe that other tool is even better&quot; that kept all existing approaches niche.')
