I would argue that the solution is not some imaginary set of sensors that could somehow flawlessly detect every class of psychoactive drugs that could somehow impair a person, including but not limited to: xanax, PCP, ketamine, cocaine, alcohol, GHB, LSD, mushrooms, marijuana, 2C-I, MDMA, MDA, meth, heroin, fentanyl, etc. Not to mention a myriad more prescription drugs, including sleep medication and antipsychotics which are perfectly legal to drive on, but can also be equally impairing.<p>... But actually to continue the work that we&#x27;re already doing to implement self-driving cars. I mean, it&#x27;s not just drugs, it&#x27;s also tiredness, distractions, and simple mistakes.
