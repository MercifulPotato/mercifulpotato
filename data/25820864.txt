USB-C is preferable in every way.<p>When the iMac came out, everyone thought it was crazy not to have a serial port on the outside, since that was the standard for mouse and keyboard.  But pretty soon, everything was available for USB.  In fact, you might not have all those USB-A peripherals if Apple hadn&#x27;t cut the cord, so to speak.<p>So I don&#x27;t mind the loss of USB-A as much because USB-C is a strict upgrade.  But for the SD card reader and the HDMI those are sort of separate and common use cases.')
