Note that Antifa is an specific group of self-identifying people, not just everyone that’s against fascism.  They have a flag.  They’ve been around since the 80’s.  Some are violent, some just harass.<p>This is according to the anti-defamation league.  The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has also condemned Antifa in the past:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adl.org&#x2F;antifa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adl.org&#x2F;antifa</a><p>The people you are describing probably are more closely aligned, ideologically with SPLC and ADL (unless they spend their evenings doxing neo-nazis, and shopping for equipment for their next violent counterprotest).<p>I have been donating to and referring people to non-violent anti-fascist groups for years.  That’s very different than supporting militant extremists.<p>(Trump designated Antifa a terrorist organization, and I refuse to use that word to describe them.)<p>&gt; <i>No, it’s to get other people to exercise their right to free speech to not amplify harmful voices.</i><p>So, compelling speech is better than silencing people?  Where will it end?  Surely the criteria isn’t Republican vs. Democrat.  Lets go with “supports violence”<p>Violent far left militants definitely exist, and are “harmful”.  Shall we silence them?  The ADL and SPLC condemn them, but are also clearly sympathetic.  Shall we silence them too?<p>If not, perhaps we should stop them from supporting harmful protests.  Antifa could use this map to physically attack lawful groups on the right:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.splcenter.org&#x2F;hate-map" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.splcenter.org&#x2F;hate-map</a><p>Perhaps it should be taken down, at least?  I donated money to help create the map.  Should I be put on a list and prevented from getting a job?')
