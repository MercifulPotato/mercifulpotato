The slavery part is kind of creepy, but the former two parts solves this classes of controversies beautifully.<p>As you can see, most, if not all, known branches of vegetarianisms are specifically crafted rebellion movement against certain parts of western agriculture, and I think thus they are moot in other contexts.')
