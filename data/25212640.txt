Item(by='kingosticks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606329654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25211929, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t know which lens Jeff used in his video, I would have to rewatch it and I&#x27;m not inclined to do that.<p>He uses the &quot;official&quot; 6mm lens.<p>I use it daily for video and I just loaded it up and re-checked - I don&#x27;t see distortion like in that reddit posted image. I see something very similar to the examples in Jeff&#x27;s video. I highly doubt he&#x27;d have post-processed the video, that would be extremely misleading. In the context of similarly priced webcams that are available to buy in 2020, I find it very usable and not at all terrible. But I do appreciate it&#x27;s all subjective.')
