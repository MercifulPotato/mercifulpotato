I play a game where we will have thousands of players in the same shard and need people to be able to communicate with each other in subchannels while still being able to hear and speak up to the entire channel. We did switch from Jabber to Discord for paging purposes though.<p>Personally I hate running Discord because my computer already has trouble running 8 game clients, but I see the value in its appeal to the mass market. Personally I prefer the days when every friend group had a ventrilo server, and if not you&#x27;d use Skype (before it got ruined) for those adhoc meetups.')
