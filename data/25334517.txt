Fortunately I have a propane grill and a gas stove I can manually ignite. Otherwise I probably would&#x27;ve just eaten a box of goldfish for lunch and dinner.<p>Even though some gas appliances (like ovens and heaters) don&#x27;t work without electricity, I think stoves and gas fireplaces could be really helpful in life or death situations such as extended power outages caused by &quot;the big one&quot;. On the other hand I suppose gas lines are one more thing that can be damaged, so there&#x27;s a tradeoff there.<p>I actually know some people in outage prone areas who have invested in natural gas generators. Much cheaper than a Tesla battery pack and similar storage solutions')
