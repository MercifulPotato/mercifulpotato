It seems highly unlikely to me that the average customer of an ebook reader or a streaming TV&#x2F;movie service or one of the gaming networks has any idea about how the DRM works or how intrusively the provider of their electronic content can later monitor their use of it and change or revoke their access to it. Who do you think is going around and warning all these people, in such a way that they can reasonably understand the implications of what is being said, about the risks that come with these kinds of technologies?<p>Now, if you were arguing that governments <i>should</i> be regulating these industries, mandating information for customers about the risks and prohibiting abusive behaviours by content providers, then I&#x27;d be the first to agree with you. I think such measures are long overdue. But that&#x27;s not the same thing as what you wrote before.')
