To avoid having configuration files clogging up the bottom-level, put those in etc&#x2F;, and so on.  Maybe also share&#x2F; for common library code (which could be symlinked into per-plugin locations if you wanted them to be self-contained (git handles symlinks gracefully <i>except</i> on Windows I understand).  A doc&#x2F; directory maybe?<p>It&#x27;s likely that the amount of this whole-repo administration code will increase with time, so worthwhile having it with some structure from the start -- the &#x2F;bin, &#x2F;etc ... conventions are from Unix of course, but perhaps your team has other roots, in which case whatever works for you.<p>I would advise having these as non-hidden directories with short lower-case names without spaces, makes it easier to script; and README.md files so the documentation is nice &amp; visible on GitHub etc.<p>And yes, the &quot;real&quot; per-project directories in a subdirectory, pkg&#x2F;, client&#x2F;, product&#x2F;, something likes that.<p>Re issues, I&#x27;ve previously used tags to reasonable effect.  Not as convenient as per-repo issues, but that&#x27;s one of the downsides to monorepos. I think the benefits outweigh those.')
