So it took hundreds of millions of years for the first &quot;life&quot; to evolve-- perhaps close to a billion. This includes RNA, DNA, ATP, etc. Then it took about a billion-ish years to go from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life. Then about another billion-ish years to get multicellular eukaryotic life. Then it only took about a quarter billion years to have dinosaurs. It only took about 10-20 million years to go from the ancestors of all apes to having chimps, gorillas, and people. (!!!) And when you have people directing evolution, like with dogs or crops, you can make things happen very &quot;quickly&quot;.')
