The mass of the shielding alone for a hypothetical miniature DT fusion reactor would prevent it from being used in anything smaller than a large ship.  &#x27;Advanced fuels&#x27; with reduced neutron radiation are orders of magnitude below DT in power density for given reactor performance levels, so miniaturizing them is even <i>more</i> in the realm of science fiction.')
