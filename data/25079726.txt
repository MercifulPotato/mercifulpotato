I highly doubt it is true in any significant way. I would also challenge the assumption that women want aesthetics over some other factor. In this day and age, that&#x27;s an incredibly &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; statement to make.<p>From what I could tell. People bought iPhones because they were:<p>a)Cool and of good quality.
