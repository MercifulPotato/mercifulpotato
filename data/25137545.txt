I wouldnâ€™t. Would you?<p>I would lend, after carefully evaluating the educational track record of the student and the earning potential of the major.<p>If a lazy kid tries to get a loan for philosophy without a clear path, they get a high interest loan or no loan at all until they figure out the most efficient major for themselves.<p>If a poor kid with high GPA in high school wants to major in finance, sure I&#x27;ll lend at a low interest rate without a collateral.<p>If a rich kid with low GPA and poor track record comes for a loan, sure I&#x27;ll lend with a collateral.<p>If a poor kid with poor GPA and poor track record comes for a loan, sure I&#x27;ll lend at a high interest rate or wait until they improve their track record to earn the low interest rate.<p>This is literally how debt is supposed to signal prices.
