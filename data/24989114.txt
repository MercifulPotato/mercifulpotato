So as per earlier comments, I&#x27;d interpret that as the 7&#x2F;8th&#x27;s vote requirement actually <i>reducing</i> the burden on the legislature.  As long as they can get 7&#x2F;8ths of the votes, they <i>don&#x27;t need to bring it back to the voter&#x27;s again</i>.<p><i>&quot;The California State Legislature may not amend or repeal an approved measure without submitting the change to voters. However, a ballot measure may include a clause waiving this protection either entirely or conditionally.&quot;</i><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Laws_governing_the_initiative_process_in_California#Legislative_alteration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Laws_governing_the_initiative_proces...</a>')
