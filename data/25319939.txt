Tidyverse uses it to accomplish some non-model stuff. The one that leaps to my mind is faceting [2]. I&#x27;d expect that sort of thing to be handled by macros.<p>And all the rest of the comment I wouldn&#x27;t have typed except I&#x27;m already replying, since I know this is one of those two-types-of-people-who-don&#x27;t-change-opinions situations. But...<p>&gt;  not only saves a few keystrokes.<p>R is secretly a lisp. People can define whatever they want to be whatever they want. Pipes were already implemented in a library (try doing that in Python). Make your own library or bind \\ to a keyboard macro or something if your fingers are on the point of crumbling under the stress of those 7 keystrokes.<p>Defaults using real words to describe things is good. The function to create a function being function() is eminently reasonable. \\() is meaningless and about as useful as a one-word variable<p>&gt; It will also produce shorter, and clearer, lines of code.<p>Opinons very much divide. Code length is only a proxy for load on a reader&#x27;s short term memory which is what matters. \\ is going to put more burden on someone if they aren&#x27;t very familiar with R. Most R coders are not full time programmers and not very good at R.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rdocumentation.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;base&#x2F;versions&#x2F;3.6.2&#x2F;topics&#x2F;tilde" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rdocumentation.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;base&#x2F;versions&#x2F;3.6.2&#x2F;...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rdocumentation.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;stats&#x2F;versions&#x2F;3.6.2&#x2F;topics&#x2F;formula" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rdocumentation.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;stats&#x2F;versions&#x2F;3.6.2...</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cookbook-r.com&#x2F;Graphs&#x2F;Facets_(ggplot2)&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cookbook-r.com&#x2F;Graphs&#x2F;Facets_(ggplot2)&#x2F;</a>')
