It&#x27;s a long list.<p>- Greater confidence in TSMC vs Intel to deliver process improvements<p>- Leverage in house silicon design expertise<p>- Leverage Apple&#x27;s collaboration with TSMC<p>- More modern CPU architecture<p>- Single architecture across all products (so can run iPhone apps on Mac)<p>- Ability to incorporate Apple&#x27;s own IP (e.g. neural engine) in SoC<p>- Cost savings<p>- Full control of the hardware design<p>I&#x27;ve not mentioned performance as this follows from the other factors.<p>Only one of these benefits would be delivered by moving to AMD.<p>So some short term transition pain but I think this would be pretty compelling from Apple&#x27;s perspective when the decision was made.')
