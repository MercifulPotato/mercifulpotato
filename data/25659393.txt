Or, doesn&#x27;t reflect how my E5 interviews goes and doesn&#x27;t match up with what I&#x27;ve heard from friends. This is all anecdotal of course and based on personal experience.<p>1) DDIA is way too deep for E5, system design or product design. In general, the book is just too deep for any interview. It&#x27;s a fantastic book but it&#x27;s dense and too detailed for a 45 min interview.<p>2) The system design interview is largely around communication and thought process, <i>not</i> spouting techniques and flexing. I feel like candidates have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the system design round is and why it&#x27;s used. It is not simply a time slot to rattle off design concepts.<p>3) The big elephant in the room are the coding questions. 2 med&#x2F;hard per coding round, and you need to nail it all. Not only that, but expectations are higher. So no bugs, test all your code, perfect one shot solutions in optimal time complexity. This is very difficult to do under pressure.<p>4) At E5 level, I found the system design portion fairly easy. If you&#x27;ve been through the sys design interview before or currently work as a senior, it won&#x27;t be a big deal. I think people are blindsided by it because they are trying to up level themselves from L4 or E4, and then hit the &quot;senior wall&quot;.<p>5) Behavioral is really important. Unfortunate to not see this being mentioned.<p>tldr, E5 is hard because of the coding, not the system design. The system design at FB was similar to design questions and depth for all the major tech companies (MS, Amazon, Goog, Apple etc)')
