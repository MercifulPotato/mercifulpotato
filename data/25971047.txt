Of course the Gamestop situation is a unique one, but speculation is the entire point of the stock market. You can justify (and lower) the risk you take by examining fundamentals, or by investing in &quot;safe&quot; funds, but you are always speculating that the price will eventually go up and not down.<p>An example: One could argue that TSLA&#x27;s current price is almost entirely speculation divorced from current fundamentals. Are you sure it will be &quot;good for a lucky few and very bad for lots of people when it goes off the rails&quot;? It&#x27;s possible, but what should we do about that? Restrict people&#x27;s ability to trade TSLA?<p>In the case of Gamestop, I agree with you, it will be bad for lots of people who get in late. I think more people should be informed about risk before entering the stock market, but I don&#x27;t know if I agree with you that we need more government regulation in the market to do this. What would that look like?')
