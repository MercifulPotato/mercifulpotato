Telling people to install cygwin just to build a project simply isn&#x27;t viable when the default compiler toolchain on Windows is Visual Studio. Also it&#x27;s not about building projects alone, cmake is also a project file generator for IDEs (in my case that was the actual reason why I switched to cmake from my own project file generator for Visual Studio and Xcode).')
