Item(by='akiselev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603325153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849521, text='Haven&#x27;t used Nim yet but I&#x27;ve used a DSL with that syntax (in anger) - it <i>really</i> sticks out as distracting visual noise since I&#x27;m used to curly braces for code blocks and brackets for array&#x2F;object access. Since the latter are less common in most code, take up far less space, and provide a relatively useless visual signal compared to code blocks, I&#x27;ve learned to tune them out during navigation and light reading, which comes free on demand when adopting a new language. The curly braces, however, draw the eye and often come as annotations on things that share names or structures with what I&#x27;m looking for or trying understand or remember, confusing the whole process and causing mental &quot;cache misses,&quot; if you will.<p>I find many of Rust&#x27;s macros annoying for a similar reason, since they&#x27;ll often be at the root of a module or function but for various complicated reasons can&#x27;t have leading expressions - you can&#x27;t make user macros that look like `macro_rules! your_macro_name {...}` or control flow like `match expr {...}` - so they&#x27;re in an uncanny valley that&#x27;s just as distracting.')
