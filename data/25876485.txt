Even a few seconds is bad. And since our replicas are spread all over the world, it&#x27;s not feasible to move 1GB+ data from the &quot;servers&quot; fast enough.<p>Is there a way for us to use that sqlite file without it ever going away? We&#x27;ve thought about hardlinking it elsewhere and replacing the hardlink when rqlite is up, but haven&#x27;t built any tooling to do that.')
