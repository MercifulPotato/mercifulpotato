It&#x27;s a pretty small investment of time, and it frees you up from the time spent watching a Discord or refreshing store pages manually. Set it up to poll at a reasonable frequency, set up some form of push notification, and find that it&#x27;s not that hard to get ahead of the horde who are all relying on someone else to do the dirty work for them.<p>Signed,<p>Someone who got a launch day 3090 from the Nvidia store')
