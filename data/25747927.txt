Item(by='Lopiolis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610464592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746476, text='&gt; In case of whatsapp and keeping chat history it can mean years of chat history becoming public if for example your Apple &#x2F; Google account (where whatsapp automatically stores your conversation backups) gets hacked.<p>This just isn&#x27;t the threat model most people care about, nor do they have to. Given a choice between preserving their chat history with their loved ones and not having any of it in the off chance that it might be leaked somewhere, the vast majority of people will opt for the former. Once you value chat history and other media in this way, then the risk simply isn&#x27;t relevant. Again, this is all irrelevant. You people keep thinking on this one track of &quot;but it&#x27;s not secure&quot; when that isn&#x27;t the overriding concern for these people. It needs to be secure enough while not completely disregarding one of their core needs (preserving history). It&#x27;s non-negotiable and no amount of discussing of risk or privacy will change this. Again, I find it insufferable that tech people are so unwilling to take normal peoples&#x27; needs into account.<p>Signal has the opportunity to become the default secure messaging app while also providing &quot;secure&quot; backups. They don&#x27;t even need to be cloud backups, though that would be preferred. Even local backups can be sufficient. But as long as they don&#x27;t account for the needs of &quot;normal&quot; people, Signal isn&#x27;t a real option.<p>If I go to my friend&#x27;s girlfriend and say, here&#x27;s this awesome secure messaging app that you need to switch to and she switches, then something happens to her phone and she loses all her precious chats, how do you think that&#x27;s going to go over? I can blabber on about privacy and risks all I want, I&#x27;m still the asshole.')
