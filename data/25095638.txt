Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605388130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093665, text='&gt; Meanwhile with arm, you have constant instruction size (other than thumb, but thatâ€™s more straightforward than variable size),<p>That&#x27;s only for 32-bit ARM; for 64-bit ARM, the instruction size is always constant (there&#x27;s no Thumb&#x2F;Thumb2&#x2F;ThumbEE&#x2F;etc). It won&#x27;t surprise me at all if Apple&#x27;s new ARM processor is 64-bit only (being 64-bit only is allowed for ARM, unlike x86), which means that not only the decoder does not have to worry about the 2-byte instructions from Thumb, but also the decoder does not have to worry about the older 32-bit ARM instructions (including the quirky ones like LDM&#x2F;STM).<p>That would also explains why Apple can have wide decoders while their competitors can&#x27;t: these competitors want to keep compatibility with 32-bit ARM, while Apple doesn&#x27;t care.')
