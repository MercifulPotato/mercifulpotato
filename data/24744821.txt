This means that you are unlikely to drive off with the dispenser still in the car as there is no benefit to the driver to leave it in when they have finished.<p>It is interesting that it is the same dispenser design used around the world, but the latch is removed in the UK.<p>However, As a teenager I discovered the wonders of the latch on fuel dispensers on airfields.  Then on the road I started using the removable fuel-cap as a wedge to the dispenser.  eeeeek!<p>(Now I use an electric car)')
