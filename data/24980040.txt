And its whole IPO process is preferential treatment at its finest, almost looked like Jack Ma can do whatever he wanted.<p>Ant and Ma&#x27;s condescending posture did draw a fairly big backlash, it&#x27;s certain pratices border on non-compliance, and Ma&#x27;s beneficiaries are mostly from the last leadership, these probably helped put a brake on it.')
