Which species of &quot;trees&quot; are being planted? The answer to that question is...kind of important. And unfortunately, if you look at what we are doing right now, a lot of tree-planting schemes are just commercial species. If we go down this road, our zeal to combat climate change may in fact end up having negative consequences for species conservation. We must tie these two things together; it just requires us to understand that wild organisms are picky: a eucalyptus or pine plantation is no good whatsoever for the species we must save from extinction.')
