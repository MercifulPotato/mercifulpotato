Item(by='205guy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603098572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819254, text='Hate to say it, but iPad: I have a non-internet cell phone (still have a small data plan, just pretend I don’t) so during the day, it’s just calls and text messages (SMS or iMessage) and useful stuff like camera, music (offline) and calculator. I will turn on location data for maps if I’m traveling (so not much, especially recently)—otherwise those stay off. At night, I have an hour or 2 with the iPad, airdrop and post a few photos to social media, catch up on local news, watch a few select YouTube channels. All my internet and social media happens on the iPad that never leaves the house, and my phone is locked down and disabled as much as possible. Benefits are no tracking, no distractions, no notifications, and all my social media and video is on the larger iPad.<p>The tool I use the most at home: bench-mounted vise. I’ve owned a home for 15 years and try to fix everything I can myself, so I had lots of other tools (cordless everything) but never a vise until getting one as a gift. Now I clamp (almost) everything for cutting, drilling, sanding, whatever, and I don’t know how I managed before (I remember straining to hold things and getting upset when they slipped—or even injured).')
