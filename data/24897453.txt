How close that is to the &#x27;1% rule&#x27; ratio depends on which is the bigger factor: users with more than one IP or IPs with more than one user. We don&#x27;t know. If the former is bigger, then 0.008 is a lower bound.<p>&gt; Here&#x27;s another way. The number of accounts that have posted this year, divided by the number of accounts that have viewed HN while logged in, is 0.36. That doesn&#x27;t tell us much, but we can estimate the ratio of logged-in users to total users this way: logged-in page views divided by total page views. That ratio is 0.23. We can multiply those two to estimate the ratio of posters to total:<p>&gt; So the two ways of estimating produce 0.8% and 8% respectively. Both ways are bogus in that they assume things we don&#x27;t know and mix units that aren&#x27;t the same, but they&#x27;re the two I came up with and I don&#x27;t remember how I did it before. It&#x27;s interesting that they&#x27;re almost exactly an order of magnitude apart. That makes it tempting to say the number is probably in between, but that&#x27;s another cognitive bias talking.')
