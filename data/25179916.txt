They switched to citywide testing with 5:1 and then 10:1 pooled PCR tests in May and then recently switched to pooled rapid antigen testing. With the current testing methodology, they place one sample on a test strip, wait to see if there&#x27;s a color change, and if not, they&#x27;ll put a subsequent sample on. You can use a single antigen test for up to 10 people and patients get their results while at the testing site.')
