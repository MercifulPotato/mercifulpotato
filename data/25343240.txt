Sorry for the bluntness, but that is either malice or stupidity.<p>You completely ignored my argument that is important to look at the scale and reach of the democratic institution you&#x27;re dealing with. It&#x27;s all good if you say that you are working for democracy. It is <i>not</i> okay of your idea of democracy is to have some federal bureaucrat responsible in making decisions that affect so many people at once and does not take into account the desires and peculiarities of the people in the local level. I don&#x27;t want Federal Government being responsible for and the arbiter of matters that are in the realm of the city council, much like I don&#x27;t want the city council to step into things that should be in the realm of my neighbors association. The scale of power and reach matters. Do you understand that?<p>It seems your idea of &quot;fighting for democracy&quot; is in advocating more power and authority in an single entity and more central planning. History is filled with examples where centralization of power has always led to tyranny and abuse. Road to hell paved with good intentions and all...<p>So, before you start advocating for regulations that can affect so many people and have so many catastrophic unintended consequences, consider acting on the change on the smallest possible level: <i>you</i>. Once <i>you</i> do it and can honestly tell that the change was good, then you go a little bit higher in your circle and advocate for them to adopt the policies you did. Go bottom-up, not top-down. Not only is the most realistic way to affect change, it is the most ethical one.')
