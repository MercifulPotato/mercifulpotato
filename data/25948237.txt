When a market maker signs up to make markets on an exchange, they commit–contractually–to providing quotes in good times and bad. Payment for order flow contracts can vary, and I don&#x27;t know what Robinhood&#x27;s terms are, but they typically carry a similar requirement.<p>There are reasonable exceptions. If your systems are having issues with a stock, <i>e.g.</i> the intern entered a dividend wrong into the database, you can declare &quot;self help&quot; and stop quoting for some time. This is occasionally abused. But exchanges are decent at policing it.<p>In this case, though, yes--a lot of market makers made a ton of money, got scared, shrugged and then put their hands up. (Again, caveated to Robinhood&#x27;s agreements.) Fortunately for them, the crowd has been distracted by this Ken Griffin called Robinhood to screw over &#x2F;r&#x2F;wsb story, so they won&#x27;t get much more than a slap on the wrist.')
