A lot more ready-coded ideas fail which means a lot more wasted time (if making money is the point). I agree that not all ideas can be tested that way, some ideas just have to be experienced. For the ones that can be tested in their idea phase, it seems like a good way to prevent doing too much when the interest just isn&#x27;t there. At the same time you&#x27;ll probably miss out on some ideas that need a bit of a runway first, but you&#x27;re minimizing for downside risk instead of maximizing for upside potential.')
