There&#x27;s enormous amounts of it. Hundreds of studies. Hundreds of books. And the daily lived experience of million of people, who you need only listen to on the Internet.  But if you want a very simple, obvious one, take NBER paper 9873: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w9873" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w9873</a><p>One could plausibly debate the level of it. But to sweepingly declare there&#x27;s absolutely no evidence isn&#x27;t so much a claim of fact as a declaration of willful ignorance. Which, unfortunately, is part of why racism is still endemic. See, for example, Loewen&#x27;s &quot;Sundown Towns&quot;, where the later chapters show how America&#x27;s ongoing de-facto segregation, which was born out of the Nadir, both depends on and creates the sort of refusal to see the obvious that you engage in here.')
