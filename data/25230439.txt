If, for the sake of argument, we accept that as true...might it be also true that they are other things, simultaneously?<p>Who knows what ideas (and communications of ideas) <i>really</i> are, how they <i>really</i> work, what <i>influence</i> they exert on the very fabric of the environment (this infinitely complex, <i>magical soup</i> that we refer to as reality) in which they (and we) are contained, and what the infinite, recursive downstream consequences are of this influence.<p>At the end of the day, they &quot;are what they are&quot; and &quot;do what they do&quot;, and the same applies to their (unseen, unrealized, misunderstood) systemic consequences.  We can culturally deny such things (just as conspiracy theory culture <i>collectively denies</i> many things) all we want, but this does not stop it from being <i>actually</i> true.  Mother Nature does not require our agreement when organizing the structure and affairs of the universe, but we may mind a great deal when the system she has designed (that we rarely try to truly understand) serves up the consequences of any wilful ignorance that we may be guilty of (see: Planet Earth, 2020).<p>An extremely large number of people confidently (and sincerely)  make claims that seem to suggest they have a deep, accurate understanding of all this complexity.  My intuition suggests that these people may not actually be as correct as they perceive themselves to be.<p>&gt;&gt; Find a way to get rationalists out of believing that these examples are an accurate representation of the beliefs of the conspiracy world in general, and you may be well on your way to a universal solution.<p>This is <i>but one instance of</i> a much larger problem.  But solve this one, and you may have unknowingly solved many others.<p>FTA:<p><i>You can also take more explicit measures to prevent yourself from automatically adopting conventional opinions. The most general is to cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say something, stop and ask yourself &quot;Is that true?&quot; Don&#x27;t say it out loud. I&#x27;m not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to you the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.</i><p>&quot;Saying things out loud&quot; certainly has consequences (which come in many forms....loss of friends, ostracization, downvotes, etc).  I wonder...might there also be some downstream systemic consequences to <i>not</i> &quot;saying things out loud&quot;...like for example when some of the things that are not said out loud are ~unpopular&#x2F;unpleasant to ponder, <i>but also true and extremely important</i>.')
