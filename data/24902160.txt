If we did, we might find that humans who have lived healthfully and richly for centuries, raised many children, participated in my adventures and pursued many ambitions, might look nothing like the cached expectation of a 100 year old elderly decrepit person, or a 70 year old cantankerous political reactionary. Then again, they might; we just don’t know. I would rather find out, rather than continuing to bury potential wise old elves in the ground because we find the elderly tiresome and unsightly  and subconsciously want them permanently out of sight.')
