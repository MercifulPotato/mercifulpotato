Let me explain.<p>Conway&#x27;s game of life organisms&#x27; different states can be memoized. Starting the simulation slowly, an engine can memoize the following computations. This is what Hashlife [1] does. Quoting from Wikipedia: &quot;the rapid increase in speed is often described as &quot;exploding&quot;.&quot;<p>So much so that this kind of thing is possible: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8</a><p>Simulating the next ticks just entail looking up the future. Except for things the users touch.<p>Since Factorio is a game about reaching the next scale of automation, I believe this is a worthy follow-up to Factorio 1.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hashlife" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hashlife</a>')
