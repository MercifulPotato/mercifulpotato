Saying things like, “this is a big deal” and “this is unheard of”.<p>In my mind, the argument of wattage seems analogous to saying, “There is no way a low wattage LED bulb will ever outshine a high wattage filament bulb.” I have assumed that we’ve been able to make leaps and bounds in CPU technology since the dawn of computers while also reducing power consumption.<p>But maybe there is some critical information I am missing here. I’m certainly no expert and would love to hear more about why the wattage aspect holds weight.')
