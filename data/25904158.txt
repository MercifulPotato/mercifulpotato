In those types of scenarios it is worth buying a new car simply for those reasons.<p>Maintenance has to be done regardless of what kind of car you have. If you&#x27;re skipping those steps then it&#x27;ll come back to bite you. I think people just don&#x27;t like maintenance because they think it should be less than the value of the car. Which is simply not the case. Cars aren&#x27;t investments (typically) in the sense that their value rarely goes up. It goes down, almost always.<p>Maintenance is done to keep the vehicle operating properly, reliable, safe, and in good condition. Sometimes those maintenance steps may increase it&#x27;s value slightly<p>But here&#x27;s an example. Say you have a car. It&#x27;s worth $1000 but is otherwise in fine condition. It runs great, it&#x27;s safe, it is rust free and structurally sound. Except it needs to tires. Lets say those tires cost $750 because you also have to buy a new wheel and maybe the tires are harder to find. Do you go &quot;well... that&#x27;s too much... I&#x27;m just going to throw the car out and get a new one&quot;<p>If you do, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. The same is true for battery maintenance. If the car is otherwise fine, it&#x27;s like buying any other maintenance. You may not LIKE that you have to pay for maintenance, but it&#x27;s part of vehicle ownership.')
