There is always a few people who use the platform to express themselves in the most horrible way. 30 minutes were enough for me, there are many crazies out there using the platform for unamicable purposes. No way the moderators worst case is soft pork, unless they are only looking at flagged posts. I am not sure why people think they need the platform to &quot;keep in touch with friends&quot; . What happened to a good old call or a WhatsApp message or god forbid, meet in person.')
