Not so much of the poor people, but how do you secure the transfer and avoid making the poor people a target of abuse? (eg: people with guns lie in wait right after payday).<p>What&#x27;s stopping a corrupt government from making up a bunch of fake people to capture the money. Or giving each person 2-3 identities and allow them to get 2-3x the distribution?<p>Anyone know the details on corruption?<p>And to use a line from the article<p>&gt;“I think we often end up holding the poor, the recipients of aid, to a higher bar than we hold ourselves to, and that shows up when you hear the question, ‘Why cash?’ I think we should start with recipient empowerment and choice and ask, ‘Why not cash?’”<p>People can only eat a certain amount of food before it&#x27;s kinda a waste, whereas cash can be infinitely consumed&#x2F;transferred. Yes food can be stolen and resold, but at a fraction of it&#x27;s value -- decreasing the incentive to steal&#x2F;resell')
