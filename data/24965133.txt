What is relevant are the vast quantities of people who suffer from poverty and grotesque inequality.<p>Imagine explaining to some homeless person that society was pretty fine actually because in several generations somebody will have overtaken Bezos.<p>Put another way - you don&#x27;t make an unfair ladder fair by rapidly re-arranging people on it as much as possible (aka &quot;social mobility&quot; or &quot;opportunity&quot;) you make it fair by flattening the ladder (inequality reduction) and making the bottom of the ladder a less unpleasant place to be (poverty reduction).')
