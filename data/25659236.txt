If someone lives in and believes their own hype for long enough, have they created their own little bubble of reality?<p>It&#x27;s like watching someone try to perform a coup with a foam sword and a Nerf gun. On the other hand, a lot of bank robberies are done with fake guns; so the question is, how much does the plausibility of realness matter? All a bit Baudrillard for my taste.')
