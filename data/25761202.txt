Ever since leaving the Intercept because of the Biden story he became very narrow minded. He&#x27;s definitely in the wrong about Parler. The platforms have a rightful expectation that you can moderate the content on your site and it was proven that they have the right tools for the job. It was also shown that a huge part of the moderators were indeed MAGAs. It also seems to have incentivized users to spread disinformation [1]<p>Additionally: wasn&#x27;t there a post recently about the investors being unknown? I read speculations about a Mercer involvement but other than that little is known. How can Greenwald make naive assumptions like this only looking at the public figures? Aren&#x27;t there connections to Russia that had to be investigated? (Can&#x27;t find source right now, it&#x27;s on HN though)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;donk_enby?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;donk_enby?lang=en</a>')
