I’m not convinced.  There’s definitely closed platforms both hard and soft but the web still exists and general purpose computers are still available.<p>When I see these complaints I see people talking about how they want <i>other</i> people to use the Internet and computers.  That smells like authoritarianism.<p>If you want to contribute to an open web then do it.  It’s not your job to get our metaphorical racist uncles on mastodon or something.  Why would you even want that?<p>The romanticized “old web” was just a product of massive selection bias that <i>still exists</i>.  If you want that experience it is still out there.  Just stop worrying about what other people are doing.')
