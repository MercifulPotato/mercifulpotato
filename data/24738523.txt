It is understandable: according to this poll, over 94% of Belarusian users think the channels that made Apple worry should be left alone.<p>Previously, when removing posts at Apple’s request, Telegram replaced those posts with a notice that cited the exact rule limiting such content for iOS users. However, Apple reached out to us a while ago and said our app is not allowed to show users such notices because they were “irrelevant”.<p>Similarly, when Facebook wanted to inform its users that 30% of the fees users were paying for online events went to Apple, Apple didn’t let Facebook do it saying this information was (once more) “irrelevant”.<p>I strongly disagree with Apple’s definition of “irrelevant”. I think the reason certain content was censored or why the price is 30% higher is the opposite of irrelevant.<p>Apple has the right to be greedy and formalistic (or maybe not – that’s something for the courts and regulators to decide). But it’s time Apple learned to assume responsibility for their policy instead of trying to hide it from users – they deserve to know.<p>```<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;s&#x2F;durov&#x2F;136" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;s&#x2F;durov&#x2F;136</a>')
