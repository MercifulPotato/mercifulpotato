When we&#x27;re out shopping (well in the days when you could go out shopping). If we saw something that would look like a good gift for person X or person Y we&#x27;d buy it and put it in the present box. It might be a book or a certain item of some kind.<p>Then when it comes to near a birthday or Christmas we&#x27;d check what&#x27;s in the present box to see if we have anything suitable for them. If not we&#x27;d then go through the process of buying something. But the present box has saved us countless times as we&#x27;d often buy something thoughtful and put it in there in advance.')
