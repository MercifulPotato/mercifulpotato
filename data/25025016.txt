So far there is not one story of substantial fraud that looks plausible (let alone probable) and the two closest that I have found are a data entry error by a polling company (leading to &quot;they suddenly found 100k Biden votes&quot; posts all over the alt-right-o-sphere) and a postal worker in Michigan caught on the Canadian boarder with 1k postal items in his truck including three ballots.')
