I have a Dell Windows laptop with an ordinary barrel charger port which can also be kept charged by a dock plugged into the USB C port. It seems a good arrangement. I haven&#x27;t tried charging the laptop from a USB C wall wart rather than a dock, but it seems plausible it would work and it could be a handy feature if you forgot the charger somewhere.')
