But the point is not to argue that ad relevancy itself is bad. In a vacuum, improved ad relevancy is good! However, the improved relevancy of individually-targeted advertisements is not offset by the social detriment of user tracking.<p>To use an example, on a Facebook group for gamers, it would be fine and dandy for Facebook to establish a market where PC hardware and video game companies bid to show ads to users browsing the group page. Note that this doesn&#x27;t have to involve advertisers receiving any identifiable data about <i>who</i> the ad was shown to, and nor does it have to involve Facebook tracking your behavior online in order to show ads based on <i>other</i> sites you&#x27;ve visited, e.g. gaming communities on Reddit. The targeting is as simple as &quot;show the game ads to the people in the game group&quot;; it&#x27;s extremely coarse demographic-based targeting that doesn&#x27;t require any sort of persistent user profiling. It&#x27;s no more of a privacy issue than back in the old-timey days when a company would buy an ad in an enthusiast magazine.')
