They can&#x27;t afford it.  They can afford a house from the 70s or 80s that needs some TLC. The ones from the 50s and 60s cost over a million bucks because of location and lot size.<p>There&#x27;s always new construction available way far out at a middle income price range, there&#x27;s no history of depreciation there because way far out is a relatively new thing.  The previous way far out are those 70s and 80s houses I mentioned above.  With the 90s and 00&#x27;s in between.')
