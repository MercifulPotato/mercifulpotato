Also, this can adversely affect these student&#x27;s grades, as they have to purposely skip eating or dehydrate themselves hours in advance of the exam.<p>Personally, while I am registered at disability services, my issues are particularly severe. I have two rare immune-mediated neurological diseases affecting my peripheral nervous system.<p>If I hold my bladder, I literally experience something life threatening known as autonomic dysreflexia, which is just about the worst feeling in the world: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autonomic_dysreflexia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autonomic_dysreflexia</a><p>I also look completely normal, and I can walk. So, while I do not appear disabled, I am severely disabled, and I cannot hold it. I also have severe bowel issues too, but it&#x27;s TMI. I am on a last resort medication for that.<p>My professors limit the amount of bathroom breaks (an arbitrary amount) during the exam, and sometimes it is inadequate, especially for somebody like me who gets extended testing time. So, I had to go to disability services and explain my situation (degrading) to be allowed to use the restroom as needed. I had to have another accommodations meeting over these rules.<p>As for a TA escorting me to the restroom and literally standing outside the stall. Yeah, it&#x27;s degrading, but go ahead, be my guest.')
