Facebook was selling on the private market for ~$40-$45 per share before listing at $38.  Uber had a similar run-up.  Carta provides some equity tools for start-ups (at least, I&#x27;ve used their 83b product) and they want to expand to be a marketplace for helping sell that stock.  Forge Global is similar operation (if you create an account there btw they were giving free Crunchbase data for a while).<p>These equity transactions aren&#x27;t as simple as buying and selling an ETF though.  Moreover, most of the existing sales have been private, so sellers (e.g. accredited investors) and buyers (e.g. employees and founders) are at a steep information disadvantage when jumping into these deals-- Carta and Forge know the consequences, but the market participants do not.  Moreover, the space isn&#x27;t necessarily well-regulated.  So that&#x27;s a prime business opportunity: you have people who are too &quot;dumb&quot; to create a market themselves, but who want to transact.  The snark in my narrative comes from personal observations that it&#x27;s very easy to get burned (even in successful exits) and that these middlemen are typically even less trustworthy than big banks.')
