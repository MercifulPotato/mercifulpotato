Therefore your argument is invalid. Perhaps this is why.<p>But I don&#x27;t want to play that game. I just know that I want my primary computing platform and a major computing platform in my society to be open and not put a high tax on all economic activity – this seems important. But I do not particularly care if a games console I use does or not. Someone else can figure out the laws and fine distinctions.<p>EDIT: The Xbox can be used to watch TV and browse the web, so it is also &quot;general purpose&quot; by a strict definition.')
