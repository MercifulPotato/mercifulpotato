Frontend runs in browser and is either served by its own container or the backend, backend is in a containerized server, DB in something more persistent.<p>Except, the reality is it&#x27;s Frontend-&gt;Backend-&gt;DB-&gt;Storage. To some extent, the DB is just a standardized (and very quick) caching&#x2F;sorting mechanism in front of an SSD, HDD, network drive, whatever. Storage can be separate and persistent, even if the DB is in a container and gets killed&#x2F;dies.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, then even if the DB is in an ephemeral container the backing storage should always survive. With it, you can bring up a new DB container with all the same data being available.<p>So yes, your passwords etc are in the &quot;DB&quot;, but really they&#x27;re in storage on disk. Yeah, your app won&#x27;t work well if the DB disappears, but that&#x27;s a given no matter whether your DB is in a container or somewhere else. Once it&#x27;s back up, everything should work fine.')
