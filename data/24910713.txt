I&#x27;m sure the very first test car driving anywhere was less safe than a human driver.  Each step will lay the foundation baseline for the next step.  The Tesla 4 billion miles can&#x27;t be compared with anything since those aren&#x27;t really autonomous driving.  It&#x27;s like saying there&#x27;s a trillion miles on cruise control.')
