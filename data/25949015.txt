For example, they never mention that Robinhood allowed only sales, instead alleging that Robinhood disallowed all trades with GME.<p>The best route plaintiffs have to win the lawsuit is to argue Robinhood&#x27;s illegality here. They don&#x27;t do that effectively in the complaint, which hurts their case (though they could, and probably should, amend their complaint accordingly).')
