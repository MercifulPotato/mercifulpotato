Item(by='elmo2you', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607784001, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25396657, text='Upfront: I&#x27;m pretty much a total noob regarding UX.<p>However, I got a similar reaction to this being called &quot;flow cards&quot;. This to me looks just like yet another &quot;standardized&quot; set of (typical) web interface&#x2F;page designs. Sounds like a big misnomer.<p>Regardless of that, I guess there will be plenty of (UX) front end engineers, who will see value in designing things in a uniform way and from what is essentially a limited set of &quot;this is how it&#x27;s done&quot;.<p>That said, with between 2 and 3 decades of at least observing (web) design, I am still convinced that any good design begins with an empty piece of paper and a pencil, and a good understanding of everything relevant to the design (e.g. problem domain, technical platform, target audience, etc, etc).<p>Whenever I see (yet) another company promoting their tools for &quot;streamlining&quot; web&#x2F;interface design, the first thing that always strikes me is how much their tools appear to just push their particular ideas about what &quot;good&quot; (uniform) design is.<p>With the huge number of (varied) factor that may (or should) go into good interface design, I sincerely doubt that any of these tools can ever really help all that much in making better designs. They can help with collaboration and all being &quot;on the same page&quot;, no doubt. But it still feels to me that they just train people in making designs in a particular (and often not the best) way, with maybe more negative side effects than the positive ones they provide. That is not to even mention how contemporary fashion also always is a factor, in any design.<p>Anyways, just my two cents. I&#x27;m open to criticism and disagreement on this.')
