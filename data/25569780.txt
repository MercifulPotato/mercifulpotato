It can only ever lead to less diversity: that idea is a sure road to a chrome-only-web, which is far worse than the dark-IE6-ages.<p>I truly hope Flow finds its niche or sweet spot. Maybe embedded is that, maybe micro-computers. I truly hope a big name gets behind it, though. Maybe a game console or other OEM that needs a built-in browser. Maybe the Chino-West-economic war will force a large asian phone os to build their own browser. We&#x27;ll see.<p>But there really is need for another browser engine. If alone to prove that writing a new one from scratch is possible in 2020.')
