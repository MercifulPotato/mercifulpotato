For me, as a non-statistician, it&#x27;s difficult for me to look at the numbers and know whether this one particular reality was adequately accounted for by the model. 538 gave chances of each candidate winning - they didn&#x27;t state that they&#x27;ll have exactly x margins of victory. Nate&#x27;s stance before the election was that Biden could survive a significant polling error, and that&#x27;s about where we seem to be now.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the 538 post-mortem.')
