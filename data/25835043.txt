I also kind of harp on people who say they need really high precision systems, so use servos and spend bookoo bucks on slop-reductive hardware.<p>Even a cheap encoder, when decoupled from the motor, and directly coupled to the axis it measures, will give better axial positioning than a servo. It boggles my mind why people seem to ignore this in favor of a motor that knows where it is in space, but doesn&#x27;t know where the axis it is driving is in space.')
