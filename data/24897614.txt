And yet in many cases the social media sites themselves can easily determine which country a poster is from.<p>By default, everyone posting online has an IP address that reveals their country with reasonable accuracy. So why not reveal the country of each poster on all social media sites?<p>Every social media submission&#x2F;comment could have a country flag next to it.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that on &#x2F;r&#x2F;europe, where country flags are used, it has a subtle but profound effect on how I interpret comments.<p>For example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;europe&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jiareq&#x2F;happy_national_day_austria&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;m very aware that it&#x27;s possible to proxy traffic. But it&#x27;s also well within the big tech companies power to make this increasingly difficult. And those nationalistic trolls, which are not state-actors, would not have the know-how to mask their IPs in the first place. Identifying users with cloud provider IPs and VPNs is reasonably straightforward.<p>This is also not a ban of any kind and wouldn&#x27;t prevent anonymous users on TOR. It would just flag them as &quot;Unknown&quot; or something, which would still be useful info for the reader.<p>The only potential downside that I can see is the risk of actually increasing the impact of the bad actors, if the anti-proxying effort is not effective enough. But this seems like just a simple matter of doing the work that should already be done.<p>So, assuming effective anti-proxying is done by the big social media sites, why shouldn&#x27;t we have country flags everywhere?')
