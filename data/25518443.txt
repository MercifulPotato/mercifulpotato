Sometimes it&#x27;ll take 30-45s of the monitors going in and out of power saving mode before it actually wakes up. This does seem to be the MBP&#x27;s fault, because I can temporarily fix it by resetting the NVRAM.<p>Other than that, overall I&#x27;ve had a really positive experience with the TB3.')
