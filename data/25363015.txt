A common sentiment although easily debunked, since there are always rulers in any system with legal codes.  In any case this seems pretty off-topic.<p>Another in any case (since I can’t help myself): when political scientists talk about “modern democracies” they mean liberal democracies with rule of law etc.  Even though very few modern countries are truely democracies.')
