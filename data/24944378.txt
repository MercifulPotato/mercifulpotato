The company in question seems to essentially have no intention of spending their cash, yet instead of just paying it out in dividends or stock buy backs they&#x27;re pumping it all into bictoin (or investing in growth).<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense for a number of reasons. Firstly: The company has no competitive advantage buying bitcoin. If investors in this company wanted to buy bitcoin there&#x27;s no reason not to just pay a dividend and let the investors buy bitcoin.<p>Secondly, investors can now no longer invest in MicroStrategy - since the value of your investment in MSTR is now 2&#x2F;3rd determined by the performance of MSTR, and 1&#x2F;3rd determined by the performance of bitcoin. Essentially attaching a hugely risky bet on bitcoin to a business analytics company.<p>Thirdly, even if you do buy their contention that USD is going to go to 0 (which is a wild contention) there are other assets you would buy. Commodoties, Foreign currencies, real estate - hell even Treasury Inflation-Protected bonds would all form part of your portfolio.<p>Fourthly, you&#x27;re signing yourself up for this enormous risk of owning bitcoin. You&#x27;ve essentially put a $400m target on your back saying &quot;If you can compromise our security, you could have half a billion dollars!&quot;. Now obviously security is important in all asset ownership, but most assets have far more reputable people willing to offer services to secure your possessions (like a bank).<p>On the other hand though this does make it nice and easy for the CEO to disappear off with half a billion of his investors money in his back pocket. I&#x27;m sure glad those investors are in safe hands though - this would be really suspicious if the CEO had previously had to settle accounting fraud charges.')
