Item(by='SahAssar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611793575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25934130, text='&gt; There is almost none real p2p webrtc traffic happening in reality because most people donâ€˜t have enough upload bandwidth to transmit their video to all participating peers.<p>Many providers choose to use SFU&#x27;s even when not needed because they have features like recording that require it. I&#x27;ve gotten much better quality and latency on normal webrtc than I have over slack, teams, hangouts, even over bad mobile networks.')
