Indication of where the key lies means nothing to me if the key is nowhere to be found in a video&#x2F;article. &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une pipe&quot;.<p>Most content is useless mostly not because of malice, but simply because people who put content about what interests me mostly never have worked on actual real world projects. They&#x27;ll write about experiment tracking and ML project management and will just snatch the marketing brochure of whatever library pushed out by some company at a summit, never having used that library for actual work, heck never having run the getting started, to notice the cracks. They&#x27;d have relevant content if they had. Oh, well. Nobody &quot;got time&quot; for that, need to churn out a Medium post&#x2F;YouTube video.')
