It&#x27;s important for them to be the one telling you and you having to obey. If you just did what an email says then that&#x27;s just working for the business; the machine is working. If you attend a meeting then, it appears at least, the boss is the one who controls you rather than your actions being directed to the business needs you&#x27;re [apparently] working for the boss. They say jump, you say how high.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s minor megalomania. IME that&#x27;s another reason for meetings.')
