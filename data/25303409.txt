A car is a major contributing factor to personal freedom. You are able to travel short to long distances on YOUR schedule, not someone else&#x27;s. The biggest issue with a lot of public transpo is the lack of freedom. You dont travel when convenient to you and you dont get taken to exactly where you want to go. This of course has its pros that go with the cons, both environmental and cost (cost to a degree, not all public transport is created equal and I have a big problem with considering it savings if you spend 1.5 hours round trip to do a 30 min round trip commute, but that&#x27;s a slightly different topic).<p>When people argue for the rights of cars, they are really talking about their own personal rights to large movement (grocery shopping is far easier with a car than by public transpo and foot as a quick example).<p>And as the caveat, yes I do believe we need to take steps to solving our pollution generation. In the same breath, I dont believe in taking away personal freedoms or independent abilities. Paris is literally an archaic city. The design is archaic and what city planners have to deal with are hacks due to legacy design. Then again, French culture is rather archaic as well. They still refuse to adopt loaner words as an example, something the rest of the world has been doing for the past few hundred years at least. Using them as a poster child for what the rest of the modern world should do to fix pollution problems is like trusting an Italian engineering firm to build a bridge... it&#x27;s going to collapse :P Add to that, banning anything is a very buercratical answer to a complex problem. Tell me the last time banning&#x2F;prohibition has worked well and never had 2nd or 3rd order severe consequences. Historical speaking, they&#x27;re pulling ideas out of their ass and are going to regret this decision regardless if its &quot;for the greater good&quot;.')
