No more late night runs to the store hoping they have the one random cartridge I need. And I have only once run through ink so fast that I found myself without a waiting cartridge that had been previously shipped.<p>We do a lot of printing in the home right now with virtual schooling for my youngers. Watching them try to complete math assignments (this is early elementary, mind you) on a tablet interface is a frustrating experience, and in my opinion hinders their ability to actually learn the relevant skills. Printing the assignments out on paper and having them use a pencil is both faster and gets them into a learning mode better.')
