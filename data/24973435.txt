I have extensive infrastructure and tooling experience, particularly with data&#x2F;ETL services such as Spark, Airflow and Jupyter. I thrive in a position where I can help other teams solve business problems more efficiently and I love working on internal tooling to make existing jobs and processes easier. I have lots of experience working in and with remote teams. I would prefer a Ruby-centric organization but am open to almost any choice of technologies.
