The prohibitions of the DMCA&#x27;s anticircumvention provisions do not merely prohibit you from breaking DRM on a copyrighted work. If that was the case, then this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem: once the work falls into the public domain the DRM wrapping would have no legal force. However, the DMCA also prohibits making or distributing tools capable of breaking DRM. That means that as long as there&#x27;s even a single copyrighted work protected by some DRM scheme, then you can&#x27;t break DRM on otherwise uncopyrighted works.<p>This is sort of like living in a world where burgling old homes is perfectly legal, but lockpicks are also illegal, and so people who always locked their homes have basically opted out of the intent of the law.')
