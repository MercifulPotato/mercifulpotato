They over time really learn a lot and meantime end up blaming everything except themselves. But, people who start with conviction that they are not technical kind of person, never learn and just give up.<p>Drivers who assume themselves to be bad drivers tend to drive very little or not at all and never improve. They are parallelized by fear, their assumption they cant do anything rubs on others who are in car with them who then start to give them advice - making situation worst.<p>I have seen that dynamic a lot of times, because in my country it is quite frequent with women drivers. Not most women or something, but there is certain kind of woman who assumes own incapability and it is self-fullfiling prophecy.')
