Because literally any evidence is equally consistent with that as it is with constant physical laws; more consistent, actually, absent a complete model of the actual physical laws supposedly at work.<p>The very concept of evidence requires assuming that there are constant physical laws governing the production of sense data from something else. Without that, nothing is evidence of anything.<p>Now, there are lots of other assumptions that get marshalled to justify that assumption as a conclusion (my personal favorite being “God exists and he wouldn&#x27;t allow me to be deceived the way thay that not being true would entail”), but you can&#x27;t have evidence for it, because you can&#x27;t have evidence without it.')
