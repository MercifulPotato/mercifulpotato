You write it in your source code file, then send a piece of code to the REPL to update the “in-memory” state of your running program.<p>So any modifications you make stay in your files, just like you would normally do with any other language. But you write your program while it’s running, and you grow&#x2F;change it piece-by-piece, until it’s done (by that time, your source code is exactly your finished program).<p>If you want to re-start your REPL session, you just run your current file in the REPL as a whole, and maybe run some “Rich comments” (from the same file) to set up a limited test environment (to isolate the piece of program you’re working on).<p>This way, you make use of syntax highlighting and all the IDE features.<p>Edit:\nI’ve re-read your example with breakloop — I don’t really have experience with this style of REPLing. I agree that it raises a lot of questions, but thankfully functional nature of Clojure discourages this kind of programming.')
