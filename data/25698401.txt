It&#x27;s like email: you can run your own, but it&#x27;s easier to join some of the numerous existing servers.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t see how decentralized service can live without decentralization of control and ownership of nodes. Without the latter, you just get a multi-DC centralized service. So there&#x27;s no alternative to a certain degree of self-hosting. Either you yield control to a central authority, or you care enough to maintain a node under your control.<p>OTOH self-hosting should be made as simple as possible for an average user. Much like running a Skype node, or a torrent node did not <i>feel</i> like hosting, and felt like just running an app. This is ruined by the need to run on mobile clients (can&#x27;t be reasonable servers) and exacerbated by the widespread NATting of home networks, so your desktop can&#x27;t easily be a server, too.')
