Starting and connecting to a VM isn&#x27;t nearly as streamlined as connecting to a Docker container (even if it is also running in a VM).<p>Even the hurdle of SSH&#x27;ing to a VM is more cumbersome than `docker run`.<p>Certainly this could be automated and scripted, but the Docker solution is so... streamlined.<p>And I say this as someone that used to use Vagrant. With smaller installs available (such as Alpine), maybe more modern VMs would be just as easy as containers...<p>Also -- for me, VirtualBox was just &quot;meh&quot;. It worked, but really wasn&#x27;t that great. It always seemed like it took too many resources to run. That was another issue with Vagrant. (And yes, I did also use Vagrant with VMWare, but again -- that&#x27;s a lot of overhead).')
