I can&#x27;t use ffmpeg, because my app in commercial. So at this time I do reencoding -- these are implementation details I simply can&#x27;t avoid.<p>However, this happens on GPU, and it&#x27;s really really fast. Especially on a decent graphic card.<p>&gt; Also, I would like it to be super easy to keep the existing frame rate, quality, encoding, etc. Most software I see today ask for fresh export settings and not let easily figure the current ones (I guess assuming each video clip imported may have differences on these parameters).<p>This is doable (basically, guessing the best arguments by looking at all imported videos).<p>&gt; It would be so much better, for some tasks, to treat videos like usual documents - open, edit, save (to the same location), as opposed to import, edit, export.<p>This is an interesting idea. Do you mean, have a special extension, and when you open it do your editing + auto save + at close, you&#x27;ve already saved the video project?')
