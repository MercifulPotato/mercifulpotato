Metal is not inherently superior in this application. It is different, not better. Stiffer materials are more resistant to cone breakup but that is not really an issue in tiny headphone drivers. Some headphone makers probably choose metal drivers for marketing reasons, because (as we see on this thread) consumers understandably think that metal is better than plastic.<p><pre><code>    $100 Sennheiser HD 280 pros.

Above 4khz those Sennheisers do random things to the frequency response that an individual may or may not find enjoyable. And above 7khz it starts to become a simulation of high frequency hearing loss. I would probably enjoy it, because my old ears aren&#x27;t great in the treble region.<p>More to the point, we&#x27;re comparing active DSP EQ&#x27;d headphones (the Apples) to a bunch of passive models. Physical construction of the drivers becomes less relevant when you can use onboard EQ to bend the frequency response however you like, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about making your headphones&#x27; impedance curve work with a ridiculous array of amplifiers because it is mated to a known onboard amplifier.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not claiming that the AirPods Max will be headphones to buy. I really don&#x27;t like the sound of Bluetooth headphones in general, with the caveat that I haven&#x27;t heard Sony&#x27;s near-lossless LDAP codec. But these seem like a reasonable value proposition if you want wireless <i>and</i> a bunch of Apple-specific convenience features <i>and</i> you&#x27;re in the market to drop a few hundred on some headphones that you might use for several thousand hours.')
