Why should software engineers have special immunity?<p>This industry has a terrible track record of self-policing when it comes to security, so maybe some added liability would help—and, to the OP’s point, there really is no way that a secret token should be finding its way into a public code repository <i>except</i> by failing to follow safe design practices.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ehstoday.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;article&#x2F;21914808&#x2F;engineers-charged-in-fatal-scaffold-collapse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ehstoday.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;article&#x2F;21914808&#x2F;engineers-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lexology.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;detail.aspx?g=3812f88d-8670-4fc6-bf07-06e8f6f156c1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lexology.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;detail.aspx?g=3812f88d-8670...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.denenapoints.com&#x2F;engineer-fined-errors-dallas-cowboys-practice-facility-collapse&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.denenapoints.com&#x2F;engineer-fined-errors-dallas-co...</a>')
