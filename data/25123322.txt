Here is the thing, my wife and I did an around the world trip for an entire year and we did not stay once at an AirBnb. I checked AirBnb in every new country and every time it lost against a hotel or a hostel. Most AirBnbs were priced at the level of a hotel room, so if we wanted to splash out (after roughing it for a few weeks) then we booked a hotel for the price of an AirBnb and if we wanted something cheaper than a hotel then hostels beat AirBnb by miles every single time. Especially outside Europe many hostels were offering an unbeatable experience where you could get so much more comfort and value for little money than what the cheap AirBnbs had to offer. If during an entire year of travelling we didn&#x27;t book an AirBnb once (despite trying) then this speaks for itself IMHO - at least from my point of view.')
