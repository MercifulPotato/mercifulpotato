Nice to run into a fellow appreciator. I think it&#x27;s also the only DRM[0] I&#x27;ve ever encountered that was <i>a genuine pleasure to use</i> (not that it would work today).<p>[0] - Conquests of the Longbow required you to use the book that came with it to look up lore like coats of arms, to identify plants by their leaves, find out about superstitions around gemstones, etc in order to solve the puzzles in the game. At the time, people generally pirated by passing around floppy disks, none of the kids pirating had access to xerox machines, and the information in the manual was obscure, so you really kinda needed to <i>have</i> the manual. But if you <i>did</i> have it, it almost felt like a natural part of the game, and the information was fun to learn. Of course, now you can easily find it online: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sierrahelp.com&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Manuals&#x2F;Conquests_of_the_Longbow_-_Manual.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sierrahelp.com&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Manuals&#x2F;Conquests_of_the...</a>')
