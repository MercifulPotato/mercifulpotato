We don’t use assessments as a means of harming students, but we do genuinely want to make sure that you are ready to move onto the next level before doing so. I understand this can be frustrating.<p>This particular assessment, you’re correct, is not a direct map to the previous couple weeks of content, but rather a summative general assessment that covers material taught over longer periods of time. Anyone who is interested can google “CodeSignal General Coding Assessment” and find the assessment.<p>I don’t believe we’ve removed anyone from Slack for voicing concerns, but if you’d like to email me austen@lambdaschool.com I’ll look into it.')
