Unless you route everything, not only  default DNS, through the VPN, any app can just hardcode its own DNS ip and if you route everything through the VPN Blokada will do exactly the same but without an extra hop. Sounds terribly complicated for something that gives less security and privacy. Mind you that is coming from someone who runs 3 Piholes on a homelab.')
