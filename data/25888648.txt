But as someone who has built 100s of sites with WordPress I feel the need to defend it on a few points here:<p>&gt; You have to let it modify its install. Security-fucking-nightmare.<p>You don&#x27;t have to do this, you can set up sane permissions and use the wp cli[0] tool to install updates manually. I prefer to version sites with git and install updates locally, then git pull down on to the live server.<p>&gt; It will use incoming requests to trigger &quot;cron&quot; jobs (which can include self-upgrades), via a non-loopback HTTP request.<p>A good practice is to set up your own cron job[1] on the server and disable the internal cron in your wp-config.php, like this:<p><pre><code>  define(&#x27;DISABLE_WP_CRON&#x27;, true);\n</code></pre>\nAgain this is a decision I imagine was made to support shared hosting environments. They&#x27;ve made it easy for 99% of users, which is why it&#x27;s so popular. We the remaining 1% who prefer to use real cron can edit the config.<p>&gt; It falls apart under any kind of load, both because of unoptimized DB queries, and because of PHP. You have to put a cache in front of it to be able to handle getting on HN, let alone Reddit.<p>Just install a page caching plugin of your choice[2]<p>&gt; You really have to dedicate an admin to it if you want to keep it secure and performant. I still get angry remembering my experience installing, securing, and setting up caching in front of it.<p>Or use a managed WordPress hosting service like Kinsta[3] if you don&#x27;t want the hassle. They&#x27;ll handle all this sysadmin faff for you...<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wp-cli.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wp-cli.org&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.siteground.co.uk&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;real-cron-job&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.siteground.co.uk&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;wordpress&#x2F;real-cron-j...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en-gb.wordpress.org&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;w3-total-cache&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en-gb.wordpress.org&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;w3-total-cache&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinsta.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinsta.com&#x2F;</a>')
