Or worse, using select() in jq.  The grep should always come first.  Even if you need to do something like<p><pre><code>    .. | fgrep value | jq ... | fgrep value\n</code></pre>\nto pre-filter, and then filter again to rule out any false positives.<p>I have some tooling built around jsonparser and fastjson that I need to split out and open source. jq just makes me sad.. very capable, but overkill for what most people use it for and very slow for the common case.<p>source: wrote the C version of bro-cut that you like so much :)')
