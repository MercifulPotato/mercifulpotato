Wayland somehow seems to handle the cursor on the same thread as anything else, meaning when your system is under heavy load the cursor actually starts to lag, and even under normal circumstances mouse movement feels weirdly laggy. It is an absolutely atrocious experience, like someone has put sand on your toothbrush or something, it actually makes Wayland unusable for me.')
