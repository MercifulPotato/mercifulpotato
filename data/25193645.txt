Companies like Cummins sell them as crate motors, complete with the computer and everything you need, down to the electronic accelerator pedal.  Now, you may have to cut off some motor mounts and weld on some new ones and maybe solve a few coolant and hydraulic plumbing issues but I would guess that these guys probably have a go-to motor and they’ve got that down pat.<p>That said, I kind of doubt you’re getting out the door with an industrial Cummins turbodiesel for under $40K.')
