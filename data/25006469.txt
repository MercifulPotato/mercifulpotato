To some extent, housing has inflexible demand.  If you work in a city, you <i>need</i> to find housing at least within commuting distance of that city.  Because of this, landlords can build tiny palaces, and people will pay 50% of their income or more to live there, even if they really want affordable housing.  In some sense, you could argue that real-estate developers can operate like a cartel and control the supply of affordable housing.<p>One clear alternative to this public housing.  In Vienna, for example, about a quarter of the population lives in social housing.  And these are poorly maintained slums, these are nice, well-located and affordable apartments.  The city&#x2F;state can optimize for the actual housing needs of the city rather than for profit.<p>I would argue that housing, much like healthcare, can function better when managed as a public good, as there are too many perverse incentives at play when there is a profit motive involved.')
