I an built entire deployment&#x2F;change-management system in very small IT teams (1 other person with different skills from mine). We eventually got the go-ahead to grow the team, including more admins with my skill set. At that point, I had written pretty much the entire thing while the other admin had been focusing on tasks related to their skills.<p>Whenever a request came in for something regarding the system, I would have to force myself to sit down with one of the other admins and walk them through making the change to close the ticket. It took 3-4 times as long to do the work that way, but after a few weeks, I could start assigning some tickets to them directly and eventually the time savings exceeded the expenditure and I could go back to big-picture planning.<p>It&#x27;s a hard lesson to learn the first time, but worth the pain of going through.')
