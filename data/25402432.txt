At some point in time stars started lighting up. Maybe they even all lit up at once, long time ago. But some stars are so far away that the light from them has not yet reached us.<p>Even though there are an infinite number of stars we can only see the light from a subset of them because the light from the rest of them has not reached us yet.<p>So I think the simple resolution of the paradox is that the speed of light is not infinite. No?<p>What I also never understood was what about matter that is not lit up?  There could be many more unlit heavenly bodies than stars, which would block the light from the stars.')
