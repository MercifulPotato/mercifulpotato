I was actually surprised when they hired me with absolutely zero knowledge in Go. That said, I was able to hit the ground running with minimal assistance using the language itself and I found Go to be enjoyable. Don&#x27;t let the unfamiliar territory intimidate you. &quot;A Tour of Go&quot; was a perfect starting point: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tour.golang.org&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tour.golang.org&#x2F;welcome&#x2F;1</a><p>You raised an interesting point in your question though: how do you reap benefits? I did not find a good answer to this. I&#x27;ve yet to see any convincing real-world reason to switch from .NET Core to Go. I thought perhaps it had an edge in the streaming media industry, but I didn&#x27;t find that argument to hold significant weight either. If you go searching online, you might find some articles that show Go to be more performant using large numbers of threads or doing exclusively mathematical operations, so that might be where you could reap some benefits?<p>EDIT: I hope what I said about reaping benefits doesn&#x27;t come off as any sort of fanboy-ism towards a specific language. This is just my personal experience as C# dev. Use the language that&#x27;s right for you and right for the task.')
