We also are careful to include problem and rationale in our own product internally. When one of us wants a feature or one of our data scientists asks for a feature &quot;I want a button to click and do X&quot;, we ask &quot;what are you trying to accomplish?&quot; and focus on the job to be done. People naturally go for solutions&#x2F;implementations and we can be completely oblivious that the solutions we propose are a result of our knowledge or lack of knowledge.<p>Here&#x27;s our issue template for features to lower the barrier to write good issues:<p><pre><code>  &lt;!--These are comments and will not be rendered. Please click Preview to check.--&gt;\n  \n  ### Description\n  ----------------\n  \n  &lt;!--Describe the problem we&#x27;ll solve. What, where, when, who, why, and how.--&gt;\n  \n  \n  ### Target\n  ----------\n  &lt;!--Who&#x27;s the target audience? Who&#x27;ll enjoy this the most or suffering from\n      lacking this feature the most? Is this a problem you have? Have you talked\n      with other people who have this problem? Is it something that would just be cool?\n      Is it a seed for an idea that can be cool?\n  --&gt;\n  \n  \n  \n  ### Instances\n  -------------\n  \n  &lt;!--If the problem has happened multiple times, can you describe them--&gt;\n  \n  \n  ### Proposal\n  ------------\n  \n  &lt;!--What is the plan to solve this problem? Can we guess a solution or have a hunch?\n      Do we have a list of steps? It&#x27;s okay if they are a bit vague for now. We&#x27;ll clarify\n      by debating them and adding context to them, reading more about the subject. It&#x27;s \n      essential to understand that this document serves to capture thoughts and externalize\n      thought processes so we can all tackle the problem more effectively.\n  --&gt;\n  \n  \n  ### Resources\n  -------------\n  \n  &lt;!--Do you recommend any reading to do about this? Maybe a video to watch for something similar?\n      Maybe a blog post or documentation pages or just a snippet? An image, mock-ups, etc...\n  --&gt;\n  \n  \n  &#x2F;label ~feature\n  &#x2F;cc @rahimbk @jhadjar @hadjkhelil\n\n</code></pre>\n&gt;<i>Your product looks interesting.
