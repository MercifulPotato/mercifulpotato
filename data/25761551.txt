Your goal really isn&#x27;t just &quot;ban TikTok&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;raise my children to develop healthy habits on their own and to recognize when they are being manipulated.&quot;<p>So, even if you ultimately decide to enforce parental controls, I hope you will bring your children into the decision-making process.  Have an honest dialogue with your children about your concerns, and develop a space where they are free to share their own thoughts and feelings without fear of judgement.  It&#x27;s important that your mind is not already made up before you sit down at the table, as they&#x27;ll sense it immediately.  Repeat this often, and make it easy for anyone (yourself included) to express that their perspective has changed.  Set a good example (by e.g. not using social media yourself) and apologize when you are wrong, so that your children learn that it&#x27;s safe to do the same.<p>Encourage them to pursue healthier alternatives.  Allow them to experiment and learn from their mistakes.')
