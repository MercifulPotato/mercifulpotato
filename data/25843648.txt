Wuhan was in lockdown for a week at that point, and my flight to the Netherlands was the very last one I could get. At that point, the WHO also declared global emergency.<p>I arrived in Germany and the Netherlands. What happened in the airports? No temperature checks or other checks. Nobody who took note of my name for contact tracing. Nothing.<p>Back in the Netherlands, I called the CDC: can I get tested? Reply: no, not even if I pay for it myself. I ask: do I need to quarantine myself? Reply: nope.<p>I didn&#x27;t trust that. Chinese media has been raging for weeks about how infectious and dangerous it was, and that it could be spread asymptomatically. So I voluntarily quarantined myself and my family for 2 weeks. Turned out I wasn&#x27;t infected.<p>Up until March or April or so, I saw on tv and newspapers and how multiple western governments called covid just a flu, that we&#x27;re &quot;well prepared&quot;, even criticizing the lockdown in Wuhan as a human rights violation.<p>You want to talk <i>negligence</i>? Okay, China could have done a better job, but let&#x27;s say they were earlier by 2 weeks and reported to WHO mid-Dec rather than late-Dec. Would that have changed <i>anything</i> when for months the west totally dismissed the virus as being dangerous, and gleed at China&#x27;s misfortune?<p>&gt; and how they treated the doctors that sounded the alarm<p>Li Wenliang was not jailed. He was reprimanded by the police, and could go back to work the next day. He wasn&#x27;t the first one: the first doctor who said something was Jiang Jixian, whose work led to the WHO escalation on Dec 31, 1 day after Li Wenliang said something. The Chinese court later ruled that the police&#x27;s treatment of Li Wenliang was unjustified. The police then apologized.<p>See also: &quot;Some whistleblowers are more equal than others&quot;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mango-press.com&#x2F;some-whistleblowers-are-more-equal-than-others&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mango-press.com&#x2F;some-whistleblowers-are-more-equ...</a><p>&gt; the HK issue and with the Uighur concentration camps<p>These are whole different, and rather complicated topics. I could go into them, but I need to know from you: do you actually want to discuss, or is this meant as a diss to me?<p>&gt; So you&#x27;re not behind the great firewall huh? Reminds me of Chinese agents bullying Chinese students in Canada to not badmouth the government<p>So what? I don&#x27;t &quot;bully&quot; others for disagreeing with me about China, I talk to them. If you ask me whether those students should bully, then I&#x27;d say no: they should discuss. That&#x27;s something they need to learn.<p>But the same applies to a great many people in the west, who despite being raised in a free society, prefer to cancel rather than talk.<p>Still, that doesn&#x27;t mean that those students&#x27; support for China is not genuine or legit.')
