Months have passed and life has moved on, but I wanted to release it to the public so it didn&#x27;t just on my harddrive, lost to eternity.<p>Smiley vs. Karla is an espionage role-playing game for 3 to 5 players set in the world of John Le Carr√©&#x27;s cold war spy novels.<p>Unlike most pen and paper role playing games, Smiley vs. Karla is not a strictly collaborative game. Each player has a private objective which may conflict with the objectives of other players.<p>The game is played by 3-4 player characters, who play as spies employed by the British intelligence services (&quot;The Circus&quot;), and one Spy Master, who controls the context of the adventure and plays as the non-player characters, some of whom will be assets of the Russian intelligence services (&quot;Moscow Centre&quot;).<p>Collectively, players are trying to achieve the assignments ordered by Smiley, the British spymaster and to foil the objectives of Karla, the Russian spymaster.<p>However, each player also has a private goal that only they know about. These goals may conflict with and supersede the collective goal, particularly if their role is as a double-agent for Karla.<p>The group wins if they successfully complete Smiley&#x27;s mission and an individual wins if they complete their own.<p>Prelude in London, a complete one-shot campaign, based in the 1960&#x27;s criminal underworld of London, is available here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Miserlou&#x2F;Karla&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Prelude_in_London.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Miserlou&#x2F;Karla&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Prelude_in_Lon...</a><p>My group ran it as a one shot-campaign and had a lot of fun, especially with accents and moments where we got to try to betray and undermine each other.<p>Anyway, I know it&#x27;s not super hackery, but I thought there might be some community overlap, so I wanted to share.<p>Cheers!')
