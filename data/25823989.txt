Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610990274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823621, text='&gt; why is freedom of speech even coming up?<p>The wider context of the debate is the thing, IMO. Prior to the Internet, exchange of opinions used to be locally restricted - now with the Internet, we have a couple of clashes.<p>The most obvious is that the US model of &quot;free speech&quot; is almost absolute, whereas European societies believe that some forms of speech (esp. calls to violence, Holocaust denial, Nazi imagery) should be banned to protect society and its minorities from the worst. I&#x27;m German, given the history of what my ancestors did I&#x27;m firmly on the latter camp.<p>The second one, related to that, is that social networks are, for about the first time in human history, <i>truly global</i>, and it&#x27;s not in the clear at all who should &#x2F; could claim legal authority over what happens there. When a person denies the Holocaust, Twitter can ban them, they can refuse to do anything or they can place a German-wide ban (per the NetzDG law). On the other side, when a German woman posts a photo of herself topless on Facebook, that is perfectly fine by German law but risks heavy fines for Facebook in the US, so Facebook errs on deleting stuff.<p>And the third and final clash is STBX President Trump: should a private company have the power to take away the capability of a sitting US president to communicate efficiently with his citizens? Should a President (or any other political figure) be allowed to &quot;govern by Tweet&quot; in the first place? Is a call for violence, even for genocide (Iran&#x27;s Khamenei comes to mind), acceptable simply because its caller is a government leader?')
