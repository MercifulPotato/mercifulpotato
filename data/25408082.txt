You think that the entire population would&#x27;ve continued just headed to restaurants while hospitals declared &quot;not accepting patients anymore&quot; and refrigerator trucks stacked up outside nursing homes?<p>What actually happened in stupid countries is that they reacted too late, too lightly, and everyone&#x27;s been complaining that &quot;oh the cost was too high&quot;. It takes a lockdown of ONE month, enforced strictly, to clear out COVID from the population and resume effectively normal activity (you still need to limit international passenger travel but that&#x27;s proportionally far simpler).')
