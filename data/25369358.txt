Google isn&#x27;t DNSSEC-signed. Neither is Microsoft. Or Facebook. Or Amazon (whose DNS service, Route53, doesn&#x27;t implement DNSSEC). Or, last I checked, any US bank.<p>You can check this for yourself: make a list of domains, and then write a trivial script:<p><pre><code>    #!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh\n    while read domain\n    do \n      ds=$(dig ds $domain +short)\n      echo &quot;$domain $ds&quot;\n    done</code></pre>')
