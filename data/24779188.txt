Some form of engineering or hard science (I presume you don&#x27;t have a CS degree).<p>Do you have a portfolio of work that can demonstrate your ability?<p>Have you contributed significantly to a reasonably large open source project? Better yet, are you a maintainer of such?<p>If you can answer yes to some or all of these, it will demonstrate that you have a certain intellectual ability and staying power; that you have demonstrable competence in programming and that you understand and are familiar with SDLCs and working in a development team. It will still likely take some effort in applications, you are still a risk, but you should stand a reasonable chance of landing a job.<p>If you can&#x27;t answer yes to some of them then I&#x27;d argue struggle, as a recruiter, to see what&#x27;s in it for me.')
