I&#x27;ve used different 3d modeling applications, few that do it this way, but I never liked it. I think the early Photoshop 3d viewport used this, but now does something else. Lightwave modeler always had one of the best free-rotation cameras.<p>Off-hand, I don&#x27;t remember what that rotation equation is to be most effective.')
