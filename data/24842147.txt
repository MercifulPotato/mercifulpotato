I&#x27;d take this to the logical extreme and claim\nuniversity lectures are largely vestiges of a past when the replication and\ndistribution of monographs was expensive, and audiences were often the\nspeaker&#x27;s peers who could benefit from live interaction.  The\nadvent of the internet and the commoditization of post-secondary education\nhave dissolved these two motivations, and the fact that colleges charge the\nsame tuition for recorded lectures during COVID-19 belies the longstanding\n&quot;dirty&quot; secret that college is more a third-party seal of approval than a\nplace of genuine learning.')
