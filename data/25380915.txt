Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607647608, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380618, text='&gt;Let me hear your side.<p>In the absence of any support from the Federal government. many states and localities have re-opened in the face of growing numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths (more than 3,000 people in the US died <i>yesterday</i> from COVID).<p>Note that states and local governments are <i>forbidden</i> from running deficits, which is why many have reopened and stayed open even though cases&#x2F;hospitalization&#x2F;deaths have skyrocketed.<p>If they want to continue to pay police, fire fighters, EMTs and keep public hospitals open, they need revenue.<p>Implementing another stimulus as we did last spring, with support for state and local governments would allow us to stabilize the economy while limiting the risk to the populace.<p>The outside review board for the Pfizer vaccine approved it today.  The FDA will likely give emergency approval for it in the next few days.<p>However, it will take <i>at least</i> six months to vaccinate enough people to limit the carnage.<p>With a stimulus from the Federal government, we can <i>save lives</i> while we vaccinate as many as will take it.<p>Not GP, but that&#x27;s my side.<p>Edit: Fixed incorrect reference to the Pfizer &quot;virus&quot;.  That should (and now does) have read Pfizer &quot;vaccine.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d love to hear from others who disagree with my take.  I think it would be a good discussion.  I hope someone who does disagree goes that route rather than other, less expressive ones.')
