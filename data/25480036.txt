I was given some advice when I was junior and I&#x27;ve been repeating it for years.<p>Code it read 100 times more than it is written&#x2F;edited. Writing in a high level language is writing for a human first and a computer second.<p>As a general rule of thumb a variable name should be as big as the scope of that variable.<p>* If it&#x27;s scope is one line it&#x27;s okay to use a single letter.<p><pre><code>    deletedDocuments = documents.find(d =&gt; d.deleted)\n</code></pre>\n* If it&#x27;s within a block normally one or two words will be fine.<p>* If it&#x27;s one file, 3 or 4 words.<p>* If it&#x27;s global it should read like the opening paragraph to war and peace.<p>The last two are generally indications that something has gone wrong with how you are encapsulating your code and you should consider a refactor. However you will often have no other option in which case always lean towards more descriptive not less.')
