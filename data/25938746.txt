Look at all the window when resizing, how they stutter, streak, flip. That&#x27;s the broken windowing system. At it&#x27;s core, it&#x27;s a classic race condition, the window size, controlled by the os is updated, the software needs to repaint it, if it doesn&#x27;t do it before the next compositor redraw, yikes.\nSadly, nobody seems to care and microsoft &quot;fixed&quot; it in UWP.')
