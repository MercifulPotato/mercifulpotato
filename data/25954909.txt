It&#x27;s not easy and it will take some time, but as the knowledge of UX is increasing across decision-makers and people building products, we will get to a better place.<p>With all due respect: you are new here. The level of UX is at Windows 1.0 or Xt widgets. I hate to say that but windows 3.1 looks like a revolution compared with Windows 10,  OSX (current) or Material &quot;design&quot;.\nThere was a time when things worked. Now the dark ages of UX have come i it will be a long time until the new industrial revolution will come.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a bit early to start losing faith, we haven&#x27;t even properly started yet.<p>This is true for Win 10 and Google&#x27;s brain dead interface. Some not so long time ago things were much, much better. \nThe worst thing is that there is budget allocated for such things.')
