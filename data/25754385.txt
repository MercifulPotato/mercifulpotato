Nobody actually knows if you can transmit after getting vaccinated or not.  Thus far anyone who claims otherwise is a liar.<p>There is some evidence that some of the vaccines prevent transmissions, but we need more study before we can make a statistical determination.<p>We know why other vaccines have failed to stop transmission. The reasons those vaccines didn&#x27;t stop transmission do not apply to the covid ones.  However there is a lot we don&#x27;t know about biology so until we have better evidence no expert will state that the vaccine stops transmission even though many believe it will.')
