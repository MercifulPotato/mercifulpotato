I haven&#x27;t clicked through on all of them. It appears to weigh various pros and cons. It seems even handed to me on a quick skim.<p>Further, the NYT has many sections and voices. This piece is specifically from from The Upshot which has this tagline: &quot;Analysis that explains politics, policy and everyday life, with an emphasis on data and charts.&quot;<p>And this specific piece is written not by a reporter, but by a expert in the field: Austin Frakt is director of the Partnered Evidence-Based Policy Resource Center at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System; associate professor with Boston Universityâ€™s School of Public Health; and a senior research scientist with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.<p>I appreciate the rest of your comment.')
