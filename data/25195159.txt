The configs are all over the place, there&#x27;s 2 or 3 per project repo, another several global configs, the command line tools have a thousand flags and switches, the compiler language extensions are insane (i have like 30 turned on by default, and those are just the safe ones), i could continue...<p>This project, at least, tries to help the new user get into it quickly, I appreciate that because it helps me get my friends to try Haskell for a nontrivial use right away, then they want to invest the time to learn the rest of the Haskell toolchain bullshit.')
