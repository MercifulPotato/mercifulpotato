Where were those unlimited spoons when I overslept, decided not to shower, put on a pair of dirty socks and sprayed them with deodorant because there were no clean ones left, got to the office an hour late, failed to complete any major task all day, fell asleep on the train and missed my stop, got home an hour later than I should have, ate half a tub of icecream and some raw carrots instead of cooking dinner, and went to bed leaving two days worth of dishes in the sink and still having no clean socks?<p>I&#x27;m still unsure whether I&#x27;m an unusually low-spoon individual, or whether the author thinks nominally healthy people are doing better than they really are, or whether there&#x27;s actually something wrong with me, or what&#x27;s going on.')
