Item(by='Terrario', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607227927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320708, text='&gt; The primary works often just blatantly &quot;state&quot; things as if they were opinions.<p>&gt; Historical philosophy books aren&#x27;t mathematical proofs. They don&#x27;t necessary demonstrate process at all, it&#x27;s not philosophy being &quot;done&quot; but just stated.<p>This is such a strange take. I have always found the absolute opposite to be true. Recently, I’ve read Spinoza Ethics (literal attempts at geometric proofs), Kant’s Critique (arguments meticulously crafted line by line, from the regressive methodology to the transcendental proofs it reads like program in degree of detail) and Adorno’s Dialectic of Enlightenment (basically a modern day academic thesis in style and substance).<p>Im not denying that some philosophers simply state things without arguments, but then that’s something a critic would point out with textual references and attack. Bad business to do if philosophy’s your trade...')
