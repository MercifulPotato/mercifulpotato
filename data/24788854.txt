It is clearly not the focus. But, yes over diagnosis of any form particularly when it leads to the unneeded medication of children is a huge problem. I think it is clear that I am not advocating dealing with boys by sedating them.<p>I&#x27;m glad you raised this related issue though as I believe that many of the legions downvoting my opinion feel that somehow I am ok with that strategy. I feel that the systemic need to identify energetic and inattentive students and then solve those issues with medication is a travesty that rises directly as a result of increased classroom sizes resulting from school funding shortfalls. I&#x27;m not advocating that at all. What I am advocating is that teaching strategies in my opinion do not need to be altered to accommodate boys contrary to what I perceive the article to actually be about. Changes such as:<p>* Lessons that are structured as competitive games.<p>* Lessons requiring motor activity.<p>* Lessons that require a combination of competition and teamwork.<p>Boys (in general) are already proficient in learning though competition and movement, starkly opposed by middle school girls who (in general) are not, at least not when it comes to physical contests with boys. Boys just don&#x27;t need lessons that reinforce competitive games and motor activity. If anyone would benefit, it would be girls but that would also likely require a single gender school system.<p>Boys go on to dominate (almost) every profession so clearly altering middle school teaching strategies to favor and accommodate them at the expense of girls is both unneeded and would likely lead to larger systemic disadvantages to women.')
