Item(by='myself248', descendants=None, kids=[25676272], score=None, time=1610048393, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676002, text='&gt; Are there any popular old computers (Commodore, Amiga, Mac etc) that used a 5Â¼&quot; drive? My impression is everything was on cassette, until 90mm drives became cheap enough for home use.<p>Your impression is very much mistaken. The Commodore 64 and Apple &#x2F;&#x2F; were both equipped with 5 1&#x2F;4&quot; drives quite frequently, as were the Atari 400&#x2F;800, the Tandy CoCo, etc. The TI 99&#x2F;4A was usually found with cartridges and tapes, but could be equipped with a peripheral expansion box including a 5 1&#x2F;4&quot; drive.<p>Anecdotally as a kid growing up in the 80s, 5 1&#x2F;4&quot;s were everywhere and I didn&#x27;t see my first 90mm disk until years later.')
