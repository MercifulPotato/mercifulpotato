We keep thinking it&#x27;s going to, but it doesn&#x27;t.  (Or rather, it does, but only for a very short time.  Then we want more.  I&#x27;ve started to sometimes question whether I should take the first hit, because I know what&#x27;s going to happen.)<p>A cynic might suspect that the primary point of the processing is to make the food sell more of itself.')
