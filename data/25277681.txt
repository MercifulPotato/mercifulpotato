There just isn&#x27;t even a remotely passible substitute for many cheeses.<p>99% vegetarian, 1% pescatarian here and I agree with your statement, but I&#x27;d add milk and eggs to that list. There is no substitute for eggs at the moment AFAIK and despite many probably pointing me to all the oat&#x2F;nut&#x2F;soy milk replacements none of them comes even close to real milk for me. I can tolerate a bit of oat milk with my coffee every now and then, but can&#x27;t have a bowl of cereal with milk substitutes. Just doesn&#x27;t taste right. Also I&#x27;m concerned about the much higher glucose intake from oat milks than real milk.')
