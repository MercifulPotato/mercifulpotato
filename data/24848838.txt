I have to do it for the web sites I build.  But I build them with this kind of abstraction in mind, and am able to convert the mechanics of a web site to another language in just a week or so working with a translator.  Then they do the content, and I add that in, and it&#x27;s done and good.<p>I&#x27;ve added up to five languages to some of the sites so far, and the language audits have turned up no problems, and no complaints from the users. (We do actual human testing with actual humans. No bogus &quot;telemetry.&quot;)<p>Admittedly, my sites don&#x27;t serve nearly as many people as GMail, but they have to be as close to perfect as possible because I&#x27;m in healthcare, and conveying important information.<p>At the same time I&#x27;m able to do it with just me, while Google has a trillion dollars to throw at the problem.<p>The professional translators I work with say that to them, it looks like Google translates its web sites with Google Translate, rather than with a native-speaking human being.')
