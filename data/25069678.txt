Doesn’t matter if the individual data points are not themselves identifying.<p>One thing I’ve been curious about is whether AI and algorithms that can potentially take a huge amount of anonymous data and “identify” a user (but not explicitly), only identify in the sense that the output of the AI was only possible by correlating individuals granularity enough. I’m almost certain the answer is yes. I’m not clear on whether GDPR addresses that issue or not.')
