There&#x27;s nothing so simple as Maven&#x27;s list of phases <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maven.apache.org&#x2F;guides&#x2F;introduction&#x2F;introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#a-build-lifecycle-is-made-up-of-phases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maven.apache.org&#x2F;guides&#x2F;introduction&#x2F;introduction-to...</a> ; instead each project has its own slightly different set of build commands.<p>&gt; Once you start to dig deeper, you find out that setting multimodule projects is still easier in SBT. And if you decide to dig deep and really learn the build tool, it doesn&#x27;t really matter which one you choose.<p>Disagree. Maven multimodule projects are very simple: you can have a module that contains a list of submodules to build and... that&#x27;s it. Importantly, every submodule acts exactly like a normal top-level project, so if you only ever want to work on one module you don&#x27;t have to understand anything about the bigger project. And moving between single-module and multi-module projects isn&#x27;t a big conceptual leap.<p>SBT multimodule projects are not only their own unique thing, they make the above problem even more confusing, because each project has its own slightly different set of build commands, and each module has a slightly different subset of them that works.<p>And even if you really learn it in detail, SBT is still awful on multiple levels. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lihaoyi.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;SowhatswrongwithSBT.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lihaoyi.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;SowhatswrongwithSBT.html</a> talks about the deeper problems.')
