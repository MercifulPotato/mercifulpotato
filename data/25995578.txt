I really enjoyed building it (Ruby on Rails, if you wondered), I learned a lot. It turns out I also really like using the app, and I&#x27;ve actually blogged a lot more since I built it.<p>I hadn&#x27;t planned to &#x27;commercialise&#x27; it at all because I figured not many people in 2021 want to pay cash money for a basic (albeit intentionally!) blogging app, and B2C is generally a tough place to live.<p>Despite knowing better we got locked down again so I built a marketing page and I thought I might as well ask the Hacker News massive what they think of it before I inevitably turn it off. Is old-school blogging dead? Shall we try and resuscitate it? You tell me.<p>Go forth and roast me - I can take it! :-)')
