As a lawyer, reading people&#x27;s reactions to 230 repeal attempts (especially when it comes from educated engineers and technologists) is shocking. What is more astounding is that, for some reason, they seem convinced that this will take out FB&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Twitter, etc. where we have ample evidence that the <i>opposite</i> will occur, and they&#x27;ll just become further entrenched platforms since they are the only ones that would have the financial capacity to continue running community based platforms effectively. I have yet to come across a strong argument for repeal that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate the issues that repeal proponents purport to want to address.')
