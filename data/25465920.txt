I think the people that harp on about this are expecting the game to be something it&#x27;s just not. Why not focus on the aspects of it that are good, instead - like, literally anything else? Visuals? Story? Tactics? Ambience? Different character builds? The game gives you plenty of freedom to decide how you want to experience it. It seems like a lot of people just want to focus on the uninteresting&#x2F;minor parts for some reason.')
