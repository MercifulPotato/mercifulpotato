Is it a cancer on our culture? In some cases absolutely (FB&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Insta for example).<p>But the reality is as it always has been. Big money controls things. The guy really driving the bus at this point is pretty much Larry Fink, who sits on top of a 7.8 trillion dollar fund that effectively controls the markets...like all of them. (there are other large funds but this one is I think the largest). Matt Levine touches on this topic in a piece from last summer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-06-25&#x2F;the-government-wants-esg-out-of-pensions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-06-25&#x2F;the-go...</a><p>Larry&#x27;s gotta be super happy to have people distracted by this &quot;Big Tech&quot; nonsense, keeps his shadow government off the radar screens.<p>And really only a very small number of people relative to the broader population actually care that Trump was de-platformed. Frankly it was long overdue. Putin lost his useful idiot (oh well, easy come easy go...), but The Republic, and the broader country appears to have flushed the toilet on a zero-value-add liability.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting the markets didn&#x27;t miss a beat over the last two weeks. Go figure....')
