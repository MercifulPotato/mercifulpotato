The original announcement trailer was all about police bringing in a cyborg person who went on a killing spree. Granted, that trailer is most of a decade old now, but their recent marketing is similar. I just saw a commercial saying something like &quot;nothing is illegal in Night City... As long as you don&#x27;t get caught&quot;. Even though it was coolguy marketing fluff, I assumed that the police AI would at least be at the level of 15 year old Grand Theft Autos')
