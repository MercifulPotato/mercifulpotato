It reminds me of old religious zealots shoving some holy texts in front of you to show how &quot;good&quot; they are, but if you dare peek behind their back, you&#x27;d see a mountain of bodies. Point that out and you can see truly how remarkably fast an human brain can compute hundreds of excuses.')
