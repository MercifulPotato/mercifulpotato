Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610861663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806315, text='&gt; What irks me is people who use the equal sign as in T(n)=O(n log n), though. Why would a function equal a class? Set membership notation does the job just fine.<p>It&#x27;s strange but it&#x27;s fully standard. I would guess it develops from the use in analysis, where o(n) is more common. You derive your formula, it has a term in it that you don&#x27;t want, you observe that &quot;complicated term&#x27;s numerator = o(n)&quot;, you take your limit, and the term vanishes away. Use of the = sign makes more sense there, because conceptually you&#x27;re claiming something about the value of the term. (Specifically, that in the limit, it&#x27;s equal to zero.)')
