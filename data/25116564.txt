I think I&#x27;m aware of only one other instance, though I&#x27;ve personally begged journalists for headers multiple times even in some cases where I was a subject of the article and not some random nobody.<p>From the perspective of protecting sources it&#x27;s probably good advice to avoid publishing any kind of opaque header-stuff.  But also, most readers wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with the information and -- less charitably-- publishing evidence moves away from the framework where readers accept the reporters word on blind faith.<p>Your position was entirely understandable: I declined to link to the repo or the two flagged HN threads about it, though I considered it, because I thought it would increase the risk that my comment would get flagged.  I think your reply had the surprising consequence of making a really good example at how effective the suppression of info like this is at distorting the public discourse.')
