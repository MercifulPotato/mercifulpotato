Item(by='bArray', descendants=None, kids=[24670017, 24670231], score=None, time=1601699949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669440, text='Eh, I&#x27;ve had the &quot;one button&quot; UI on a &quot;smart&quot; watch where you&#x27;re doing a series of single taps, multi-taps, short presses, long presses, etc. It&#x27;s really not fun for several reasons:<p>1. It takes forever to do anything even remotely complex.<p>2. The most common features aren&#x27;t really the easiest to access (in terms of input effort).<p>3. If you make even a single mistake in a long series of taps, you have to loop all the way back through the interface. If you let it timeout, this is apparently the equivalent of a &quot;select&quot;.<p>4. There is zero intuition for any this functionality.<p>I know some people here will not like to here this, but it&#x27;s how I feel when somebody with an iPad is showing me the difference between a one finger, two finger, three finger and four finger swipe&#x2F;grip. It&#x27;s not that they exist and nobody but a power user would access them, for me it&#x27;s more that I might accidentally trigger one of these functions and have zero idea of cause and effect.<p>The worst offenders are when the UI changes depending on the context. Like that touch bar Apple had where the buttons and layout would change depending on which application you are in. I understand how it could be cool for a power user, but as a normal user I want some standardization for the location of things between apps.')
