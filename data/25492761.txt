I encourage anyone interested in performance to look over GC code and realize how much work they are doing.<p>That GC in particular has to stop the world, traverse the entire fresh heap, guesses whether something is even a pointer (and can guess wrong, causing a memory leak!), and does all this at arbitrary times, unless you do non-idiomatic things like manage your own memory in preallocated arrays, or use C&#x2F;asm-powered memory mapped buffers [0].<p>Nothing comes for free, and some domains can&#x27;t pay the price for GC (and choose to spend those resources elsewhere). Games, in my opinion, are largely still in that category.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=S7nEZ3TuFpA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=S7nEZ3TuFpA</a>')
