The basic idea is that the user can connect live data to Splitgraph, or upload versioned snapshots called “data images”. Then we give them a unified SQL interface to query all that data, a catalog to discover and share it, and tools to build&#x2F;push&#x2F;pull it.<p>We (two co-founders) just raised a seed round to productize the core tech that we&#x27;ve been working on for the last few years. Now we&#x27;re building the initial team to help us make Splitgraph a category defining product in the data space. This is an opportunity to join an early startup with an exciting vision backed by a strong group of investors. The two of us are based in Cambridge, UK, but we&#x27;re building a remote organization and are able to hire from the UK and the US.<p>We&#x27;ve put a lot of effort into building a stable and modern stack to allow you to work productively. We primarily code in Python (backend) and TypeScript (next.js frontend) with GraphQL queries auto-generated from Postgres schema via Postgraphile. There&#x27;s also some C, Lua, and Pl&#x2F;pgSQL involved. We&#x27;ve got automated build and deployment pipelines, rely heavily on Docker containers and use Nomad and Terraform for deployments.<p>We&#x27;re hiring Senior Software Engineers across the stack. Specifically:<p>- FRONTEND ENGINEER: Work on the frontend of the data catalog. We have a lot to do. You should be proficient in the &quot;modern frontend stack&quot; of TypeScript &#x2F; React &#x2F; GraphQL. Backend experience is a plus.<p>- BACKEND ENGINEER: Work on wide range of backend projects, from authorization APIs in Python to Postgres extensions in C. At minimum you should be proficient in Python, with bonus points for a Data Engineering or Dev Ops background. Experience with other languages is a plus.<p>- PRODUCT ENGINEER &#x2F; UX DESIGNER: You&#x27;ll help us articulate our vision. You&#x27;ll conduct user interviews, write PRDs and create mock-ups. You&#x27;ll organize the roadmap, prioritize sprints, and serve as the interface between users and devs.<p>Please send resume &#x2F; CV to careers [at] splitgraph [dot] com. The subject line should include the position you&#x27;re applying for. Also please let us know which timezone you would expect to work from, and any relevant citizenship &#x2F; residency status information.')
