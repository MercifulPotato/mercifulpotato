If I lose all of my electronic devices in a sudden accident, how can I recover my online life? To address your questions specifically:<p>1. I used Shamir&#x27;s secret sharing to send out a copy of my secret key to a few loved ones. The master password is in my memory only. If I forget the master password, I lose.<p>2. I use 1Password, and they say they make accounts read-only once you stop paying. If they did actively delete my account, my devices have a local copy. If I lose my devices and they delete my account at the same time, I lose.<p>3. I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re imagining, but you need the data, secret key, and master password to have this be a concern.<p>4. This has nothing to do with my threat model, I&#x27;m afraid. I can&#x27;t imagine a world in which knowing my IP address leads to decrypting my password vault.<p>5. I am and this is correct. If there&#x27;s a vulnerability in the cryptography used by 1Password, I lose. As you said, if there&#x27;s a trojan update, I lose.<p>6. This is the same as 1 and 2.<p>All things considered, as a regular person who is concerned about protection from thieves and not especially concerned about being a target of governments, I am OK with these risks.')
