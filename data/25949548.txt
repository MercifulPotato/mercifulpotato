Credit cards will have interest rates, collateral loans will have liens on property, etc, etc. Nothing about this is impossible.<p>I do find it funny how the people who complain about this are also complaining about government oversight, robinhood stopping trades, etc. If you want full freedom then it&#x27;s on you to pay attention to the details and not expect someone else to bail you out of your own ignorance.')
