It indeed brings a lot of memories (mostly from childhood), but I have a slightly different perspective on it. When I moved to New York, ~8 years ago, my budget for rent was around $2,000. I checked 20+ different apartments, worked with a ton of agencies. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes – so many people in NYC (Manhattan specifically, the place I always wanted to live in) live like rats, an order magnitude worse than what you can get in Odessa for $300-400. I ended up getting a decent studio for abysmal $2,700. I moved to Brooklyn since then and live at a much better place now, but a ton of people still live in conditions, IMO, way worse than the ones shown in the game, paying $2000 a month ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
