Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=[24950376], score=None, time=1604139808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949739, text='&gt; So whatâ€™s the alternative?<p>Currently: a Google-free AOSP-based distribution on one of the hundreds of supported devices.<p>In the future, hopefully: a free software mobile platform compatible with a range of hardware.<p>Google-free Android is a thing, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years now. I do not have a Google account, there is no &#x27;Gapps&#x27; (Google Apps) on my devices, I do not use the &#x27;Play Store&#x27; (which is a bit of a silly name for people who speak Dutch where the word &#x27;Play&#x27; sounds like a Dutch slang term for toilet, &#x27;plee&#x27;), I don&#x27;t use Google Search directly (it is one of the engines used in my own Searx instance, next to DDG, Bing, Yahoo etc.), no Gmail (I host my own mail), no Google Docs (or whatever it is called today, Libreoffice Online works just fine for me, hosted on my own server), etc.<p>Just try it for a change instead of giving up and giving either Apple or Google their pound of flesh. There is too much disinformation on the subject of mobile freedom, too much &#x27;party politics&#x27;. There <i>is</i> a world outside of Apple and Google, why not give it a try instead of assuming it doesn&#x27;t exist?')
