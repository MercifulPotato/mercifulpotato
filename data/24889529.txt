I&#x27;m also considerably heavier!<p>I would guess that a random average adult male who doesn&#x27;t neglect general fitness, but doesn&#x27;t necessarily cycle, could put out 160w-220w for an hour if they were forced to.<p>60W is insanely easy tho, pretty much anyone without some sort of extreme physical limitation would be able to do that.')
