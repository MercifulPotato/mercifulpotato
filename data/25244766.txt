Like most (I assume), we&#x27;ve built our own build language&#x2F;system on top of Make. It works but only in a few well-defined ways that modern software shops would probably baulk at. We don&#x27;t support parallel builds, no caching, only coarse grained incremental builds (at a subproject&#x2F;library level) and who knows what else that others benefit from.<p>I&#x27;ve only looked at modern tools briefly but everytime I come away realising we&#x27;d have to re-write everything. There is no out-of-the-box support for our tools&#x2F;language and it would be a lot of work to learn someone else&#x27;s DSL, re-implement everything and then potentially discover a load of ways it&#x27;s broken for our workflow. Personally I think it&#x27;d be worth it in the long run but it&#x27;s a really hard sell.')
