Being able to configure dynamic DNS and host a VPN server was an amazing thing when you had a handful of routers to remotely manage (parents, etc). And the replacement firmware made them so much more stable than stock. Gone were the days of the Internet dying and having to reboot the router to get it back.<p>I still have a few unused WRT54GL lying around that I never got around to using. Funny to think they&#x27;re still selling on Amazon for the same price they were a decade ago!<p>In case anyone doubts my adoration for this router, take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tfvlrue.wordpress.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;lego-router-wrt54gl&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tfvlrue.wordpress.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;lego-router-wrt54gl...</a> :)')
