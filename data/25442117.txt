The idea was to just exercise some intelligence in the matter. Like maybe just retry a couple times, spaced out by a day or two.<p>What you&#x27;re proposing is to <i>explicitly</i> ignore the specification (which says that you should _not_ retry when you receive a 550) and try to implement a custom smart retry logic that handles temporary error cases, but also does not get you blocked.<p>&gt; So I don&#x27;t buy this excuse one bit.<p>I&#x27;m all for building resilient services, but &quot;try to detect when a server incorrectly returns 550&quot; is <i>not</i> something I would prioritize at all. I&#x27;ll happily manually clean up after this occurrence than to have this complicated retry logic. It&#x27;s not an &quot;excuse&quot;, it&#x27;s a very sensible trade-off.')
