But what I&#x27;ve seen as a consultant is that everyone likes to do that part, but what clients usually want to contract for, and what makes money is the steady, often boring, implementation part.<p>Targeting the MVP work you are often competing with others who will heavily discount the initial work hoping to get the lucrative implementation. What makes it harder is the uncertainty involved, there is a high bar to being trusted enough contract for something that had not been defined yet.<p>In the management consulting world which I am more familiar with, the distinction is between &quot;strategy&quot; work - the focus of well reputed (in some circles) firms with very strong networks like McKinsey, and implementation or &quot;transformation&quot; type work from IBM or a Big 4. The dream is to be McKinsey and come in and demonstrate a brilliant plan that others are stuck implementing, but the reality is that that kind of work is tough to sell.')
