I&#x27;m so happy when these kinds of posts surface as this is exactly how we&#x27;ve envisoned our platform to be used - by tinkerers builidng interesting ideas.<p>I do see a lot of comments regarding the price, so it&#x27;s best if I do the general disclaimer. E Ink screens are very pricy (compared to LCD). The driving is even pricier. And since this is not a mass-mass produced product (at least not in a sense of your 75&quot; OLED TV) you get to the price that you have. We&#x27;ve worked for years on getting the price down for the E Ink screens (trust me on this), but there is a question of critical mass. E Ink in the non-reader, non-shelf label applications is still a very niche solution, that will command very high price. I hate to say it, but the only way we could have brought the price down with current quantities is if we built an inferior product as the price right now is the function of Bill-of-Materials.<p>We tried a lot of applications, some covered previously here on HN, we currently see that there are just two other avenues where E Ink is being used and has the potential for mass depoyments in the near future.<p>1. In offices it can be used as interactive signage - we&#x27;ve built a very successful solution for meeting room booking around it (see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;getjoan.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;getjoan.com</a>).<p>2. The market for outdoor displays - especialy smart bus stops that run on solar - is starting to ramp up. Check out what our partners are doing in this space (a recent live deployment <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visionect.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;coimbra-the-city-of-the-students-whose-public-transport-runs-on-sunlight&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visionect.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;coimbra-the-city-of-the-stude...</a>).<p>If anyone would like to get more information about E Ink, please shoot - we&#x27;ve tried every E Ink display out there, played with color display and probably seen every E Ink application out there.
