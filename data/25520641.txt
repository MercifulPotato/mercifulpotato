Item(by='matthewdgreen', descendants=None, kids=[25521298], score=None, time=1608748997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520439, text='Terms like &quot;fleecing&quot; are subjective, and I wasn&#x27;t claiming that RH necessary fleeced anyone in this instance. I was pointing out that opaque pricing models are problematic, since they make it much harder for customers to compare competing services and determine which offers more reasonable costs. In the extreme case, this can harm competition and make everyone worse off than they would be in a transparent regime, aka &quot;people get fleeced&quot;.<p>In this case the real questions are: (1) does RH&#x27;s model result in some customers paying more for the same services than they would pay at competitors, and (2) can these customers realistically make the determination before they choose a service?<p>We don&#x27;t exactly know the answer to (1), and the reason we don&#x27;t know the answer to that is because the answer to (2) is &quot;almost certainly not&quot;. In fact the RH model is so opaque  that even the SEC can&#x27;t fully answer the question, and on top of this normal opacity RH added a layer of clear misrepresentation.<p>Maybe in the end, it should be totally fine for brokerages to make all their money from order flow fees, in ways that are completely invisible and opaque to the customer, and regulators should just back off the whole thing as long as there are a few lines of text in a ToS somewhere. To me as a customer that seems kind of crummy, but I&#x27;m not a regulator.')
