Now you are doing philosophy! You just proved how important philosophy is! Thanks for your contributions to it!&quot; But if I don&#x27;t do philosophy you keep prodding me &quot;Hey, hey, philosophy is important, do philosophy!&quot;. If I tell you to go away because I don&#x27;t need it for this and this reason, then I&#x27;ve fallen into the trap because I&#x27;m now doing philosophy.<p>But I guess science-denying people argue just like I did above when they dislike the idea that science admits that it may be wrong and will update itself with new evidence. But I can see how someone with a different epistemological footing would be annoyed with this.<p>Something of this sort can never be &quot;wrong&quot;, because it will just incorporate an update when it&#x27;s proven wrong. But is that updated thing really the same?<p>It&#x27;s a cheap trick to try and get around of being ever truly wrong. If you turn out to be wrong you can just say &quot;but I knew I may be wrong and would have to update&quot; so you weren&#x27;t <i>really wrong</i> in the deeper sense!<p>Note that I adhere to this scientific ethos as well, but I can see it has a wobbly structure in this way.')
