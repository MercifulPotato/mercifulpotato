It&#x27;s a Brownian motion of small incremental innovations, until eventually we stumble upon something big (like deep learning). In no way is machine learning unique in this.</i><p>Except ... while machine learning is great, has made important and significant strides, it&#x27;s not a yet science. It involves essentially a series of sophisticated, mathematically informed recipes for feeding data to giant algorithms and having them create something useful (maybe very useful but still).<p>An analogy from a couple years ago is bridge building before physics. You accumulate rules of thumb, you get a vague understand what works. You get better. But you aren&#x27;t producing a systematic field.<p>And that implies merely advancement isn&#x27;t necessarily progress (which isn&#x27;t to say there&#x27;s no progress but building larger SOTA isn&#x27;t that as the article notes).')
