I absolutely need split windows, and being able to switch what is in the sub-panes easily.  That&#x27;s what require nesting.<p>The fact that it <i>also</i> doesn&#x27;t have my preferred behavior for multiple clients connecting is just a minor nit-pick at that point.  And I did say that the misnamed &#x27;switch-client&#x27; would likely work.<p>Tmux  has some very nice features: a nice commmand language, xterm-style mouse support, including both event binding and sending to client (pass through only),  well thought out client-server separation, the ability for other programs to fairly easily drive it, visual identification of panes, menu-popups, and the default status-line is nicer.<p>All of that is merely nice to have, not actually needed though.  It fundamentally doesn&#x27;t have a model that works well for me.  I wish it did, or that screen gains such things.')
