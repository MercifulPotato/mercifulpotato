It suits me.<p>In my experience, mentoring junior devs and new hires on my projects is <i>much</i> harder for everyone involved when you&#x27;re not in the same office. Sometimes you&#x27;re lucky and get someone who&#x27;ll speak up and ask questions when they get stuck, but often (<i>especially</i> with juniors) people will just try to figure things out on their own in order to not look bad at their job or incompetent or something. Some devs would rather spend a whole day on a problem and only bring it up in the following day&#x27;s stand up than show they can&#x27;t solve it alone. That is really bad for a project. I find I have to poke the quieter juniors regularly on Slack just to make sure they&#x27;re OK, but then people get annoyed about being micromanaged. This is something I really want to solve...')
