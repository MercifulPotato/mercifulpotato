The Github page says the app has &quot;slight focus on cool graphs&quot; but the demo&#x27;s &quot;Data Viz&quot; section is completely empty. EDIT: Oh not completely empty, the face recognition library has data.<p>I&#x27;m interested to see my frequency of photos per day&#x2F;week&#x2F;month, etc, so if I want to try that out I would have to install the whole thing locally.')
