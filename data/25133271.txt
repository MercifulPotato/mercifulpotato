Does any software currently use it, or is it something that Apple are trying to push? Is it designed to build ML models, or to apply them to data?<p>And perhaps more basically, what for? How much machine learning is done on user machines, as opposed to renting some cloud time? What are they anticipating will be done?<p>I ask these questions in genuine curiousity, I assume I&#x27;m missing something but this just seems like a rather wild divergence from what (very little) I knew of the ML field.')
