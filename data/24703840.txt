From a national government standpoint, they bring in some revenue to the economy, but it&#x27;s <i>miniscule</i> compared to the GDP value they will create, directly and indirectly, with their newfound skills in a lifetime.<p>I&#x27;d even argue in favor of government financial aid for international students that meet certain bars of merit or talent. Give them a free ride if they are that talented. Then let them build the next company and hire a bunch of Americans. Hand them a US passport as well if they get there.<p>Also, PhDs are another story -- they are not revenue sources for the university, but they are a means to quality research, and very much an investment.')
