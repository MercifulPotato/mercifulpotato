I got 60ms from Rails and 2ms from Yesod in a similar scenario.<p>This will not be fastest (that will be the C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust solutions), but the programming experience is very high level. I want speed in runtime performance (1) and in developer productivity (2). I&#x27;d say Rust and Haskell have interesting offerings looking at these two metrics.')
