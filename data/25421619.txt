Itâ€™s called Efficiency. In the narrow sense, we are nowhere near the limits of thermodynamics. But there is also efficiency versus effectiveness. If I make a different product that better satisfices the greater needs, it may have a higher embodied energy costs than the old product, and yet still drive overall efficiency.<p>A thinner saw blade has a smaller kerf, resulting in less raw material turned to dust. And even though the blade contains less steel, that steel is more dear. But I chop down fewer trees or dig up less stone if I use it.')
