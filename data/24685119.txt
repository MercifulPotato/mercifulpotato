There was hardly any testing possible, specially for exercises like UNIX IPC.<p>Then each group would take their turn at the tower, copy their prepared samples via a floppy, turn those stubs into proper calls, and finally testing that the application was actually able to run and if the exercise goal was met.<p>Naturally everyone having a turn pretty much depended on how well prepared everyone else was.')
