The idea is that anyone using random numbers must be implementing a cryptographic protocol and therefore should not be using Math.random as it&#x27;s not a CSPRNG.<p>So all the AB tests, percentage rollouts etc. started getting spam PR comments until they were made to turn it back off again.<p>Frankly if a teammate was writing their own crypto algorithm implemntation in the bog standard web app we working on, that would be more concerning than which RNG they&#x27;re using.')
