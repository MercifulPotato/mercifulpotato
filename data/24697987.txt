St. Mark&#x27;s floods at 90cm according to the article.<p>When there was a 132cm tide, the barriers went up and St. Mark&#x27;s stayed dry.  The next day, the tide was 106cm, the barriers stayed down, St. Mark&#x27;s flooded.  What was the exact date on your friend&#x27;s photo?  What was the tide height that day?')
