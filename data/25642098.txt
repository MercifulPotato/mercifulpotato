Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=[25642173], score=None, time=1609820729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641922, text='&gt;<i>You started from the assumption I need sight to navigate</i><p>Yes, and it was a legitimate assumption, given that your comment implied as much (speaking of those people as a minority in the third person, saying &quot;who cares&quot; about those, etc).<p>There certainly wasn&#x27;t any &quot;I am a person with accessibility issues myself, and I consider open formats for the majority more important than accessible content&quot; implication.<p>&gt;<i>Again: why should the needs of the few trump the needs of the many?</i><p>First, disabled &#x2F; elderly etc. people being able to have access to content, knowledge, entertainment, isn&#x27;t just some random small thing we can just toss aside. Nor does it concern some insignificant minority we could ignore with minimal loss.<p>Second, putting out unaccessible PDF content is 100% certain to be problematic for people with accessibility needs.<p>Whereas having HTML instead of PDFs (the latter being what the grandfather suggested and you supported) is far from certain to make people &quot;serfs&quot; (which is a loaded metaphor from feudal times) or to be of much significance.<p>If anything HTML is open source and free, and implementing a browser to read basic HTML (as opposed to full WPAs) is trivial - more trivial than PDF for that matter, and with more FOSS browser engines in existance, from full-on to minimal like Links. So even at the basic factual level the concern is misplaced.')
