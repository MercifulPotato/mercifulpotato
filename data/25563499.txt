The speed at which Swift has changed has left the documentation behind. I&#x27;ve complained about this numerous times.<p>Simply put, if you want useful doco don&#x27;t look at the latest version of the language. They literally stripped the useful notes and examples and it&#x27;s now a straight API print out.<p>If you use stackoverflow (sarcasm) be prepared to constantly be using older versions of swift and translating them to the latest.
