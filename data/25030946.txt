I think there&#x27;s merit in the ability to install whatever software you want. But I also think there&#x27;s merit in making sure there&#x27;s a robust, unfragmented market of apps that work with the last 6 years of iPhones, and restrictions that Apple has in place ensure that.<p>I think the Dev Store is a reasonable compromise to ensure that average users don&#x27;t have to run AVG AntiVirus on their phones. That situation is absurdly anti-user.<p>&gt;why is there no strict walled garden for Macs?<p>There is, and it&#x27;s annoying: GateKeeper, which if I recall correctly requires you to basically outsmart your OS to install software using the GUI.<p>This is why I&#x27;m happy the iPad Pro is getting more desktop-like, hopefully bridging the gap between people who want a laptop to do weird stuff and people who want a device that will work no matter what you do to it.')
