For example, if I have the cron in my ecs.json file, then I would guess that AWS has some code to pick up that value and place it in the correct location on the server. It would be great if we could specify a timezone in the json and have the AWS code translate the cron expression as it deploys it to the server. I would even guess they could reuse or depend on the implementation thats already built in Linux (being open source).')
