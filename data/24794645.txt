I am clearly not a publisher; I do produce content and do not want to produce content. So I am a platform.<p>Am I no longer allowed to decide what is acceptable on my platform? Even if I am running a forum about the Ninja 400 motorcycle, I now have to allow people to post about their Toyota Corolla or about how vaccines cause autism or the earth is flat? What about if I want to moderate the forum to keep discussion on topic and I need to delete trolling or spam, or lock&#x2F;delete threads that devolve into political fighting among forum members?<p>You can&#x27;t have platforms without moderation.')
