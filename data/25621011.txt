Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609671232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620906, text='To me the argument was pretty simple: if running software as non-root is important--and you clearly think it is--but it is even slightly annoying to write software in a container that doesn&#x27;t run as root (as maybe it now has to have a special user and internally manage these users; the comment you responded to showed this with de facto evidence) then it seems pretty obvious this shouldn&#x27;t be an abstraction that people who make containers have to deal with... let them write everything to run as root and then add a damned command line flag to the container runtime to run the container not as root. I don&#x27;t use containers (I am too deep into security to pretend they are a security boundary and I know too much about toolchains to feel they solve actual deployment problems), so I am frankly shocked this isn&#x27;t already how they work :(.')
