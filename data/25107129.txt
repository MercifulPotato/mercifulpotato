Can this be fixed? I&#x27;m absolutely sure it can be fixed. Do I have time? No.<p>I have watched way too many coworkers bomb meetings because of trying to use bluetooth headsets on Linux. Am I trying to cause suffering? No, I will use a headset with the good old headphone jack, because I have something else that I need to do with my actual day.')
