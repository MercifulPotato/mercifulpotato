If you feel you need something to knock against, hello. So...<p>No, not without evidence. Simply just evidence that you don&#x27;t want to see or don&#x27;t think exists, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist. I get if you look at the same stuff and reach different conclusions. But you say you think not hearing about stuff is strong evidence against. I don&#x27;t think so, that you&#x27;ve never heard of it doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>You want to ask for &quot;evidence&quot;...can you really provide any evidence either way? Can you give me like a study that compares hunter-gatherer groups and shows a majority of them do most of their hunting during the day? No. So don&#x27;t try to talk about evidence as if you&#x27;re backing up your claims with it. How ridiculous.<p>We&#x27;re both just thought experimenting. So...Comparing humans to other primates it stupid. We&#x27;re an apex predator. Our ancestors even more so re hunting. Just think about it. What will we eat? When will it be easier to catch that? How do other super predators hunt? At night. We were hunting experts. Our hunting behaviors would probably be similar to other hunting experts. &quot;Hunt at night&quot; describes every spec ops outfit ever, as well as big cats.<p>We&#x27;re evolved enough to hunt at night in moonless nights I&#x27;d say your &quot;evolutionary evidence&quot; which you claim supports your idea, actually fully supports what I&#x27;m saying instead.<p>You don&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;re open to changing your mind or learning something new here, so I don&#x27;t expect you to respond and go, &quot;Oh yeah, I hadn&#x27;t thought of that. Good point.&quot;')
