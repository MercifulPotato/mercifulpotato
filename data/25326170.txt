An environment where using docker feels native\n2. When they start the vm to run podman they will use qemu on arm to simulate an x86 machine and run x86 containers<p>The second one will be a huge step forward as docker will not be able to do this for a long time as they use the mac hypervisor which canâ€˜t run x86 vms. Podman would enable again prod&#x2F;dev comparability which may work for redhat to more people switching to podman even for their production systems.')
