It locked the accounts of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, the Post, and many others for retweeting the story.<p>Twitter and Facebook decided to prove their critics right. Censorship was supposed to be for Russian bot-generated fake news. The New York Post may be a shitty tabloid, but it’s a real organization with a Manhattan office building and hundreds of thousands of subscribers.<p>As far as I can tell, it’s unclear whether the laptop the New York Post sourced it’s emails from really belonged to Hunter Biden. That’s an ordinary question of a news article’s credibility. It’s insane to make that the bar for sharing an article on social media.<p>Matt Taibbi has catalogued how many New York Times stories about Trump ultimately proved unfounded: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taibbi.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-bombshell-memory-hole-d20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taibbi.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-bombshell-memory-hole-d20</a> (paid). The Times is a hell of a lot more credible than the Post, but again, the fact that an article from a real source may prove to be wrong can’t be a justification for censoring it on social media.')
