Someone has to learn Rust and then convert all of these programs. And it also has the issue that Rust programs are only memory safe if the unsafe keyword is not used anywhere in the program (correct me if wrong?). So it looks like the effort to do such thing, while noble, and valiant, is essentially an experiment with an uncertain pay-off that could turn out to be small or large.<p>Much more interesting (to my mind, anyway) is something like Miri. The rust interpreter, which uses fat-pointers to make things (more? completely? someone more informed can correct me..) memory-safe by inserting some relatively lightweight run-time checks.<p>And, then again, if such a thing could be compiled rather than interpreted (some things similar to this already exist, like C with fat-pointers). And if the source language was C (or something like it) or C++ (or some future C++) then the human aspect of re-training a generation of programmers goes from being a very big hurdle, to a much lower one.<p>At that point the benefits go up quite a bit, and the costs come down quite a bit. And I think that might be a promising path to overcoming the sort of human&#x2F;political hurdles&#x2F;inertia involved in rewriting the world :)')
