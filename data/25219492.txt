You think there&#x27;s time to search around for the best price?<p>Exactly, this child got the emergency treatment. His dad wasn&#x27;t asked to pay 19k upfront.<p>I write all this because I was born in a country where all medical treatment is free for everyone.<p>Guess what? It&#x27;s super low quality. Doctors got paid less than in McDonald&#x27;s. If you have a serious problems you literally have to search for a right doctor. It might be someone not even in your large town. And, you pay upfront! So, I&#x27;d rather live broke than die because no one even treats me.')
