They have at times literally not had access to withdrawals â€” because they were pretending not to be who they are and were caught by Wells Fargo. A few times if memory serves. You think a whale is dropping $2 billion dollars of new money into tether prints via bitfinex?! What kind of mad man would do that when they have access to Coinbase and Gemini, where they could actually get their money back out?<p>Remember this is newly printed tether which means net deposits of new actual usd, if you believe them - and of course I do not.')
