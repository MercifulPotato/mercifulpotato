I now think that immutability by default is clearly the better way to go, even in close-to-the machine applications like embedded devices and industrial control applications.<p>Then, I saw this article on the different options and syntax for initializing variables in modern C++: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikelui.io&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;03&#x2F;seriously-bonkers.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikelui.io&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;03&#x2F;seriously-bonkers.html</a><p>And I was like, no, this can&#x27;t be serious. I think this was the point where I began to distance from the language (though I still use it at work when I need to).<p>I got also the impression that the actual language use in C++ is undergoing a serious split. Compare the C++ core guidelines with Google&#x27;s C++ style guide:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isocpp.github.io&#x2F;CppCoreGuidelines&#x2F;CppCoreGuidelines" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isocpp.github.io&#x2F;CppCoreGuidelines&#x2F;CppCoreGuidelines</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.github.io&#x2F;styleguide&#x2F;cppguide.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.github.io&#x2F;styleguide&#x2F;cppguide.html</a><p>This does already look somewhat like different languages, only that they can be compiled with the same compiler.<p>And then, the C++17 and C++20 standard iterations, at this point it is just like &quot;this is too much! What is this good for?&quot;')
