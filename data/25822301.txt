So, if you&#x27;re trying to find the &quot;one missing number&quot; between 1 and n, you simply subtract all values from n*(n+1)&#x2F;2 (the sum of all said numbers) and you end up with the missing one. (using wrap-around semantics, you don&#x27;t even need to have more bits of memory than you need for the xor solution!)<p>Second: A common way to solve a problem with two variables is to build a system of two equations. One can compute, in a single pass, what is &quot;a+b&quot; and &quot;a^b&quot; ; solve the system, and you get both variables with no additional lookups. Now, it&#x27;s true that if you get a carry from the addition, this problem might not be solvable...but, if you can afford one extra bit for the potential carry, you&#x27;re all set.')
