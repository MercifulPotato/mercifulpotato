It&#x27;s decent if you use it and out of your way if you don&#x27;t? Especially when the alternative is Chrome, which pushes it&#x27;s shit on you constantly.<p>And regarding performance, I find it rather unlikely that you didn&#x27;t experience a performance improvement, especially on mobile. Seriously try downloading the last build of Fennec and load the same webpage on it, then on Fenix (the new Firefox for Android). I&#x27;ve seen 2x load time improvements on plently of sites and the speedup seems to be proportional to how heavy the page is. Yes, Chrome still beats it at anything using JS, but even horribly slow things like GDrive are now completely usable on FF, even with many tabs.')
