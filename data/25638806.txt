I left a remote job in like, late 2017 because of some problems I had with their ethics. I took a job that paid less and required me to drive (not too far, and I was missing seeing people&#x27;s faces a bit anyway).<p>It was a bigger company that had acquired probably 7-8 businesses--my team&#x27;s job was to integrate them all together to help the business operate more fluidly. It took me about 2 days to realize that a) the project was doomed, b) all the people working here (except Dave, the guy who told me to &quot;abandon all hope&quot; as I sat down on the first day) were just faking it and c) literally every person with decision-making capacity was incompetent.<p>The SMEs were all siloed into a different (you might even say competing) team. They were actually trying to encode all the business rules into something akin to MuleSoft. They were inaccessible to us.<p>The architect on the project couldn&#x27;t write code to save his life. He was in love with some inane microservices architecture for which the example project wouldn&#x27;t even compile. It was basically a mock of a microservice architecture, but built on top of SOAP. It was a bunch of crazy nonsense. He got fired shortly after I left.<p>The development manager was a nice enough guy, probably too nice. I&#x27;m not sure what he did other than set up interviews for me and a couple of the other senior developers to conduct.<p>I left after 3 months, for a job that was still a pay-cut from my first job, and was twice as far to commute to. But at least it wasn&#x27;t a total crapshow.<p>I still keep up with Dave though. So I guess it wasn&#x27;t a total waste :)')
