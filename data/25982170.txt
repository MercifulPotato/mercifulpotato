Happy to expand on my thoughts if you would like me to, but for now here is the verse:<p>[46:15]  We enjoined the human being to honor his parents. His mother bore him arduously, gave birth to him arduously, and took intimate care of him for thirty months. When he reaches maturity, and reaches the age of forty, he should say, &quot;My Lord, direct me to appreciate the blessings You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to do the righteous works that please You. Let my children be righteous as well. I have repented to You; I am a submitter.&quot;<p>Edit: translation by Rashad Khalifa')
