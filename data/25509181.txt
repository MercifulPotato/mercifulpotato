I however think Phoenix Liveview is still the best from all the alternatives I have seen so far and that is mainly because Elixir as a language seems to be very stable and suited for having a lot of websocket connections open at the same time.<p>It seems easier to accomplish this with Liveview and perhaps Alpine.js for displaying stuff like modals etc. It&#x27;s a really good way to build applications I think for places that need a server roundtrip anyway which is most of the stuff in a modern app.<p>I write a SPA app for work in javascript and about 90% of the issues that occurs are mainly state issues where the state differs or is in a bad state for some reason. State management is very hard to do right and I think solutions like these simplyfies it a lot!<p>I urge people to check out Elixir and Phoenix Liveview which I think is the &quot;original gangsta&quot; when it comes to sending small updates over websockets and if you try it I will guarantee you will be blown away of the speed of which you can develop web apps as a solo dev.')
