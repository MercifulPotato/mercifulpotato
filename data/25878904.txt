At Lichess there millions and billions of games played each month and they don&#x27;t pay with micropayments for each game. Other chess websites charge monthly fee.<p>Micropayments are a hassle for any system that has people, actual human organisms, being responsible for a gazillion of small transactions. The involvement of a human increases the cost of each money transaction. Only for detecting and resolving fraud a human needs to spend minutes and hours of his life, his boss has to pay him at the end of the day, and that cost bubbles up to the consumer. Minimum fees have be to many cents or dollars for each transaction, so the micropayment starts to not being a micropayment, it starts to seem very much like a payment.<p>The only solution to that, is a fully automated money transfer mechanism, an immutable public ledger with all the pseudonymous transactions, i.e. bitcoin. The miner network ensures the validity of the transactions, that no malicious actor in the whole network change one bit of a transaction to his benefit. Humans can do that, have done that for centuries in the banking system, by hiring trusted employees, and by following protocols to ensure the validity of each transaction, papers with stamps and all of that.<p>Micropayments can help for a person to change a light in the street, and charging all the residents around, a thousand of them, for 1 cent each. 10 dollars he will receive in total, 5 dollars for his work, 5 for the light bulb, and he will be paid the minute the work is done. No need to give a corrupt politician 10 million dollars, for all the work in his municipality, and the politician afterwards he will pay the technician for the fixing of the light. That creates a honey pot ready to be exploited. Micropayments can make that honeypot disappear.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V1Ef6I7R0zY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V1Ef6I7R0zY</a>')
