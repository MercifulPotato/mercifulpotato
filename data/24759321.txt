Finite, stateless interactions that don&#x27;t happen often. A good example will be a site say example.org that has a donate page. On form submit, a lambda can take the payload and create a subscription at a payment service like Stripe or Razorpay. The donate page at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internetfreedom.in" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internetfreedom.in</a> works the exact same way.<p>The broader idea is a service (or static site even) sending messages to a different service. Given how popular no-code platforms are getting, tiny serverless pieces can help automate operations between these platforms.')
