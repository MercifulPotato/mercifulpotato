When I was looking into HTTP&#x2F;S crates, I decided against Hyper because it seemed to require bringing in a runtime for HTTPS, and the async nature of hyper did not seem necessary for my totally synchronous CLI tool.  For something like CURL it seems like you would just want the leanest, simplest synchronous HTTP implementation possible')
