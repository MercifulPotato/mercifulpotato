Some money is needed sometimes to get or keep going, we have this money, we have plenty of money.<p>We can also chose to reward innovators both for the effort and the result. It should be in proportion tho, an invention that makes you the owner of the world is not desirable for anyone else.<p>And finally, the most ironic, you don&#x27;t have innovation if you are renting it. (they don&#x27;t even have to let you rent it) Its a well crafted con that turns you into a subject to be exploited in any way the ~~innovator~~ owner chooses.')
