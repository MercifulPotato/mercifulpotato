From Wikipedia:<p>&gt; The rise of wages in jobs without productivity gains derives from the requirement to compete for employees with jobs that have experienced gains and so can naturally pay higher salaries, just as classical economics predicts.<p>You claim that those low-efficiency jobs would still have workers if we were allowed to pay them a low enough price. Baumol effect says they&#x27;d choose to work higher-efficiency jobs until you paid them the same wage as a high-efficiency job worker.')
