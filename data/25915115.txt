The retailer<p>2. The card network Mastercard&#x2F;Visa<p>3. The card issuer (the customers bank)<p>Amex dodge this by being both the card network and the issuer. So there are only two parties involved in their transactions.<p>1. The retailer<p>2. Amex<p>So they charge a much higher interchange than Mastercard&#x2F;Visa can. Which is also the reason why there will  never be an Amex competitor in Europe. No merchant would ever sign up to anew card network that charged more and had no customers. Equally no customer would signup for card they couldnâ€™t use anywhere.')
