But WinMD files only contained definitions for WinRT&#x2F;COM APIs, so how could this possibly work?<p>Well turns out, microsoft started a project to also generate Win32 API information in WinMD file, to generate APIs from them automatically for all native languages! See win32metadata[0]. This could make interfacing with win32 APIs a lot more convenient!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;win32metadata" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;win32metadata</a>')
