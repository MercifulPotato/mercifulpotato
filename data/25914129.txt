To move a boat (virtual or real) you need work, not power</i><p>You are correct, but just for one stroke. The thing slowing down a boat or spinning flywheel is <i>drag</i>, which is a power dissipator. =&gt; Generating more power means you overcome more drag == go faster.<p>cf. when you take the rate up by reducing the time on the recovery while keeping work&#x2F;stroke the same. Your speed increases as your rate of (the same) work increases.<p>edit: Also, forgot to mention this<p><i>Concept sells &quot;Sliders&quot; for the C2 ergs that you can use for a single erg but also to link together multiple ergs to a crew. If you haven&#x27;t tried this, I can highly recommend this as it makes it much more realistic and also a lot more challenging.</i><p>I made my own! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0BvX8leh1_c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0BvX8leh1_c</a>')
