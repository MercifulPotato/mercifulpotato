I deployed <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seamless.cloud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seamless.cloud</a> to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and I have been very happy with it. It is currently setup as a Load Balancer + 2 nodes + RDS PostgreSQL db. SSL is free and included if you also use Route53 for DNS. Pretty easy to setup, scale, and configure for an AWS product.')
