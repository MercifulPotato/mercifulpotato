Instead of telling people how to do it safely, and how to minimize risk, the government is taking the impossible approach of telling people not to do it at all, and taking away venues where it is relatively low-risk to do so.<p>Even though the government cannot ban highly risky gatherings in private homes (because law enforcement is not on board with that), it has decided to ban lower-risk gatherings such as outdoor dining anyway. This is not a rational scientific approach, but rather an attempt to stick to unrealistic abstinence-only messaging. That attempt to stay on message is costing people their jobs and their businesses despite having little public health benefit.<p>When people see public health orders being unrealistic and inconsistent, they stop respecting them.')
