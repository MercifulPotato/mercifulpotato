Item(by='minimuffins', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608337773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459506, text='I agree strongly with the main thrust of this article, but it doesn&#x27;t support the &quot;Loss of Locality&quot; prong of the argument very well.<p>&gt; when reading through the original caller, it is less clear what the code does<p>In my experience it is usually clearer, if the function has an even remotely appropriate name. And unless you are coding with notepad.exe, toggling between caller and callee is pretty trivial.<p>&gt; When you move this code to a function as a part of a straightforward DRY refactoring, this means that now a function is mutating its parameters.<p>Whether that matters depends a lot on the language.<p>And anyway it seems like the main problem in code like that is that the function is inappropriately mutating state outside of itself in a surprising way, which might be a problem separate from dryness.<p>&quot;Loss of Locality&quot; does strike me as reasonable argument against code that is too dehydrated though. Maybe somebody else can make some better supporting claims for it?')
