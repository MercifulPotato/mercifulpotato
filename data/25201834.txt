The linked email listing says the issue is that logging in as a non-existent user with an empty password will work, and the fix that you linked seems to just make it harder to figure out if a user doesn&#x27;t exist. That doesn&#x27;t seem like it fixes anything; there&#x27;s no need to determine beforehand if a user doesn&#x27;t exist to use this exploit, since you could just try to use the exploit with an arbitrary username, and if it works, then obviously the user doesn&#x27;t exist.')
