In our app, `rm -rf node_modules` (75,000 files, 1.1GB) takes about 10x longer on MacOS than it does on Linux (btrfs, zfs, ext4 all similar). `yarn install` has a similar difference between the two. I&#x27;d imagine most compiling tasks involving lots of tiny files would be impacted by the filesystem performance as well, hamstringing the performance of the M1.')
