These leaders certainly are responsible for allowing lies and propaganda to rally and enrage these people, priming them for a civil war, however is it better it happened all at once or if Trump deplatforming sooner giving them more time to better organize on a platform and all necessary layers that they&#x27;d control to allow the public inciting of violence?
