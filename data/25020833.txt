US manufacturing is too expensive without extensive automation. And automation won&#x27;t feed workers.<p>We need to protect our lead in tech and information and attack China&#x27;s chances of leapfrogging us. Protect our industries, protect democracy. Build up our allies. Build a stronger world.<p>The risk is that China becomes better than us at everything we do. Then what do we have? Being protectionist is anti-growth. Industry and innovation shut down.<p>A new cold war is coming. The sooner we get ahead of it, the better prepared we&#x27;ll be.<p>The future is knowledge work. Manufacturing domestically is regressive. We need to put the supply chain in the hands of our developing allies.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t want to train <i>anyone</i> to do menial jobs anyway. We&#x27;re about to enter an era where we&#x27;ll have plenty of creative, knowledge jobs for everyone.')
