His book <i>Impossibility</i> had a big impact on me growing up.<p>I do remember hearing a story about him, perhaps apocryphal.  Apparently a grad student had been working on a paper and wanted to get Barrow&#x27;s thoughts on it.  With a great deal of trepidation, the student presented the draft to Barrow and Barrow said he&#x27;d take a look.  A few days later Barrow returned the paper to the grad student with no changes, except for adding &quot;John D. Barrow&quot; to the author list.  :)')
