It&#x27;s a series of molecules that represent data. Cells read the topology and molecular interactions of those molecules and determine information from them.<p>Now, because the DNA is read-only, the permissions are super restrictive. Which means if you want to access that data in the DNA, you need to go through an intermediate, which, when it leaves the restricted area, is ok if it gets destroyed, because that original copy is still intact. That&#x27;s where RNA comes in. RNA is designed to be mutable and temporary. I think of it like system memory. Reboot the system, and you lose it all. Want to protect it? Write it to the disk (DNA)., Similarly, you don&#x27;t mess with files right on the disk - first you read them to memory.<p>So, RNA is basically DNA that&#x27;s been read to memory, and can now be messed with. You can do something like execute it, which would be analogous to translating it to proteins. The process is similar. While 0s and 1s might translate to microcode calls (i.e. physical action on part of the computer sending electrons around), RNA translates to amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, which are the physical components of cells, and do things like...well...move electrons around, among other things.<p>The way this works is that while 1010010101110 (I have no idea) might be some microcode call like OR or NOR, RNA bases (which are derived from the transcribed DNA) might say things like AUG, which tells the cell &quot;OK go get the Methionine amino acid&quot; or UUU which means &quot;ok go get the phenylalanine amino acid&quot;. Chain enough amino acids together, and you get a protein, which essentially is a function in the cell. For instance, a protein of a specific sequence of amino acids might go fight off viruses. A protein of a different, but still specific sequence, might go produce energy.')
