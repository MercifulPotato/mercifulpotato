Basically they banned him for tweets:<p>“The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”<p>“To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.”<p>I don&#x27;t see any violence in those tweets and I don&#x27;t understand what kind of person could classify those tweets as a violent ones. I guess only kind of person who wanted to ban him for anything.')
