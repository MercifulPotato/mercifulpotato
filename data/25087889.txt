I would agree that its an inferior experience, but maybe someone people value the portability of the tablet versus the efficiency of a mouse and keyboard. Also I would say the game doesnt really teach you the short cuts. I found the self discovery not to be great, and i defaulted to looking to guides to understand a lot of the nuanced features. Things have gotten a lot better since the 1.0 launch, but there are still a few tricks like launching artillery on drag instead of click that only extreme power users know about that normal users would probably like.')
