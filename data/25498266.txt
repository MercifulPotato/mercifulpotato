Your neural networks were programmed with the idea of humans as something special and unique in the universe. It feels good to fire in those potentiation patterns, right?<p>Is someone who has never had vision incapable of understanding vision? How do they learn about it, if not through symbols? Is someone who has never had hearing incapable of understanding hearing? Their experiences may not be exactly identical to yours, but they aren&#x27;t meaningless.<p>It is, at present, impossible to know what is&#x2F;isn&#x27;t required for a neural network to be &quot;intelligent&quot;.

Even without vision, you can describe your clothes to it and see if it likes them.<p>You&#x27;re also discounting incredible progress in the field. I talk to my house.
