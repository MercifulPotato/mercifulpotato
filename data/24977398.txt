With youtube-dl[0] (and probably long before?) we know you can push a commit and view it under the web UI under another user, GitHub hasn&#x27;t indicated this is a vulnerability at all.<p>2. Many people know you can impersonate another user through Git email addresses[1] (GPG signing is supposed to solve this, but a lot of people don&#x27;t use it and even when they do others don&#x27;t really know they should look for &quot;Verified&quot; in GitHub&#x27;s web UI.)<p>Combine these two known-issues and you get a really convincing phishing attack.<p>I really hope this doesn&#x27;t become a common-place thing. Hopefully this raises some awareness that, basically, you <i>should not trust any GitHub URL with a commit SHA in it</i> - only trust ones with branch names - because it could be a phishing attack otherwise.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24882921" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24882921</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bounty.github.com&#x2F;ineligible.html#impersonating_a_user_through_git_email_address" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bounty.github.com&#x2F;ineligible.html#impersonating_a_us...</a>')
