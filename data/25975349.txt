Stalin and Hitler murdered gajillions.  So, what&#x27;s your point? If it&#x27;s that Trump did things not considered peaceful, despite the peace inducing actions, then why not call out Obama for the drone bombing of Anwar Al-Awlaki, a US citizen?  And Obama GOT a peace prize.<p>To be clear - my point is not to endorse the Trump peace prize nomination, or even to make this a Trump vs Obama debate.  My only gripe here is this constant inclusion of Trump as a villain, of Hitler caliber.  It&#x27;s not a generally accepted premise, so let&#x27;s stop using it as one.')
