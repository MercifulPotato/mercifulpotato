They would presumably be using some type of augmented GPS&#x2F;differential GPS which could require calibrated ground stations depending on accuracy targets, but the error you&#x27;d get from using unaugmented GPS or a low-setup augmented GPS like WAAS wouldn&#x27;t be large enough to account for the errors discussed here. A cheap consumer GPS receiver like the one in your phone shouldn&#x27;t produce the errors in question over a meaningful distance outside of some really fringe situations.<p>One of the specific claims is that the GPS equipment doesn&#x27;t show a speed of zero when the vehicle is not moving - it&#x27;s hard to understand how this would happen, a poorly set up DGPS scheme would not produce a 20mph rate of change in fixes for a non-moving object unless it was seriously defective.<p>All in all it feels a lot like the &quot;calibration&quot; here is just a hand-waving excuse for the outcome - the margin here is so large that calibration issues are not going to account for it unless there was outright incompetence.<p>The vendor involved, DEWE, makes various types of augmented GPS equipment but also inertial measurement products. Calibration would be a much bigger issue with inertial measurement and that could make more sense, but all the reporting on this says GPS was in use.')
