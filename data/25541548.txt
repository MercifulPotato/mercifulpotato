I tell everyone, I have never met ANYONE like her, I honestly thought she was completely unique.<p>By all accounts she seems to be utterly immune to both physical pain and does not experience fear.<p>(1) She was a glass blower in college and would regularly get large burns that did not seem to bother her at all. She has multiple tattoos that she says caused no discomfort, gave birth to both our children without any drugs and to this day says it caused her no pain. She is aware of things happening but they do not bother her. Not in a bad way, I have often told people, she does not <i>feel</i> anything.<p>(2) She can say anything to anyone, anywhere and feel nothing like anxiety. This has also baffled me but I NEVER would have thought the two were somehow connected. I&#x27;ve asked many times if she ever gets nervous or anxious talking to people and says she does not and it is clearly true. In ten years I&#x27;ve never seen her cry or so much as tear up. When we lived on a farm she was our go to for any slaughtering, she sliced our goats throat without even wincing and I saw her once stand up to a 1,000+ pound charging heifer without thinking twice and made nothing of it.<p>It blows my mind but makes so much sense that this could be a single DNA mutation! Hopefully it is one 23 And Me can check for!')
