Item(by='benlivengood', descendants=None, kids=[25086276], score=None, time=1605293375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25077847, text='&gt; Itâ€™s seductive to think AGI will suddenly advance technology dramatically, but dumping more effort into existing technology has a bad habit of hitting diminishing returns. Ideas like nano-machines seem to have vast potential, until you realize biology is already operating at those scales and has significant limitations.<p>There are a few reasons to think that AGI will significantly outproduce humans; it&#x27;s likely cheap to run compared to the training costs.  GPT-3 can generate text quite a bit faster than a human at maybe a billionth of the cost of its training, for example.  Once achieved it&#x27;s likely that practical progress on a lot of problems will actually be pretty rapid.  Even if we only achieve parity with human intelligence and can never improve AGI beyond that we&#x27;ll experience a few orders of magnitude in speedup of research.<p>I think it&#x27;s a little early to write off nanotechnology when we haven&#x27;t seen much more than tech demos at this point.  Biology is a soup of proteins using brownian motion to find reaction sites.  Highly impressive and amazing to be sure but needs to be wet, fed, and in a narrow temperature band.  Precision molecular engineering is a game-changer in so many ways.')
