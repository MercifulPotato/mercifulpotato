They knew that this decision would get publicity.<p>With this knowledge, the VC firm probably made a calculated decision to forego their liquid pref in return for the good will generated by the founder&#x27;s transparent PR.<p>It&#x27;s cool to see the founder being financially rewarded for his transparency.')
