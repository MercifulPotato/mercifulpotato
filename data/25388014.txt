It can be pretty hard to determine and control what codecs are supported and which one is used, this is almost always hidden and never mentioned anywhere.<p>Nonsense. Few developers want to add the complexity of shipping and supporting their own audio decompression inside their app so they just use the ones Apple supports.<p>There are exceptions, FLAC for example isn&#x27;t supported by Apple, but I believe FLAC takes too much bandwidth to work over BT regardless.')
