In GNOME if you want to do strange things with moving and reparenting windows from other processes then you write a GNOME extension. Same with KDE and kwin scripts. No touching of Wayland necessary. Fundamentally it doesn&#x27;t seem that different from writing Arcan WMs. If all that&#x27;s not enough then you write a new Wayland compositor with the policy you want, maybe using wlroots to save time. Overall that really hasn&#x27;t changed much from writing X WMs, I don&#x27;t get what the concern here is. At worst, it is a change that can be adapted to just like those changes you describe in DWM.<p>&gt;you are much more locked down<p>Is this not what a policy is? The window manager locking down clients and enforcing that they can only do certain things? I&#x27;m aware that Arcan got wayland support recently and that actually gives me more hope that we&#x27;re <i>not</i> headed towards an apocalypse of protocol incompatibilities.')
