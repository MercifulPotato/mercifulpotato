I think a lot of people conflate Nixon and Regan - which is pretty ridiculous when you look at the policies those two presidents actually pursued during their terms... And even more folks are getting second hand vibes from Nixon&#x27;s infamous presidential debate[3] which pitted a rather uncharismatic man against JFK and led to a pretty obvious outcome.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;3&#x2F;22&#x2F;11278760&#x2F;war-on-drugs-racism-nixon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;3&#x2F;22&#x2F;11278760&#x2F;war-on-drugs-racism-n...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiancountrytoday.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;barack-obama-and-richard-nixon-among-best-presidents-for-indian-country-bJnChvj2_EKI5u8jISt1Hw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiancountrytoday.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;barack-obama-and-rich...</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-9cdRpE4KKc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-9cdRpE4KKc</a> Just FYI - if you&#x27;ve never seen this I&#x27;d suggest giving it a go sometime.  Given recent politics it&#x27;s almost fantastical to listen to two folks come into a debate focused on the issues and minimizing the ways they attacked each other.')
