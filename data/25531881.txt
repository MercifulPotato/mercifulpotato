It seems like a ethical minefield to me.<p>You have companies like Uber&#x2F;Lyft&#x2F;Tesla (and presumably the rest of the gig economy mob) waiting to put the AI into bonded&#x2F;slave labor driving customers around 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365.<p>If it truly is a Human level intelligence, then it will have values and goals and aspirations. It will have exploratory impulses. How can we square that with the purely commercial tasks and arbitrary goals that <i>we</i> want it to perform?<p>Either we humans want slaves that will do what we tell them to or we treat them like children who may or may not end up as the adults that their parents think&#x2F;hope they will become? I doubt it is the later because why else would the billions of dollars investment being pumped into AI? They want slaves.')
