Though, Ethereum doesn&#x27;t have time to wait for Eth2 imo as it will take years before it&#x27;s fully released. So it will have to rely on l2 scaling until then.<p>A lot of other platform projects are providing bridges which makes it possible to use those projects as some sort of an L2 for ethereum. If a lot of dapps starts migrating to those instead of to native L2 solutions it can get ugly.')
