I mean, if you&#x27;re just advocating that for yourself that is one thing. But advocating that as a position in general is misanthropic and in my view not a tenable or healthy position.<p>In any case, if you don&#x27;t care about the risks and are just concerned with the meaning about why we propagate and what the point of anything is, then I must point out that I&#x27;m not super interested in discussing this. I was more getting at why someone would oppose transhumanism, but this doesn&#x27;t seem tone a meaningful critique of transhumanism as much as it is a sort of pessimism about why we do anything or we should propagate at all.')
