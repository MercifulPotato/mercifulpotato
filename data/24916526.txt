I was extremely sceptical of the arguments for veganism and tried looking for arguments to refute the claims made in the book. People online were raving about &quot;the vegetarian myth&quot; by Lierre Keith, so I went to the library and borrowed it.<p>I really wanted the book to be good, but found probably the most anti-intellectual garbage ever produced. After getting about half way through, trying to fact check as I went along, I went vegan over night.<p>That is probably the largest change I have made, but Peter Singer is probably the one author that has made the biggest impact on my life and has affected many of my daily choices.')
