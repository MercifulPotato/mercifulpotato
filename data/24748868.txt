People aren&#x27;t trading their cars for bikes, they&#x27;re trading the risk of dying from a transit-related COVID-19 superspreader event for the risk of dying in a vehicle vs. bike crash.<p>A mode shift towards bikes won&#x27;t happen in most of the US because most of the US doesn&#x27;t have viable public transit, and therefore, there&#x27;s no need for Americans to switch transport modes.<p>I believe bike use has increased in relation to public transit ridership in greater New York, but this is absolutely the exception to the rule as NYC was (prior to COVID-19) a transit-dependent city.')
