I totally buy post-viral fatigue syndrome, and that there&#x27;s certainly a possibility of it occurring post COVID-19, particularly since it is a virus.  But alarm bells started ringing with the description of the lymphatic drainage, and the way the examination section is written is odd.  You don&#x27;t find mid thoracic spine inflammation on examination - an MRI would be used for that.  They mention a conflict of interest in that the treatment for this condition is some kind of lymphatic drainage and is a technique devised by one of the authors.  That author is an osteopath not a medical doctor.  That in itself would not mean I&#x27;d automatically discount research, but as others have mentioned it really is n of 1, and I&#x27;d be surprised if these clinical signs and techniques have been validated in any large trial.')
