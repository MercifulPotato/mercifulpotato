It is less an issue of capability and more an issue of Cyberpunk 2077 not being sufficiently optimized for them. The game was delayed multiple times. If it was released earlier the console version would have only been played on the previous gen. Makes me wonder if the delays were in large part to wait on new gen to come out in order to lower the need for optimization of older gen. I guess they should have waited another year.')
