Everything I think and do is through the perspective of my worldview, personality, and my peers. Human beings didn&#x27;t evolve to be rational creatures - we&#x27;re not Vulcans. We&#x27;re born with good-enough rules for making sense of the environment around us and maintaining harmony with the people around us. It&#x27;s a mistake to believe otherwise. In fact, I look at the &quot;post-truth&quot; label as just another non-rational attack against the other side.')
