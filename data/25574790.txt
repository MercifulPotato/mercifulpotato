Item(by='shadowgovt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609274951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573548, text='&gt; is there any hope to reform the corrupt political system or even to ascertain &quot;the consent of the governed&quot;?<p>A shared interpretation of reality would be a good start. Most of the things you named in your first sentence happened at such low counts that they had functionally zero impact on the outcome of the election. For starters, there has been no instance of obvious election fraud caught on camera, no forensic evidence that has gone unchallenged, voter roll issues, while chronic, were being addressed for years leading up to the election, intimidation of poll watchers was in the eye of the beholder, and transparency was extraordinary (they had counts live-streamed). Actionable oversight also exists, but excludes &quot;tossing the entire result of a state election,&quot; for obvious reasons (most of the actionable oversight is of the form &quot;Screwing with elections is a federal crime and you do a lot of time for it).<p>There was a commission to look into instances of fraud in the 2016 election, and it concluded in 2018 that there were a handful of actionable events but the end result was the outcome was unchanged. The 2020 election&#x27;s results were even wider than the difference in the 2016 outcome. It may not be unwise to appoint a commission to investigate the election results, but my money&#x27;s personally on an outcome in 2022 similar to the outcome in 2018.<p>(... and Carlin was a great entertainer but not a political scientist).')
