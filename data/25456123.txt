MATLAB has many constructs to manipulate tabular and timeseries data in a very efficient way. It also has perfectly capable OOP, which allows building very large applications while staying sane.<p>MATLAB has evolved tremendously in the last 15 years, and most critics I read, while valid if you compared a circa 2005 version to current Python + numpy + pandas + scipy, are usually just uninformed.')
