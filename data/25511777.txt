Fundamentally all wireless peers share the bandwidth (they can share it differently, but they share) - with a typical ethernet switch (i haven&#x27;t seen a hub in years, let alone coax...) - you get 1gbps duplex between any two peers simultaneously (these day probably without much problems at 1gbps, depending on hardware at higher speeds and multiple ports - but much closer than with wireless, anyway).<p>I think the &quot;leap&quot; to 10gbps was a bit too far for consumer grade switches - and &quot;too fast&quot; - faster than your SSD - so it didn&#x27;t make much sense. Hight cost, low real world benefit.<p>In a lot of situations, you&#x27;ll likely only use 10gbps in order for your NAS to talk to multiple clients, each around 1-2gbps duplex.')
