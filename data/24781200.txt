The &quot;$1500 for a gauze bandage&quot; meme makes a little more sense if you view it from the perspective of &quot;we can&#x27;t charge market price for expensive things like an MRI since Medi___ pays a flat $1.5k&#x2F;ea, so lets gouge everywhere we can to make up for it&quot;. In addition, the business setup of hospitals&#x2F;providers and lack of a single customer-facing entity&#x2F;provider that charges you for services makes these even more Kafkaesque.<p>On top of this, my friends who work at (private, non-general) hospitals work a lot and are not paid what someone on HN might expect for what they put in. This isn&#x27;t even necessarily ownership vs labor, since afaik the hospitals themselves are not usually in the best of places financially.<p>To me, the short version is: can&#x27;t easily negotiate, information asymmetry, and captured regulators. Imo, this isn&#x27;t helped that in USA we say &quot;healthcare insurance&quot; but what we mean&#x2F;want seems to actually be &quot;healthcare subsidy&#x2F;guarantee&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;medicare&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;whats-the-latest-on-medicare-drug-price-negotiations&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;medicare&#x2F;issue-brief&#x2F;whats-the-latest-on...</a>')
