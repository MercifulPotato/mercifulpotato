I think I can hate all of those things without believing that the site should be censored.&quot;<p>I have yet to see any evidence that the capitol protest was planned primarily on Parler. I have seen plenty of evidence that it was planned primarily on Facebook (that has since been deleted&#x2F;hidden by Facebook). You&#x27;d think if the goal was to punish or curtail such events Facebook would be getting at least similar treatment as Parler.')
