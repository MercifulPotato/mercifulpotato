This drops Telegram out: no e2e rooms.<p>3) handles sending photos, videos, and voice messages. More or less kills XMPP, unless people are on the latest-and-greatest version of Conversations and  maybe ChatSecure.<p>4) the maintaining organisation needs to be reasonably big with decent privacy.<p>5) usable for completely non technical generic population - meaning Tox is out as well.<p>As much as I dislike to admit it, this leaves Matrix, and nothing else. My problem with Matrix is that it&#x27;s so resource hungry - both the servers and the clients - is that it&#x27;s silly. Yes, I know &quot;optimization is coming&quot; but even Dendrite eats 1.5GB memory easily with a single user joining a few, medium sized, federated rooms (yes, I&#x27;ve tried).<p>Footnote: Threema... no. There is no need for yet another competing open source thing, there are enough with Signal, Matrix, and XMPP.')
