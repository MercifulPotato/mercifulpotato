Unlike many open source engines that have failed, Godot (esp. Since 3.x) tends to provide you with minimal abstractions, and focus its development efforts on polishing core features which more complex features can be built on top of. It offers a smaller core feature set than an engine like Unreal, but polishes what&#x27;s there so well that it can compete on a commercial level<p>I personally believe much of its success is owed in large part to this kind of prioritization on fit and finish.<p>Its networking api is minimal, and easy to use. It helps you negotiate your initial connection, and then gets out of your way, so you can spend your time thinking about the information coming through the pipe.<p>A more opinionated system might be faster to get up and going, but would likely get in your way for more complex projects.<p>Much of godot&#x27;s functionality is implemented in modules, which the engine can be optionally compiled without, and are easily added in by other developers.<p>On top of this, the engine has a plug-in ecosystem like Unity has, which allows functionality extension on a per-project basis.<p>This means that more opinionated networking features can be trivially appended to the engine&#x27;s core feature set by the community, and shared or sold as developers see fit.<p>Imo, this is a win. Developers don&#x27;t have to work around, bypass, or ship with a clunky networking model that seemed like a good idea at the time, and Godot devs don&#x27;t have to maintain the potentially sprawling implementation of a feature that could very well get in somebody&#x27;s way.<p>Wrt gdscript, it&#x27;s something that existed in the engine before it was open-sourced, is tightly integrated into the engine&#x27;s systems, and is easy to bind new code and methods to.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the core vm has been touched too much since it was released, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to ignore if you want to use C#, or C++ instead.<p>Godot exists in a space between something like Unreal, and older frameworks like XNA. It&#x27;s small enough that a single person can wrap their head around it, offers a baseline set of tools, with a modern renderer (4.0 will have a more modern renderer). It&#x27;s beginner friendly, but it rarely gets in the way of experienced devs as a result.')
