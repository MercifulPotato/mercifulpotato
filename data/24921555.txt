I bought their top rated washer in a rental apartment where the landlord told me to &quot;buy whatever.&quot; It was a decent washer, but nothing too incredible, and got mildewy smells (I know, I could have cleaned it more assiduously).<p>For my next washer when I moved into my own house, I did my own research, and found a washer that 1) stored an entire bottle of detergent and dispensed it automatically 2) ran a venting fan to prevent mildew after a load is done, and keeps it bone dry, 3) Sends me a phone notification when my laundry is done and when it&#x27;s been sitting for 30 minutes, 4) Can wash a small load and dry it in one shot with the venting fan. Massive upgrade and nowhere on Consumer Reports&#x27; radar.')
