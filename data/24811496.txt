Works pretty well but yeah, Cloud9 as an IDE it&#x27;s very meh.<p>Also it has broken workflows. They push functions back to Lambda unzipped, so if you&#x27;re working there and you hit the unzipped limit, there&#x27;s nothing you can do to push. It will just fail to push back. It&#x27;s so stupid. You can actually download the inflated function projects but you can&#x27;t push back after a change. It annoys me so much.<p>GitLab recently integrated Gitpod natively and that looks pretty solid! It&#x27;s based on Visual Studio Code + K8s: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gitpod.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gitpod.io&#x2F;</a>')
