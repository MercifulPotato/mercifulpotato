On Windows things are more stable but that&#x27;s only because Windows cares about backwards compatibility to the point of preserving the behavior of even the most badly written software.<p>Linux is the only one of the three that promises a stable kernel ABI. On macOS and Windows the system libc is the only safe way to talk to the kernel.')
