SolarWinds was actually attacked by an actual threat and their defenses were comically outmatched by that real threat who found real value in attacking them. We are not talking 10%-20% or even 100%, we are talking systems that need to improve by 1,000%-10,000% to provide credible defense against real foes. And this is not just SolarWinds, FireEye, a major cybersecurity company, needs to improve their security by a factor of 100x to protect their customers against people who actually wish to attack them. The security is not merely inadequate, it is inadequate to a degree that is almost mind-boggling. Systems are being deployed that are not even 1% of the necessary level of effectiveness. These organizations are completely incapable of developing and deploying adequate defenses.<p>This ignores the secondary problem which is that if the attacks being deployed are 100x stronger than the defenses, how hard is it to develop an attack that is merely 2x stronger than the defenses. If we lazily extrapolate this linearly, that would be 1&#x2F;50th the resources to develop an attack that still outmatches the defenders. How many people do you think were on the SolarWinds attack? 10, 100, 1000? Even at 1000 that means you would only need 20 fulltime people for a year to develop a credible attack against nearly every Fortune 500 company in the world and most of the US government. That should be a terrifying concept. Obviously, this is lazy extrapolation, but it is not so off as to be non-illustrative of this problem.<p>Given this immense difference between real problems and available solutions, the only reasonable assumption for companies and people is to assume that they are completely defenseless against such actors and likely even largely defenseless against even poorly-resourced attacks as demonstrated time and time again. It is imperative that they act accordingly and only make systems accessible where the harm of guaranteed breach is less than the benefit of making those systems accessible.')
