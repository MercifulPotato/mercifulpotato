These are mistakes, even as they are understandable. After all, misinformation is a bad thing, change is uncertain, and no one wants to be the one that screwed up. Everyone has good intentions; the mistake is in valuing intentions over outcomes.<p>This, I think, is the flaw in this argument. People do not always have good intentions, and they are polluting the informational landscape to the point where it&#x27;s dramatically impacting society.<p>The principles he&#x27;s asking for are indeed happening right now, but in a nefarious way:<p>&quot;Free speech is a good thing&quot; - Sure, but that means 4chan, QAnon, anti-vaxxers, and the like also get loud, free speech now.<p>&quot;Status quo is bad&quot; - The previous status quo of large, centralized media groups is gone, and with it basic levels of journalistic ethics and transparency.<p>&quot;Move fast, value experimentation&quot; - Changes are happening to the way information is produced disseminated much faster than societal constructs can keep up. I didn&#x27;t have to worry 20 years ago about my relatives treating &quot;Hillary Clinton runs a sex dungeon in a pizza shop&quot; FB memes with the same weight as NBC Nightly News.<p>Fixing these issues, whether by government, tech industry, or otherwise, will involve some level of &quot;authoritarianism&quot;.')
