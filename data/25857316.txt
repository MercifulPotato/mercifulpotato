There are studies on this too -- you can skip middle school and lose not very much at all. They&#x27;re notorious for behavioral problems. It&#x27;s often a toxic experience.<p>It&#x27;s the time when, from an evolutionary psychology perspective, people began helping support families and to have meaning and purpose in life. When I&#x27;ve visited countries when kids do elementary school and then go work the fields, that whole set of behavioral problems and toxicity was avoided. Of course, kids also left school, so I&#x27;m not claiming that&#x27;s a good alternative. But a wealthy nation should be able to provide one:<p>1) I believe that providing kids with <i>meaningful</i> work starting in middle school would reduce much of that toxicity.<p>2) I also believe providing kids with work would motivate learning. Right now, kids often ask why they need to know &quot;this,&quot; and don&#x27;t know how to pick majors when they hit college.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t believe just throwing kids into the grinder, metaphorically speaking, and sending them off to flip burgers at McD&#x27;s would do any good. Ideally, I&#x27;d be thinking of a structured process -- internships and similar where kids have something meaningful to do aligned with their interest. If a 12-year-old is interested in art, they&#x27;re sent off to do something at an advertising company.<p>On the other side, when kids leave college, I also wouldn&#x27;t throw them into a 40-hour (or 70-hour a week) grinder. I&#x27;d also try to structure jobs which pay less, but provide for learning and mentorship. Your first few jobs out of college, you should still be taking perhaps 1 class per semester.<p>As a footnote, I also needed to pay my own way for much of college. My short-term mental&#x2F;physical health suffered for it, but in the long-term, I&#x27;m better off for it. I&#x27;m not claiming that&#x27;s true for everyone (so much of this depends on the specifics of the jobs), but I&#x27;m claiming it could be.')
