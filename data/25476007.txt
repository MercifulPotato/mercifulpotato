I didn&#x27;t realize we need to get into that kind of semantics. My argument is that a sentence long function name of 10 words roughly is still a good function name. There&#x27;s no hard rule here. Judgement is still qualitative The main point that I was arguing for is that this:<p><pre><code>  find_xy_coordinate_of_dogs_cats_and_baboons_in_picture\n</code></pre>\nis a perfectly good function name. The poster I responded to disagrees with me and I was responding to that specifically.')
