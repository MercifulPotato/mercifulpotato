I guess the hard part was the password, after login it was over quickly.  The game almost lost me on password guessing, I misunderstood something and had a different date.  Hammering away at the password wasn&#x27;t fun. Between guessing the name, the date, the date format, and case sensitivity, it leaves one with too many options to hammer away at manually.')
