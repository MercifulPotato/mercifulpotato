How many blocks for this partition again? What partition type am I marking this? Am I using a capital G to denote gigabyte? A plus sign before or after the number? What is the current state? What is the planned state?<p>These aren&#x27;t particularly difficult questions, but they <i>are</i> more easily answered when using a GUI tool like GParted than they are when using fdisk or parted.<p>GParted is an excellent GUI. I personally haven&#x27;t seen a more reliable and usable partition utility. It&#x27;s my first and last recommendation, no matter what the user&#x27;s background, and it will likely continue to be for a very long time.')
