The more usage, the more important performance and correctness are.<p>-- How critical is your application? The more critical it is, the more important correctness is.<p>Also, the argument that you can spend developer time to increase correctness just by writing more tests works up to a point, but then it doesn&#x27;t, because of diminishing returns. With Rust you can eliminate certain entire classes of bugs which tests will never reach.')
