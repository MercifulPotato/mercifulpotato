The daily grind of polishing the ubiquitous rough edges in the existing UI is beneath them, so they feel like they need to go redesign the entire product every two years. The sole clients of this redesign are the execs, who want to see something shiny.<p>The massive redesigns aren&#x27;t really amenable to A&#x2F;B testing; after launching, they generally are deeply flawed and engineers spend a quarter clawing back to the usability of the original design. Eventually it becomes the new baseline, which means it&#x27;s boring, which means it&#x27;s time to redesign again. Repeat until you leave, collect your accolades for all the redesigns you presided over, and depart to go do the same at BigCo2.')
