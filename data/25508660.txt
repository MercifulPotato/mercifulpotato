Society today is much, much larger and more complex than society in George Washington&#x27;s day. (Much more complex than in any time in history in fact.)<p>This is not to imply that George Washington is no better than the corrupt politicians, judges and police we have today. George Washington was, by all accounts, a very good man.<p>My only point was that it was far easier to actually <i>be</i> a good man in the time of George Washington than it is to be a good man or woman today. Not even a tenth of the opportunities to get yourself in trouble back then.')
