Item(by='dreamcompiler', descendants=None, kids=[25079517], score=None, time=1605248390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078888, text='&gt; Hopefully Apple can find their way back.<p>It&#x27;s not going to happen. Apple talks up privacy and security but the truth is they don&#x27;t care about those things. What they care about is having a locked-down platform because locked-down platforms make Apple $hitloads more money than open general-purpose computers.<p>Let&#x27;s take another example: Remember back before 9&#x2F;11 and you didn&#x27;t have to show an ID when you boarded a plane? The airlines hated that because it meant people could resell tickets when they changed their plans, and there was no way for the airlines to get a cut of that money. After 9&#x2F;11, the Feds made the airlines ask for ID, which the airlines absolutely loved because it destroyed the secondary market for unused tickets. Of course they didn&#x27;t frame it this way--the airlines said &quot;they were happy to help enforce additional security measures&quot;--even though you and I both know that asking for ID before boarding a plane is just another aspect of security theater.<p>Apple is doing the same thing. Locked-down platforms they justify with security theater are making Apple a lot of money. They have absolutely no incentive to change anything.')
