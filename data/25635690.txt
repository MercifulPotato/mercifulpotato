We’re building a music-focused social network fighting back against algorithmically generated playlists and soulless corporate radio. We’re creating a democratized platform people connect with their music, their favorite artists, and each other. One of our founders is an actual rockstar, and we have artists and industry executives lauding us as the future of music streaming.<p>We are a small team working collaboratively in a diverse and inclusive workplace.  While we&#x27;re working remote, the team is based in NYC, and we have general availability for meetings and synchronous collaboration 10-4 eastern time.<p>The position is Android-only. No backend or iOS programming is expected, although some understanding of Swift and iOS fundamentals is helpful since some feature work will be direct ports from our iOS project. Our Android codebase is less than a year old, and uses Kotlin exclusively.<p>Email me at andrew@stationhead.com if you&#x27;re interested. Be sure to include your favorite band in the email!')
