A little surprised about Mastodon because I&#x27;ve only heard that from people I follow on twitter who tend to not be crazy, but I guess it makes sense.<p>I have an idea for an app whose primary motivation is offering a comment section for websites that don&#x27;t normally have comments or have them disabled (yes, this idea is old as dirt and has been tried many times).<p>The part I&#x27;m really struggling with is how one would market such an app without targeting free speech absolutists and nutters, despite it being really useful for everyone.
