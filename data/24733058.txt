I read their posts or add my own posts perhaps twice a day. 90% are status updates and&#x2F;or photos of what they are up to. I find it extremely useful. It&#x27;s a micro-blogging service. When did this moniker &quot;social media&quot; come into being? What does that even mean? I should say that I have everything except direct posts disabled - including all &quot;shares&quot; and all ads - and that&#x27;s why to me it&#x27;s just a micro-blogging site.')
