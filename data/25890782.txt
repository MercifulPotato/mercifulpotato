They can READ ALL YOUR DATA including the passwords you type into gmail, and can do “forgot password” on any site and hijack your gmail in the background as you read it.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. There is a security check in place for Chrome extensions. Are you saying that it&#x27;s inadequate or that it is security theater only?  Because it sounds like you&#x27;re implying that no security exists whatsoever.')
