They create ads offering your expert development services, ostensibly competing with your existing website, but with intentionally slashed pricing and a ‘creatively’ misrepresented offering (aka growth hacking). Then they subcontract the job to some crappy outsourcing firm that bungles it, but who cares, they got their cut and you signed the TOS.<p>Now bad reviews are piling up online about the bad experiences people had with your business, your reputation is destroyed, and your business is next.<p>I know it’s not a perfect analogy but try to empathize with the restaurants here.')
