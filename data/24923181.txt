Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24923515], score=None, time=1603913737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922708, text='&gt; 8chan hosting is a legitimate liability concern.<p>Some plausible excuse can always be found.<p>&gt; This is not an apples to apples comparison of businesses operating in good faith with reasonable policies and practices.<p>Humans are incredible capable at &quot;reasoning&quot; (framing, rationalizing) things to any desired perspective or conclusion.<p>&gt; &quot;If someone is able to shut down our unabashed cesspool, eventually they&#x27;re going to start coming for sites that aren&#x27;t cesspools!&quot;<p>Those are you words, not the words someone else has said in this thread.<p>You did say this though:<p>&gt; There are plenty of alternative platforms, which conservatives are constantly failing to lure anyone to.<p>The person who replied to this assertion noted some examples of such alternative platforms being interfered with - and of course, a &quot;reasonable&quot; reason can typically be manufactured (imagined) within seconds.<p>And all of this does not take into consideration that <i>visibility</i> of speech largely varies per platform.  No, you do not have a &quot;right&quot; to be on a platform, but that is orthogonal to the question of whether the broadcast of certain ideas is being forcefully limited by the employees or executives of large platforms (completely within their <i>current</i> rights).')
