(not sure the correct word).<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about it a bit lately because I have 2 young kids at home just starting to earn pocket money. For them money is to spend on treats. Sometimes I can convince them to save up for something larger, but fundamentally it&#x27;s something for them to spend.<p>It&#x27;s not until later in life, when you start selling your time that some people start to see money a little differently. No &quot;treats&quot; are really worth that time you invested earning the money to buy them. Money is not for spending on treats, it&#x27;s for  surviving. (and every cent counts.) Food, shelter, clothing, tools, then as little as possible on entertainment &#x2F; culture &#x2F; travel.<p>Then even later, when you have children, you start to realize that when you spend money, you are not only selling your time, but also the time of your children, because if you can just put enough away for them to start life without debt, they&#x27;ll have to sell a hell of a lot less of their time to just survive.<p>err, but the point I was trying to make was that not many people are taught that money is not for spending on treats, but I don&#x27;t thin that&#x27;s something that you can be taught in school, (would even agree with).')
