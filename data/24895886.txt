And websites that aren&#x27;t conscious of loading times are probably using bundling techniques that would already make cross-site caches useless. In both cases, I&#x27;m having a hard time believing that loading JQuery is the reason anyone&#x27;s website is slow.<p>There are theoretical schemes that could allow us to share libraries between sites without having the same privacy impacts, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even worth the effort of proposing them.')
