You realize 100 years ago, speech advocating for homosexuals would be considered deeply offensive, deplorable and unsafe, right?<p>At least in the US, the law is very specific about speech: direct calls to violence are banned, and should be.<p>But now we have Big Tech, Mozilla and others, tells us what is and isn&#x27;t hate speech. You say &quot;Nazis&quot; and &quot;fascists&quot; but it&#x27;s just a stand-in now for anything and everything you disagree with. It&#x27;s all Nazi Nazi Nazi and it has no real meaning.<p>When you ban speech, when you dictate what language people are and aren&#x27;t allowed to use, you control though.<p>We are literally talking about though policing here. Distributed social networks help prevent though crime and Mozilla opposed them in ways that feel more fascistic than anything they&#x27;re claiming the &quot;Fascists&quot; are doing.')
