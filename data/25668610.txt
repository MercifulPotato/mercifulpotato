Trump is shaking down the Georgia Secretary of State. There is your fraud.<p>But the Georgia Secretary of state goes through the claims anyway, and sums it up with: <i>Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong.</i><p>And specifically the ridiculous and unfounded claim of 5000 dead people voting he says: <i>The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. And so thatâ€™s wrong.</i><p>I do not understand what possesses sore losers to insist that their fragile emotional state must be coddled this much for this long, and to tell lies so prolifically. But it is not the responsibility of everyone else to provide emotional support for them.')
