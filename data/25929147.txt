Invariably the administrative staff at his schools (apart from the principal) are women, and invariably they call his mom instead of me. Every single time I get an apology because they tried to reach out to mom and couldn’t get an answer.<p>1. They assume his mom is his primary caregiver\n2. They assume I will mind having to care for my child\n3. They never make a note that they can’t get through to his mom; the assumption remains all year that she’s the primary caregiver<p>On the other side though, buying a car last year was frustrating because multiple salesmen treated my partner like she didn’t exist and answered her questions about cars like she was 3 years old or simply directed answers to me. I had to remind them far too often to talk to her - I hadn’t asked the question.<p>Also the shitty jokes about letting her test drive - it just isn’t funny, she commutes by car for work and I ride a bike to work; she really should test drive it and no I’m not afraid of a woman driving a car. It made us want to walk off car lots, but then we discovered every lot did it anyway.')
