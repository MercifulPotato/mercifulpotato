This should be concerning to everyone.</i><p>I use a carbon &#x2F; global warming metaphor instead of pressure, but same intuition. You&#x27;re taking actions today that will play out in the future.<p>Assuming most excess money supply has gone into (a) stocks, pushing valuations up, &amp; (b) real estate, pushing valuations up, what would cause a <i>freeing</i> of that money? Because until it&#x27;s liquified, it&#x27;s not impacting inflation.<p>The only way substantial amounts of money move out of stocks is if the Fed raises rates and bond yields improve. It has to go somewhere, and that&#x27;s the only sink big enough to swallow the flow.<p>Real estate is trickier. There&#x27;s only so much volume that the (at least in the US) inefficient process can handle, which means there&#x27;s a fundamental process against a flash liquidation.')
