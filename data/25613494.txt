But it&#x27;s not the first place in Europe to demand that other places (wherever) register and submit tax there...<p>One example: I live in Finland, and if you were to send me beer in the post (from within or without the EU), then actually Finland would expect you to pay Finnish alcohol exise on it though as they count it as distance selling if you were to orgainse transport of it[1] (by posting it). Of course, it&#x27;s basically unenforceable, it&#x27;s a loophole that is heavily exploited, and there is ambiguity surrounding this and free movement of goods.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vero.fi&#x2F;en&#x2F;detailed-guidance&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;48631&#x2F;rules_and_procedures_regarding_distance&#x2F;#2.5-goods-subject-to-excise-duty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vero.fi&#x2F;en&#x2F;detailed-guidance&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;48631&#x2F;rule...</a> (Sec. 2.5.1)')
