We know humans are controlling these planes and the equipment can always gets better. Usually it comes down to UX, checklists and more to have multiple stopgaps to prevent issues. Just a quick scan of the Flight 522 page shows there were in fact many UX issues like why can you take off when the pressure system is turned to manual? Forcing a manual override if so would have helped. Same alert sound was also used for &quot;take-off configuration warning&quot; and &quot;cabin altitude warning&quot;, leading to the pilots making the wrong decision. Attributing Flight 522 to only human error is not what the courts did (check the &quot;Lawsuits and criminal proceedings&quot; section in the page you linked) so not sure why you would.')
