It&#x27;s an AAA game that&#x27;s been hyped to death and delayed 3 times to deliver sub par results.<p>I like rockstars approach much better: very limited hype, limited numbers of trailer&#x2F;videos, no crazy promise, &amp;c. Release on a limited amount of platforms first and take your time to port it to others so that everyone gets a polished version (or at least as good as it gets given the hardware). Cyberpunk looks like your typical &quot;over promise, under deliver&quot; approach.')
