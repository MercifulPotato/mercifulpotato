It can&#x27;t. They get stuck and get into messes. Nonetheless the ability to encode some things into types makes Haskell by far the most practical language I&#x27;ve used.<p>It&#x27;s not even that, I&#x27;ll assume that the majority of Haskell novices are aware that there are humble limits to the expressiveness of most (including Haskell&#x27;s) type systems.<p>The real problem IMHO is the dichotomy that this approach entails. You have to decide which language to use to model a concept (type language or run time language), and if the idea of what you want to do changes a little, chances are you can&#x27;t continue on your current path.<p>In other words, I think the type system approach prevents a lot of the fluidity that I want from a programming language as a tool to get things done.')
