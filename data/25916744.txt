Having to polyfill WebXR out of the ancient WebVR API is a pain, too.<p>Normally, the fact that practically nobody actually uses Firefox would mean it&#x27;s not a huge problem. But the only standalone VR headsets with a Chromium-based browser are the Facebook headsets. If Firefox were better, I could be running twice as many of the not-Facebook-encumbered Pico Neo headsets for the same price. As it stands, Oculus for Business headsets are almost the same price as a Valve Index, once you add in the mandatory &quot;support&quot; yearly licensing fee.')
