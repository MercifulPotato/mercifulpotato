Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24932135], score=None, time=1603980150, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929525, text='&gt; If I&#x27;m vulnerable, why should I gamble that your views are similar to mine?<p>Don&#x27;t you do that with a CoC as well? Short of writing a long list of things that may and may not be said, you can only give a vague &quot;please be kind to each other&quot;, but the concrete judgement what is and isn&#x27;t kind depends on whether your views align with those in power.<p>My experience is that vague rules are both a recipe for corruption (where the enforcer&#x27;s friends are exempt from the rules and the argument is &quot;that wasn&#x27;t rude, the person deserved to be called a shithead&quot;) and the troll&#x27;s playground, because toxic people that <i>want</i> to cause trouble are great at figuring out the pain points that get to their targets but don&#x27;t cross any lines.<p>I believe that enforcement is important, not rules. You can always have a more specific policy for the moderators to guide them and to develop the team&#x27;s response, but that shouldn&#x27;t be part of the rules.<p>It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not 100% fair that you might get kicked out for breaking a rule you didn&#x27;t know existed, but to me that&#x27;s collateral damage I&#x27;m more than happy to accept (and I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of a &quot;you crossed a line&quot; talk).')
