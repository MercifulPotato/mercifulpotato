Except for JS execution.<p>A handful of examples: Scrapehero, Webrobots, Apify, Scrapingbee, Scrapinghub, Promptcloud<p>Except for the ones that require setup fee, or have ridiculous pricing models. Why would anyone want to setup Puppeteer&#x2F;Selenium&#x2F;other scraping bots instead of using one of the &quot;scraping-as-a-service&quot; platforms?')
