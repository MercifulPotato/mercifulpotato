I used both perl and Scala and I had to laugh when I read what you said.<p>Yeah, Scala makes it possible to write cryptic DSLs. I just don&#x27;t use libraries that do that, but there are not many such libraries anymore anyways, that was mostly abused in the early days of Scala. Now, 15 years later, that&#x27;s almost non-existing anymore.<p>But not having symbolic characters in method names is just horrible. Here is Java code that calculates some datetime:<p><pre><code>    LocalDateTime started = LocalDateTime.parse(&quot;2018-03-22T19:00:00&quot;)\n    LocalDateTime finished = start.plus(Duration.ofMinutes(30)).plus(Duration.ofMinutes(15).multipliedBy(4)).plus(Duration.ofSeconds(45)).plus(Duration.ofMinutes(4).multipliedBy(3)).plus(Duration.ofSeconds(30))\n </code></pre>\nHere is the exact same calculation, but with Scala&#x27;s &quot;symbolic&quot; characters:<p><pre><code>    val started = LocalDateTime.parse(&quot;2018-03-22T19:00:00&quot;)\n    val finished = start + 30.minutes + 4 * 15.minutes + 45.seconds + 3 * 4.minutes + 30.seconds\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t need very long to know what I find far more readable ;)')
