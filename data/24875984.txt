Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[24876295], score=None, time=1603500908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24874806, text='&gt; If nuclear could compete on cost, we should go for it, but it can&#x27;t without a major tech breakthrough<p>I do actually agree on the sentiment. We should be using the cheapest form of energy with a little bit of a concession to reliability.<p>But the problem with saying &quot;nuclear costs more&quot; is it is clearly over-regulated. We accept, for coal, about 3 orders of magnitude [0] more deaths per TWh than nuclear, as we have for the last 30 or 40 years†. At any point, literally hundreds of lives could have been saved moving to a technically excellent form of energy. We didn&#x27;t do that. Ditto for renewables despite the terror displayed by the climate change lobby.<p>Humanity has, when tested, shown an overwhelming willingness to go with cheap power and disregard some really quite high social costs to get there. Nobody likes that inconvenient fact, but nuclear has been grossly over-regulated when assessed against humanities choices through the industrial revolution and beyond.<p>If we hold nuclear to the same standards all of us sitting in fossil-fuel based economies are accepting right now it would be much cheaper. If we held solar to the same standards of doing no harm as nuclear, it would be much more expensive.<p>So yes; cheapest option please. But can we also be consistent about the standards that we hold our energy to before we make that choice?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;nuclear-energy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;nuclear-energy</a><p>† Misread the chart.
