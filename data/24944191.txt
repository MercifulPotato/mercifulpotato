There are ton of ways to slice this data, though. I used national stats for accidents where the police showed up; maybe Waymo&#x27;s data includes no-police accidents. It would also be interesting to compare injury statistics. And of course this is Phoenix-specific data from Waymo, which is a place with good road conditions.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdan.nhtsa.gov&#x2F;tsftables&#x2F;National%20Statistics.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdan.nhtsa.gov&#x2F;tsftables&#x2F;National%20Statistics.pdf</a><p>(edited to include simulated crashes, which were only averted through human safety driver intervention.)')
