To that end, the registers boil down to:<p>* 16 general-purpose registers.<p>* 16 or 32 vector registers.<p>* 7 vector mask registers<p>* 8 x87 floating-point registers, with 8 MMX registers aliased. (To separate or not separate x87&#x2F;mmx is definitely a challenging question)<p>* 3 normal status registers: RIP, RFLAGS, MXCSR<p>* 6 x87 status registers: FSW, FCW, FTP, FDP, FIP, FOP<p>* 6 segment registers<p>* 6 debug registers<p>* Relevant MPX registers (I don&#x27;t know this ISA extension very well, so I can&#x27;t count these registers accurately)<p>These are the registers that I would expect to be able to poke at in a debugger or inspect&#x2F;modify via something like ucontext_t, and they&#x27;re going to be found in whatever kernel abstraction you use to save not-currently-running thread information.')
