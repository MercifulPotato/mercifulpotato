I do have digital backups of all (or, nearly all... some are hard to find) of my physical books. I didn&#x27;t make them from my own copy of course, but I still consider my digital library to be a backup of my physical bookshelves. Maybe this isn&#x27;t as common as I had imagined, but I thought it was a fairly reasonable thing to do.')
