I did the method where you set up a network firewall at the router level that redirects all port 53 traffic to the pi. It&#x27;s a nice feature for getting my xbox filtered, but it really felt like an insecure historical quirk rather than a feature we should be praising.<p>Surely it&#x27;s progress for devices to be able to securely access name servers? I can&#x27;t snoop on the network traffic going over https but somehow I can get a list of all names queried?')
