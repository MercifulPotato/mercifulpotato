Just some ideas I had:<p>Speech recognition + basic NLP for automatic customer support triage. None of these are great to use as a customer, but they seem to be effective enough to continue using and save companies lots of money.<p>Automatic &quot;offensive&quot; content detection for social media. I&#x27;d bet they use ML to do a first-pass on uploaded content to make sure it doesn&#x27;t contain porn, gore, etc. Probably lets these companies save money.<p>Automatic defect detection in factories. Instead of training humans to detect subtle issues in manufacturing issues. I think companies like Samsara are experimenting with offering this tech as a service.<p>Facial recognition&#x2F;tracking for law enforcement&#x2F;defense. Ignoring the ethics of it for a moment, it seems like governments would be willing to pay a good amount of money for this tech. Could be used to automatically search through hours of footage to find which frames (if any) contain a target.')
