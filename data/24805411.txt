While, sure, there are things a religious person feel wonder over that I as an atheist won&#x27;t, there is so much to be excited about in knowledge and rationality itself. But also, knowing the sun is &quot;just&quot; a fairly unremarkable star does not mean being unable to appreciate the feelings a sunset brings, either.<p>Le Corbusier is a poor example to attempt to push this idea of rationality as cold, because you find that kind of worship of austerity and purity all over religious history too, and Corbusier faced rejection from a whole lot of people you might expect would embrace the austerity of his ideas (most notably, perhaps, Stalin, who opted for a far more conservative approach full of emotionally driven symbolism for both his changes to Moscow and e.g. the (never finished) Palace of the Soviets).')
