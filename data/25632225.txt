Just as an analogy:<p>----<p>&quot;I lost 30 pounds and fixed a sleep apnea problem when I started paying attention to my diet.&quot;<p>&quot;That isn&#x27;t paying attention to your diet, it&#x27;s fixing a fundamental health problem. In general, most dieting falls into the category of fads and micromanaging.&quot;<p>----<p>Aside from your specific definitions about what does and doesn&#x27;t count as customization, what do you and the OP actually disagree on?<p>Do both of you agree that when changing an Emacs config, I should take into account the ratio of time they&#x27;ll save and the time I&#x27;ll lose making them?<p>Do both of you agree that there are changes I can make to an Emacs config that would eventually provide a net benefit in terms of time saved?<p>Is it good that I can make those changes that save me time in the long run?<p>Is it bad if I ignore the cost&#x2F;benefit analysis of a customization and spend more time messing with configs than actually programming?<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re actually arguing about.')
