It started importing my files. &quot;Fine&quot;, I thought, &quot;it&#x27;s creating some internal database of my files. Oh neat it&#x27;s downloading meta-data.&quot; Then I realized, to my horror, it was also renaming&#x2F;retagging files and directories in it&#x27;s own format. All of my music was in a consistently named and categorized file structure of my own devising, having been mostly ripped from CDs I owned and then tagged and filed by hand. Down the details of track filenames and ID3 titles having consistent casing. All of that was trashed by iTunes. The hate I feel, to this day, for that software has no equal in decades of computer experience.')
