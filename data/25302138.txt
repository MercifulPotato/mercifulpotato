Of course, we all have video calls, use a bunch of different tools, but almost all of them are focused only on work...<p>It&#x27;s not enough to build stronger social connections. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to talk more about our hobbies and activities other than work? Discuss together the latest sports events or share book and movie recommendations?<p>This is how the idea of TeamBuddy was born - it introduces &quot;Clubs&quot;, which group team members around similar interests. Each club has its own set of questions that members can answer. This way in our teams we all can know each other better and find topics to discuss.<p>It can be also useful when onboarding new employees. New remote hires will get a chance to introduce themselves to the team, but also to learn more about their new teammates.<p>I was working on TeamBuddy for the last couple of months as my side project and I&#x27;m very keen to see what you think about it. Do you like the idea? Do you think it can be useful for you &amp; your team?<p>More information:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teambuddy.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teambuddy.app</a><p>Demo:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.teambuddy.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.teambuddy.app</a><p>Thank you!')
