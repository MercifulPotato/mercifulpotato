In my city they offered ride passes that had a flat fare (of less than $5 per trip, within some threshold...I think it was within 20 miles). Then when they expanded they slowly raised the price of the flat fare before getting rid of it altogether.<p>In short, yes, we are generally conditioned to rely on these services.')
