Then second time two years ago when it was dropped into clean water. In the second case the water got absolutely everywhere including between individual leaves of the LCD panel.<p>Thanks to how it is built, both times I was able to disassemble it myself and clean it properly to remove any water and residues.<p>I have also changed internal battery which was as simple as unscrewing it and disconnecting from main board. I hacked BIOS to accept 4G M.2 card because when the laptop was certified 4G wasn&#x27;t even a thing yet.<p>I will be giving it away and replacing it with a newer one but only because of some outdated technology. It still runs fast, doesn&#x27;t get hot, panel is perfectly readable and everything works smoothly.')
