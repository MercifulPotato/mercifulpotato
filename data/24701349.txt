[Edit] I suspect the rationale is that both products are fine, and the regulations represent overreach, so we&#x27;re going to mollify them. But the banking and finance industries were complaining about overreach right up until the crash (as they have before every single crash). The money it costs you to comply also costs you your objectivity.<p>You might be able to overclock the hell out of an Intel processor that was binned several notches down from the top, but that depends on how good the yields were that week. It&#x27;s possible you just got a slightly shittier processor.')
