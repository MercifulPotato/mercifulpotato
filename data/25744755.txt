Its builds are made by a handful of volunteers in their spare time, and any of those volunteers may lose interest and walk away. Because Android building is so byzantine, it is not trivial for someone else to come along and restore support for an abandoned phone.<p>The LineageOS team has repeatedly emphasized that they do not owe anyone long-term support, so please stop recommending it as such. This is one of the reasons for interest in the PinePhone: it is now supported by the mainline kernel and much easier to build for in perpetuity than an Android device.')
