But there is a balance to be achieved, and beyond a certain point... synthetic improvements in performance don’t show up in the real world.<p>Queuing up a few database requests concurrently to make up for the overhead of literally hundreds of nanoseconds of latency is trivial, especially when Optane can service those requests concurrently, unlike a spinning hard drive. Applications running on other machines won’t be able to tell a difference.<p>But, agree to disagree.<p>There are probably applications where these mega machines are useful, but I don’t personally find this to be a compelling example.<p>I readily admit that I could be wrong... but neither of us have numbers in front of us showing a compelling reason for a company to spend unbelievable amounts of money on a single machine. My experiences (limited compared to many, I’m sure) tell me this isn’t the winning scenario, though.')
