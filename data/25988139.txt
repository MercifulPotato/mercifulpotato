If it gets pulled for racism it&#x27;s an unambiguous case of either cognitive dissonance or uninformed judgement.<p>To add insult to hypothetical injury, racism is weaponized in the film by an upper-class railroad baron to divide the working poor amongst themselves so they don&#x27;t unite against him. Having the film spark yet another battle along ideological lines among the less well-off of society would be weirdly poetic.')
