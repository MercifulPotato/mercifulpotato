Item(by='ldjb', descendants=None, kids=[25125648], score=None, time=1605624529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25123855, text='I can understand your use case, but I know a lot of people (often those who use computers infrequently) type out the full URL all the time. They don&#x27;t know what HTTP or HTTPS is, they don&#x27;t realise you can omit that part. They just want to access the website.<p>For those people, it makes sense that typing &quot;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a>&quot; would take them to the &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a>&quot; site if available. Although they did specify HTTP, it isn&#x27;t necessarily what they actually wanted.<p>I think the use case you describe (whilst valid) only applies to a relatively small pool of people. Most people don&#x27;t really understand HTTP or HTTPS very well. They know it&#x27;s part of the web address, and some know that &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a>&quot; is &quot;secure&quot;, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>I think it makes sense to direct people to the secure version of the site as much as possible, whilst of course providing a mechanism to switch to the HTTP version if necessary.')
