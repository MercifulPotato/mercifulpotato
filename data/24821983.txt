(We have two car seats, one lie-flat and one normal, since we expected to travel more with the baby, we&#x27;re well aware of the issues. Of course COVID put a stop to that plan. The hammock worked well on a whistlestop tour of Germany and Ireland visiting our respective relatives, during the summer COVID lull.)<p>We got the hammock after he would continuously wake up in a bedside cot.<p>Do your own research, of course. I&#x27;m just saying what worked for us. I&#x27;m not invested in selling the product.')
