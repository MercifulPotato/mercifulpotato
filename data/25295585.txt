Pinebook and Raspberry Pi both use no bullshit ARM setups.</i><p>They&#x27;re ARM SoCs, meaning that you can&#x27;t just download the Ubuntu ARM ISO[1] and run it on either device like you could with an x86 ISO and an x86 machine.<p>To run Ubuntu or any Linux distribution, you need to use images that were specially crafted for either SoC.<p>This is because ARM SoCs use custom bootloaders and don&#x27;t have hardware on enumerable buses. Each SoC model is essentially a unique hardware configuration that needs an individual Linux port.<p>ARM servers are more similar to x86 machines in that they use UEFI and have enumerable buses.<p>As long as machines are shipped that use ARM SoCs, Linux support for all of them will be quite difficult to achieve[2] compared to x86 machines.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ubuntu.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;server&#x2F;arm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ubuntu.com&#x2F;download&#x2F;server&#x2F;arm</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elinux.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;a&#x2F;ad&#x2F;Arm-soc-checklist.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elinux.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;a&#x2F;ad&#x2F;Arm-soc-checklist.pdf</a>')
