He was really wowed at first but after using it for a bit he wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the results. Still, for a birder, at $1K coupled with the R5&#x27;s eye autofocus it doesn&#x27;t have any real competitors. Not everyone needs or can pay for the higher end and very heavy lenses. (And, with modern full frame digital cameras, the smaller fixed aperature doesn&#x27;t matter nearly as much.)')
