Sadly this isn&#x27;t an isolated case.<p>Take Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. Both plead guilty and both were somehow granted home detention due to the pandemic<p>What Levandowski did was egregious. You walk out the door of a company. You take nothing. That&#x27;s it. You don&#x27;t own nor are you entitled to any of that work product. It&#x27;s pretty simple.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised to see Peter Thiel on that list. His politics are pretty appealing. I don&#x27;t know most of the other names on that list who supported the pardon but that&#x27;s not a list I&#x27;d want to be associated with, personally.')
