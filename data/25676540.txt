Almost no one uses it in New Zealand for example, but a lot of people use Facebook Messenger but it isn&#x27;t completely dominant like WhatsApp is in some places. I wonder if it ties back to countries that have good value cell phone plans? Even the very cheapest plans here come with unlimited SMS and it&#x27;s been that way since smartphones were first taking off.')
