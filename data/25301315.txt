It’s either because of kickbacks or because it seemed enterprise-y; there’s no rational explanation other than incompetence or corruption. An adequate IT director &#x2F; CTO would be able to make their case for use of better and cheaper ToC of best-of-class open-source solutions.<p>Whether it’s kickbacks or just enjoying bragging about the Ferrari of webscalers we just bought or brandname IAAS we use, it’s wrong.')
