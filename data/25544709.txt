Their lifetime is measured in decades (first in EVs and then in grid-storage) as compared to single-use for gas.<p>2. They (at least the various types of Li-Ion cells) are 100% recyclable. Battery production will probably switch to &quot;urban mining&quot; once enough has been manufactured to supply the global fleet.<p>Tesla recently mentioned during their battery day presentation that they plan to do exactly this. Re-manufacturing batteries will be far cheaper than mining fresh raw materials once enough EoL batteries are available.')
