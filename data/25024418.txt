The &quot;things&quot; on the right are not supposed to be buttons, but  cards that get updated when you add tasks. There is only one button, the last one which says &quot;completed&quot;  which clears out your completed tasks.<p>Can I ask you what I could do to make them NOT look like buttons or what made you think they were buttons? :)')
