In the end, it all is superficial. I haven&#x27;t had a friendship from work that lasted more than 6 months after I quit.  In retrospect, I would have liked all that time chatting back.<p>Outside the office, on the other hand, I definitely miss spontaneous conversation.  In my experience, post corona, it&#x27;s kinda hard to talk to anyone random. Most places where it would be appropriate are operating at a lower capacity, everyone is wearing a mask(making it difficult to read sentiment), and they all just want to get in and get out. It doesn&#x27;t help that at least 20% of people are down right paranoid about getting the virus. I miss those random conversations at the cafe, the gym, the grocery store, the gastropub, etc., because at least they happen in a natural environment and have some potential for actual acquaintance. I know things are opening up very slowly, but it&#x27;s still not the same.<p>Workplace, I can&#x27;t care less. People are more fake at the workplace than in real life.')
