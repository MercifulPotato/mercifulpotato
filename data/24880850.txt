Piotrowska, one of Nym’s main researcher, explained in details what are the privacy properties you need against state level mass surveillance.<p>The importance of this article is to see a privacy project introspectively admitting its current limitation. In Nym’s case, it still doesn’t have hidden service, sender anonymity and receiver anonymity. This is the level of transparency we want to see from any privacy project.<p>Having flaws or limitations are okay, but not communicating them with users while advertising itself as a privacy project is just dishonest. I hope to see more articles like this from other privacy projects.<p>Nym explained its ambition to achieve much stronger privacy properties under much stronger threat model. Until then, they can truly claim to protect privacy against state surveillance.')
