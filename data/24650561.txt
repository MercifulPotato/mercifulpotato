It&#x27;s angled, so the roof is directly above the room (no attic). There&#x27;s also a higher wall whose top portion is presumably adjacent to the attic.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this in California homes, including my own master bedroom. It really heats up during the day, presumably due to heat convection from the roof and attic.')
