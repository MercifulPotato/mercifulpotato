I know for me it is the potatoes, I can easily go through 2 entire potatoes, stuffed with sour cream, chive, shrimp, and cheese. (and I know the shrimp sounds super weird in there, but trust me, try it, it is amazing!)<p>That is 800 calories, and after that I&#x27;m going to wait 15 minutes and resume the rest of my dinner for yet more calories!<p>But if I start with 8oz of steak and some well prepared kale, well, I&#x27;m done for the night. ~700 calories total for the entire meal, rather than starting with 800 and working my way up from there!<p>The thing that changed my mind was realizing that <i>skipping the bread</i> at dinner didn&#x27;t make me any less full.<p>[1] Such unhealthy habits are spreading world wide!')
