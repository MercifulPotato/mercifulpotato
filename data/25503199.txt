When the great grandparent said &quot;Tesla&#x27;s revolution is a more automated assembly&quot;, they were flat wrong which is something Elon himself admitted. Tesla tried to go big on automated assembly and failed.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;elonmusk&#x2F;status&#x2F;984882630947753984" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;elonmusk&#x2F;status&#x2F;984882630947753984</a><p>I have watched most all of Sandy&#x27;s videos; they are orthogonal to assembly automation. The exceptionally impressive things Tesla have done in later revisions of the Model 3&#x2F;Y (particularly the octovalve and the rear body castings) are related to advanced manufacturing methods which reduce part counts. Not factory automation.<p>Sandy is very good at styling himself as a premier industry expertâ€”and he&#x27;s quite likely one of the greatest automotive manufacturing experts on YouTube. But I don&#x27;t think most serious automotive manufacturing experts are spending much time posting on YouTube...')
