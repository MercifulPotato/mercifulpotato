It&#x27;s the realpolitik of 30,000 US troops in Taiwan.<p>Any significant &amp; sustained attack against Taiwan would harm US troops. They&#x27;d be little more than a speedbump for China if China acted quickly &amp; in force, but that speedbump would <i>require</i> a significant-- and perhaps disproportionate-- response from the US.')
