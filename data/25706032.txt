I honestly do not think I am, but let me do a quick DDG to not rely on memory alone:<p>Portland 01&#x2F;02&#x2F;21 - reports of molotov cocktails, fireworks, fires - I don&#x27;t know about you, but use of explosive materials does tend to sound violent. You don&#x27;t really come with a firebomb with no intent to use it.<p>Seatle 07&#x2F;27&#x2F;20 - reports of fires, 59 injured officers<p>Kenosha 08&#x2F;25&#x2F;20 - riots, destruction of property including fires including courthouse, incitement for more violence<p>I don&#x27;t think I have to mention Chicago or NY..<p>And this is just a cursory check.<p>In BLM defense, they initially suffered from the same issues anonymous did. Literally anyone could be their spokesporson so right wing media got lovely quotes about purpose and goals of BLM such as ( some of those come from their official website ):<p>-Destruction comes before rebuilding, that’s what we talking about here\n-“Yes, I think the statues of the white European they claim is Jesus should also come down,” the activist posted via Twitter on Monday. “They are a form of white supremacy. Always have been.”“Tear them down.”\n-We believe and understand that Black people will never achieve liberation under the current global racialized capitalist system. \n-‘we will burn down this system’\n-&#x27;MacCallum asked Newsome what Black Lives Matter hoped to achieve through violence.&quot; “Wow, it’s interesting that you would pose that question like that,” Newsome responded, “because this country is built upon violence. What was the American Revolution? What’s our diplomacy across the globe?”<p>Now you will note that their website is cleaned up and no longer contains notes about - forgot what terminology they used - abandoning existing familial structures and building new utopian world. It is a shame they took it down. It could open some eyes. I guess someone told them they need rebranding.<p>So maybe you are right. They are different after all. BLM is worse that Trump crazies. At least Capitol assholes will be picked up by various agencies and prosecuted. BLM members may have been arrested, but various Dem operatives ensured they are out as soon as possible. Hell, some were raising money for bails.<p>In other words, I do not think you have a clear picture of BLM, who they are, or even what they were doing.<p>So I this my comparison is valid.')
