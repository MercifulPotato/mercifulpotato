Item(by='Wowfunhappy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601654451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24663193, text='&gt; I keep seeing people who argue that TVs would be notably &quot;more expensive&quot; if they didn&#x27;t come with ads.<p>In a competitive market, you can certainly imagine a situation where this would be true. Competition should drive prices as low as they can go, and if manufacturers make money from ads, they can afford to not make a profit off hardware (and maybe even sell it at a loss).<p>In which case, the questions are:<p>1) Is this a trade-off we&#x27;re okay with? (Advertisements and privacy violations in exchange for cheaper televisions.)<p>2) How can we support a business environment that leads to this outcome?<p>We ought to focus on #2 anyway, for all sorts of reasons.<p>For #1, I think it&#x27;s fairly easy to say &quot;no, everyone should have a guaranteed right to privacy&quot;, but as a fairly well-off person, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m comfortable making that decision for everyone else.')
