You may get 1% as an early engineer or 3% as an early executive for example.<p>- The investor owning 10% of the company means that they think the company is worth $1,000,000 right now. ($100,000 x 10)<p>- The 4yr vesting with 1 year cliff means the Op gets 1&#x2F;48th ownership of the company every month over the course of 4 years. BUT BUT BUT they only get the first 1&#x2F;4 (12&#x2F;48th) until they have been at the company for at least 1 year. If the Op leave before 1 year, they get nothing.')
