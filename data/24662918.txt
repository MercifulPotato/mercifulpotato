Everyone should have a place to live. I&#x27;m interested in exploring the hypothetical, when you say:<p>&gt; keep person homeless because nobody will want to rent a flat because someone&#x27;s kids stained the walls in the rented apartment.<p>If Evan&#x27;s kids stain the wall, then Evan&#x27;s kids are more likely to stain the wall. Currently, the expectation of someone being more likely to stain the walls is &quot;priced in&quot; to the rental prices everywhere. People who don&#x27;t stain walls pay a little more, and people whose kids stain the wall cost their owners a little more, but on average it comes out (hope you can own a lot of domiciles).<p>If we start to be able to measure this, doesn&#x27;t this mean we can more accurately price it? People less likely will pay less, and people more likely will pay more. I think you&#x27;re suggesting that &quot;Owners will just use the likelihood of damages as a threshold, and if you&#x27;re 0.01 above the Unsafe&#x2F;Volatile threshold you&#x27;ll not be rented to at all&quot;, but that leaves a pretty big hole in the market. If there&#x27;s not enough supply, then people are being kicked out instead of Evan _now_, and if there is enough supply, then you&#x27;d rather rent to Evan at higher rates to cover your risks than to not rent at all, right?<p>The current situation kinda feels like an &quot;insurance&quot; thing, with pooled risk.')
