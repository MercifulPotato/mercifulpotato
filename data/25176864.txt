The information asymmetry is off the charts, and a rational &quot;analyst&#x2F;reader&quot; (the role you want to play) of geopolitics should be aware of this fact, and its implications. You simply have no idea what is really going on. You don&#x27;t have the data and it is naive to assume what is printed in a handful of outlets by an equally limited number of promoted authors are the &quot;geopolitical facts&quot;.<p>So, yes geopolitics certainly &quot;matter&quot; but that was not the point.')
