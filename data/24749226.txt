It’s fine until it’s not. And in many cases you’re proper fucked. There’s very little in between.<p>Until that moment, many people see any precautions as unnecessary, boring, patronising, paranoid, and so on. Be that because they are reckless, clueless, or both.<p>And once people do die, everybody is up in arms about the authorities not doing anything, the victims being at fault, why didn’t we do intervene, it would have been so easy. And so on.<p>There has to be a name for auch a thing.<p>So as someone who knows about avalanches, it is frustrating to see careless attitudes towards covid.')
