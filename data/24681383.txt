Decided to go all in on AirPlay 2.<p>JBL Link Music devices are about $70 right now and support AirPlay 2 only operation with no need for another app, just the built-in Home app. I picked up 3 locally from Home Depot and I’m happy with ‘em. They also have 5 GHz Wi-Fi and the connection a bit better than the 2.4 GHz AirPort Express when far away from my AP.<p>And if you already use Google Home, these work with it too with Chromecast built-in, but it’s optional. I just kept them AirPlay 2 only.<p>I also use hard wired Ethernet on AirPort Express devices as AirPlay 2 receivers. They all mix together nicely. Planning to add wired outdoor speakers with a spare one.')
