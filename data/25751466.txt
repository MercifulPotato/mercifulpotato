It&#x27;s entirely possible that the problem is due to incompatibities with new OS code or bugs in the firewall program (edit: ie, your case a and case b), but evidence in the bug report pretty clearly suggests that the firewall is correctly blocking all non-whitelisted network requests, and the failure to log in is due to the OS maliciously trying to phone home against the user&#x27;s wishes.')
