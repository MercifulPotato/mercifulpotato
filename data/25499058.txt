The JS solution is shorter, faster, and easier to understand.\nI&#x27;m thankfull for the insights into reality and programming clojure has provided, but highly optimised clojure is neither idiomatic nor pretty, you end up with eductions everywhere.\nCombine that with reaaaallllyy bad debuggability with all those nested inside out transducer calls (the stack traces have also gotten worse over the years, I don&#x27;t know why, and a splintered ecosystem (lein, boot, clj-tools)) I&#x27;d pick rust and deno&#x2F;js any day for a greenfield project over clojure. sadly.')
