Google was a heavy user of Python from the start. Python seriously sucked for scientific computing in 2005. I was looking for a new language (the old one wasn&#x27;t cutting it) and I&#x27;d been looking for a use for Python for years. It had some projects but it just was not in a useful state so I went with R, which was quite mature by that time, and it focused on statistical analysis. Years later Python became popular for scientific computing, likely due to the userbase it had built up in other areas.')
