Done your tax paperwork in reasonable time? Your name is guaranteed by law to keep working for another year. Maybe 1480219643.ny.citizen-names.us is <i>ugly</i> but it&#x27;d satisfy this problem for individuals. Maybe they could bolt on a checkbox, $50 extra to the IRS and you get to pick any as-yet unreserved legal name, or they have rules like for license plates.')
