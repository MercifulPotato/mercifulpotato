They do their jobs very well, and as WSL emulating Linux proves they are near interchangeable.  I have no doubt Linux could emulate the Windows kernel near perfectly too if we had the Windows source to see what is required.  When you&#x27;ve already go a slew of interchangeable parts, we create another one?<p>If something new is to displace them, it&#x27;s going to have to do something very different.  The only thing I can see is not a replacement, but a security kernel that allows us to establish a trust chain from the hardware to some application.  It wasn&#x27;t necessary when the hardware sits on your lap or desk, but now we are tending to rent out CPU cycles from some machine on the other side of the planet and yet still want to have some assurance of privacy, they are becoming kinda essential.  There are a number of proprietary ones out there now, but I think that&#x27;s doomed to fail.  No one in the right mind would put their faith in a binary that could be in cahoots with anybody, from the USA government to a ransomware gang.')
