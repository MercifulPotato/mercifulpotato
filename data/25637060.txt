There is a metric asston of mining hardware out there that needs to be running to secure the chain -- presumably all coming from transaction fees.<p>Not only to transaction fees have to scale to cover the entirety of block rewards but they must continue to grow over time to compete with increased hardware efficiency in hashing.<p>Does it not follow that:<p>a) transaction fees rise to recoup not only current cost of mining hardware, but R&amp;D and deployment of new hardware over time to keep the chain secure.  As people realize this they convert their bitcoin to something else to avoid bag holding.<p>OR<p>b) transaction fees cannot support the mining hardware as is, miners sell of their hardware to recoup their costs and the chain becomes vulnerable.<p>I confess I might be missing something but I don&#x27;t see how a fully mined coin is stable.')
