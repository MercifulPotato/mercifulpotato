Too many engineers spend too much time arguing on a hacker news that their way is the One True Way (Trademark) - that is not always the case. <i>Your business needs should drive your tech stack choice, and no one tool is perfect.</i><p>So if, like in your example, your use case involves a lot of data processing in the back end, then the choice is easy: favor building the custom server and associated data processing  yourself, over using a BaaS or FaaS. However, if you are building a CRUD app where you have like less than 1,000 people using your app, you&#x27;re time constrained, you don&#x27;t have enough devs, then Baas&#x2F;FaaS starts to become a more viable option.')
