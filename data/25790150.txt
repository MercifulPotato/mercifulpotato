The tarballs even extracted fine and at first glance the directory structure and file lengths were ok.<p>Trouble is a bug in the file system meant that somehow the files had been overwritten with nulls.<p>The program continued to run, as it sat in memory. Until one day the box was rebooted (power test or something). It didn&#x27;t come back. The files were great, containing multiple files all of the right looking length. Everything was null. &quot;main.c&quot; or whatever it was was 8 kilobytes of null characters.<p>This had been happening for some months so even the oldest source backups were wiped, and the actual binaries were out too. The system was called ELVIS, which made for a great status report.<p>As it was on an ancient irix machine and he was rewriting in PHP at the time he just accelerated that and we were back up in a few days (the program was a front end to a database and file stores on other machines, so it was just the web part)')
