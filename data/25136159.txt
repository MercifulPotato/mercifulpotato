The US just elected the oldest President ever, who has spent decades in government.<p>Honestly confused by Americans pretending they have anything that different to what the Chinese do. Bushes, Clintons, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve all harked back to royal lines while pretending it&#x27;s something else.<p>It&#x27;s truly terrifying that democracies are electing older and older people across the board, they simply aren&#x27;t capable of doing the job, everyone I know over 60 has highly diminished mental capacities and if not retired they should be relegated to menial tasks.<p>I know it&#x27;s a harsh thing to say and I&#x27;m truly sorry to people of said demographic reading this stuff but it&#x27;s a cold hard fact easily backed up by decades of science.<p>Elderly people are the most dangerous politicians on the planet.')
