Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604533693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993554, text='&gt; Do you have any examples of contemporary issues where an infusion of information has triggered a successful policy reassement and compromise? If not an active success then some areas where it&#x27;s possible?<p>At a group level?  No.  At an individual level?  Yes.  The problems are presented by the nature of the groups competing for mindshare, and I don&#x27;t know a good solution for that.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that we can&#x27;t have substantive and productive conversations as individuals though, which is what I&#x27;m talking about here.  It&#x27;s important to accept that the other party may have data you haven&#x27;t considered yourself though.  This isn&#x27;t a  call to &quot;show them why they&#x27;re wrong&quot; as much as a note that actual discussion requires an exchange of ideas and data and an acceptance that there may be things you don&#x27;t know that can change your own mind as much as the mind of others.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d love to believe this but years of following local, state and federal politics have disabused me of this notion. Especially watching the Obama administration try that approach over and over unsuccessfully.<p>I agree.  It&#x27;s a hard problem when scaled up.  When scaled down though, I think it&#x27;s still tractable.')
