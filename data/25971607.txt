What you are saying is, on paper, true I guess. The actual situation of me and all my Volt friends is that the cars are VERY reliable. I have 128K miles (105K EV miles) so my engine has only 22K miles after 7 years. Besides  tires, ONE oil change and a front-end CV issue -- I&#x27;ve spent zero on maintenance.<p>FWIW, my next car will be a Model Y.')
