Think of it as &#x27;setting project parameters&#x27;. The team will fill in the blanks.<p>At 20, there&#x27;s nothing you can do but trust them. You don&#x27;t have the experience to know when&#x2F;if they are screwing you over. You definitely won&#x27;t know if they are not even aware themselves.<p>A cynical manager might assume nefarious&#x2F;lazy when none is there. A too easy-going manager might get walked over.<p>But with 6 months experience the only thing you can do is trust them to do their jobs.<p>Basically frame the job as &#x27;helping them do their jobs&#x27;.')
