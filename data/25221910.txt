We&#x27;re actively working on this at Sourcegraph. Up until recently, we&#x27;ve focused on working well on large private codebases, but looking forward, we have two big efforts that will make this a reality on sourcegraph.com:<p>1. Vastly expanding the size of our global search index to cover every public repository on github.com, gitlab.com, and bitbucket.org.\n2. Enabling LSIF indexing (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsif.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lsif.dev</a>) in every major language for compiler-accurate code navigation (go-to-def, find-refs) across repository&#x2F;dependency boundaries.<p>The latter is already working on a subset of languages for private Sourcegraph instances, and we want to scale it to the entire open-source world. We think a single search box that covers all the visible code in the world and allows you to seamlessly walk the reference graph is super super powerful and someday will be a thing that most developers use every day.')
