Obnoxious users were always a problem, but before centralized OSS warehouses at least they had to go to the project&#x27;s web site and mailing list.<p>Where they&#x27;d be told to get lost if they misbehaved.<p>With GitHub, the branding of products is lost and most credit goes to GitHub. If a user isn&#x27;t satisfied, he does the proverbial left-swipe and goes to the next project in a second.<p>If you tell a user to get lost, you violate the tenets of the new corporate sponsored cultural revolution: Newcomers are always right.<p>The last 10 years have been a coordinated attack on OSS to make developers obedient and silent cogs. It works, because at present they are showered with money in return.<p>Will it continue to work in 5 or 10 years?')
