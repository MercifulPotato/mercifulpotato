Let&#x27;s see...<p>Does this example of a bad government regulation come from the government? Or the people voting and demanding it from the government?<p>No, it comes from business. DMCA is an example of the badness of private business if allowed to do what it wants.<p>That was a purchased law. The failure on the governments part was in allowing itself to be for sale.<p>So you are right, even though I bet this is just about the opposite of the conclusion you thought citing the DMCA resolves out to, we should definitely stop allowing the government to be influenced by the private sector.')
