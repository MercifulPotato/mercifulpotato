I want exactly what I see there, but with a premium camera and maybe a better SoC. I&#x27;m not looking for a cheap budget phone, but for that form factor and I&#x27;d pay for it. I&#x27;d have a hard time giving up my Pixel 3&#x27;s camera, it&#x27;d be odd to have to start carrying around a separate camera.<p>Kinda reminds me of my first gen Palm Pre.  Loved that phone.')
