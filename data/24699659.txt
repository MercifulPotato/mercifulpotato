UNNEST works a bit funky, and in particular it works super funky if you have multiple calls in the same select statement (or any set expanded function calls it turns out).  There&#x27;s a bit of a dive into here[1] (though that is out of date - PG10 no longer follows the different array sized result, it uses null filling) which I managed to find after struggling with an issue where an experimental query was resulting in nulls in the output while unnesting arrays without nulls.<p>All DBs have their warts and while MySQL has an over abundance of warts they tend to be quite well documented.  The warts that postgres has tend to be quite buried and their documentation is very good for syntax comprehension but rather light when it comes to deeper learning.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;50364475&#x2F;how-to-force-postgresql-cartesian-product-behavior-when-unnesting-multiple-ar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;50364475&#x2F;how-to-force-po...</a>')
