We think of space being three dimensions but really it’s only one - velocity relative to a specific reference frame. Thinking of it this way, the word “spacetime” makes sense; it’s a two-dimensional system: “spatial velocity” (S) on one axis and “temporal velocity” (T) on another. Both velocities are always measured against a reference frame, and their sum is c (c=S+T).<p>This would mean that time travel is impossible not because of a “speed limit”, but because c is a dimensionless physical constant.')
