Item(by='LatteLazy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609277389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575245, text='&gt;Since the Impossible Burger is not a veggie burger, the scientists had to make the patty in the lab using neuroscience. After breaking down a beef patty molecule by molecule, they discovered that what makes meat “meat” is a molecule called Heme. Heme, an essential molecule containing iron and found in all living things, creates the burger flavor and color. Fortunately, it can also be found in plants, albeit in much lower concentrations.<p>So many many incorrect things in this paragraph. Wtf?<p>Still, good luck to Impossible Foods.')
