And you wouldn&#x27;t even have to do it live in-memory, just disassemble the program piecewise from disk. People did extraordinary things back then, and you vastly underestimate their capabilities. Sure, you had to write a lot of tooling yourself, but it was simpler times.<p>I am not trying to detract from the copy protection mechanism, which truly is ingenious. I was just genuinely curious whether I was misunderstanding anything from the article.')
