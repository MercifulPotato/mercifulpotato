I am trying to understand some key concepts here, so please forgive the simple questions:<p>&gt; 16byte subject&#x2F;entity | 16 byte predicate&#x2F;attribute | 32 byte object&#x2F;value<p>What would be a difference between subject and entity? Do you include a timestamp of your entries next to your trible?<p>&gt; Having a fixed size binary representation makes this compatible with most existing databases (...)<p>Are you using a external look up table to identify the human language definition of the entry, and keep using the 2^128 possible entries for internal use?<p>&gt; (...) if you want to upgrade your schema (...)<p>&gt; We stole the context from jsonLD (...)<p>What were the reasons you did not use jsonLD as a base for your software?<p>Could you point perhaps point me to a case study of your system, or, if this is not possible, a similar case published in literature&#x2F;www etc? I would love to learn more what you are doing (my contact is in the my profile).<p>Wish I could upvote you a couple of times. Thank you.')
