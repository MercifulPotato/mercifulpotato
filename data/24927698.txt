If it&#x27;s fake it&#x27;s obviously not done for profit. I&#x27;m referring to actual ransomware that works, that&#x27;s done for profit.<p>&gt; On a more theoretical level, it&#x27;s certainly possible to do both at the same time, two birds with one stone.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how well that would work. Ransomware generally has responsive and helpful support people, because without that it will be hard to convince victims to pay. If they spend their time instilling fear instead of confidence in the payment process, then no one will pay.')
