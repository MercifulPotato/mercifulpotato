Having traveled in many balkan countries that try to be in the EU, serbia felt like a place that doesn&#x27;t really try too hard.<p>Because it spent 2 decades trying, while not being taken seriously, and is now tired? Turkey is now in the same bag.<p>I think at some point it was as close to starting an accession roadmap plan as ironing out some agricultural subsidies, and &quot;WaReZ in Belgrade.&quot; It amazes me how EU let them slip out of their hands over being &quot;deliriously pedantic.&quot;')
