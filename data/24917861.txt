Yeah it&#x27;s gone now. The estate of $ARTIST doesn&#x27;t want it available on $SERVICE_A now that $SERVICE_B is offering a better deal. Oh, and $SERVICE_B isn&#x27;t available in $COUNTRY of course, but someone could buy the rights for it there and publish the music, someday, or never, we don&#x27;t care.<p>I don&#x27;t get it either, and yet these services are massively popular to the point of alternatives going away. Meanwhile I have tons of music on my laptop, desktop, and HTPC, and can play it as long as there isn&#x27;t a power outage.<p>Streaming is great for things I know I want to watch once (e.g. TV series) and don&#x27;t care if I can&#x27;t rewatch it tomorrow. For music? Nope.')
