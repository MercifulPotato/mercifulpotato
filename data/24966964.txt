Some custom-made tracks also made the game glitch by only showing some obstacles once you were basically one grid coordinate away (e.g. slalom obstacle would be invisible just until the moment you are about to hit it...). Fun times!<p>Edit: Also took me YEARS to figure out that you could edit your own terrain with Shift+F1!')
