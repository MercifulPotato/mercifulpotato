Not that it matters, but in the scene Iron Man brushed Elon off -- He was &quot;politely rude&quot;, and the scene (while serving as an ad for Elon) served the film by giving cred to Stark by having Elon fawn over him.<p>More importantly though, treating someone &quot;as a peer&quot; is kinda a weird criticism? Superheros on TV these days don&#x27;t seem terribly stuck-up. When other characters in the films seem honest the heroes usually treat them with respect and dignity.<p>Anyway, thanks for the heads-up that you hate superhero movies, will keep it in mind next time I see one on a plane.')
