Just yesterday I saw what looked like a very useful tool whose install instructions were &quot;npm install -g &lt;thing&gt;&quot; and I felt a little pang of &quot;ugh&quot; but went ahead and did it anyway.  Never got the thing running but did get a nice error message that said &quot;Electron failed to install correctly, please delete node_modules&#x2F;electron and try installing again.&quot;  I actually said out loud, &quot;why the hell does this tool use <i>electron</i>?!&quot; and gave up.')
