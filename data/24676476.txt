It&#x27;s designed to be written&#x2F;read by machines. It&#x27;s convenience for humans is that it can be relatively easily be read or written by humans as well.<p>Protobufs is similarly a serialization protocol combined with an RPC layer for server and client stubs. Its canonical serialization format is binary.<p>Neither are particularly well suited for human written configuration files. A &quot;JSON without the quotes around keys and allowing Javascript comments and commas at the end of objects or lists and a mechanism to escape multi-line strings&quot; would probably cover most of the required cases.<p>YAML is an attempt at that, but also attempts to solve a bunch of other problems in a complicated and fault-inducing way (eg, relying on indentation for hierarchy).')
