In fact, in many cases, when asked, the lawyers explicitly denied that they were fraud cases. So if the evidence was so strong, why wasn&#x27;t it presented to the court? Your 2cd best bet is to blame incompetent lawyers, but my money is on the crappy quality of the so-called evidence. Like where they said Michigan counties over-counted but they counties were actually in Minnesota.')
