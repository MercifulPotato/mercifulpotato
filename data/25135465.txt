I also argue that this extra safety can bring more than Rust is capable of providing. Now, what&#x27;s the technical merit of Rust that justifies spending time learning it when the same time can be spent on bringing ATS into the same codebase&#x2F;toolchain one function at a time?<p>What&#x27;s the point of waiting for 1.0.0? It&#x27;s just a tag that doesn&#x27;t save you from bugs and breaking changes.<p>What is industry support? What does it have to do with a team where everyone can read the documentation of the tool that is already built on top of a mature GCC ecosystem and that adheres existing approaches to debugging, profiling, releasing and maintaining C codebases?<p>&gt; and doesn&#x27;t use a modern build system or package<p>Why do I need a separate solution such as Cargo if I can build, package, and distribute everything with Nix and get reproducibility, distributed builds, transparent caching, and environment isolation along the way for free?')
