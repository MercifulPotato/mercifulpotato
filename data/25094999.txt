Registering with email is not usually an SSO. Authentication is using password and email is used only for recovery. Your won&#x27;t get locked out of other services even if email server fails for some reason.<p>2. Hosting providers usually engage customers much better than ad and social media companies. Chances of getting your service back up with customer support assistance is much better.<p>3. In case the hosting provider locks you out without recourse, you can always move to another provider and point your DNS records there. For this, it&#x27;s better to have a different company as registrar and hosting provider.<p>4. DNS so far is the least affected&#x2F;abused online resource. The chances of you getting locked out of your domain name is low, unless you fail to renew. They give sufficient warning as well. Let&#x27;s take advantage of that until companies decide to wreck that.<p>&gt; There should be a better and more resilient way to identify people online in 2020!<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an accident.
