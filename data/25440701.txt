But my problem is, the only time a client is smart and and to just ask for whatever they want us if I&#x27;m building an admin application, otherwise, all sorts of access control needs to be added to various levels of most queries, something I&#x27;ve never felt as though GraphQL handles well.<p>Then there&#x27;s the performance stuff, hitting caches or doing joins, it&#x27;s much harder to make a GraphQL backend know when it can do these things, short of simple cache lookups by very limited keys.<p>With REST, I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle. I&#x27;m saying, okay, these are the resources, and these are the actions. You might get a little more or a little less data than you wanted with your response, but I know exactly what you&#x27;re getting, can optimize it, and test the shit out of it.<p>I&#x27;m by no means resistant to new technology, I have just never worked on a project that avoided these pitfalls.')
