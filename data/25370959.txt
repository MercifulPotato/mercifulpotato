Indigenous people in North America weren&#x27;t just colonized, their cultures were systematically destroyed. Children were taken away on steamboats to boarding schools, forced into Christianity and beaten if they spoke their native languages. Now the languages are all almost completely dead and the cultures have suffered greatly. It was the explicit goal of the white governments to wipe out native cultures and forcibly assimilate them.<p>Decolonization is about recovering from that, not about eschewing cars for canoes.')
