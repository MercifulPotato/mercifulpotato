The GPU can&#x27;t keep those ops active - \nparticularly during inference when most of the data is fresh so caches don&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s the roofline model.<p>In my experience FPGA&gt;GPU for inference, if you have people who can implement good FPGA designs. And inference is more common than training. Much of this is due to explicit memory management and more memory on FPGA.')
