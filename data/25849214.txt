It does seem to be a double standard in allowing it for months in 2020 only to condemn it when the same tactics are used on 1&#x2F;6.  Violence and lawlessness isn&#x27;t acceptable...unless you claim your voices are being ignored and your rights trampled upon...that was the message we have seen since May of last year.<p>Take political sides out of the equation...and none of the events like this that have transpired in the last year are acceptable.')
