SeeLink makes your links sharable, searchable, and easily readable (as it displays each link in the form of a card with a title, description, and image). It also allows you to write text around the links using a tag, and has a ton of link specific features that make it easier to share links. These include creating specific boards through which you can add specific links to share with specific people. I think these are the main advantages that SeeLink has over something like Google Docs. Let me know if you have any further questions!')
