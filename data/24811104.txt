They originally wanted people to learn logic by learning Loglan, but today the speakers of Lojban and Toaq are usually either fluent or logical but not both.<p>The weakest forms of Sapir-Whorf are obviously true, via Zipf&#x27;s law; being able to shorten long phrases into short nonce words allows for faster communication, which allows for normalization of concepts, in a positive feedback loop. In English, for example, it&#x27;s no accident that the shortest two words are &quot;a&quot; and &quot;I&quot; and that they are also the most two common ways to refer to things; &quot;u&quot; is on the way there, too!')
