If it is included, what is the least impactful design?<p>Overflow is part of the result, so maybe include extra bits to each register that can be arithmetic destination.  These bits are not included in moves, but could be tested with new instructions.<p>Another way that avoids flags is new arithmetic instructions: add but jump on overflow.  Maybe this is reduced to add and skip next instruction except for overflow, but maybe things are simplified if the only allowed next instruction is a jump, so the result is a single longer instruction.')
