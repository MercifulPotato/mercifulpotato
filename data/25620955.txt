And then again, K&amp;R&#x27;s definitely not a half hour read.<p>Zig&#x27;s std lib documentation will keep getting better. In the meantime, the std lib code itself is so well written, it&#x27;s worth a read, even coming from another language, and even if you have no intention to learn Zig. I found it easy to read and was impressed by the code structure and quality of the design.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s not to suggest that code is documentation, but I&#x27;ve learned alot about improving my programming in general, just by reading Zig&#x27;s std lib.')
