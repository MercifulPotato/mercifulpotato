They are the monsters here. They are the ones invading capitols. They are the ones emboldening white supremacists, racists and fascists. They are the one demanding to overturn the legitimate outcome of a democratic election.<p>It&#x27;s an insult to the millions and millions who died during WWII to corrupt the message behind this famous poem&#x2F;statement and insinuate that Trump and his supporters are the victims here. They are not the victims. They are the problem. And they need to be crushed.')
