What we perceive as “meaningful” is shaped by our biological and cultural evolution, a byproduct if you will. “Meaningfulness” is not something that exists out there, outside of our minds. When we see meaning, that’s a perspective we project on things, or a relation we have with things. It’s not a property of the things by themselves. We do crave meaning, and thus we have to come up with meaning for ourselves. Maybe it helps to realize that meaning is just something we create in our minds.')
