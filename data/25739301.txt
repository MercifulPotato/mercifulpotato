For example, Oregon banned many single use plastic shopping bags. They went away briefly; however, a workaround has been found by stores. They are now using much heavier plastic bags and calling them &quot;reusable&quot;. But most people seem to just treat them like the old disposable ones. So a well intentioned, but heavy handed law has put us a step back. We are now using more plastic per bag... The market is very creative, and bans must be made carefully to avoid making a situation worse.')
