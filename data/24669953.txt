These days though, most manuals are on CD, with tiny 20 language install manuals... so that differentiation is gone.<p>What I find often happening, is that each large store, BestBuy&#x2F;Walmart&#x2F;whatever asks for, and receives, unique model numbers so you cannot price match easily.<p>There are still models which are generic, but those are used by smaller corps, which cannot negotiate en-masse, and therefore are unable to shrug of price-matching.<p>Stuff like this burns me up.  &quot;We price match!&quot;, then &quot;Quick Bob, get on the phone to LG!  We want unique models for their product line!&quot;')
