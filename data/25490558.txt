But as I said, no one is really worried about the asymptotic time complexity of reverse mode differentiation, although there is scope for improving constants).  The main scope for improvement is in the space complexity.<p>There is a lot of work on trying to speed up optimization, for example the K-FAC optimizer by Roger Grosse that uses second-order gradient information in a scalable way.<p>The lottery ticket pruning strategies do reduce space complexity, but I think the main reason people are interested in it is to reduce training time complexity, or deployment memory requirements, but not so much training memory requirements.<p>As for whether memory-saving and time-saving approaches are disjoint, many methods (like checkpointing) introduce a tradeoff between time and space complexity, so no.')
