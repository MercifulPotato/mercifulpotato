The pope, he said, was refusing to pressure the state to adopt a policy in line with church dogma (i.e. opposed to tacit approval of homosexuality by the state). This as though the Pope were embracing the separation of Church and State.<p>My point is, the Pope has a history of pressuring the state to support his religious&#x2F;moral agenda (re: poverty) and has even gone beyond that to pressure the state on points outside of church dogma (re: his statements on wealth inequality and tax cuts). With that in mind, it seems odd that the Pope, who presumably believes in the infallibility of scripture[0], would feel that it was somehow wrong to pressure the state to support his moral agenda on the (alleged) sin of homosexuality (by opposing civil unions).<p>It makes perfect sense from a humanist perspective, but from the Pope it seems arbitrary and internally incoherent.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uscatholic.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;201611&#x2F;is-the-bible-infallible&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uscatholic.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;201611&#x2F;is-the-bible-infallib...</a>')
