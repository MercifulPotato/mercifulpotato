The San Diego light rail got extended out to UCSD.<p>10. Pho came to 29 Palms (although the loss of Palm Kebab is deeply mourned).<p>11. Here&#x27;s an extra one just for fun, Mira Mesa got an 85 Degrees. <i>Hello</i> sea salt coffee.<p>12. Oh, here&#x27;s another one.

The cops stopped hassling people over doing the Carrizo Canyon hike (to the largest wooden railroad trestle in the world) in Anza Borrego from Carrizo Gorge Road (the coolest route) along the railroad tracks. (If you do it, do yourself a favor and round the day off with a visit to the Arroyo Tapiado mud caves)<p>Cool California stuff from a Californian who spends their time doing cool California stuff instead of sitting around getting bummed out about statistics.
