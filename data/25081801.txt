I&#x27;d need to work as a contractor because I am living in South America and all the interested companies are from the US.<p>The things is, being a contractor means that the company can no longer need my services whenever they want and that&#x27;s the reason I&#x27;ve been having troubles deciding to follow this path or not.<p>I&#x27;m in a good position right now and I&#x27;ll need to leave a secure job plus some clients in order to start on the new job.<p>I consider myself a good professional but it&#x27;s difficult to know beforehand what level of output will the new company require. I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be up for the task and they will end the contract a month or two after starting.<p>Do you have any experiencies related to this? Am I being too dramatic? Is there a way to better approach this?')
