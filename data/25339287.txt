Telework has yet to prove as collaboration-friendly as face-to-face and water-cooler talk. I&#x27;m not sure cost of living alone can counter that advantage. Any other city that &quot;collects&quot; enough techies to do the same will start to have cost of living problems of its own.<p>Plus, SV is used to &quot;foreigners&quot; and oddballs. Many other cities are not. As soon as you leave downtown, tradition-based evangelical influences take over. Rural areas are going to be that way no matter where you are in the US, but the intensity is generally more gradual in CA.')
