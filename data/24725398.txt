It took a few years to realize that the African American students who would have fit in perfectly in my classes all went to a higher ranked school, and my school had to reach down to &quot;meet their numbers&quot;.<p>The students who get bumped up to a better school (and graduate) end up getting better paying jobs, but it must cause a lot of people to form negative stereotypes along the way.<p>Maybe a better solution would be to provide extra help to disadvantaged groups before students are academically segregated.')
