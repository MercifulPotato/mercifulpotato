I don&#x27;t belive that&#x27;s the case.<p>We&#x27;re learning to deal with new forms of propaganda the same way we dealt with the old ones. I remember when people were talking about the information overload of the early days of the internet as driving people insane. Or people who complained about TV advertising being a form of mind control.<p>People that can&#x27;t cope will either succumb to the will of others or retreat but that doesn&#x27;t mean the rest of us shouldn&#x27;t keep using these tools to our advantage.<p>&gt; Yes. Politicians. They also do actual political work.<p>Isn&#x27;t it clear that renaming post-offices a few months before they&#x27;re defunded qualifies as actual political work or filling stadiums of people to give them a rock concert version of the political experience or hosting twitch streams of a co-op video game to an audience of 500k people? You might consider grilling social media companies for not doing enough to promote for their party&#x27;s interests &quot;political work&quot; but when it&#x27;s done in a chamber dedicated to governing through legislation and comes of as whining or yet another attempt at pandering it misses any loftier goals you&#x27;re implying might exist.')
