Namely a separate develop and master.<p>This statement is simply wrong and ignorant.<p>The reason why mainline and develop branches exist is due to the fact that production-ready code and unstable code are not the same ops-wise.<p>Nowadays, with the dissemination of CICD practices, that difference has been shifted away from the source code repository and into the Delivery&#x2F;Deployment phase of a CICD pipeline.  Yet, the overall principle is the same, and arguably its still here.  Calling those differences &quot;redundant and for no reason&quot; is just ignorant at multiple levels, from software engineering to the fact that the sofware lifecycle process for commercial software projects, the kind that had to &quot;go gold&quot;, had very specific requirements.')
