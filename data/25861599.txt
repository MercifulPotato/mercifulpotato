I mean you can’t pretend away one Chile of electricity use to play multiplayer excel.<p>It&#x27;s horribly wasteful now.  As the block reward decays it may transition to being less wasteful; it depends on how high transaction fees rise.  Last time I tried to work it out the total electrical+transaction fee cost of bitcoin compared to spend volume (not including obvious change to self) was at about 1%.  Almost comparable to current credit&#x2F;debit network overhead, probably a lot more expensive than interbank transfer.')
