Several years back, I noticed a very large price hike in dry ice, as well as a drop in availability (less available in my city, vanishing from small towns).  I was told by someone in my supply chain that federal regulations around dry ice had changed, resulting in only a few players being left in the game and of course the price going up.<p>I wonder if now, a decade or so later, the law of unindented consequences has reared its often invisible head.')
