I am not a web programmer by trade, but I can always get busy with jQuery and just a couple of Google searches.<p>Last weekend I was trying to find new car dealerships in my region that carried a particular model of car that I&#x27;m interested in. They had a dealer search page that could return all dealerships within 250 miles, and they had an inventory search page that had hardcoded the 3 nearest dealership IDs into the URL. But they had no GUI to search all the cars for all the dealers in my region.<p>I poked around at the elements on the dealership search page, cobbled together a jQuery one-liner to dump all the dealership IDs in my region, and pasted those into the URL to finally see every individual car in my region of the model I wanted. The page took quite a while to load, so probably have have some DoS vulnerabilities to deal with, but at least I was happy.<p>Vanilla javascript would have been so much more cumbersome!')
