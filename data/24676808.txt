No idea why, but around 11 pm it turns on. I wake up early for work, but still, if I’m trying to do something, I can focus so easily at that time. At 2-3 am I have to force myself to go to bed cause I know I need to wake up early. No matter what I try during the day, nothing compares except the rare cases when something in prod is broken and everything is urgent. Maybe try just listening to your body instead of tricking it')
