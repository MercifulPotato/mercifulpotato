Yet there is an alternate medication (C) for one of them (B) that can be given 3 times per day, which reduces blood level fluctuations resulting in better symptom management. She told me that they don&#x27;t usually prescribe that one because they don&#x27;t trust the parents of their patients to correctly administer one drug only twice per day (A) when giving the other drug (C) 3 times (they are worried about overdoses of the twice daily medication A).')
