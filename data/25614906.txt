I get that confluence is supposed to be for everybody, not just programmers, but there are plenty of great WYSIWYG implementations that use markdown under the hood (and make that accessible).  If I could clone the underlying git repo (or an abstraction or something) like Gollum allows, I&#x27;d advocate for confluence everywhere.  As it stands now I advocate for either markdown&#x2F;asciidoc in the code, or gitlab wiki (which allows doing that).')
