As far as I can tell, AMP does three things:<p>1. It enforces some good practices &#x2F; forbids certain expensive browser features.<p>2. It lazily loads images only when they are scrolled in.<p>3. It fucks up scroll-to-top and other scrolling behavior on iOS.<p>The first you can do with or without AMP.<p>The second doesn&#x27;t cause anything above the fold to load any faster. If anything, you get an additional delay until content shows up when scrolling, because the browser was prevented from continuing to download the other images in the background.<p>The third regularly causes me to be done with a site in just a few seconds, which I guess is an optimization of some kind.')
