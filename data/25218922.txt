To accommodate the x% of people who seem to get confused in some manner when presented with &quot;too many choices&quot;.</i><p>FWIW, this is done to accommodate SSO (single sign-on), which matters for any software that&#x27;s going to be used in corporate or governmental environments. You have to submit your login first, because it&#x27;s used to determine what authentication method and provider to select.<p>That said, I hate this flow too, and there must be a better way. It also doesn&#x27;t excuse products that do not support SSO that still implement such split flow anyway.')
