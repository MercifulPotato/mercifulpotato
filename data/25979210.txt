I had a client make an RFP based on my company&#x27;s service specs.  The entire intent (stated behind the scenes) was to have us get the work.  We&#x27;d already done other work - they wanted to keep us involved for the next phase of work.  We lost to someone local.  They charged basically the same as we did, but they were local so didn&#x27;t have to include travel costs, so they &#x27;won&#x27;.  The client lost out because there was no consideration for continuation of knowledge&#x2F;experience - we&#x27;d done an initial training course for them - our teams knew each other and had done some informal prototyping already while on site.  But... &quot;the other bid was lower&quot;.')
