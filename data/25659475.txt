The biggest problem with exposing anything to the current web is complete exposure to anonymous strangers (loss of privacy) and all the security implications that come with that.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way.  The crux of the web is HTTP, which exposes a pseudo-anonymous session-less client-server model.  I am working on an application that inverts HTTP to a non-anonymous session-oriented server-client model exposing a GUI in the browser.<p>The goal isn&#x27;t privacy, but exposing new capabilities that only make sense in a private environment.  There are numerous things people are willing to do on their desktop that would be absurd to do over the web.  For example: there is no reason cross-platform file transfer should be challenging.  Simply expose a slice of the file system to the net on a computer you own to somebody you trust and they can get what ever files they need at their convenience and discretion, like copy&#x2F;paste from one folder to another folder except those folders are on different computers.  The way the web currently works this isn&#x27;t practical.  The closest thing is a shared storage space in the cloud, like DropBox.<p>Other potential capabilities include remote application access, remote hardware access, built-in media sharing (think non-proprietary video conferences&#x2F;presentations), and synchronizing things between your various personal devices.')
