So far there has been no evidence of either fraud or misconduct and the thin claims put up so far have been laughed out of court.  Lacking any claims of fraud or misconduct the only other option is to somehow be able to prove a miscount and since everyone learned their lesson with the hanging chads of the butterfly ballots this is exceedingly unlikely.
