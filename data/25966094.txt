Handling those fragile pieces of RNA, and getting them inside an encapsulation, is a very touchy process. It involves custom microfluidic components made by, apparently, only one company so far.<p>Remember, this is a minimum viable product. A few year from now, there will probably be regular bulk production of RNA vaccines. But this was all lab scale until recently.<p>Once the production problem is solved, making new vaccines will be easier. The encapsulation process doesn&#x27;t much care what it&#x27;s encapsulating.')
