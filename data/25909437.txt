I use a few connected rowing apps, mostly Asensei and Kinomap. They don&#x27;t deliver a Peloton level of experience but they are good enough to stay motivated and there is no vendor lock-in on the hardware side, which is important to me as this is a nascent industry and I don&#x27;t believe that all entrants will be winners.<p>While I have no interest whatsoever in buying another hardware platform, I would gladly pay $40&#x2F;mo for an amazing software platform for the C2.')
