So far I&#x27;ve mainly used Johnny Five ยน on Node.js to orchestrate things. It was so simple to jump in, with an easy ubiquitous language, and I was able to spend time learning the actual hardware and developing the logic. For my needs, an interpreted language has been plenty capable.<p>As I get deeper though, I&#x27;m finding a need for near real-time control (timing, to be precise), as performant as I can make it. For that, I&#x27;m (re)turning to C, a language I last used a couple dedades ago. It&#x27;s tougher going but definitely rewarding.<p>I&#x27;m so glad for the friendly introduction to the field, like Python and Arduino sketches. It reminds me of my pre&#x2F;teen days, hacking at a personal (well, family) computer, getting familiar with a marvel of technology through exploration and discovery.<p>ยน <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rwaldron&#x2F;johnny-five&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rwaldron&#x2F;johnny-five&#x2F;</a>')
