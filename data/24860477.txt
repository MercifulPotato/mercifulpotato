Apparently it has a bit of a user base still, and for some reason Amazon sends me about $50&#x2F;quarter. I don&#x27;t know how the app is being monetized, it certainly wasn&#x27;t something I did.<p>Also, because my app uses API Gateway and Lambda as a backend, Amazon gives me a $100 credit on my AWS account every month to cover the costs. My costs for the app are about $10&#x2F;month, so the other $90 are used for various other activities.')
