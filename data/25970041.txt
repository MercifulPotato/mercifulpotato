It&#x27;ll automatically cut your charge off at ~80% and slow the charging if it&#x27;s heating up too much. Should greatly extend the service life of your battery. You can pretty much just install with Magisk and forget it. Perhaps it&#x27;s too late for your current phone&#x2F;battery but maybe on the next one.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VR-25&#x2F;acc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;VR-25&#x2F;acc</a><p>Pair with something like AccuBattery for visibility into battery capacity over time.')
