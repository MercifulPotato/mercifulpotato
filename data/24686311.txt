SGML even can treat CSVs as markup. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with CSVs&#x2F;TSVs anyway - it&#x27;s a concise tabular format using only minimal special coding for a record and a field separator, as envisioned by ASCII and EDIFACT. The problem seems more like that there was no error checking in place to capture file write errors, or more generally the use of non-reproducible, manual operating practices which seems common in data processing.')
