If you had a magical perfect AI that was loyal to you and ran on your PC, it would always act in your interest - Spidering the web and returning interesting things based on your feedback. Whereas the current model is, none of this stuff is self-hosted, it has to run on Somebody Else&#x27;s Computer. SEC costs money to run, so they have to make that money back by tweaking the recommendations, and none of the big ones inter-operate. YouTube will never recommend videos from the Fediverse.<p>So anything that&#x27;s not self-hosted (which is just a specific form of a subscription payment, anyway) will never have your best interests at heart, it can only have some of your interests at heart. This same problems comes up in politics - Companies have no interest in creating public goods and we shouldn&#x27;t expect them to do so.<p>But anyway, I think this is where some of the good stuff will fall out of AI in the next 10 or 20 years - Having intelligent agents that try to cut through the BS of the web on behalf of their owners.')
