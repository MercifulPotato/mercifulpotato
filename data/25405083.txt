And for anything practical you needed to. There either weren&#x27;t API&#x27;s for things you wanted. Or the API&#x27;s that existed were insufficient. I remember in the early 80&#x27;s someone showing me some code for high end medical product. It was written in Pascal and C. With shim functions to dick with the stack so you could call C functions from Pascal. Couple of years later they rewrote everything in C++.<p>Notable I think C# and Rust both have no seat belt modes.')
