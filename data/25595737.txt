Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609440652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595592, text='&gt;  does a video in this HDMI out mode count as just one click<p>A mirrorless camera&#x27;s shutter is <i>only</i> used during taking photos (and some cameras, like the Sony A7S2 which I own, can also run in &quot;shutterless&quot; aka silent mode, at a slight expense in picture quality). It will not be impacted at all if the camera is used exclusively for video.<p>&gt;  Also can you completely avoid using a battery with a power line adapter?<p>Not with Sony Alphas, they <i>will</i> drain the battery even if hooked up to a powerful USB charger. Get a &quot;dummy battery&quot; for your camera.<p>&gt; I tried using an old Nexus 4 as a live streaming camera a while back but after a few weeks the battery bulged and the gorgeous glass back shattered.<p>I hope you got rid of the phone or at least took out the battery, when it bulges it&#x27;s having internal issues and now is a fire &#x2F; explosion risk. You probably used a cheap power supply that has lots of high frequency ripple.')
