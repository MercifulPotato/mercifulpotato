Assorted disclaimers, of course. In particular, the 8008 was a clone of the TTL-based Datapoint 2200 desktop terminal&#x2F;computer.<p>The regular 8008 ran at 500 kHz while the 8008-1 ran at 800 kHz. As far as I know, the -1 version was just from sorting, without any special changes. (Of course as they improved their manufacturing process, you&#x27;d expect more would sort into the faster bucket.) In comparison, the 8086 die was shrunk over time with new generations of the HMOS process, so it had a &quot;genuine&quot; speedup.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s interesting that the Osborne 1 &quot;portable&quot; computer didn&#x27;t show up until 1981. I think there are two reasons. First, the technology wasn&#x27;t ready in 1972, not just the processor but memory, display technology, floppy disks, and importantly software. It wasn&#x27;t until 1975 that IBM made an extremely expensive portable (the 5100) and 1978 when Xerox made an even more expensive prototype portable (the Notetaker). But by 1981, technology had improved so Osborne could make a moderately useful portable at a high but plausible price.')
