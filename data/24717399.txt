It can still get bit “catty,” but nothing that even comes close to what I’ve experienced (and contributed to -<i>mea culpa</i>) in the past.<p>Will I stay forever? Maybe, maybe not. Time will tell. I have left many communities; some, in which I enjoyed some status. They all hurt, but I have always gotten to the point where I no longer miss them. I barely ever visit Facebook. I have to maintain an account, because I’m a senior figure in a tech group there, but I find the community to be a bit corrosive to my personal sense of well-being. So, months ago, I stopped doing anything more than brief daily checks for posts in the group. I pretty much never read Twitter.<p>In fact, this is really the only social media in which I participate. I have many accounts, but most are there as “placeholders.”<p>I do try to be a “good citizen,” by following the rules and walking away, when I feel like all I would bring is darkness, and I will occasionally remove or revise comments that I feel are not productive.<p>I know that I come across as a “stuffed shirt,” but one reason is that it’s important for me to be fairly careful about what I put out there. I have been...<i>pithy</i>, in the past.<p>I’m also fairly good at apologizing. That’s because I get a lot of practice.')
