They are fearless in a way that I haven&#x27;t seen elsewhere.<p>Time will tell if fear would have been wise. But for now, I&#x27;m curious to see whether &quot;the link will last for years&quot; is true.<p>If it goes down, I&#x27;ll append instructions to the original twitter thread on how to access it elsewhere. I also don&#x27;t have any experience setting up the alternatives you mention; if you do, please feel free to mention it somewhere (twitter DM is always a reliable way to reach me) and I&#x27;ll highlight it.<p>As for a torrent link specifically, I did request that the-eye have a torrent ready to go on day one, for just such an eventuality. I was confused when they didn&#x27;t seem worried. After spending almost an hour describing in detail the kinds of repercussions that might inevitably follow, he simply said that fear does not control him the way it controls me, and that he will ensure it remains. (Probably via torrent, if such a thing becomes necessary.)<p>I&#x27;ve thought a lot about what he said, and how he phrased it. I decided to trust them to take care of the data. Mostly, though, I made the decision out of intellectual curiosity to see how true their ambition really is.<p>In the meantime, joining their community on Discord and&#x2F;or donating to them would be helpful (though to my surprise, they didn&#x27;t seem too interested in monetary concerns either). <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-eye.eu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-eye.eu&#x2F;</a>')
