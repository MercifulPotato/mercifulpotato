This has been the case throughout history.<p>I was just thinking about the difference between “good,” and “excellent.”<p>If we look at the difference between a Henkels kitchen knife, and a Japanese Takayuki knife, we are talking exponentially divergent costs. The Takayuki is definitely a lot better than the Henkels, but is it <i>twenty times</i> as good, as the price difference might suggest?<p>But Henkels makes far better knives than most of the disposable crap out there. It costs more; usually two or three times as much as a “standard quality” knife. Worth it, though.<p>That’s sort of the “sweet spot” I aim for, and we don’t get there, without discipline, consistency, and patience.')
