I&#x27;ve been using Macbooks for ~10 years and their quality has been going consistently going downhill the past few years. I usually buy a new one every 1-2 years. I&#x27;m currently on a maxed out 16 inch Macbook Pro. Can&#x27;t even connect an external monitor because of heating issues. Unless I mod the whole thing with cooling pads.<p>The last two times I bought a new one I thought &quot;Not happy, but let&#x27;s give Apple one more chance because they used to be good and everyone makes mistakes&quot; - Regretted it every time. Keyboard issues (went to the Apple store 6+ times), Touchbar issues and it&#x27;s annoying as a whole, overheating, GPU issues with external monitors, Bluetooth issues, and more. Next time will be the first time (really!) that I&#x27;m not buying a Macbook anymore.')
