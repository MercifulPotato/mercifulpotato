At the end of the day the argument boils down to &quot;drivers make more money when they can drive faster&quot;, which seems pretty indisputable.  So if overall traffic speeds are slowing down, then <i>in aggregate</i> all drivers will suffer as well, although the daytime driver suffering through rush hour gridlock will be <i>comparatively</i> worse off than a driver who focuses on long airport rides in the middle of the night.<p>As for the taxi meter fee structure, Uber&#x2F;Lyft can work around this with surge fees during those congested peak hours, while taxis cannot.  This too is quite clearly in the Uber drivers&#x27; favor: if you&#x27;re going to be sitting around in traffic, better to be paid more for it.  (Unless Uber takes all the extra revenue for themselves, but that&#x27;s another story.)')
