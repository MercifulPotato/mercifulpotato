I think they were shown around the time of this interview. I remember for the first time the threads on hn felt unmoderated or overwhelmed [1]. Like someone sucked all the air out the room, metaphorically speaking. I don&#x27;t mean this as a criticism of dan or anyone else behind hn (you can even see he was  actively trying to flag the worst offenders), but I just wonder what it was like behind the scenes for hn that day, how prevalent that sort of thing is, how concerned mods should be of that sort of thing in the future, etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19632086" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19632086</a>')
