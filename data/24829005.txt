That is, if you eat junk&#x2F;processed foods your body can&#x27;t deal with the &#x27;artificial&#x27; components as well as it can real food (no or little human interference).\nThe side effects of poor food choices for me are lethargy and &#x27;brain fog&#x27; along with exacerbating my body pain levels. On these days I no longer fight it and just rest. I recover much better&#x2F;quicker this way rather than trying to fight through it.<p>Your illness can consume you at times and this can be quite depressing. Learning and practicing some type of mindful meditation can bring you back to some kind of normal, even just 10 minutes a day can make a big difference and I do notice this if I skip a day or two!<p>Stay well.')
