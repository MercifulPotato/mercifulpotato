Similar to how I&#x27;m not giving any of my SE friends the Computer Science for Dummies book.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to ask is... would a book about baking that isn&#x27;t basic be a better gift? Even if it isn&#x27;t particularly something you would have gotten yourself. Examples off the top of my head include a biography about a famous or obscure baker, an in depth book about the science behind baking, a hyper focused book about history of baking techniques, etc.<p>Maybe trying to gain some domain expertise in something your potential gift receiver is interested in - in order to give a better gift - is a gift in itself?<p>Here&#x27;s a quick way you can get some functional domain expertise in knives to give a better gift to your knife friend (if you want). Depending on if they&#x27;re into knives as collectibles or for use, I&#x27;d suggest finding out which brand(s) your friend favors and then picking up a used knife in a discontinued model from that brand on ebay. Worst case scenario they have it already but even then I bet they&#x27;d still value the gift.')
