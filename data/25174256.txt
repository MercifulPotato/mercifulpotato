Even so, the optimal size is probably at least a little smaller than what we have todayâ€”after all, I&#x27;m seeing a lot of complaints that the keys are currently too big, and almost none that they&#x27;re currently too small.<p>So, is it worth changing the standard size to something more optimal? You would end up with a lot of older pianos that have the legacy size, and it would take a very long time for those to age out of use. But it would happen eventually, and the status quo is inhibiting progress.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d come down hard in favor of maintaining the status quo. Whatever benefit we&#x27;d get from changing the current key size would not be worth the pain of the transition. Everyone would have to learn a new size, and potentially replace their pianos.<p>This is also why I&#x27;m not so enthused by USB-C...')
