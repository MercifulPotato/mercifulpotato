Perhaps even <i>the</i> issue.<p>Let&#x27;s say we all agree that most pianos should have one, consistent size. Even so, the optimal size is probably at least a <i>little</i> smaller than what we have today—after all, I&#x27;m seeing lots of complaints that the keys are currently too big, and almost none that they&#x27;re too small.<p>So, is it worth changing the standard size to something more optimal? You would end up with a lot of older pianos that have the legacy size, and it would take a very long time for those to age out of use. But it would happen eventually, and the status quo is clearly creating problems.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d come down on the side of maintaining the status quo. Whatever benefit we&#x27;d get from from smaller keys would not be worth the pain of the transition. Everyone would have to learn a new size, and potentially replace their pianos.<p>And this is also why I&#x27;m not so enthused by USB-C. Or replacing the headphone jack.<p>But, clearly some change is needed, sometimes, or else we&#x27;d all be using Mac OS 9, and laptops gigantic enough to accommodate bulky optical disc drives. I&#x27;m in favor of <i>those</i> transitions—they were painful, but the need was great enough to make them worthwhile. All the way at the other end of the spectrum are Slack&#x27;s weekly UI redesigns, both because of their frequency and because they rarely seem like clear-cut improvements.')
