This is the idea that something called `loop_index` is the index for a loop, when it could actually be anything. He strongly felt that semantic content in variable names should be minimized.<p>I haven&#x27;t run into the phrase anywhere else, and Google doesn&#x27;t turn up any programming-related results that I can tell, but I&#x27;ve found the idea endlessly useful. In talking <i>about</i> programs and the <i>goal</i> of programs, we often use language that describes things we have not yet been able to construct. The language has a parasitic relationship to the thing it names - misdirecting our understanding of the machine it sits on.<p>I try to practice a lot of skepticism around language and computers. It is very easy to name a thing and much harder to make the machine behave in the way the language suggests.')
