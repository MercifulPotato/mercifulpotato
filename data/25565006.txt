Mobile UI conventions stole the show, but IN PRACTICE gui&#x27;s still rule the office and productivity world.<p>Yet, our current web standards are GUI and CRUD un-friendly. To be desktop-like in a browser requires giant JavaScript libraries which are clunky and buggy.<p>GUI&#x27;s may no longer be sexy, but they still run the backlots of the world and that&#x27;s not likely to change within the next decade or more. Mobile UI&#x27;s are a sub-set of rich GUI&#x27;s, which logically means they don&#x27;t have the same full ability. I could list several UI patterns GUI&#x27;s do with fewer human eye and finger movements.<p>So, let&#x27;s create a state-friendly GUI markup standard so we can have rich GUI&#x27;s in browsers without requiring bloated buggy JS&#x2F;CSS libraries.<p>And somewhat related, our current web standards have too many &quot;positioning problems&quot; such that they can&#x27;t replace PDF&#x27;s. PDF&#x27;s are needed because end users (non-IT office workers) want WYSIWYG documents; they can&#x27;t afford to go to CSS school.')
