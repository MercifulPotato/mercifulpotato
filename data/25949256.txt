Before you call me stupid or irresponsible, I&#x27;m going to say practically no one reads these agreements, and even fewer understand them.<p>The NYT a few days ago had an opinion piece on how no one reads the TOS for things like this. A very choice line:<p>&gt; A 2012 Carnegie Mellon study found that the average American would have to devote 76 work days just to read over tech companiesâ€™ policies. That number would probably be much higher today.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;sunday&#x2F;online-terms-of-service.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;sunday&#x2F;online-ter...</a><p>When I bought my house, the attorneys sat down with me and had me read through and explained to me every single term of the purchase agreement and my mortgage, checking that I understood them. Absolutely no one has done this for Facebook, throwing a few hundred into Robinhood, etc. It&#x27;s not worth it, and the terms change with such frequency that it would be outdated immediately.<p>I don&#x27;t think having such impossible terms that you &quot;agree&quot; to are in good faith.<p>I&#x27;m not ignorant, I&#x27;m pretty typical, and I&#x27;m not going to spend 1&#x2F;3 of my time simply sitting reading TOS.')
