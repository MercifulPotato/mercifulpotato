We just had an isolation requirement and testing.<p>As you might remember, there was a shortage of tests the first time that the EU needed to move its agricultural workers en masse (which happened already in the spring â€“ harvests in Spain are more or less continuous, unlike Atlantic Canada where it is much more restricted seasonally). Also, many of those agricultural laborers live in precarious working conditions that the state has little insight into, and arranging any kind of isolation on short notice was not possible.<p>The EU was not aiming at total elimination because the virus had already spread throughout the bloc practically before the authorities were even aware of it and again, these are not island nations.')
