Thus only if you are &quot;privileged&quot;, meaning that people are letting you be free and giving you your fair share of the resources, can you in practice choose to &quot;not care&quot;, since the politics don&#x27;t affect you negatively.<p>Also note that politics means: &quot;the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status&quot; and implies nothing about having or not a &quot;Government&quot;. That depends very much on the political system itself.')
