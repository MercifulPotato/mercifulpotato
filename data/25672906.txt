Being able to define what&#x27;s acceptable free speech just means the majority bullies the minority.

It’s the only one I’ve ever known.<p>&gt; Do you think MLK or any other civil rights leaders would&#x27;ve had a chance in hell of not being muzzle by the mainstream opinion of the day?<p>&gt; 1A protected them, and when they were incorrectly arrested or muzzled, there were legions of lawyers ready to remind the government in court what the law says.<p>This is one of those times I wish HN allowed emojis. This is so laughably historically ignorant I don’t even know what to say. I’ll try: do you know how dead MLK and a bunch of other civil rights leaders got for their “protection”? Do you know that federal government agents and various state governments actively conspired with the people who’d make them dead?<p>I mean, I take your point.
