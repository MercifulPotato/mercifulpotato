Why&#x2F;how is something unsafe for an American, but safe for an Italian or Spaniard?<p>America has a longstanding tradition of food fortification. Niacin is also used to supplement US diets featuring a corn staple -- corn&#x27;s niacin is not bioavailable without additional processing traditional to Mesoamerican cultures. Probably more recognized today is iodized salt, which is responsible for perhaps a decade&#x27;s worth of the Flynn effect in the US.<p>In the case of flour, Europe is lagging behind: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ffinetwork.org&#x2F;europe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ffinetwork.org&#x2F;europe</a>. Apparently Denmark went the extra step of banning enriched &#x2F; fortified foods. You could probably argue that regional diets will naturally vary and that something like iodine supplements aren&#x27;t required for Italians when they have ready access to seafood that Oklahomans don&#x27;t. But since I&#x27;m pretty sure these enrichments aren&#x27;t harmful to those who do have access, I imagine some of the divide is simply protectionism -- protecting your local markets and local manufacturers from cheaper American brands.')
