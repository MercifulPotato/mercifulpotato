These numbers couldn&#x27;t work otherwise.<p>This is, of course, thanks to the incredible lucky foresight that let us capture most of the profits from the oil industry as a public good. One could of course question the priorities in how this money is spent.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that our public sector is too big, for instance. I&#x27;m fairly sure that a considerable part of it works more as a jobs program than a necessary public utility.<p>Another interpretation would be that we <i>in effect</i> already have a massive basic income program going, a priority with which I&#x27;d actually agree. We&#x27;re just not being honest about it, partly due to still being unable to run it unconditionally. The unspoken and un-debated consensus seems to be that there needs to be a bit of a taboo in utilizing such services, or the system would be overloaded.')
