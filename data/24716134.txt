Had to wait a bit since the server seems to be busy. No worries though:)<p>I like this concept. It was very relaxing. I did a far too rapid run through a bunch of feelings testing various inputs and responses. I like the way it cycles back through to help you focus on solving the problem that you have identified yourself as having. Very nice.<p>I did find one of your response options has an error.<p>There are a couple of options presented for answers - OK, NO, YES, ?, NOT YET.<p>Maybe a couple of others. One of the dialogs where you are offering a question box [?] shows up as &quot;Question_square&quot; or something very similar to that. I apologize for not taking notes. I believe that it was in the first group of negative Feelings that started with a &quot;D&quot;.<p>I also found one sentence in the written dialog that makes no sense as it looks like a word was left out. This was probably in the positive feelings list. It was in the descriptive part with dialog that had a comma followed by a couple of words that looked out of place as they didn&#x27;t fit in the sentence like some other thought was edited out and they are now an orphaned phrase. I am starting to feel sad for those poor words thinking about it. Might have to dip back into it if I can get back on the server! :)<p>I tried to get back to it but your server is evidently getting slammed by all the people curious for a solution to their problems.<p>Good luck with this. Nicely done.')
