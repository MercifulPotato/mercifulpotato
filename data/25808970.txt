Problems<p>Then that&#x27;s when you should definitely start looking to specific solutions to specific problems.<p>Are you having scaling&#x2F;performance issues? Look into kubernetes.<p>Are you having problems with &quot;too many cooks in the kitchen&quot;? Start looking splitting things to separate services.<p>Are you having problems hiring &quot;full stack&quot; people than can work on both ruby and frontend? Then start thinking about an SPA.<p>That&#x27;s the power of Rails.... you can get really, really far with it... when your business is a total success and you have steady income, then start looking into the specifics.<p>Starting from the get go with an SPA, kubernetes, microservices, monorepos, etc is, in my opinion, a recipe for failure.<p>(not that you have said that of course, just something I see too much around and I just take every opportunity to rant against it )')
