The distribution part. But that would work in Sonoma county. Sonoma is an Ag county. It means you can have a cow or pig in your backyard garden and that’s fine.(not exaggerating) Not so much in Bay Area where we have a housing crisis and no such thing as unused lots. Or electricity.<p>I&#x27;m familiar with Sonoma&#x27;s Ag, I helped with a conversion of an organic farm to Biodynmic in Petaluma and you&#x27;re right this is not going to work in the Bay Area due to the immense population density and scarce vacant land as is, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t have to; you could just onboard people into a CSA while growing with this practice in Sonoma&#x2F;Napa counties and use things like Cropmobster and distribute in a major city like say Palo Alto or Mountain View or some where people from even SF can come in and get their food boxes. It&#x27;s going to exhausting regardless, as we had a team of 5 dedicated people in my apprenticeship handle a 300 client CSA and we worked roughly 14-18 hour days dueing the Spring, Summer and Fall months when I was in S. Germany.<p>The goal is to get school children involved (middle to HS aged), we tried to do that, but could only get them to come to harvest for a few hours a month and tour the farm: my friend&#x27;s mother was a member of the ruling Green party in Baden Wuttenberg and we had so much red tape to deal with to ensure the children&#x27;s safety, thus this needs to be done either on a volunteer basis after school or as a in-school program.  But if I&#x27;m honest, now with COVID school shut downs in CA I bet parents are just dying to get their kids out of the house and it could get lots of traction.<p>&gt; I know because I tried. Then there is liability, insurance and red tape and legal translations. It’s hideous and exhausting.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t doubt it, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t bother following the rules in CA and just resort to things like guerilla gardening and bypass it entirely if I wanted to take the challenge. I remember the riots that happened at UC Berkeley when people tried to use the vacant land for gardening&#x2F;farming, not sure if it was OWS people but lots of them were sympathetic and got maced just the same. Occupy the Farm covers this [0].<p>It seems like we have much to discuss, I still need to drop you an email. I&#x27;ll drop you a line before the end of the month, just got a lot going on, but it&#x27;d be cool to chat and share resources.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=09DjPh6OQyk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=09DjPh6OQyk</a>')
