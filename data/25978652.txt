It&#x27;s been a blockbuster success in my opinion - they have some of the best UX&#x2F;UI in the world and their websites are ultralight and downgrade well.<p>There are a few issues with authentication, but there is support. \nEverything that&#x27;s related to dealing with the UK government btw is all in ONE website, where everything is explained to you in Plain English - gov.uk<p>Coming from a country where this doesn&#x27;t exist, I was blown away by every interaction I&#x27;ve had with the system. It&#x27;s simply amazing.')
