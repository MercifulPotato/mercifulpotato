If you need something more permissive, find an even more permissive hosting service (probably outside the US). I&#x27;m not saying that you do anything with a blog and be guaranteed that it stayed available, but you&#x27;d have to do way, way, way more than anything a platform like FB&#x2F;Twitter would take action on.')
