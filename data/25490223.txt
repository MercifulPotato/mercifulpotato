Was looking at 5 port ones so maybe sweet spot price wise.  Had quick look at 8 port ones and branded would be around prices you have - though Netgear seemed closer to 50 price wise.   Do note many 8 port models only do POE over half the ports I&#x27;ve noticed, so mindful of that and two 4&#x2F;5 port affairs maybe better price in some situations.<p>Though if you&#x27;re in no rush, January is sure to have some good sales&#x2F;warehouse return deals.  Though if you want to go offbrand and 10&#x2F;100 do you then &quot;Cudy FS1010P 8+2-Port 100Mbps Ethernet PoE+ Unmanaged Plug and Play Switch, 120 W, 8 10&#x2F;100Mbps PoE+ Ports&quot; on Amazon will pull up a 40$ model as an example that seems like maybe worth checking into.')
