However, I think you should proof read the article again. An article on &#x27;Improving Your Writing&#x27; loses a lot of credibility when it has sentences like:<p>&gt; The character, &#x27;hotel&#x27; has does an action &#x27;wanted&#x27;.<p>which should be:<p>&gt; The character, &#x27;hotel&#x27;, has an action, &#x27;wanted&#x27;.<p>It also seems like you rely on a single source, Williams and Colomb (1990). Is this your personal summary of that book? Do you recommend reading it, or do you believe your post captures the most important points?')
