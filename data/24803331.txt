A license dictates what is legally permissible but it doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t other cultural expectations that go with that.<p>Eric Raymond famously wrote about the customs of open source in Homesteading the Noosphere: &quot;I have observed these customs in action for 20 years, going back to the pre-FSF ancient history of open-source software. They have several very interesting features. One of the most interesting is that most hackers have followed them without being fully aware of doing so.&quot;[0]<p>It is possible for us to have norms of mutual respect beyond what is legally required. I think those norms are actually at the heart of open source and have been since the beginning. I hope we never abandon them just because they are &quot;not in black and white&quot;.<p>[0] - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catb.org&#x2F;~esr&#x2F;writings&#x2F;cathedral-bazaar&#x2F;homesteading&#x2F;ar01s04.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catb.org&#x2F;~esr&#x2F;writings&#x2F;cathedral-bazaar&#x2F;homestead...</a>')
