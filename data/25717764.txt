Any entity forcefully removing your body&#x27;s ability to perform any of its fundamental functions is obviously abhorrent. If the state were seeking to remove your ability to see or your ability to consume food or excrete it, would you find that a matter of definitions?<p>By contrast, male circumcision and teeth straitghening are essentially cosmetic differences. Male circumcision is more problematic (and it is certainly not considered anywhere close to normal in most of the world), but even there the harm is minimal - being able to cover one&#x27;s glans with one&#x27;s foreskin is not a significant ability that anyone could claim has a significant effect on their life (of course, the risks of complications associated with the procedure itself are a different matter).<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve noticed that he moral queasiness of sterilization of the male seems to be quite a bit lower than with sterilization of the female<p>I have no idea where you have seen this. I haven&#x27;t even seen the sex or gender of the person being potentially sterilized discussed at all in any discussion of the horror of forced sterilization. Certainly nowhere in this thread or even the deleted tweet.<p>Overall, you seem to want to either make some kind of eugenic argument for forced sterilization (which I consider so abhorrent it&#x27;s not even worth arguing against), OR some kind of strange more-liberal-than-thou argument that reproduction shouldn&#x27;t be given some special place (which no one is, it&#x27;s just that reproduction is the ONLY function of the body that anyone seems to think it might be ok to take from you for some strange reason - it isn&#x27;t, anymore than gouging your eyes or removing your inner ear would be).')
