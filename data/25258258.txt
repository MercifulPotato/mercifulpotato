I developed and launched a weekly newsletter (Jobleter) featuring hand-picked Remote jobs for developers from verified employers.<p>Due to COVID, I got laid off this summer and didn&#x27;t have a job for almost 2 months. My daily routine was to get up, open several job posting sites and look through all of the jobs that I thought were a good fit for me. I did this for almost 2 weeks and I just couldn&#x27;t continue doing this as it was a huge drain of my time and was getting me no where. I then started looking for remote jobs and found the perfect one for me. That&#x27;s when I thought of Jobleter.<p>A lot of people are in the same place as I was and with Covid, all of the software companies have gone remote. Jobleter is a weekly newsletter (currently for developers only, but will be expanded) that contains hand-picked new jobs from verified employers.<p>Give it a try and let me know what you think.')
