However, the paper explained: &quot;The votes attributed to the dead are too few, and spread over 20 elections since 2000, to consider them a coordinated fraud attempt. More likely is what investigators in other states have found when examining dead voter records: Clerical errors are to blame, such as a person&#x27;s vote being assigned to a dead person with a similar name.&quot;<p>Thus, when presented with a list like this, the first assumption must be to check how many are due to clerical errors.')
