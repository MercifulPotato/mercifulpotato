Some countries do choose to negotiate with terrorists.  I think there’s two frameworks to evaluate how we should act, one based on Justice and one based on Power.  It’s idealistic to assume that we should approach everything from a “because it’s the right thing to do” perspective, as that can lead to more harm.  Sometimes you have to acknowledge a groups power to do harm, and work to mitigate that harm.  Not everything is going to have a clean solution.  I don’t know how much power the far right has at this point.  We may be about to find out, and if so we’ll see how long it takes for the country to get weary of a terrorist insurgency.')
