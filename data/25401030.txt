Tell me I&#x27;m doing my eyes in if you will, but I find dark mode to be easy on the eyes, especially when - but not exclusively because - I can&#x27;t always control how poorly lit my environment is.  Dark mode, however, is also a curse, because when the contrast is too high I find that I get this &quot;negative space effect&quot; where in my vision the letters on screen go really dim and I get a series of fuzzy white lines appearing between the lines, making it almost impossible to read any text without immediately losing my place and skipping to the line of text above or below.<p>The trend towards AMOLED dark mode has made life hard for me, especially when using websites or phones (looking at you, Android 10 and above) that I can&#x27;t really customise the way I can the rest of my computer.  Give me Gruvbox&#x27;s #ebdbb2 on #282828 any day of the week, I want to get off the AMOLED #ffffff on #000000 train.')
