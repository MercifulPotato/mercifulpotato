I&#x27;m probably chasing several different places.  3 days homework times 10 places equals something that I do <i>not</i> have time in my life for.  Nor am I going to make time for it to try to get into <i>your</i> company.  You aren&#x27;t that much better than anywhere else, so don&#x27;t make it harder for me to get a job at your place.')
