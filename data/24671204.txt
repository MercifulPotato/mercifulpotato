Your comment just gave me an itch I had to scratch.<p>There are some words in people&#x27;s explanations that always bother me. These are &#x27;just&#x27;, &#x27;mere&#x27;, merely&#x27; and the like. Why? Because they&#x27;re not explaining, but explaining away. It&#x27;s like saying: x is trivial, so it&#x27;s not as important as you think.<p>But reality is much more complicated than that. For even simple things are hard to fathom for those not knowing how simple it is.<p>Now, back to the topic: no, medieval painters&#x27; lack of knowledge on how use perspective was not just matter of being stuck at conventions. When everyone is expecting to see a certain thing and you&#x27;re payed to do that thing, it&#x27;s not &#x27;just&#x27; up to the  painter see outside her&#x2F;his perspective. What I&#x27;m saying is that takes a huge leap to break away from all that.<p>Beware of just explaining away phenomena.')
