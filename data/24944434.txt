But neither of the major parties like &quot;spoiler&quot; candidates, it seems like the ability to &quot;collect&quot; votes from the green or libertarian parties would be in their interest.<p>I suspect the reason it&#x27;s not more widespread is more mundane. It isn&#x27;t incomprehensible, but it&#x27;s more complicated than what we have. If you&#x27;re explaining you&#x27;re losing. Also people are (perhaps rightly) cautious about messing with how elections happen. Finally, it doesn&#x27;t ignite the same passions as abortion or police reform.  The interest groups pushing most strongly for it are, by definition, small and not really powerful.')
