Item(by='tw04', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610151628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25692610, text='&gt;This is prime &quot;Free Speech for Me - But Not for Thee&quot;.<p>That was a pretty bold assumption on your part, and couldn&#x27;t be any further from the truth.  I don&#x27;t participate on Twitter or Facebook, and I&#x27;m getting by just fine.  Somehow I don&#x27;t feel my freedom of speech has been in any way limited.    So I can tell you with 100% certainty that you can in fact get by just fine without having a &quot;public channel to express yourself&quot;.<p>&gt;You&#x27;re making a very easy generalization. Not any significant portion of people expressing themselves contributed to any of the events you are mentioning. It&#x27;s funny because you can read the exact same thought process from the opposite side, against say the BLM protests.<p>It doesn&#x27;t actually matter if it was &quot;a significant portion&quot; - they allowed the organization of what became a violent protest and will likely be de-platformed as a result.  Freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t apply to private companies.  I have literally no idea what BLM has to do with any of this other than you&#x27;re making another poor assumption that I&#x27;m OK with violent protests if it&#x27;s by a certain group.  You&#x27;d be wrong.')
