You won&#x27;t get those people vaccinated. They will massively contribute to the spread.<p>Additionally, vaccinating risk groups in the high age category first lets you spot complications with the disease more early and it&#x27;s ethically somewhat better to risk long-term vaccination issues with 90+ year olds than 20+ year olds, as one of these groups will have to suffer the consequences for a shorter time. It may sound harsh to make comparisons like that but you&#x27;ll have to make decisions like that in a medical environment.')
