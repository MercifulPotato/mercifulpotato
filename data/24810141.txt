Item(by='RonaldRaygun', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602944326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24809834, text='Believe it or not, the Senate used to actually follow the law as written and advice and <i>consent</i>, and not simply reject out of hand because the nominating president was of the opposing political party. 13 Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed by a Senate controlled by the opposing party since 1945. All of these were under a Republican President and confirmed by a Democratic Senate.<p>The last Justice to fail to be confirmed was Bork in 1987, for the very valid reason of his association with Nixon&#x27;s Saturday Night Massacre prior to the latter&#x27;s forced resignation.<p>The process was never intended to be a political, partisan battle, and this was respected by both parties until 2016. Merrick Garland was (and remains) eminently qualified for the seat, and nobody serious on either side of the aisle claims otherwise. I defy anyone to give me a cogent reason why he should not have been given the prescribed consent by the Senate. Mitch McConnell has most likely indelibly changed the Supreme Court confirmation process to be a purely political one, to the great detriment of the Court. Incredibly shortsighted, in my opinion, as it has dispensed with all pretense of a supra-partisan deliberating body.')
