I can&#x27;t believe they make you do that. It sounds like they try to make the process as cumbersome as possible so you go away. Which you did. I think I would do the same.<p>A story like that really puts into context what expensive insulin means. When it&#x27;s expensive, they want to make sure you don&#x27;t sell it. So even people who can get it through insurance are affected.<p>For contrast an experience from a rich European country: My doc writes me a yearly prescription. I forgot to renew it once, and had to pay out of my pocket to get my insulin. He sent me a backdated prescription I could use to get the cost reimbursed.')
