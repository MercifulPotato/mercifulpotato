Something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT202491" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT202491</a> would be good. I note that while right now there’s no way to override the malware safeguards, Apple&#x27;s promising to fix this. (I believe that update was made after this article was written, btw.)<p>Now: it’s absolutely true that Apple could change their mind. Given that possibility, I understand why someone might prefer to avoid Apple. I&#x27;d be sincerely interested in some thoughts on how you can make such a Pact enforceable, or do you just have to take it on a case by case basis?')
