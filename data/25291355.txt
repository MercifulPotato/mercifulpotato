I feel that developers who started their careers before the advent of NoSQL DBs&#x2F;MEAN stack&#x2F;etc had to go through the rigor of fine tuning their SQL queries and witness the powers (and quirks) of a performant SQL DB. These devs are usually a fan of using DB-as-a-backend. Personally, I am a big fan of PostgREST and I apply it whenever I find a use case that suits it. I find it quite pragmatic and it just shines when it plays to it&#x27;s strength. Pragmatic developers should took a pragmatic look at such approaches and try to use the powerhouse that are SQL DB engines.<p>Shameless plug: I&#x27;ve written an article to showcase it&#x27;s philosophy and how easy it is to get started with PostgREST.<p>[^1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samkhawase.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;postgrest&#x2F;postgrest_introduction&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samkhawase.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;postgrest&#x2F;postgrest_introduction...</a>')
