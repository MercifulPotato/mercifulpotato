That&#x27;s a good chunk of the problem, because it seems that legitimate investigation and &quot;linking&quot; of said facts to prove the claims is next to <i>impossible</i> without serious government-level powers of acquiring evidence. So inference needs to be used, unfortunately. And once you start inferring without direct evidence, you start sounding like a conspiracy theorist, which is now being used to shut-down dissent and questioning.<p>It&#x27;s not like a journalist right now can tell Robinhood &quot;give us all your internal emails so we can verify the reason you&#x27;ve stopped trading these stocks&quot;. Or &quot;Hey Discord, let&#x27;s look at your internal slack comms so we can figure out what evidence you had to conclude that the WSB chat rooms were filled with hatespeech.&quot; Or &quot;give us a data-dump of all the users and comments you identified as hatespeech&quot;.<p>How about some regulation in that regard? Hey EU? Here&#x27;s an idea for a possible scenario and how it could look:<p>1. Public company makes contentious claims.<p>2. Curious individual (maybe journalist) makes formal request for data to confirm.<p>3. By law, company above is obligated to provide access.<p>4. Individual gets given a secure-room, no-data-copying-allowed physical access to inspect and analyze said data.<p>5. Individual is allowed to report on said data.<p>Edit. Formatting.')
