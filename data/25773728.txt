Like web-devs supporting IE 9 or lower... it&#x27;s like, a whole generation of technology backwards... and it&#x27;s just... not fun.. it sucks...<p>Taking your beautiful game that you&#x27;ve spend 5+ years on building and hacking it to pieces to run on older hardware must be the most tedious and infuriating experience...
