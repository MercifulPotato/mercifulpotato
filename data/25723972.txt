I find it very possible that white doctors are less attuned to the small social and even physical differences (higher risk of certain things) for Black patients. For example, there are studies showing that white doctors are less likely to prescribe pain medication to Black women because they think they are overreacting. Part of that could be overt racism. But lack of time spent around Black people could be another culprit. One being individual racism, the other more a result of systemic racism.')
