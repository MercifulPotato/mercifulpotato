Most x86 code looks a lot like it was produced for a RISC chip and ARM has been gaining some more complex instructions and addressing modes. Academics may have felt that RISC was better than CISC for a long time but I don’t think they were predicting the world of today so much as they were incorrectly predicting the near past. If RISC were so much better then we’d have lots of workstations running on modern Alpha or PA-RISC systems. But we don’t see that.')
