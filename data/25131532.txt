The feedback cycle consisted of your readers, who you also read, writing replies... a modern version of letter writing, but in public.  It worked well, in fact it still works well, but it&#x27;s not twitchy enough for modern tastes.<p>The downside of the modern system is that the attention economics encourage hot takes, and the advertising economics encourage pushing only content likely to promote engagement, at the cost of reverse chronological order, and a full feed of everything you thought you signed up to read.<p>Because people are encouraged to act rashly, history in those types of environment is a mine for seeking out poorly thought out statements. It&#x27;s built into the system.<p>The technical fix offered here is to erase history, which makes everyone effectively anonymous, as they can say what the want, causing real world effects, and the evidence disappears after X amount of time.  Do we really want to make twitter and facebook even more like Lord of the Flies?<p>There are other ways to deal with this... limiting the audience of one&#x27;s words to only the friends you have at the current time, and making that stick for all time, is the way to go, in my opinion.  If someone isn&#x27;t in your audience at the time you express a thought, they never will be.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to implement this with the addition of starting and ending times for access.... if I add Bob on November 17, 2020... the default might be to give access starting a Month earlier... and never ending... until it is revoked.<p>Here at HN, wiser people than me set up a system that seems remarkable resistant to &quot;first post&quot; pressure, and more rewarding of reflective contemplation that will stand the test of time.<p>Twitter is going to see this new &quot;feature&quot; heavily used to game a lot of things, once people catch on.')
