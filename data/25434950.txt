As for going more &quot;invasive&quot;, it&#x27;s that exact reason that ads are being attacked, so I wouldn&#x27;t bet on that working out long term either. I also fail to see how logging in inherently leads to revenue, unless we&#x27;re talking about a subscription service in which case it&#x27;ll live or die by the quality of the content....or else no one is going to pay.')
