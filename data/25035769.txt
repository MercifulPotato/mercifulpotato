Do not even get me started on the #@%^$# signup process for Apple TV<p>iCloud: I needed, do not see an easy alternative :(<p>Apple one: yeah, no thanks.<p>Appstore: I needed and it is fine for my needs.<p>Apple Music: Like it, works great for my needs and works fine with Shazam. Do not try to play anything they suggest however. From play lists to &quot;specially for you&quot; it does not even come close to what I want to listen to. Playlist management overall is terrible too.<p>Apple Car Play: NEEDS A WIRE, in 2020! I got a wireless charging thingy in the car (Audi 2019), and keyless entry, but I need a cable to use Car Play: disappointing to say the least.<p>Your other examples: did not know they existed, no need for them.<p>So basically I am using the same old Apple services since day one and see no need at all to switch to anything existing. If they would allow me to host my email from my private domain however...<p>Love the &quot;live long&quot; updates, the interface and the styling of the devices and the (perceived) privacy enough to stick in this ecosystem.')
