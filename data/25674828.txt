Nintendo owned almost half of the UK company, but for reasons unknown never tried to buy Rare outright, despite the fact that the Stampers were clearly on the lookout for buyers.<p>Stamper is at a loss as to why Nintendo didn&#x27;t step in and open up its chequebook:<p>I&#x27;ve no idea why they didn&#x27;t do that. I thought we were a good fit.” [1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nintendolife.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;rare_co-founder_has_no_idea_why_nintendo_didnt_buy_the_studio_outright" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nintendolife.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015&#x2F;08&#x2F;rare_co-founder_ha...</a>')
