For instance, consider this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanbar.org&#x2F;groups&#x2F;professional_responsibility&#x2F;publications&#x2F;model_rules_of_professional_conduct&#x2F;rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanbar.org&#x2F;groups&#x2F;professional_responsibili...</a><p>(d) A lawyer shall not practice with or in the form of a professional corporation or association authorized to practice law for a profit, if: (3) a nonlawyer has the right to direct or control the professional judgment of a lawyer.<p>In general, this means that 1) lawyers don&#x27;t report to non-lawyers, and 2) non-lawyers can be imprisoned for practicing law without a license. That gives lawyers both a professional obligation and a professional power to meet that obligation.<p>Now, I have misgivings about the kind of cartel-building we often see in the ABA, AMA, and so forth. But the truth is, engineers, in the way you&#x27;re using the term (unlicensed software engineers) don&#x27;t have any particular standing as professionals. There are benefits to this, in that we can be considered mere employees if our employers do something dastardly and we went along with it - there are limits to what a mere employee can go along with under the defense of following orders, but there&#x27;s no malpractice. But the flip side is that we aren&#x27;t empowered to hold the line the way licensed professionals are.<p>That makes your willingness to stand up all the more impressive and commendable, but I can&#x27;t really agree that software &quot;engineers&quot; have the kind of power you&#x27;re describing, and it&#x27;s built into the system that way (I put &quot;engineers&quot; that in quotes because in the context of this discussion, licensed PE holders do have more power, but not in the world of software).')
