Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610880665, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809571, text='&gt; what is the actual reason?<p>The reason is that many developers were already selling native Mac and native iOS versions of their apps, and who opted out of providing their iOS app in the Mac App Store — because they already had a Mac app in the Mac App Store! — and then Apple comes along and without permission undercuts the developer&#x27;s own product.<p>Note that Apple allowing this to happen actually violates Apple&#x27;s developer program agreement with third-party developers. Section 6.3 of the agreement covers iOS and iPadOS apps on Mac, while section 7.6 explicitly says No Other Distribution Authorized Under This Agreement. Apple was in breach of contract!<p>This is not further lockdown of the Mac, because from the beginning of iPhone in 2007, Macs never even had the ability to run iOS apps. 2007 to late 2020, no iOS apps on Mac, and nobody was crying lockdown about that. Intel Macs still can&#x27;t do it. Apple wasn&#x27;t violating your legal rights all those years.<p>There is a license agreement with the third-party developer, and unless the developer has opted in to providing the app on the Mac App Store, then distribution of the app to a non-licensed device is illegal. You are free to use licensed apps however you like, but only on licensed devices. For example, you can&#x27;t copy the app you bought to an unlimited number of devices, to your friends devices, etc. It has never been true that you have unlimited use of licensed apps. You can only install a Mac App Store app on up 5 Macs, no more. That&#x27;s not &quot;OS lockdown&quot;.')
