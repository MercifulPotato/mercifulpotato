Several of the people doing the gaming are escalating it to very stupid heights: dozens of LLCs registered, applied for ASNs, used to hijack large amounts of IP space and hijack Comcast&#x2F;Verizon&#x2F;etc IP space to place fraudulent orders.<p>There is a huge amount of CFAA or worse stuff that needs prosecuting - it isn&#x27;t just bots placing orders, it&#x27;s mass amounts of hacked machines and hacked phones being used as proxies and cookies stolen for a valid fingerprint&#x2F;less CAPTCHAs, wire fraud and forgery of documentation being accepted (instead of RPKI&#x2F;proper filtering)<p>Anyone that has a slightly popular (at all, really) will get shady requests asking to &quot;install a SDK&quot; or &quot;buy your extension&quot; which installs malware on your end-users devices.
