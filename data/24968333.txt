I had to re-read everything from the point where you start talking about carrying the thing inside.<p>How about revising law enforcement to a point where property rights don&#x27;t have a de-facto exception for bicycles?

Thought experiment: steal a bike and steal the equivalent value of that bike in cash and imagine the reactions of executive, judicative when the theft gets noticed. It would almost be as if legislatives had added an &quot;except bikes&quot; paragraph to all laws about property ownership.')
