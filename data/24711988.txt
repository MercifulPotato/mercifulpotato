And some of the technologies and services I care most about are those where I understand the people behind them and share their values.<p>Lines like the first one of those two don&#x27;t work with me at all; they&#x27;re targeting an audience that isn&#x27;t me, and they do very much provoke the &quot;uh-huh, what are you selling&quot; reaction.<p>But I <i>do</i> want to see the humans and the humanity in a business. I do want to see a face and a personality and a set of values. <i>If</i> I share those values, I&#x27;m going to be much more enthusiastic about the business, and if I don&#x27;t, I may be less so.<p>It&#x27;s possible to create a cookie-cutter talking-about-the-weather-and-the-pandemic pseudo-personality that&#x27;s kinda uncanny-valley human-ish, but doesn&#x27;t take any chances. But that&#x27;s not going to create that same resonance.<p>So the question then becomes, do you want to be faceless or pseudo-faceless and try to appeal to <i>everyone</i>, or do you want to be yourself, stop hiding the fact that your business has humans in it, and appeal very strongly to people who care about what you care about?')
