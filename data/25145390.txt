There is only so much water and therefore there can only be so many people.  To put it simply: &quot;sorry, New York is full.  We cannot issue you a building permit or allow you to make a water&#x2F;sewer connection.&quot;  Bolinas, CA does this.<p>But oh, no!  We the great and mighty Cities Of Humanity know better than Nature.  We must not accept her limits.  And so they grow without control, and then when Fire or Cholera exposes their overleveraged water account they fall back on Too Big To Fail.  Sorry farmers, we know better, your land is ours now.  We&#x27;re Urbanists, we know what&#x27;s best for you.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in these issues, consider reading <i>Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water</i>.  It&#x27;s long and scholarly and dry (heh) but it will change your perspective on the limits of Nature.  Perhaps you&#x27;ll move somewhere with 100 inches of rainfall per year, like I did.')
