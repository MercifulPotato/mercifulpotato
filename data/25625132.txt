At which point, it becomes an economics discussion. C is usually a choice when pure performance is secondary to other considerations like portability.<p>Most C++ code I see has few vtables, and what vtables exist are mostly removed by the compiler. Java-style inheritance hierarchies are not idiomatic in C++. The code gen for C++ looks a lot like hyper-optimized C code, but without having to write hyper-optimized code. C++ naturally provides much more information about intent to the compiler than C does, and modern compilers are excellent at using that information to provide nearly optimal code gen.')
