Listening to people&#x27;s voices on tiny laptop or iPad speakers is even more annoying.<p>Hearing the bass and midrange in people&#x27;s voices makes them more intelligible, particularly if they have an accent.  It&#x27;s just 100% more pleasant all around.<p>And this is purely an aesthetic thing, but it&#x27;s crazy to me that people seem to listen to music through their phone speaker, let alone their laptop speaker... to me it&#x27;s unrecognizable.<p>----<p>Most people seem to be using the bluetooth speakers these days, which ~10 years ago were extremely bad IMO.  Admittedly I found one that is pretty good recently.<p>But I still think it&#x27;s very much worth it to have real speakers with drivers, speaker wire, and an amplifier in your home.  (Or a powered speaker, although your options are more limited there, and it&#x27;s more expensive.)<p>For traveling the right bluetooth speaker can be alright (there are many bad ones), but after a week of traveling my ears are &quot;relieved&quot; when I get to hear real audio again.<p>----<p>Also: a single kettlebell for ~$45, which I almost think of as a stretching&#x2F;circulation device, and a bicycle used for 10+ years.')
