A human is born into a role to some degree but can use intelligence to change that role as well. This requires some ability to reason about the self, and to some extent being able to reason about the self improves the ability to reason about others.<p>I often see the question asked as &quot;what if there was something that behaved just like you, but without consciousness, isn&#x27;t it just as evolutionarily fit?&quot; But it presupposes that such a creature could exist, and a creature that behaves like a conscious one without consciousness seems like a bizarrely inefficient solution to me.')
