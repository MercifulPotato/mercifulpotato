It makes sense intuitively that those people whose jobs require them to take a COVID-19 test would be over-represented in the case count, and that those jobs would be comparably high-stress.<p>They did not mention job or career choice in the study, nor did they mention stress except in the context of PTSD. They hint that they did not look at socioeconomic factors at all.<p>This is how the bureaucratic elite will eventually try to explain the severe mental health crisis unfolding before us as a biological effect of the novel coronavirus, when in fact, it was caused by their own choices to impose restrictive lockdowns.')
