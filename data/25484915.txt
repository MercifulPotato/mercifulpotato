The impact would be that some subset of existing HIV tests would have to be abandoned. That would impose a cost on the health system.<p>The real issue is that there were other vaccines being developed that were equally effective but which did not have this drawback. If this was the only vaccine available, the health system would have worn the burden of changing HIV test regimes; given several other effective vaccines are becoming available, it wasn&#x27;t clear that the cost of imposing massive changes on HIV testing regimes was justified.')
