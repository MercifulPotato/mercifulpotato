Indeed, shootings are concentrated to a few areas with high crime rates. Doesn&#x27;t mean that people living in those areas don&#x27;t have to watch out. I replied to an anecdote about people living close to such a tavern having to watch out.<p>As for gun murders being a rare death cause, indeed if you average over all age ranges they are. However, for younger people they are a major concern. CDC data [0] lists homicides in the top 4 reasons for death for age groups from 1 until 35. Which weapons are used for these homicides? A different statistic tells us most times it&#x27;s guns [1].<p>And yes, focusing on falls, car accidents and diabetes would be awesome. But preventing gun deaths is important too.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;injury&#x2F;wisqars&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2016-508.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;injury&#x2F;wisqars&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;leading_causes_of_dea...</a><p>[1]: 6.4k murder victims in 2019 from handguns, 3.3k from unspecified firearms, 1.5k from knives or cutting instruments, all other causes below 1k. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;195325&#x2F;murder-victims-in-the-us-by-weapon-used&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;195325&#x2F;murder-victims-in...</a>')
