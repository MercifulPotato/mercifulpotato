That doesn&#x27;t mean that you should ignore all authority (I&#x27;ve never seen that argued).<p>Naturalistic fallacy really depends on how much you value the natural state of things, but it is usually used to point out that just because it is &#x27;natural&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean it is good or sensible to do&#x2F;continue.<p>Appeal to emotion. Appeals to emotion are often used to incite people without them thinking through. &quot;They killed our people!&quot; sounds a lot more convincing&#x2F;inciting than, &quot;They had an altercation which unfortunately escalated, leading to the deaths of several people that we knew&quot;. Using emotion to obscure or not properly think about how it came to be to that point and what should be done from then on.<p>I think you&#x27;re conflating logic (ex: mathematical logic, or far less rigorous careful reasoning) with an overly strict definition of a logical fallacy.')
