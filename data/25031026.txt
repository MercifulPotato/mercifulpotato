Compare this with &quot;What is your testing strategy; what do you think you do well, and where could you improve?&quot; gives you at least a set of tradeoffs.<p>Basically, you want the interviewer to highlight potential problem areas, without speaking about their organization in a way where they can&#x27;t say anything positive about what they do. You can find these details out without giving a laundry list of explicit red flag type questions.')
