If I am engaged in the design of an algorithm, or set thereof, time passes very very quickly and my perception of it is non existent.<p>I have gone for 12 hours without even noticing any time passage, much to the chagrin of my wife and ride-home-needing-daughter.<p>Side effects? Since it’s meditation for me, it’s a relaxing retreat without any visible (at least to me) issues.. I guess I don’t see how long bouts of concentration can be damaging to the psyche.<p>I’ve also noticed that if I narrate my development (as if recording a tutorial) that a I am unable to achieve time travel.  Been doing it for 40 years... yikes..')
