But my very strong advice to others:<p>Do NOT put up with that.<p>You don&#x27;t have to. There are so many companies, even now, where you can get decent work with much more sensible norms.<p>There&#x27;s always kind of a gravitational pull toward excess debt because &quot;get the [fix&#x2F;feature] out there in front of [users&#x2F;client&#x2F;exec]&quot; is such a tempting drug for management, even if they&#x27;re generally good. But the amount and toxicity of the debt varies widely. Find a company that&#x27;s sane about this if you value your own sanity imo.')
