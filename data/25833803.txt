And so it may or may not be justified depending on what you&#x27;re writing...<p>Having gone back and forth with a real editor for a novel, half the effort was a conversation with the editor based on questions about intent and preferred tone and style, in order to come to agreement on things she had flagged as <i>possible</i> issues where it was not clear whether or not a change ought to be made or not.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely going to take a closer look at proselint, though.')
