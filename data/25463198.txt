A moderately fancy one at that. The limiting factor was cost.<p>It&#x27;s not the case anymore. While McDonald&#x27;s is still certainly more expensive than food people regularly eat, but the gap seems to be closing. People just aren&#x27;t satisfied with eating basically potatoes and <i>sometimes</i> some meat. They make fancier meals, but this increases cost. At some point the cost isn&#x27;t all that different from what fast food charges.')
