The iOS system sandboxes the binary, so it can&#x27;t do anything without permission. It can&#x27;t read files, can&#x27;t read data like contacts, can&#x27;t connect to the internet, etc. I think it would be relatively easy for Apple to allow sideloading while maintaining great security. Plus, it would be off by default, so know-nothing users would not be doing it.')
