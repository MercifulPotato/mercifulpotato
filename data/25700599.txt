You put a signal in at one end, and it propagates “slowly” to the other, where you receive the signal, and immediately replay it at the start. Creating a kind of never ending echo.<p>What’s described above relies on a standing wave in a tube, with sensors along the length of the tube to detect nodes and anti-nodes. Then encoding data into that by changing the signal input to change the locations of the nodes and anti-nodes.<p>I don’t think such a system would actually work, because your stuck using only the harmonics of your tube as possible states, and there’s gonna be a pretty limited number that you could realistically produce.')
