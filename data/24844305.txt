These days a 10-15% general gain year over year is quite good, and we&#x27;ve seen gens with less. Order of magnitude is close enough in this case, there isn&#x27;t that much practical difference between a week vs two weeks.<p>&gt;<i>(The poor, anyone using a mobile device, etc).</i><p>Case in point, for much of the population their mobile devices may well be their most powerful ones. A 7 year old PC can still be extremely capable, etc.<p>Also again, this is just another tool idea. A community can use it to whatever degree they deem appropriate, and that can vary dynamically. So in regular times a low volume community might set a very low level, just a few minutes worth say. But if there was a sudden influx, they could temporarily ramp it up for new joiners.')
