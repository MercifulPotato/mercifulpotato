Item(by='david-cako', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607571870, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25358915, text='github is great, both web and mobile (especially mobile).  and their new homepage is great too.<p>target&#x27;s item pages are really good right now.  I love the information density and layout on their site, which to me is suggestive of thoughtful human-oriented design rather than amazon&#x27;s (highly effective) a&#x2F;b test shit shoveling.<p>amazon has &quot;ship-it&quot; UI standards and a lot of variance in page section order (could be a&#x2F;b testing, or just discrete developer teams).<p>they have lots of really interesting ideas scattered around for how they can reach customers with unique contextual information, but I have a hard time with how dynamic the layout is and they also don&#x27;t know how to make good hero pages.  too many over-compressed image banners and image tables.<p>amazon and github both have crappy search which is kind of interesting to me.  amazon sort basically doesn&#x27;t work either, for price or for rating.  not sure why.<p>&#x2F;ecommerce rant lol')
