Time is a factor for the alien evolution. So if you&#x27;ll spend too much time relocating your constructions, you might fall behind aliens and will spend lots of resources to defend your base. That&#x27;ll slow down your research and you&#x27;ll fall behind more. Actually that&#x27;s the only thing that I don&#x27;t like in this game, I wish developers would rebalance the game with 0 time contribution to evolution, as I really love to spend lots of time thinking and rebuilding things and I hate that feeling that I need to move faster. I know that it&#x27;s easy to change coefficients in the game creation screen, but for some reason I don&#x27;t like this approach and prefer to play the game with built-in presets (also, I think, achievements are disabled with custom game presets).')
