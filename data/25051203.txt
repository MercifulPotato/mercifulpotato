Before I left the US around a year and a half ago, I was getting 2-3 calls a day. Basically, if I ever got a call from a number not in my contact list, I would never answer. I know I&#x27;m not the only one like this, but I don&#x27;t have any numbers to back it up. Even in Germany where robocalling seemingly doesn&#x27;t exist, I still have this reflex, so it makes me seriously consider the validity of any phone-based polling.')
