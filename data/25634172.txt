If you were harassing them, for instance, or bullying them, they may have a point and your single point of control over the enterprise may be harmful not just to the worker but to the company.<p>Just because you would <i>like</i> to fire them doesn&#x27;t mean you should, as after all, the fiduciary duty is to the company and not to you personally.<p>That is specifically the value that the union would provide in this case.')
