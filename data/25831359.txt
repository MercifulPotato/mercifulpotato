If those are the only places they can get new converts, they are not going to be wildly successful.<p>Successful extremists do it in the light of day, out in the open. When you broadcast an idea that one in a hundred people will latch on to, and you broadcast it to five people at a time, you&#x27;re not going to get much traction. When you broadcast it to five million people, you&#x27;re going to get fifty thousand converts.<p>Notice how we are not having to seriously deal with a domestic ISIS insurgency (Because it has been very effectively driven into the fringe, where it has very limited reach), but we are currently having to seriously deal with... A lot of other ugly stuff, that has been very successfully spreading through mainstream networks.')
