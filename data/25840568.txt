Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25841183], score=None, time=1611099898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25840066, text='&gt; No parent no matter how poor wants their child to work unless they cannot afford to feed them.<p>Okay, I was a child when my father (who could very much afford to feed our family) set up my first paid (cash, completely under-the-table) computer-related gigs. I would say parents often would want children to work if the work was something that would aid the child’s development and future prospects, even if not necessary for immediate support.<p>What that looks like for a middle class family in a first world information economy and what it looks like for a poorer family in a less developed country is likely to be very different.<p>But its worth noting that child labor standards are historically adopted to force <i>up</i> wages for adult laborers, so that child labor <i>is not</i> necessary for employed parents to be able to feed their children. So while I don’t agree that “no parent, no matter how poor wants their child to work unless they cannot afford to feed them” is true, I do think there are dead-end, body-ruining factory jobs for which that is true, and those are <i>exactly</i> the jobs into which that horrible choice is forced on parents by the economic conditions created by the absence of child labor standards.')
