I heard of possibility to transfer to reserved&#x2F;impossible wallets )<p>- wait a bit for the exchange rate to go up<p>- sell your previously bought bitcoins<p>- pay back the loan<p>Edit: OK, maybe $1B is too small for this scheme to work. But if the wallet would contain say 50% of all bitcoins this would be a possibility.')
