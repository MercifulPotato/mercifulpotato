It was built by some ex-Ableton folk and has a similar polish and depth. I&#x27;m running it on Linux and have no problems connecting to audio or midi devices. I&#x27;m even able to load Windows VST plugins, e.g. Serum, via a wine emulator. It contains some pretty novel features, too, like being able to build complex audio FX as if from legos [2]<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitwig.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitwig.com&#x2F;</a>\n2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-wHHbV8Zw4g&amp;feature=emb_logo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-wHHbV8Zw4g&amp;feature=emb_logo</a>')
