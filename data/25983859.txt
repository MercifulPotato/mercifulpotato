If they only allow sales, they push the trajectory down.  Brokers should not have the power to affect the trajectory of a stock.  It is a conflict of interest for their business.<p>Yes, it would absolutely suck for stock holders if sales were restricted while the price was decreasing.  In addition to not being able to exclusively restrict buying or selling, brokers should also probably be made partially liable for losses incurred as a result of restrictions on sales.  It should also be a huge hit to their brand when they are forced to lock down a stock because of liquidity issues.<p>But at the end of the day, it is a conflict of interest for brokers to artificially affect stock values.  What they did is not currently illegal (so far as I can tell), and it may not have even been their intent to manipulate the market, but there&#x27;s no way around it.  That is exactly what happened.')
