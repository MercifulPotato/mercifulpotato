Do less and deliver something.<p>I&#x27;ve just gotten off two, multi-year projects, the first crashed and burned due to a mismatch between business process, vendors and the skills in the organization to understand what it does and translate that into requirements. \nFrom the development side, we made a lot of stuff. Most of it was junk.<p>The second project arrived at a point underdone. Unable to replace the existing production solution because of a lack of a burning deck. I&#x27;d put this down as a failure as well. Mostly on the strategic leadership side.<p>In the meta sense these projects weren&#x27;t that bad. People got money for doing them, and that money was spent in the economy.<p>Maybe Amazon is onto something with their two pizza teams, and 7 page proposals.')
