This is useful in bundling several parameters into one or simply using them as short UIDs.<p>Of course, you shouldn&#x27;t use this as a means of any real security. However, neither should you rely on hiding ids through randomness as security either. If someone gets their hands on an id that doesn&#x27;t belong to them - they still should not be able to do anything with it.<p>With that in mind, you&#x27;ll get even better performance with a simple url-safe base64 scheme.')
