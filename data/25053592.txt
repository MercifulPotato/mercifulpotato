Cuban Hispanics in Miami vote very differently to people of Mexican extraction in California. That in itself will cause some variation election-to-election.<p>Secondly, and specific to this election: Republicans were very effective in their door-to-door registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns in &quot;new voter&quot; Hispanic communities in Florida and Texas. The Democratic party avoided this because of COVID-19 and it cost them badly.')
