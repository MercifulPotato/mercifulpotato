They care about outcomes, not spec sheets. Sure, they&#x27;ll take the time to spec dunk when the opportunity presents itself. It&#x27;s just rarely the <i>reason</i> they do something, whereas Dell&#x2F;HP&#x2F;whatever want to say &quot;4K SCREEN OMG&quot; on the box regardless of whether that actually leads to a better experience.<p>Apple realizes there&#x27;s diminishing returns in upping the resolution beyond what your eyes can see. So they hit Retina, and then move on to focus on color accuracy, brightness, and contrast.<p>They do this throughout their product stack. Only as much RAM as their phones actually need, because RAM is both costly in terms of BOM and also consumes battery life.<p>Using fewer Megapixels than competing phones because it&#x27;s about the quality, not quantity, when other manufacturers trip over themselves to have the most Megapixels.')
