I ran between two campuses and was called out of class regularly. Novell Netware, Windows 3.11, some BBS stuff? The only thing I didn&#x27;t do was AV work.<p>I took my &quot;job&quot; very seriously. Started though because I was absolute always playing around on every system, which meant admin &#x2F; root access, from the big local educational BBS to the library systems to the academic support stuff (I never played around with the grading system at all thankfully because most of the time it was just because I was blocked from doing something like use a disk in a drive or whatever).<p>Whoever setup these systems did things like whitelist apps, so if you wanted to use windows calculator it was blocked. So I&#x27;d jump into admin and run it from there. Nothing malicious. But I think they did have a bit of a debate (in hindsight) about which way to go, discipline or rope me in. I think the librarians carried the day actually because I&#x27;d been helping them with the netware stuff when I was in library hour (printers not printing &#x2F; computers not working right &#x2F; whatever).')
