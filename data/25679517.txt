If you&#x27;re an attacker then you&#x27;d also need to have a certificate with a matching domain and is signed by a trusted certificate authority. Otherwise the client will see the certificate as untrusted.<p>Having a trusted certificate for a domain you don&#x27;t own is already the &quot;Game Over&quot; scenario for current TLS connections since DNS hijacking is generally much easier.')
