All ethical considerations are processed in our brains. Since we all share a common brain architecture[0], there&#x27;s some core of ethics that&#x27;s encoded in our wetware.<p>There are some basic ethical concepts on which human societies tend to universally agree on. The question is, how much of that comes from our wetware, and how much of it is a function of environmental conditions. It may be that we&#x27;re only born with some most basic building blocks, and any universality we observe comes from humans living in roughly the same social structures, and dealing with roughly the same problems.<p>--<p>[0] - Changing at evolutionary timescales, but essentially fixed wrt. lifetime of a human individual.')
