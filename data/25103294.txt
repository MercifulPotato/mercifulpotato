If you open an issue on my project, at the top, you&#x27;ll get a message explaining that, as shocking as it may be, &quot;debugging requires information.&quot; Then there&#x27;s a checklist of 5-6 items which are the bare minimum required for me to start debugging this app which runs on numerous operating systems and platforms.<p>Despite all of this, about 20% of all issues ever opened in the project have blanket ignored the expectations of the project. The coding part of open source I still love. The administration of the project, and endlessly begging people to follow the guidelines, necessitates occasional sabbaticals to recover my sanity.')
