You don&#x27;t own the device in a completely divorced context, but instead you have an ongoing, unavoidable relationship with the vendor, and that includes a forced lifetime after which the device becomes unusable (for reasons other than actual hardware failure).  This is not unique to Apple, although arguably they&#x27;ve moved to this model faster and further than others.<p>Secondly, there are reasons for this, and they&#x27;re not solely about making more money out of you.  For many (I think actually most) people, it&#x27;s an acceptable trade-off.  They get a good product experience, at least in part because of this ongoing relationship.  For some people, that trade-off doesn&#x27;t work.  These people should not buy an iPhone, nor a Macbook, Apple Watch, or indeed many modern electronic products from many manufacturers.<p>I think it&#x27;s worth explaining this trade-off: in concept, and in specific detail for popular products, so that non-technical people can make informed choices.<p>But both approaches are valid.')
