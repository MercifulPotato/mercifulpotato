A switch with at least 4x 10Gbps ports costs over €300 (whereas 4x 1Gpbs costs about €20).<p>Using 2.5Gbps ports is more cost effective, with switches available at a third of the price of a 10Gbps version and network cards going for about half the price of a 10Gbps port.<p>A literal 10x price increase is not exactly what I&#x27;d call &quot;viable for enthusiasts&quot;. With 802.11ax, WiFi has surpassed ethernet for all practical purposes for end users. You can&#x27;t _rely_ on ax working at full speed, but if you try it and it works, it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper and easier than setting up wired internet.<p>It&#x27;s sad, but this is only the case because network device vendors want to keep cashing in on &quot;enterprise&quot; hardware with ludicrous pricing. Prices have barely dropped over the last 4-5 years on many 10Gbps switches, probably because they&#x27;re mostly used in data centres anyway.<p>I&#x27;ve run into annoyances with 1Gbps ethernet a few times, usually when transferring large files between PC and laptop or from my NAS. After 10 years of universal gigabit ethernet, I somehow felt like it shouldn&#x27;t be faster to copy everything from my laptop to an external SSD and then copy it back to my desktop than sending the data over a short wire connected to both computers, but here we are.')
