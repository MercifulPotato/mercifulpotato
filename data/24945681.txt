Because they are forecasting one time events, there is no way to validate if their models are in the least bit accurate. If you have a X% chance of event happening and it doesn&#x27;t, were you wrong? No because it wasn&#x27;t 100%, and even if you are right, it&#x27;s not terribly meaningful. It would be interesting to see if a site like five thirty-eight modeled all elections results, and then see how accurate they were across all of their predictions. Maybe you would have to look at all predictions with &gt; 70% chance of happening and see if they got 70% of those correct.<p>However, in the end those predictions seem like they could be done by throwing darts at a dart board and we wouldn&#x27;t really know.')
