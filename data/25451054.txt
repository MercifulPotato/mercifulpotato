Item(by='mulmen', descendants=None, kids=[25452037], score=None, time=1608167230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25450817, text='&gt; That went from a reasonable thing that might happen — you&#x27;re temporarily prevented from boarding a plane while you are bearing a highly contagious, deadly illness that can spread to whoever you breath on — to... Now you&#x27;re labeled a terrorist because you got sick?<p>To be clear, I am not talking about temporarily preventing sick people from boarding planes.  I&#x27;m talking about DHS drawing their own conclusions from FDA&#x2F;medical data.  The scare quotes on &quot;common sense&quot; were meant to point this out.  Preventing infectious people from boarding a plane is reasonable.  That means FDA may very well share data with DHS and feel perfectly fine about it.  But how does DHS achieve this?  Do they diligently maintain a list of diagnosed individuals and scrub names when those people are healthy?  Or do they re-purpose an existing mechanism that has the desired immediate effect?<p>The &quot;no fly list&quot; also contains terrorism suspects.  These lists existed before Covid and contain names of people who have never been suspected of wrongdoing but just share a name with someone who is, or not, who knows.  These individuals still live with the consequences of being suspected terrorists.<p>This is the terrorist connotation I speak of.  It is not a stretch.  Check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_Fly_List#Notable_cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;No_Fly_List#Notable_cases</a>.<p>&gt; Why do you think having at-home tests will suddenly result in labeling every positive case a terrorist?<p>I didn&#x27;t say this.<p>&gt; I feel like the main stretch of imagination here that I find difficult to believe is that everyone who contracts COVID (which will likely be millions more Americans) will be labeled a terrorist,because they took the test at home instead of at a doctor&#x27;s office or testing site.<p>I didn&#x27;t say everyone.  In fact my hypothetical constructs a situation where minorities are disproportionately placed on the lists.  The macro outcomes lead to micro outcomes which lead to further macro outcomes.  This is systemic bias.<p>Regarding the difference between home and on-site tests: is the home test data protected the same way as other tests?  How many people have <i>not</i> been tested because they are afraid of a situation like my hypothetical?<p>Can LEO get a search warrant for your home, find the testing device and retrieve the results?  What if they search your phone?')
