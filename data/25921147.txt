It&#x27;s not even remotely optional: without remembering there&#x27;s no learning.</i><p>This is different from the phrase in your first paragraph that stated:<p>&gt;<i>All learning amounts to remembering.</i><p>There is a difference between saying that remembering is a necessary condition for learning, and saying that remembering <i>is</i> learning.<p>Memory plays a role in learning. Does it play the biggest role? Let&#x27;s assume it does. Is learning only memory? I don&#x27;t think so. Did you not mean to say that all learning is remembering and but wrote so even though your thoughts on that are more nuanced? Probably.<p>&gt;<i>And inversely, discovering ourselves what we learn or applying are both optional. I can listen to a professor tell me about something someone else discovered, and never apply it, but as long as I remember that information, I have learned it.</i><p>See, here again I&#x27;ll have to disagree. I&#x27;m looking at it from the standpoint of output and outcome of a system where that output is not simply information retrieval.<p>Let&#x27;s say the information is about driving. I can have a driving manual memorized. Can I remember that information about driving? Yes. Have I &quot;learned&quot; driving? No.')
