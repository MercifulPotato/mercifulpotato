That game is just way too difficult for a mainstream audience so it makes a poor platform to milk microtransactions.<p>The rest of the Dirt series (same name, very different game) might continue to exist to complement their NFS car game lineup.<p>Most likely though is that EA only wanted the licenses to F1 and WRC series.')
