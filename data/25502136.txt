They will probably enjoy it a lot, because from the perspective of each, they can do the &quot;easier&quot; part (easier for them, than is). And the quality will probably be high, because each is working on what they know best, and what they enjoy.<p>However, from the average manager&#x27;s perspective...<p>What happens if one of these two takes a vacation, and you decide to put in the sprint something that the other one sucks at? (Planning? What planning? This is Agile!)<p>What happens if you later decide you could save some money by moving one of them to another project, and leaving the other one to handle it all?<p>Also, what if one of them asks for a raise?')
