More authentic and tastes nice.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried them as I&#x27;m not from the states. I&#x27;m Indian though and found the buttermilk company products to be highly priced and didn&#x27;t find anything novel when compared to Haldirams or MTR. At their price you could probably get food from a takeaway.')
