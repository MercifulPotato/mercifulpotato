If an agent follows a strategy of always choosing the opposite of what the algorithm predicts, then the algorithm&#x27;s prediction will always be incorrect.  A &quot;true future predicting algorithm&quot; cannot correctly predict the actions of certain kinds of agents, as long as those agents can observe the prediction.')
