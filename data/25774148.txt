You can&#x27;t give 400 million american a nice car, a big house with a view on the ocean, 100% organic food and access to top level healthcare and education. Unless you produce those thing at that scale, and some things are by definition not scalable (there is only one &quot;best medical school in the US&quot;). So some people have more power to get access to&#x2F;acquire those desirable items. And software engineers are often amongst the first in line. If you want other people to have a better access to these, by definition that leads to current &quot;first in line&quot; to loose something.<p>Giving more money to everyone is easy, everyone was a billionaire in Zimbabwe few years back. That did not make them &quot;rich&quot;.')
