Maybe known to insiders at eFabless.<p>Seriously where do you see any public mention of &quot;caravel&quot; three months ago?  There&#x27;s absolutely nothing about it on the mailing lists [1] [2].<p>&gt; it was announced at the start of the program<p>Where?<p>I heard about this in late July and have been following this very closely since they posted the design rules in early September.  I&#x27;ve probably read through the DRC rule document more closely than anybody outside of Google&#x2F;Skywater&#x2F;eFabless.   Two weeks ago there was nothing anywhere in any of that about having to use their &quot;Caravel&quot; management padframe.<p>As of 15-Sep (git commit 107103f922db43408f59a1540cd4bd3737b30172) the text &quot;caravel&quot; does not appear anywhere in the PDK [3].  I checked  with:<p><pre><code>  $ find . -not -type d -exec grep -Hi caravel {} \\;\n</code></pre>\nThis was sprung on us two weeks before the deadline.  Not cool.  A lot of karma and goodwill burned.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;d&#x2F;forum&#x2F;skywater-pdk-announce" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;d&#x2F;forum&#x2F;skywater-pdk-announce</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;skywater-pdk-users" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;skywater-pdk-users</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;skywater-pdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;skywater-pdk</a>')
