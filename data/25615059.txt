Or it should be much easier for abuse victims in the US compared to e.g. Nordic countries where corporate ownership information is fully public. Since I find no evidence of such a difference it would seem this is just the usual case of rich people using actually disadvantaged people as a cover for their bullshit.<p>(Though I feel like there&#x27;s maybe a more direct solution to this aspect, maybe something with a nice slogan you can chant at marches...)')
