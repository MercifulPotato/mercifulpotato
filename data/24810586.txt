Consciousness and cognition have an uncomfortable resemblance to what we used to call &quot;spirit&quot;.<p>It reminds me of the &quot;uncanny valley&quot;, how some machines are starting to behave awfully close to living creatures; and machine learning (&quot;artificial intelligence&quot;) producing results that seem as if there&#x27;s an awareness, a mind of its own.<p>We know that they are just mechanisms, all matter and no spirit, but our guts sense a kinship - we have an emotional reaction to life or things that act like they&#x27;re alive, like they&#x27;re thinking. We look at an ant, moving around in the world, sensing and feeling, looking back at us with its eyes - and most of us would &quot;anthropomorphise&quot; it, to relate to it as &quot;one of us&quot;. Our subjective experience tells us that we&#x27;re not just objects, but something more, special, magical even.<p>But, having rid of magic, science must understand and explain convincingly the mystery of life and mind, the very strange material existence of ourselves.<p>Looking at how slime moulds crawl through mazes to find food, I get an uncanny feeling that it&#x27;s alive and has a primitive mind. Or those sped-up films of plants reaching out their vines and tendrils, holding onto things and climbing toward the light - it has something in common with us at a fundamental level.<p>Science offers explanations for these phenomena, yes - but it seems there are still missing pieces, concepts, models, to tell the full story. Self-organization of matter, swarm behaviors, distributed intelligence, information and computation..')
