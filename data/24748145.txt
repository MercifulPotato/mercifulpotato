Item(by='nkurz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602442824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738358, text='&gt; This is how Lewis D. Wheeler, a Boston-based white male actor, found himself holed up in a studio for days listening to and repeating snippets of Nixon’s audio. There were hundreds of snippets, each only a few seconds long...\nWheeler’s job was to re-record each snippet in his own voice, matching the exact rhythm and intonation. These little bits were then fed into Respeecher’s algorithm to map his voice to Nixon’s.<p>It would be nice to hear what the actor was able to produce directly, before it was &quot;mapped&quot; to be Nixon.   With the amount of effort that was spent, I&#x27;d presume that there are actors good enough to create a convincing fakes even without the post-processing.  Are there any before-and-after samples available?')
