If we assume that the price of the car stays the same, insurance and fuel still have to be paid and the cab app gets their cut - how much of my ride is really attributable to the cost of the human driver? So how much human labor can be automated away to the benefit of consumers? Not much I think.<p>Given current hardware prices, it seems like the car itself will be a lot more expensive; so how many trips need to be taken so that the variable cost advantage exceeds the increased fixed cost?<p>Driving is a ubiquitous human skill and tens of millions are looking for work, I believe it will be difficult to undercut them on price.<p>Drivers also often do more than merely drive - they help with the luggage, they clean the car, they can talk about their city.<p>Long-haul trucking is a different story, there is a massive labor shortage and letting big rigs go from one warehouse to another without the need of a driver looks like a huge opportunity.')
