I believed this because I felt like I follow a set of content creators which where pretty far outside the &quot;mainstream&quot;, since I didn&#x27;t observe them having &quot;superstar&quot; numbers, nor did I ever see them casually mentioned outside of their own content.<p>Looking at the data, all of them are in the top 2,000 Patreon users and most of them are in the top 1,000. Here&#x27;s a compacted list:<p><pre><code>    | Creator Name              | Patreon Rank | Estimated Monthly |\n    |                           |              | Income (Patreon)  |\n    |---------------------------|--------------|-------------------|\n    | Well Thereâ€™s Your Problem | 108          | $11,196.00        |\n    | LoadingReadyRun           | 411          | $14,772.00        |\n    | Jay Foreman               | 995          | $2,620.00         |\n    | Summoning Salt            | 1478         | $2,026.00         |\n    | Wendover Productions      | 1684         | $2,220.00         |\n    | Practical Engineering     | 1872         | $1,600.00         |\n</code></pre>\nThe creator that stands out most is the #1 spot holder, the &quot;Well There&#x27;s Your Problem&quot; podcast. It&#x27;s a podcast about engineering disasters, each recounted in a very irreverent and roundabout style. I primarily watch this podcast through YouTube, and their YouTube content gets what I&#x27;d consider very &quot;acceptable&quot; view rates, on the order of 50k - 90k total views. From that, I would have expected them to fall more in the ~$1,000 tier of monthly Patreon income, but instead they&#x27;re enjoying wild success.<p>I have to assume their success comes from them doing well on platforms outside of YouTube, and their consistent marketing of Patreon rewards (additional content for Patreon subscribers).<p>Goes to show that there&#x27;s more than one way to find success, though the number of paths still seems pretty constrained.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphtreon.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphtreon.com</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalmusicnews.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;02&#x2F;patreon-content-creators-monthly-minimum-wage&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalmusicnews.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;02&#x2F;patreon-content-...</a>')
