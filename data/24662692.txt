It&#x27;s like the hypnotic induction (to make you connect to your identity as a consumer) that starts with talking about &quot;our smartphones&quot;.<p>For a long time I would wind up seeing Becky Quick interview Buffet a few times a year on CNBC,  it got cringeworthy when his dementia got worse and he started to leer at her.  (Becky Quick is a &quot;babe&quot;)  Once upon a time he was a genius investor,  but he&#x27;s not what he used to be and they don&#x27;t have a successor in the works.<p>For me,  I deleted my LinkedIn account recently because it had brought a remarkable number of time-wasters into my life.')
