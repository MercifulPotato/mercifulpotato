I&#x27;m a musician too. The answer is that they&#x27;re making do with whatever they&#x27;ve got, because it happened suddenly and everybody had to scramble. When the lockdown started, I bought them some good microphones, and to be honest, even mainstream headphones have pretty good fidelity.<p>Possibly a bigger issue is having a place where they can work. If you&#x27;ve ever heard a podcast ruined by background noise, you know what I mean.<p>I think that musicians are particularly adept at mentally filtering out shortcomings of the audio &quot;stack&quot; when they need to, and hear what they need to hear. There are still seminal recordings that are only available as scratchy phonograph records and tapes made with primitive microphones. Maybe it&#x27;s because we process music at a symbolic level. And it&#x27;s possible to focus the lessons on the things that can be done remotely. By the time they reach college, they&#x27;re already playing at an exceptionally high level.<p>A friend of mine who&#x27;s a music professor at another university says that he encourages students to use &quot;whatever works&quot; including their cell phones, so that the mechanics of recording don&#x27;t distract from learning music. They&#x27;ve always had to deal with issues such as students who can&#x27;t afford professional quality instruments.<p>Of course they&#x27;re missing out on ensemble playing.')
