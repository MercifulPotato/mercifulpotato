I sold it a could years later at a loss as it looked like it was not going to take off.  That is the same technology that today underlies their success in crypto and AI.  That is to say picking a random start year to compare individual returns is kind of silly in my opinion.  The real lesson is to buy quality companies that are doing new and interesting things and then don’t look at them for ten years.<p>I will say the one difference between Tesla and Nvidia is that Tesla drives their own demand.  They aren’t waiting for someone to come up with a good use for cars they are making something with an already established market better.  Nvidia made something that took a long time to find its killer use case at a scale that mattered for the company’s bottom line.')
