The main reason might be attributed to the fact Bitcoin scripts don&#x27;t have for loops and Ethereum does allow looping and other more complicated operations.<p>That Ethereum <i>seems</i> superior is just an effect of marketing and language around their scene. It helps they have people who can quickly say seemingly smart things (think GPT-3) that no sane person can parse in a short amount of time to arrive at knowledge. The system is overly complicated for a single individual to understand and trust easily. It may well be very difficult or impossible to tell if a given contract is secure or not.<p>In reality, there are very few mainstream &quot;killer&quot; use cases being served by Ethereum, although they do entertain themselves by trying to &quot;break&quot; each other&#x27;s contracts. The most famous case was when the authors of Ethereum rolled back the chain to get their own coins back from a clever &quot;hacker&quot;.<p>The fact is, that individual followed the rules and still lost the coin they were due them by contract! That&#x27;s not happened with Bitcoin, at least on mainchain.')
