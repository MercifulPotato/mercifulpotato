Also tried on Steam (linux), but couldn&#x27;t get it started beyond the intro screen and I don&#x27;t care to debug further.<p>I only dive into a couple games a year (RDR2 last year), so I&#x27;m not going to waste my time until it&#x27;s stable.  I just want to buy the game, take a few days off of work, and immerse myself.  If I want to debug things or deal with glitches, I can just go back to work.')
