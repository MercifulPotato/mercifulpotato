Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=[24805897], score=None, time=1602876375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24803775, text='&gt; Anything that isn&#x27;t well understood or known in advance of someone engaging in an activity, and then later faces unfair retribution because apparently they didn&#x27;t do what wasn&#x27;t told to them that needed be done, or did something that wasn&#x27;t told to them shouldn&#x27;t be done.<p>Your argument self-contradicts.  You assert, broadly, if it&#x27;s legal it&#x27;s OK.  The &quot;unfair retribution&quot; of people getting annoyed about it and complaining is also legal, so that should be OK, too.  :P<p>&gt; Now, yes I understand that maybe when you said hey this is open source with Apache license, you had in mind an audience of students, or one man startups, or hobbyist, or amateurs, and hadn&#x27;t really thought if it applied to big corps.<p>Nah, when I said &quot;Apache License&quot;, I meant that legal license.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean doing some things that effectively cost nothing, that exceed the license requirements, aren&#x27;t socially customary.<p>There&#x27;s no law that says you have to say &quot;thank you&quot; when someone renders you a service or has made something that makes your life easier or lets you make a bunch of money, but if you stand on legal grounds to avoid saying &quot;thanks&quot; you might be a dick, and people might call you out for being a dick.')
