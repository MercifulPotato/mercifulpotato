Longer names are good except where shorter names well known and widely agreed upon idioms (example: I always type `acc` in a `reduce` callback, because that’s the convention; but I always type `index` instead of `i`, because single-letter names are frequently ambiguous). Explicit types at interface&#x2F;module boundaries are better than implicit&#x2F;inferred types because they prevent regressions, surprises, breaking changes and sweeping contract changes that wouldn’t otherwise be necessary. Stricter rules are easier to comply with than more flexible rules; typing a semicolon at the end of every statement accepting one is significantly less cognitive load than remembering which ones are special and no more burdensome than correcting surprising mistakes. And those benefits are significantly more valuable than fewer punctuation marks and keystrokes.')
