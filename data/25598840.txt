The value of all BTC is a tiny microscopic speck compared to the amount of USD or gold in the world.<p>This means (among other things) a few small players (with tiny capital relative to, say, the size of all USD) can swing the BTC market either way with a comparatively tiny amount of value moving around.<p>That would seem to greatly limit BTC&#x27;s usefulness as any kind of inflation gauge for the broader economy.')
