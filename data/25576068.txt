Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=[25579726], score=None, time=1609282435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569142, text='&gt; the way libertarians tend to imagine them<p>I don&#x27;t know where your information is coming from, but it isn&#x27;t libertarianism. Under libertarianism, your rights are inalienable, and supersede contractual rights. Hence, you cannot sell yourself into slavery, because your right to liberty supersedes any contract. You can agree to work more than X hours per week, but you cannot be forced to stick to that agreement. Libertarianism only applies to legally consenting adults. Others (like children) have additional legal rights, such as not being bound by contracts.<p>There are many different meanings of &quot;free&quot;. Common misunderstandings of libertarianism come from conflating different meanings of &quot;free&quot;. The free in free markets generally means free from force or fraud.<p>As for &quot;hasty collapse&quot;, the US was a reasonable approximation to a free market in its first century, excluding the slave south, and went from subsistence farming to superpower. This also saw the greatest mass rise from poverty to wealth the world has ever seen.<p>As for other countries, the more they embraced free markets, the more they prospered.')
