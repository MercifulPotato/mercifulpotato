Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604952790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25038234, text='&gt; but &quot;is it worth it&quot; for smaller companies to have workers in other countries<p>There are a couple of options:<p>1) There are a lot of accounting&#x2F;law&#x2F;etc firms willing to setup a local subsidiary for you and do all the necessary paperwork and book-keeping. All you have to do is pay them $$$ and sign the stuff they send you. They&#x27;ll tell you when to have board meetings and spoon-feed you the resolutions the directors need to pass, etc (e.g. in some jurisdictions the directors need to review the accounts once a year and pass a resolution saying the business is still solvent – so long as the parent company is guaranteeing the subsidiary, this turns into a pro forma exercise, since the subsidiary will rely on the parent company&#x27;s guarantee to ensure its own solvency)<p>2) There are firms (e.g. Gitlab uses Safeguard and Remote) which will employ people for you in another country. You just pay them $$$ and they legally employ the employees and look after tax&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;etc. Technically they are contractors who are employees of this agency but you can treat them like employees.<p>Now, both options can be expensive. (Option 2 may be cheaper for a small number of employees, soon option 1 will become cheaper.) But, it is really a question – if it costs $X extra to employ person Y in country Z, is person Y worth paying $X extra for?')
