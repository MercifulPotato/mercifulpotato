The Assembly has 80 seats so 67&#x2F;80 is 83.75% and therefore wouldn&#x27;t be enough to amend Prop 22.<p>One big difference between that change to AB5 and this one is that almost zero journalists actually wanted AB5 to apply to them.  Journalism is profession that is much closer to true freelance work than rideshare workers who flip back and forth between a couple employers.')
