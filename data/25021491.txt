Let me be more precise: &quot;Ortholinearity is an important ergonomic feature that any keyboard that claims to be both &quot;ultimate&quot; and &quot;ergonomic&quot; absolutely must have.&quot;<p>&gt; I have seen no research suggesting that staggering is as important as wrist angle&#x2F;position - or even statistically relevant for that matter<p>That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s been very little, if any, research done in this area at <i>all</i>, so we&#x27;ll have to rely on other things - namely, the combination of (1) the culturally well-known &quot;Emacs pinkie&quot; that results exclusively from lateral finger movement and (2) the facts that (a) RSI is much more likely to result from weak muscle motions and (b) lateral finger movements are weak muscle motions relative to medial finger movements. Together, these show that ortholinearity is better than staggered rows - so unless you have a scientific paper or higher-priority first-principles arguments that contradict this, then you&#x27;re obligated to accept this conclusion.<p>&gt; Perfection is the enemy of good.<p>This has nothing to do with &quot;perfection&quot;. Ortholinearity is an extremely easy and <i>extremely cheap</i> keyboard design choice. There&#x27;s absolutely no extra hardware you have to add to your design - all you do is move the keys around a tiny bit. It&#x27;s strictly superior to staggered rows, and there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to choose staggered rows unless you&#x27;re concerned with scaring consumers away from the design.<p>&gt; A $40 staggered split layout like the Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 that&#x27;s affordable to most users will do far more benefit than a $300 mechanical ortholinear device that most people will never have.<p>Please leave your utilitarian value ethics out of this - this has nothing to do with &quot;the most good&quot; and everything to do with &quot;whether the keyboard design is ergonomic or not&quot;.<p>Finally, as stated above, ortholinearity is extremely inexpensive to add to a design, and could just as easily be grafted onto a cheap $40 keyboard as to an expensive build like this one. Pretending that the choice of ortholinearity vs. staggered rows has anything to do with cost is crazy.')
