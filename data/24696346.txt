Not even light can escape. At the event horizon, time replaces space and points only forward. The flow of time carries everything towards a singularity furthest inside the black hole, where density is infinite and time ends.&quot;<p>I enjoy reading passages like that because there&#x27;s a point where I lose comprehension completely - after &quot;Not even light can escape&quot; - and the rest of it is enjoyably poetic gibberish to a non-physicist like me. It reminds me of the beginning of The Four Quartets by TS Eliot:<p><pre><code>  Time present and time past\n  Are both perhaps present in time future,\n  And time future contained in time past.\n  If all time is eternally present\n  All time is unredeemable.\n  What might have been is an abstraction\n  Remaining a perpetual possibility\n  Only in a world of speculation.\n  What might have been and what has been\n  Point to one end, which is always present.</code></pre>')
