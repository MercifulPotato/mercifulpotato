I don&#x27;t really use IM all that much, so it&#x27;s not a big deal for me from privacy standpoint, but I&#x27;m not going to switch to yet another centralized service. I&#x27;d probably be alone there anyway, I doubt most of my contacts will care about this.<p>I&#x27;ll wait for a distributed E2E IM or death from old age, whichever comes first.')
