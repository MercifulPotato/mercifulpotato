You can allege things all day long, but the fact is that your claims don&#x27;t bear out in reality.<p>&gt; We should tell the kids mining cobalt in congo that Elon Musk&#x27;s family wealth is in fact, not from an emerald mine and that Elon is a good guy after all!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yourlogicalfallacyis.com&#x2F;appeal-to-emotion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yourlogicalfallacyis.com&#x2F;appeal-to-emotion</a><p>Even though completely unrelated to what is being discussed, since you brought it up: Tesla has constantly re-iterated their commitment to responsible sourcing of minerals up and down their supply chain in their filings (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;ns_videos&#x2F;2019-tesla-impact-report.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;ns_videos&#x2F;2019-tesla-impact-report.pdf</a>).
