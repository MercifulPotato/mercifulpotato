Item(by='NalNezumi', descendants=None, kids=[25382705], score=None, time=1607661895, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25382297, text='I&#x27;d add a option to &quot;rent &amp; option to buy&quot;. It goes both ways: I have a pricey guitar lying around that I haven&#x27;t used for 2year+, but haven&#x27;t come around to quite sell it (because I <i>might</i> one day pick it up again, as I used to be very good at it). It could be quite a great thing to rent to young music students (like I used to be) that want a fairly good sounding guitar. Some years down the line having the option to just sell it might be nice for both.<p>The real added value is like the instruments above: you want something for a couple of years, and there&#x27;s quite a lot of people out there that already <i>own</i> it (and is past year of using it). Although, second-hand shop already covers this usage, by people buying (console, instruments etc) it and using it for the years, and then re-sell it on second-hand. It only covers certain products so you might find a niche, maybe.<p>I&#x27;d say the most usefulness in the idea is what I see as a local problem around me:<p>I live in Tokyo right now, for work, so I wont stay here 1-2years+. There&#x27;s a lot of people like this in Tokyo, it&#x27;s often called &quot;a transit city&quot; by expats. Furnished apartments here is a thing, but its quite expensive and limited. For someone newly arrived, just renting the furniture might be a useful option. (but I don&#x27;t quite see <i>who</i> would only rent furniture, since storage is a problem while not being rented)')
