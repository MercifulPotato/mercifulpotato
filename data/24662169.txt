Why? Because successful people don&#x27;t network. They build relationships.<p>I&#x27;ve felt for a long time that there is no such thing as &quot;networking&quot; as its own activity. You build a network by just having life experiences and interests- hobbies, clubs, other parents from school if you have kids, religion, volunteering, side projects, alumni associations, and of course people you&#x27;ve worked with in the past. These relationships need to have some sort of basis other than you wanting something like a job or opportunities.')
