At some point it just becomes cheaper to use software and robots.<p>Look at McDonalds.  In high wage areas, they use the automated ordering kiosks, but in low wage areas they still have humans taking orders.  Because they did the math and realized the machines are cheaper than a $15&#x2F;hr wage.<p>My supermarket just massively increased the self checkout area, doubling its size.  It&#x27;s no coincidence that minimum wage in our area goes up to $15.65 in five weeks.<p>Unions are a good thing, but they have a very fine line to walk between protecting workers and changing the calculus towards eliminating the workers altogether.')
