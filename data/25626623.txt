I set this up on an Android app we delivered. There&#x27;s even companies that pay other Android apps to host their code inside the app, co-related that ID to other data available to the web (e.g. IP address, installed fonts, etc) to provide a very good guess of a user&#x27;s device id via the web.<p>Apple had something similar, but you&#x27;re right they&#x27;re starting to turn it off. In my past life in Adtech we noticed the click through rate of users with Android user agents were a lot higher on certain campaigns than iOS users for this reason.')
