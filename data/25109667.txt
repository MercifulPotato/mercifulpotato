They&#x27;ve been integrating into Europe since the 15th century with no measurable success. The Communists tried that hard, too; they gave them free housing, many privileges like they could get into any university without exams. Yet, it would help if you watched documentaries of what they turned those apartment buildings into - the whole complex had to be destroyed as it was inhabitable.<p>Again and again, a &quot;gypsy&quot; is not a matter of race or ethnicity as there are many well-integrated gypsies who distance themselves from the other gypsies, nobody calls them or considers them to be gypsies - being a gypsy is a matter of social irresponsibility, not following any laws, and having crime (mostly theft) as heritage.<p>If you look into recent genetic studies, gypsies are descendants from the untouchables caste in India. The same thing they do in Bulgaria and Romania, they&#x27;ve been doing in India, and that&#x27;s why they were persecuted and moved from Asia to Europe. They were not a different race back in India!<p>The problem is this &quot;heritage.&quot; Not all heritage should be cherished and preserved. As an extreme example, I will give you cannibalism.<p>Gypsies teach their kids to pickpocket at an early age. It&#x27;s not considered immoral. In fact, in gypsy culture, theft is only when you take away gold or silver. It&#x27;s not only a way to make a living for them, but they also consider it an intellectual challenge - how to outsmart people.<p>Another gypsy heritage is the bride marketplace. Women in the 21st century are sold like cattle. There are tons of documentaries on the subject. Should this heritage be preserved and celebrated, too?<p>So, let&#x27;s stop calling Bulgarians and Romanians racists! We&#x27;re not. It&#x27;s been 500 years already, and gypsies have killed more Bulgarians and Romanians than Bulgarians and Romanians have killed gypsies. Yes, often older people in the villages are getting tortured and killed over 5 euros.<p>I can speak about Bulgaria, which has been a multicultural country way before many new Western democracies. We&#x27;ve welcomed thousands and thousands of Armenian refugees; we live in peace with Bulgarian Turks. We have many Jews - we saved all our Jews during WWII even if we were allies of Germany. We have Russians, Greek, Italians, Macedonians, and Serbians living in Bulgaria. During Communism, many Libyans, Lebanese, and Syrians came to study in Bulgaria, get married and stayed. I can&#x27;t recall any racism and ethnicism against any of them - there&#x27;s a different attitude only toward gypsies!<p>Regarding the pocket-picking - I had a currency exchange business on the main street, and I&#x27;ve witnessed in the past many gypsy troupes &quot;working&quot; tourists. Of course, they wouldn&#x27;t try to pickpocket from Bulgarians as when they see a gypsy, everybody grabs their bags and protects their belongings. With Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU, these troupes are now all over Europe. Back to when I had that business - often gypsies were coming to me offering me 20% of what they steal if I let them &quot;work&quot; in the store!<p>And, please, let&#x27;s not victimize them and point fingers at Bulgarians and Romanians - they are victims but of their own &quot;cultural&quot; heritage! The change can only change if kids are not allowed to be &quot;trained&quot; into being a &quot;gypsy&quot; (the social behavior) by their parents! I don&#x27;t get why &quot;racist heritage&quot; could be bashed, but &quot;theft heritage&quot; cannot be!')
