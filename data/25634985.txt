If I had to pay subscription for every piece of software I own I&#x27;d be ruined. With perpetual licenses however I only update &#x2F; upgrade when I feel there is a benefit in it for me. Otherwise that old copy keeps working. I suspect I am not alone here.<p>As for not being relevant: so far I do not feel any lack of software offerings with perpetual licenses so allow me to disagree. I maybe irrelevant to your strict business model but not to the overall market.')
