But...so what?<p>&gt; and being ridiculously self-congratulatory about this when the correct response is to laugh at the silly pointless frivolity of it<p>For the same reasons Python is often a valuable choice, a faster Python is a valuable option.<p>&gt; Trying to make Python fast is a fool’s errand, because Python is slow by design.<p>Python is not slow by design, though it&#x27;s slow because it&#x27;s not fast by design. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not useful to have a faster Python, only that there are likely to be limits and trade-offs involved in doing that.<p>&gt; A useful argument would be that Python is faster overall at solving various real-world problems than current alternatives; but that’s not the popular argument being made<p>Yes, actually, it is. It&#x27;s not the message of the Pyston v2 release blog entry, but then that blog entry isn&#x27;t making an argument in the debate that you seem to want everything to be about.')
