The way to achieve &quot;racial equity&quot; is to provide better education and job opportunities to help bring under-performing populations up to par, and then their children will grow up in better school districts and have higher standards and expectations as well.<p>At least, that&#x27;s the theory.  There are no magic wands to cause these kinds of massive socio-economic changes overnight, but this sounds like a good step in the right direction.<p>If anything, I might question why &quot;only&quot; $100m? A corporation that currently has $191B in cash could presumably afford to part with more than that.  But, a small step in the right direction is better than none, and certainly sets a great example of corporate good citizenship.')
