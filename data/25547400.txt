I&#x27;m blown away by how similar it is to WoW, it kinda feels a little like the later Might &amp; Magic&#x27;s. There&#x27;s clearly an evolution at play. Especially in UI.<p>Anyway, I got past the stiffness of it and it&#x27;s kinda fun. Can&#x27;t seem to change my fonts so its a bit of an eye chart thought. LOL. Good stuff!')
