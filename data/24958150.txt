I actually enjoy that city and don&#x27;t find it depressing. It is a big city but it does not feel oppressive.<p>A lot of new modern buildings have been erected downtown and the city is quite clean.<p>As for the corruption, it is very visible on the roads. They are constantly redoing the roads and yet there are still a lot of potholes. The weather is not an excuse, roads are much better in Ontario.<p>Also I don&#x27;t know if it is still the case but you could read occasionally in the news some housing construction buildings being burnt.')
