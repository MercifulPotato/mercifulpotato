To add to their comment, I&#x27;ll say the difference here is the precision needed for LIGO is with a more or less static equipment you can tweak. This requires plasma stability during a dynamic, very chaotic system. You do tweak the static parts, the laser and related apparatus, the target and what holds it in place, various diagnostics, but the actual process itself is a very dynamic explosion that it itself is hard to understand or predict fully a priori, and certainly not to the degree we understand gravitational waves at the point of detection at LIGO.<p>I mean, as I said elsewhere, the reason we don&#x27;t have fusion for any fusion experiment is plasma instabilities, at this point that fact is like saying the reason ice cream melts in the sun is because it&#x27;s hot. It&#x27;s a fact of all fusion experiments. The only system we know of that can achieve net gain fusion we know of is gravitational confinement which uses a big mass to contain the hot plasma, also known as a star.')
