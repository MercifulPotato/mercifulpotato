Didn&#x27;t end up getting it added to the errata since we reported it against an engineering sample, but just added a sentence about how &#x27;this status bit flag is &quot;unreliable&quot;&#x27; buried somewhere in the middle of the first public release of the reference manual without any warnings as to what that implies downstream.  At least it went in the real docs I guess.  But this was after them ghosting us about this, so the whole encounter still left a bad taste in my mouth.')
