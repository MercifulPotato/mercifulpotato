MacBooks have always had worst-in-class thermal designs, as Apple prioritized looks over function on that. Hence why there&#x27;s no visible vents.<p>What a 15 MBP can and can&#x27;t cool is therefore not very interesting. Thermally it&#x27;s terrible. 45W is still going to be a challenge for other designs, but it <i>can</i> (and has) been done without being deafeningly loud like a MBP or monstrously thick. Simply having intake &amp; exhaust vents beyond just the keyboard &amp; hinge alone <i>massively</i> improves things here. But yes you will hear it under sustained load. But you&#x27;re also doing whatever you&#x27;re doing a lot faster as  a result - it&#x27;s a tradeoff here. You could always disable half the cores if you don&#x27;t like the 45W, Intel will sell you quad cores all day long quite happily.')
