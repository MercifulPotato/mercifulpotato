UL94 is basically 100LL but without the lead, so we certainly know how to produce it worldwide at decent cost.<p>- Most planes could switch without any change<p>- Yes, in some cases, changes would be needed, like<p><pre><code>  - detuning.\n\n  - installing an electronic ignition timing system.\n\n  - Installing a new engine, either a newer gasoline engine, a diesel engine, or a turbine engine.\n\n  - Scrapping the plane and buying a new one.\n</code></pre>\nSure, this would incur cost for some, but c&#x27;est la vie. Many such decisions have been made in societies all over the world, often for good reasons.<p>This could still be the solution if the EPA puts their foot down and the PAFI thing mentioned doesn&#x27;t produce a workable 100UL recipe.')
