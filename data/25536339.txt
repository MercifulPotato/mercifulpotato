The latest version of macOS has already crippled application firewalls, allowing Apple authorised code special privileges to bypass any firewall &#x2F; VPN to access the internet, even if the user wants to block them. Apple ARM processors further limit what OS you can run on it, even with virtualisation, without needing Apple&#x27;s permission.<p>All these criticisms of losing more and more control of your mac are genuine and valid - and is indicative of their aims to turn the macOS platform into a more closed system like ios. (You have to be a really naive Apple fan boi to believe that they do not want to increase their billion dollar+ profit margin by converting the macOS to a closed system like ios. And yes, the app store only works because ios is a closed system with Apple dictating how - and what - you can install on it).')
