Item(by='BitwiseFool', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611090638, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838384, text='The fact that Craigslist hasn&#x27;t done <i>anything</i> to cut down on spam, scams, and duplicate posts is maddening to me. Whenever I do a search I see dozens of phone repair advertisements and completely unrelated posts for cars and trucks. And those posts have the same title and thumbnail!<p>I simply do not understand why Craigslist refuses to improve in this regard. Look, I get why Craig doesn&#x27;t want to change the design of his site, but how in the hell do they justify such crap not being removed?')
