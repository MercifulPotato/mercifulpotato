Transition to remote has been incredible boon for my mental health, years of work in therapy are finally paying off, I&#x27;m using much less alcohol and drugs and do it much more responsibly. Not a single day when I just can&#x27;t get out of bed and answer any calls, even in November.<p>Really feel like I&#x27;m an outlier here, but it&#x27;s really possible to fight this and get better, even if you&#x27;ve felt this way from early childhood.')
