I have had a constant high pitched tinnitus since my late 20s and it just started without any reasons I can think of for I think I have never actually abused my ears much...<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the level at which I perceive it is completely linked with my anxiety level. I always ear it but when I&#x27;m tired or anxious, it&#x27;s loud while when I&#x27;m really relaxed, it can become very faint.<p>Unfortunately, I must be a pretty anxious person as it&#x27;s loud most of the time.')
