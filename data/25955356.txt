Item(by='piokoch', descendants=None, kids=[25955799], score=None, time=1611909913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954083, text='I believe when you sign up to Facebook you need to accept some terms and condition clause - this is the contract which is signed between you and Facebook (Facebook is referring that document when users are banned, so apparently they consider this as contract).<p>Facebook earns money thanks to its users, providing them some service so definitely there should be a contract here.<p>Now, when you look on those T&amp;C, they are very vague, especially possible reasons for account suspension are very, very vague. They refer user to some &quot;community standards&quot; and it is not clear, if those &quot;standards&quot; are part of the contract or not.<p>In my opinion, the first thing that should be changed is to force Facebook and other services to provide a clear, formal contract that would state what are duties of both contract parts, what rights they have, etc. Stuff that each normal contract has. No mumbling about &quot;community&quot;, etc.<p>Contract should be something that is enforceable and has clear appeal path and so on. If I don&#x27;t agree with Facebook I should be able to court and refer to something that is specific and well defined, not some Mark Zuckerberg views on what is good or bad.')
