The hard part is that was it &quot;reasonably likely&quot; changes as technology changes. It&#x27;s entirely possible that a data set that qualifies as anonymous today will not be anonymous in 5 years. Organizations are responsible for the data they publish. If data loses its anonymity in the future due to release of other data sets and&#x2F;or improved technology, the organization releasing the data will be responsible for the release of personal data, even if it wasn&#x27;t personal data at the time of release.')
