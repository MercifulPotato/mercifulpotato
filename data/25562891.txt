The Bolt seats aren&#x27;t great either, but they&#x27;re not significantly worse.<p>&gt; Smaller car<p>Yep, more nimble.  Not as powerful, for sure.  But more tossable.  Much tighter turning radius.<p>&gt; No charging network<p>Except it can use standard non-Tesla DC fast-chargers, and those networks are collectively growing much faster than Tesla is growing the Supercharger network.<p>&gt; Does GM even know how to make a car these days?<p>Uh, yes?  They&#x27;ve always had the engineering chops, even when they cut corners and made duds.  My last car before the Tesla was a Camaro SS 1LE, and it&#x27;s so far on a different planet from anything by Tesla that it&#x27;s unfair to consider Tesla a car manufacturer at that point.  Yeah, GM knows what they are doing, what a silly thing to say!<p>&gt; We should be talking about BMW.<p>No, we should not.  They make exactly two cool cars now.  The rest are just as cookie cutter boring as everything else.<p>&gt; Who cares about GM?<p>Anyone who likes cars?  I get that this generally rules out Tesla owners, I accept that.  But GM makes the mid-engine Corvette - at a price point normal people can even afford!  And Camaros, and many other cars.  Hate on them all you want, but they&#x27;re a very legitimate car manufacturer.<p>&gt; If, one day, the Mach-E ships<p>It is...<p>The Mach-E has a nicer interior than a Model 3, and even has an actual dashboard screen in addition to the big center one.  Not to mention an analog-ish volume knob.  I bet it uses actual rain sensors, too ;).  Maybe even a manual glovebox release.<p>Tesla is good at being different, and their drivetrain technology is excellent.  The rest of the car is just barely acceptable, and only if you squint, and only if you&#x27;ve never ridden in anything with Recaros, etc.  I like my P3D but only because there isn&#x27;t yet anything equivalent, aside from the just now shipping Mach-E.')
