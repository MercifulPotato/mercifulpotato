From my perspective this is a security and sysadmin nightmare (for the reasons in my link above). Lockfiles actually provide repeatable builds almost all the time, the only times they fail are when depending on non-JS builds like node-gyp or other C++&#x2F;etc dependencies where you can&#x27;t lock on system build tooling versions because they&#x27;re outside the scope of what npm can lock.<p>The real appeal of Deno for our org is the stdlib, which as a side effect means we can <i>depend on fewer packages</i>. The wholesale  removal of the package manager seems like an unwanted pain that will only keep us away from switching and gaining the stdlib benefits.')
