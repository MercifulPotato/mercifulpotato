Please re-read what I said.<p>What? You very clearly stated that the content of Article 13 makes it easy to predict that the EU will attempt to make ad blocking illegal in the foreseeable future. (Granted, the response to that didn&#x27;t make much sense - the current law doesn&#x27;t have to directly affect end users for us to make a reasonable prediction based on it that laws proposed in the future would attempt to do just that.)<p>&gt; Wrong. Copying something, without distribution, is still violating copyright.<p>That <i>really</i> depends on the jurisdiction and context. For example, in the US, making backup copies of materials licensed in perpetuity (ex a movie on VHS) is (always, AFAIK) permitted. Another example is recording broadcast TV for the purpose of time shifting it (ie watching it later), which has been explicitly permitted by the courts here. Yet another example is ripping CDs for personal use, which falls under fair use in the US and is therefore not a violation.')
