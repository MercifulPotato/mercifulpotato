Pathological pursuit of markers of social validation are the outcome of social behaviors that evolved in a society of small groups and small amounts of handmade goods being acted out in a high population, high wealth society.<p>&gt; Any society has to collectively decide what it&#x27;s priorities are, and how to balance production and consumption, this one included.<p>Collective decision-making is not possible in groups that exceed Dunbar&#x27;s number. The myth of collective decision making in a large society is a social fiction that power elites use to cover their manipulation of the political process.<p>&gt; Interesting point about using interest rates to slow the economy.<p>Thank you for considering my opinions. This is a great discussion and I&#x27;m touched by your insight into the problems of the modern world.')
