It’s basically a company created by Krste and some former graduate students.<p>I like chisel as a concept but the learning curve is too high: Scala is kind of a mess and when you add a custom DSL + lots of functional programming on top a different  hardware design methodology, it becomes overwhelming to your typical ce&#x2F;ee, who probably doesn’t have that exposure. I simply ran out of time to learn it properly.<p>It also a second class citizen when it comes to rtl tools. The verification engineers have to work with the generated verilog and it looks like a nightmare. There was some improvements recently but the engineers knowledgeable  enough to work on this stuff seem pretty bandwidth constrained.<p>The biggest headwind to chisel is the breadth of knowledge required to work and improve it IMO.<p>I’m really hoping that pymtl gets a firrtl backend soon. Python has a pretty decent record for building DSLs.')
