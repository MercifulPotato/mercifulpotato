It&#x27;s just an observation that equites are worth more when money supply increase and new business opportunities are difficult to come by.<p>If you have a box producing 4k usd per year people may want to pay around 100k for it on normal times but when you can&#x27;t find any other investments and the government is pumping money into the economy then suddenly the box becomes way more valuable. It&#x27;s after all better to buy it for 150k even if it produces 3k instead of 4k than to just your money in the bedroom mattress.
