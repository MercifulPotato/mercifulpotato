There are (and have been for at least a century) ways to transfer it from place to place, even electronically, in a mostly anonymous way - as mobile minutes, through western union, etc. The farther it has to go, the easier it is to track, but locally, it takes non-trivial effort to track transfer to the point that governments mostly do it when they actually have a reason rather than &quot;just because&quot;.<p>You are right that this COULD be designed in an anonymous way, e.g. with cryptocurrencies, sure :)<p>It is however naive to believe that governments will actually do that if citizens allow them to require payment for social media access.<p>It will very certainly wind up being trackable.<p>&gt; Well then, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. You are violating FB&#x27;s &quot;real name&quot; terms of service. And also, rest assured that almost everyone of the people you&#x27;ve talked to on Facebook has de-anonymized you, by having your real name in their address book somewhere which they uploaded to FB&#x2F;WhatsApp&#x2F;Instagram knowingly or unknowingly.<p>That only applies if I tell my real name to any of those people, which I don&#x27;t.<p>&gt; If you care about your privacy, get off facebook.<p>It is impossible to get off of FB without being denied access to things which are a central part of social life, e.g. events.<p>&gt; &gt; To not become a fascist country, you cannot regulate social media access.\n&gt; To not become a fascist country, you have to regulate social media.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, my wording was imprecise!<p>Let me correct it please: To not become a fascist country, you have to regulate social media, but you MUST NOT deny access to it.')
