This will result in you being 15 mins late to the emergency, but is pretty much guaranteed to work since in any big enough disaster they&#x27;re sure to try multiple times. :)<p>I think the phone should just explain to the person &quot;press 1 to override silence&quot;, then you could enable it for known callers only.')
