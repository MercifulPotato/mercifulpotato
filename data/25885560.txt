But there are whole teams which did that (back then anyway) for products like RHEL.<p>With support, wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense for things to be <i>clearer and easier</i>, so there&#x27;s less staff time needed to provide the documentation and support?<p>Saying that because AFAIK the places that pay for support (rather than use CentOS or similar) are more doing it for compliance reasons than straight out really <i>needing</i> (much?) support.  eg they&#x27;re going to pay for it anyway, even if they don&#x27;t really use it')
