Tesla&#x27;s stationary storage unit is seeing unprecedented demand outstripping their supply of cells [1], and they are prioritizing deployment in geographies where they have partnerships (South Australia [2] and Vermont&#x27;s Green Mountain Power territory [3], both of which are deploying distributed storage as large virtual batteries [VPPs]). Off-grid applications simply aren&#x27;t a priority at this time (and there are other vendors for such applications, such as Enphase, SunPower, and Generac, who are offering stationary storage for off grid), as grid tie batteries offer more value both to electrical consumers and the electrical grid.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utilitydive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tremendous-demand-for-stationary-storage-outstrips-teslas-2020-supply-ca&#x2F;577157&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utilitydive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tremendous-demand-for-stati...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reneweconomy.com.au&#x2F;tesla-vpp-expands-to-add-virtual-big-battery-to-south-australia-grid-19504&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reneweconomy.com.au&#x2F;tesla-vpp-expands-to-add-virtual...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pv-magazine-usa.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;green-mountain-powers-battery-pilot-programs-approved-for-expansion&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pv-magazine-usa.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;green-mountain-powers...</a><p>EDIT @boulos: That wasn&#x27;t my interpretation, but if that&#x27;s the case, I hope my citations are still helpful.')
