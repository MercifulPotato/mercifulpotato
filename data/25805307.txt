Item(by='netsharc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610829675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25802431, text='Maybe something like @harvard-school-of-journalism.com, although that&#x27;s too wordy. The article mentions &quot;Harvard Extension School&quot;, so, it could be some variation of that.<p>Edit: I tried harvard-extension.school in the browser, it redirected me to http:harvard-education.edu (not https!), which seems to be a clone of extension.harvard.edu . The WHOIS records of harvard-extension.school&#x2F;.education are pretty new (registered last year), and they&#x27;re registered on GoDaddy and 1API GmbH respectively. A Germany-based registrar? Would Harvard use them?')
