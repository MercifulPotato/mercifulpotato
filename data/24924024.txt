Item(by='cpgxiii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603918464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24923576, text='&gt; As the article explains, HLK testing isn&#x27;t really designed for non-hardware drivers and the solutions are strange at best. You&#x27;re not actually improving quality in this case, you&#x27;re just making us do convoluted busywork.<p>There&#x27;s a lot common to driver development that&#x27;s separate from purely interacting with hardware (memory management, filesystem interaction, security, etc), some of which the HLK covers. Plenty of non-hardware drivers are capable of bringing down the system or breaking things if they do something bad in kernel mode.<p>To be clear, the article is complaining about their specific case in which they claim to have a driver that explicitly violates nominal filesystem invariants and &quot;cannot&quot; pass HLK testing, not that HLK compliance is inherently a bad fit. Whether or not a different set of tests or a negotiated &quot;Contingency&quot; test filter are possible is a different question.')
