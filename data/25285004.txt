It’s still developed completely in the open now and is free to use in your platform, as most of Apple’s competitors actually do.<p>That is about as far from ‘crippling the web’ as any company in history has ever been.<p>As for saying that evolution in computing is slower because of how locked down things are, that seems like a view that is hard to understand.<p>If you can’t see how fast things have moved in software over the past 5 years and then over the past 10, I think you just aren’t looking hard enough.<p>Smartphone hardware design may have plateaued, but that’s just superficial.<p>And in any case, a government standard isn’t going to make anything any less locked down.<p>It will be just as locked down as it is now, more expensive to develop for, and the possibility of an open alternative emerging will be harder than ever, if not impossible.')
