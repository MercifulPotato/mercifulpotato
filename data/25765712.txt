Again, if you are confused by this, you aren&#x27;t trying hard to understand.<p>I control my Mac just fine. I&#x27;ve built tools from source; I run whatever I want; I can automate tasks I find tedious using the same shell tools available on Linux, and I still have access to MS Office (and no, open&#x2F;FOSS &quot;alternatives&quot; don&#x27;t work sufficiently well for me) and other COTS tools I depend on.<p>The Mac is absolutely the right platform for me, and I don&#x27;t find it limiting or broken or hostile AT ALL. And neither do millions of other folks.<p>I also work regularly with Windows, and have a higher-end Dell XPS on my desk for that purpose. Windows is so profoundly broken and un-discoverable and inconsistent (not to mention unstable over time) that I cannot fathom choosing to use it over anything else -- and it&#x27;s the only OTHER platform where I could get access to some of the tools I rely on. Linux isn&#x27;t there, and hacks to try to make things like Win software run there imply a level of tedious fiddling that I&#x27;m 100% retired from.<p>&gt;Is this such an unreasonable opinion?<p>I guess it depends on whether you consider an unstudied, single-POV opinion reasonable.')
