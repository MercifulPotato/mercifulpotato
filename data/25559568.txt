It exists solely for massaging Matt&#x27;s ego.<p>Every single non-designer person I&#x27;ve created a Wordpress site for has yelled loud abuses at it and told me to disable it because they &quot;just want to write a fucking blog post, not design a new web page each time&quot;. And each time I have to install a plugin to do that. Who the hell wants to create new blocks for each sub-heading and paragraph when they&#x27;re writing regular articles? The old editor is much easier to use.')
