I concede that there is a false extrapolation into the internet at large (or private institutions at large). I argue in his favor though that these social media platforms are, for many, their <i>main</i> sources of information. Hence his argument that we should, as a culture, focus on &quot;improving our ability to tell the difference&quot; between information and disinformation.<p>When I hear friends and families share conspiracy theories with me and I read that many people are deeply hesitant to become vaccinated, they cite these instances of YT or FB squashing posts as further proof of the legitimacy. All this is to say that these tech companies simply should not get themselves involved with answering the question of &quot;what is true?&quot;.<p>I suspect that disinformation spreads faster on FB&#x2F;YT&#x2F;Twitter than information because it is sensational. Humans love to hear stories and are compelled by them more than facts. I second Ben Thompson here that we should focus on learning how to learn and how to parse information. We should learn how to tell when an argument is bifurcated or someone is appealing to <i>ad populum</i> and learn to accept nuance and disagree respectfully.')
