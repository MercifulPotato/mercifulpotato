Supplementing daylight with high-power artificial light seems to be one of the most promising approaches. Simply sleeping more during shorter days is fairly speculative suggestion, at least as a &quot;silver bullet&quot;.<p>That being said, simply based on personal experience I would expect that slight changes of sleep length could be possible. But the effect would be more like Â±30mins to sleep length, when e.g. where I live currently daylight length varies from about 6 to 18 hours. Trying to match sleep to such a big swing seems pretty unlikely to succeed.')
