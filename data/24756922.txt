I understand the cause of this is because Wave&#x27;s network is incredibly hetereogenous because Wave&#x27;s business-model was to expand by buying-up smaller regional cablecos but to retain their infrastructure (and talent) compared to Comcast&#x27;s approach of asset-stripping (bad for employees, but good for customers...).<p>I want IPv6 so I can stop having to faff around with NAT. I&#x27;d love to be able to RDP-in directly to my desktop at home without having to pay companies like TeamViewer and Splashtop.<p>----<p>Update: I found Wave&#x27;s peering page&#x27;s IPv6 status page and <i>it remains unchanged</i> since 2011 (and possibly since 2008). Wow.<p>Compare:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20110102140910&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;as11404.net&#x2F;ipv6.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20110102140910&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;as11404.ne...</a><p>Live:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;as11404.net&#x2F;ipv6.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;as11404.net&#x2F;ipv6.html</a>')
