You say it&#x27;s quite popular and most extensions are taken - why use it then? It will diminish your chances for standing out and having a memorable brand.<p>If your name is unique, is a good fit, specific for your space, not trademarked etc., then great! But in that case you are fine with any extension. getting &quot;getbrandname.com&quot; instead of &quot;brandname.app&quot; won&#x27;t make or break your project.<p>If your name doest not fit the above criteria, pick a different one. Go wild, go bold. I suggest the book &#x27;hello my name is awesome&#x27; (bad title, but on-point, actionable content) if you go ahead.')
