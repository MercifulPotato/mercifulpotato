Your metadata just ends up getting semi-permanently logged on various machines, and there is nothing you can do about it at this time. AFAIK, Signal has implemented solutions to this (even, I believe, fixing the subtle thing I used to complain about where their server technically had a temporary in-memory metadata log for rate limiting).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2188" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2188</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4565" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;matrix-org&#x2F;synapse&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4565</a><p>(I have now provided a bit more quoted detail in this other comment, which i will link to rather than cause a lot of replication spam.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25687395" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25687395</a>')
