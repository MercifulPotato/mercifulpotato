And I would argue it&#x27;s not fine, since it&#x27;s these same types of people whining about what terrible luck they are having (purely anecdotal of course).<p>A few ideas that I think would give these grads some better luck:<p>- Update your profile to say &quot;Interested in joining a front-end or back-end team&quot; or &quot;tech generalist with a focus on X&quot;<p>- Elaborate even further in your About section and let people know which of the two you are stronger in and what experience you have<p>- Swap out &quot;full-stack&quot; for &quot;web developer&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t tell me you&#x27;re something you&#x27;re not. Under-promise, over deliver. Seeing full-stack on a resume sets my expectations for whoever I&#x27;m about to interview regardless of the number of years of experience.<p><i>edit: styling</i>')
