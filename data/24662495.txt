And since you control the random choice, you can impose nearly any reasonable distribution you feel like.  (You just have to &#x27;pay&#x27; for the generation of the random bits.  Economizing on the number of random bits involved is just as much an area of research as economizing on runtime or memory.)<p>Of course, you can also analyze randomly distributed inputs.  But that&#x27;s a different beast, because in practice you seldom have a good handle on those distributions.')
