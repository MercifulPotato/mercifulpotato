The two are quite different.  Note that a quantum computer with real amplitudes is actually just as powerful as one with complex amplitudes; the complex amplitudes are actually inessential.<p>Also, your answer to the second question fails to distinguish a quantum computer from a classical probabilistic computer.  The key here is really cancellation of amplitudes, not the larger state space.')
