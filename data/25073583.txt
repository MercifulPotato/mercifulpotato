It&#x27;s outside their core competency, it involves them negotiating with rightsholders, and there&#x27;s a bunch of competition coming from existing companies in the space (e.g. Microsoft, NVidia, etc.).<p>As I can see, their only edge is that they own a global content delivery network which in the best case might be able to give them a few years&#x27; head-start in terms of performance vs. other players that don&#x27;t own IP infrastructure. (It&#x27;s a recent development that cloud-hosted gaming is even viable from a latency perspective). But that doesn&#x27;t seem like the core long-term problem; it might give you a first-mover advantage but I don&#x27;t see that being enough to build a defensible moat in this space.')
