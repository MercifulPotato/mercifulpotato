It&#x27;s always intriguing to see how the other half lives, as it were.<p>MMS never seemed to catch on in the UK and never seems to be included in the free allowances which probably doesn&#x27;t help (eg I have unlimited calls, sms, &gt;100gb data but MMS still costs me 50p each). I think the only time I&#x27;ve seen it used in years is very occasionally when I ask an iPhone user to send me a photo and they don&#x27;t realise I&#x27;m on Android and won&#x27;t automatically have it funnelled via Apple, so instead I get badly compressed unreadable photos of printed letters.')
