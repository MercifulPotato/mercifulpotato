I know a ton of people who internalized this lesson, got a Ph.D, and have been stuck in post-doc limbo for a decade.  Or they went to law school and washed out when they realized they hated it (at least one of whom is now dead from what I think was suicide), or became a dentist and had their practice eviscerated by COVID.<p>Meanwhile I did basically no homework between the ages of 11-24, graduated 2 years late from college after flunking a couple courses, spent all my &quot;free&quot; (= homework&#x2F;class) time reading and fiddling around with computers, and ended up in one of those hot jobs.  My parents <i>freaked</i> about me ever having a job or living on my own - my mom sent me a graduation card that said &quot;Some call it graduation.  We call it a miracle.&quot;  I matched her final salary (after 35 years in the workforce) in my first year out of college.<p>IMHO, the best skills you can teach your kid these days are: 1) supply &amp; demand 2) compound interest 3) how to read what&#x27;s &quot;hot&quot; and what people really care about 4) how to form a mental model of what&#x27;s in someone&#x27;s head and trade with them so they get what they want and you get what you want 5) statistics and 6) whatever labor-saving technologies of the day can make things more efficient and throw people out of work.  That was software when I was a kid; it&#x27;s probably things like deep neural nets and robotics now, and may be biotech&#x2F;nanotech&#x2F;material science by the time kids today get into the workforce.  Lots of middle-class parents fight the last war and prepare their kids for the world they entered as 20&#x2F;30-somethings.  They need to stop stressing over economic realities now (which will be totally different by the time our kids enter the working world) and teach general principles for being able to look around you and make sense of the world, then trust the kid to be able to do that on their own.')
