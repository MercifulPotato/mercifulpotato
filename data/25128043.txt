Both for Rust and for the project -- I think that&#x27;s a really cool direction. The web becomes more and more a commodity to execute code remotely, and I think this step will help leverage Website-as-Interface as the default GUI for our programs, and empower us to commoditize it even more. And the Linux Foundation is a very lovely home -- they&#x27;re dedicated to open standards and great stewards. However, complete lack of talk about funding and &quot;every bit helps&quot; makes it sound like this is actually the death of commercial support for this project. And I think it&#x27;s super sad that Mozilla can&#x27;t fund it anymore and would&#x27;ve hoped someone else would have picked up the banner monetarily. Does anyone know if the project has a good chance of survival (Rust is a great dev community, but might alienate broader adoption) -- can this survive purely within the open source community?')
