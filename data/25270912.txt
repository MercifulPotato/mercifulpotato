Our jobs usually finish well within the limit but the top 1% hit the limit.<p>One example we&#x27;ve been wrestling with is a merge operation. Usually it&#x27;s merging about 1000 records which completes in a few seconds. But every once in a while someone kicks off a job that tries to merge 1,000,000 records and it times out.<p>We want the benefits of serverless (scale down to zero, up to infinity at the drop of a hat) but these edge cases mean we&#x27;re having to evaluate other options.<p>An hour or two would be a good start; then it&#x27;d cover 99.9% of requests. With a few hours we could add more nines :)')
