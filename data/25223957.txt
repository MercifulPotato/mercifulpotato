Our legacy system could process trade triggers from 4ms to 7ms, but tracing the behaviour of the new system it could do it in 3ms, great. Except every now and then a GC pause would halt order processing for around 50ms. Our customers hit the roof.<p>Trading systems trigger almost all their orders based on detecting market changes, which you cannot predict. If a symbol hits a price that triggers one of your trades you want that trade in the market ASAP every millisecond matters. Randomly add 50ms on to that and your trading system is out of business. The customers will go elsewhere.')
