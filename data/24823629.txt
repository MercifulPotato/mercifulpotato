(dot) - it will bring you an autocompleting text box allowing you to do every action you can on given page</i><p>How I wish I knew that at my {previous}^2-job, where we were heavy JIRA users. I remember getting so angry off at the frontend performance that I actually (somehow) got minimal API access and ended up timesheeting from a Lisp REPL.<p>I thought about my previous comment through the night and realized that, at some point, I should have had found a reference manual for JIRA and read it end-to-end (reading manuals cover-to-cover is a superpower, but that realization only truly hit me around the end of said job). Also, I now know enough to articulate what was my biggest discomfort with JIRA (beyond abysmal performance): lack of clear mental model of what it does, and what is being represented inside. This came about not just because the product is large, but also because <i>JIRA admins</i> - we (developers) had access restricted only to a tiny portion of the product, so I couldn&#x27;t just poke around (my usual way of grokking software) and build a clear mental picture. Next time in such situation, I&#x27;ll just go straight into &quot;read docs cover to cover&quot; mode.<p>&gt; <i>That said, graph-based task representation is the norm on the higher end of _desktop_ project management tools, ones that often involve physical things to make, like MS Project or OmniPlan (and going back all the way to LisaProject, which apparently became very liked at NASA for exactly that graph based view).</i><p>I suspected so! I saw some of these capabilities during my brief exposure to the &quot;corporate pointy-haired MBA&quot; project management tools during my time at the university. But I get the feeling that it&#x27;s another place where Agile culture is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.')
