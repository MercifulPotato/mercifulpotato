The vast majority of applications are fine being written in whatever flavor of high-level, garbage collected, memory safe language you want. There are many nice options with pretty much any set of feature and style choices you could want.<p>The rest of these applications have either hard realtime or hard performance requirements or both. What I don&#x27;t see in these apps, is for memory safety issues to be &#x27;ok&#x27;.* It&#x27;s 2020, using a memory safe language should be table stakes for new projects at this point.<p>----------<p>* The one exception I can think of is single player video games where the worst that can happen is basically just a crash to desktop. Multiplayer games are a different story especially with the trend toward paid DLC where these kinds of issues could result in anything from exploits in multiplayer matches (hurting the community and thus the game overall) or players circumventing DLC restrictions (resulting in a loss of profit).')
