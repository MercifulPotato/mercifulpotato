The last Mac I ran Linux on was a 2016 MBP.  And even then, audio and suspend&#x2F;resume didn&#x27;t work (well, suspend was fine, resume... not so much), and battery life was terrible.  When I first installed it, the keyboard and touchpad required an out-of-tree driver.<p>That driver has been upstreamed, but I hear the 2017 and onward touchbar MBPs still require and out-of-tree driver, and a similar level of things don&#x27;t work.<p>In 2019 I finally gave up and got a Dell XPS13.  It&#x27;s... basically perfect?  The keyboard doesn&#x27;t suck like recent MacBooks, though the touchpad isn&#x27;t quite as nice (though really, it&#x27;s perfectly fine).  The only thing that doesn&#x27;t work is the fingerprint reader, but I knew that going in and didn&#x27;t care.  And subjectively the hardware isn&#x27;t as pretty, but... oh well.  On the plus side, I really do like the &quot;soft touch&quot; palm rest better than the harsh aluminum of the MacBook.<p>I&#x27;m definitely interested in the Linux-on-M1 project&#x27;s progress from an intellectual curiosity standpoint, but I&#x27;m expecting long-term as a user it&#x27;ll be just as -- if not more -- frustrating as running Linux on any Intel MacBook from the last 5 years, which means I won&#x27;t bother.')
