XM4 is mostly like XM3. One of the very few improvements is the multiple device support (but the price difference is IMO unlikely to be worth it).<p>I use the WF-1000XM3 and WH-1000XM4 and the pairing of the WF-1000XM3 works fine for me, but the ANC of the over the ears XM4 (as well as your WH-1000XM3) is superior. At times, I don&#x27;t even have listen to anything and it still works. Its terrific at work. Even works with getting less agitated by the noise of my children.')
