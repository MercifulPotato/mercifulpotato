My sleep schedule is finally consistent after decades of struggling with it. I track my tasks and hours meticulously, and I&#x27;m more productive than ever. This didn&#x27;t come overnight and I have been struggling with productivity for years. However, it finally feels like everything is clicking into place.<p>Look up the idea of a Keystone habit. For me, it&#x27;s waking up early. When I force myself to wake up early, it&#x27;s really hard not to be productive. It&#x27;s weird to wake up early to mindlessly watch YouTube (my big vice). Pick a simple habit and stick to it. A habit that will make all of your other habits easier.')
