This lets you keep things decoupled whilst still leaving them the ability to communicate. It&#x27;s pretty handy but also needs to be used with care if you&#x27;re not going to invest a bunch of time in writing tools to support it as it makes debugging tricky.<p>Don&#x27;t be too worried about mediators though. Games are a little bit different in that you typically want to act on a shared world. If you have systems that act globally on the world then you&#x27;re just matching the data that exists. Even the physics system itself is basically a singleton that&#x27;s mediating interaction.')
