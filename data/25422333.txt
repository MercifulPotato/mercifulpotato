Threads are mixed together when multiple people reply its impossible to read content anymore and they do also change the formatting of content which puzzled me the most.<p>Maybe for people that only ever used Gmail it&#x27;s okay, because they are used to its weirdness and have never seen a more structured and visually appealing way to read email.')
