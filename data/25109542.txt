I reached Legend in Hearthstone (The top rank, no clue what percentile it was) a while back and top 3-5% in StarCraft II a couple of years ago.<p>In both games I stopped playing shortly after reaching that level because the time investment just didn&#x27;t seem worth it to me. I love games, but playing at a very high level requires a lot of practice and focus.<p>I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s possible to play competitively and do much else because of the time investment required just to stay at your current level, let alone improve. I love games, but it&#x27;s hard to justify when I could be doing something more productive with my time.')
