How does a person ask the question that I asked and mark it unambiguously as a question, not a statement (and do it without unnecessary baggage)?  How do I convince people to answer the question instead of reply the way you did, to something you received instead of what I asked?  Is that question not tolerable (it got flagged) but the other commenter&#x27;s is fine?')
