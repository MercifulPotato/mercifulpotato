K. Jemisin). My recommendations were... unhelpful? Lots of childrenâ€™s books and comics (including Calvin &amp; Hobbes), peppered with the occasional P. G. Wodehouse.<p>The latter is particularly strange to me, since Douglas Adams was a huge fan of Wodehouse, used very similar humour, and even wrote forewords for Wodehouse re-printings.')
