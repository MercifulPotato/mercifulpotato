The text made this clear, saying &quot;all hashtags.&quot; You can confirm this by searching for an arbitrary hashtag; the same message is displayed.<p>Also, Mailchimp is not primarily an ad&#x2F;spam tool, and any nontransactional email is not necessarily ad&#x2F;spam. Emails about outages to a service you use are not transactional (others also use it), advertising or spam. Emails about changes to a product or service are not transactional (others use it), advertising, or spam. Community newsletters are not transactional, and not necessarily advertising. Some of these emails could be or contain advertising, but that doesn&#x27;t equate to spam, and  many people want these emails. In fact, Mailchimp has policies against using their platform to send any unsolicited email, regardless of content, even if it is legal. You must have consent from each recipient.
