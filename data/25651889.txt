Item(by='lmilcin', descendants=None, kids=[25651993], score=None, time=1609884626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650905, text='I gave up this idea for couple of reasons and instead am negotiating for whole package which I just assume includes some amount of after hours &#x2F; on-call work.<p>After a lot of thought, asking for on-call is a loose for me. First, there are many people willing to not ask for on-call. Second, I don&#x27;t want to be associated with the ones that do. Third, even in best case the on-call doesn&#x27;t seem compensate me enough for spent time. Fourth, it makes it hard negotiating my base salary which is where the money are. Fifth, it puts some unhealthy motivation to spend even more time at work rather than be more efficient with it (for example, work to create environment where I don&#x27;t have to be on-call or have to spend less time after hours in general).<p>So, instead, I am showing I take ownership of the area I am working in, I am willing to sometimes decide that the project requires me to spend some extra time, that I am happy to do what is needed to get the job done, and I try to sell it to my company as a complete package.')
