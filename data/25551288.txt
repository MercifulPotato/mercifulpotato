Item(by='ajuc', descendants=None, kids=[25551424], score=None, time=1609079825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25549775, text='In my opinion Starcraft 2 killed RTSes (just like Dota 2 and LOL killed MOBAs).<p>With multiplayer games people can play the same title forever if it&#x27;s deep enough. So new games in the same genre have to compete against a game that was made by Blizzard in 2010 and constantly developed ever since.<p>So what happens is - people check out the new game, and either get bored (it&#x27;s too similar and worse) or get discouraged (it&#x27;s too different to bother learning).<p>The only remaining market for RTS are so called &quot;casuals&quot; that want single player experience. But they don&#x27;t engage with the game enough to justify years of gameplay development, balancing, innovative mechanics - they mostly want nice cutscenes and good graphics and beliveable dialogs and plot.<p>And most of them won&#x27;t even finish the game. They will play for a week and move on. Single player games that don&#x27;t achieve cult status - are finished on the market after the first month.<p>So for a new RTS to compete it has to be better than Starcraft 2 in multiplayer and gameplay or at least in storytelling. And that&#x27;s a VERY hard thing to do for an indie studio. Risk is huge and required investment is enormous.<p>I&#x27;ve had high hopes for Iron Harvest and it clearly went for the casual&#x2F;single player market and did pretty well, but not well enough.')
