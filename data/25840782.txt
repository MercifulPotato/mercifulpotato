HEK 293 is a cell line taken from an aborted fetus.  (HEK -&gt; Human Embryonic Kidney).  Many people consider vaccines grown in HEK 293 to be immoral.  Chicken eggs are a moral alternative medium.<p>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily apply in this case because the Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech vaccine was only tested on HEK 293, not grown in it.  (Moderna&#x27;s vaccine, conversely, was grown in HEK 293.)  Some people still consider the testing to be immoral.  Some don&#x27;t.')
