They are so annoying, that the language designers <i>extended the language&#x2F;standard libraries</i> to make them tolerable - array.map in ECMAScript 5, for (x : y) in Java 5 and C++11, foreach in PHP 4, LINQ extensions in C# 3.<p>A plain old functor&#x2F;monad has so much to recommend it. You get a uniform way to iterate&#x2F;transform all kinds of collections, even those which don&#x27;t support indexing. They can also be used without mutation and are easy to typecheck. In languages with higher-kinded types they can be abstracted over without knowing anything about how the underlying data is structured.')
