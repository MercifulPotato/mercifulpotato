Item(by='8bitsrule', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608442401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25481089, text='There are very few details (and no DOI). Is it a continuous-waveform (carrier-only) ? &quot;The signal bears no trace of modulation.&quot; What is the &#x27;signal&#x27; to noise ratio? (Was it dug out of the noise?) At what rate is the frequency &#x27;very slightly&#x27; climbing?<p>&#x27;Coming from a star very close to our own?&#x27; For sure? or just from that general direction?<p>At a 4 LY distance, given the loss in strength over that distance due to spread, the transmit power would have to be enormous. (Voyager 1 is about 10e-13 LY away, and our best scopes are needed to hear it.) If so, why invest so much energy in an un-modulated wave?<p>On the very slim chance it&#x27;s not local (harmonic bouncing off - or eminated by our space junk), some FRB&#x27;s have been observed in that range, changing (much faster) in frequency. (Possibly more scarce physics.)<p>The &#x27;mysterious&#x27; lack of &#x27;technology&#x27; details makes this sound like a PR &#x27;result&#x27; for the BL project. (When Lorimer reported the first FRB, the details were there.)')
