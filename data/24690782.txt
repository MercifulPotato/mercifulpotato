Bootstrappers who start with an existing client or product that&#x27;s already selling can do that.<p>Also, depending on circumstances $1m ARR may be enough to cover costs for a team of 9.  Many people earn much less than $100k even accounting for costs, and some SaaS don&#x27;t need high operating costs (hint: cloud services are not the cheap way), or are still working their way through AWS&#x2F;IBM&#x2F;Google free credits.')
