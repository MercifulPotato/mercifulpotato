In the late 1700s when it was created the speed of communication was horseback letters and trans Atlantic sailing ships.  It made sense to select a representative who would then travel in person to the core of politics, learn more, and possibly change their mind if the interests they represented were better served by another choice.  The hyper-politicized, party focused, blindly following electors of today may as well not exist.<p>To solve voter representation and choice I believe the US needs:<p>0) Go all mail in ballots everywhere, like Washington State <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sos.wa.gov&#x2F;elections&#x2F;faq_vote_by_mail.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sos.wa.gov&#x2F;elections&#x2F;faq_vote_by_mail.aspx</a><p>1) IRV, preferably &quot;beatpath method, beatpath winner, path voting, and path winner&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schulze_method" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schulze_method</a><p>2) Remove the electoral college.  Step A.1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Popular_Vote_Intersta...</a> Step A.2) Require all votes are counted everywhere. B) Constitutional amendment removing the Electoral College; and while we&#x27;re at it, mandating IRV of some sort (and hopefully enumerating academic criteria of the method rather than enumerating specific methods).<p>3) A ban on all political ads and limits on campaign finance and PACs.<p>4) More voter (general populace) education, an informed public is an implicit requirement for a functional democracy.  Probably also better info-graphics presenting &#x27;the books&#x27; (money in, money out) about who&#x27;s paying for what results.')
