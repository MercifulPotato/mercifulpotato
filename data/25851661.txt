If anything I need that access more than I did before it happened.&quot;<p>You might care, but most people would have bigger problems at that point.<p>&gt;  I, for one, frequently create accounts at work and when traveling. This subset of people are going to be doing either #2 or #3.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s the use case where they are working to extend the protocol for using backup keys: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yubico.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;yubico-proposes-webauthn-protocol-extension-to-simplify-backup-security-keys&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yubico.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;yubico-proposes-webauthn-protoco...</a><p>Again, most people aren&#x27;t on the road a lot, and most of those that do already follow so many other bad security practices when they do so that creating new accounts in that context will already be fraught with peril regardless of the mechanism you use... and they&#x27;d probably be increasing their exposure if they used a password manager. I&#x27;d advise them to not do it, or to create a temporary account using some low-security, low-tech compartmentalized mechanism (like writing the passwords on a piece of paper ;-) and then delete the whole thing and create a new one from scratch when they get home, because that&#x27;s probably less likely to be a problem. ;-)<p>&quot;For the folks that are still using the same password everywhere I think a password manager is a better recommendation than a security key. For one it helps them everywhere, not just the small number of sites that currently support U2F&#x2F;Webauthn. For another, such a person is probably at high risk of making mistake #2.&quot;<p>I do use a YubiKey secured password manager for services that do not currently support U2F&#x2F;Webauthn, so I agree that is really the only practical solution for certain cases. There&#x27;s an in between space where you can use the SmartCard protocol or hardware based OTP, but... My observation has been that for &quot;most people&quot; the non Webauthn cases are a) not necessary and b) actually far more difficult for them to manage, leading to them simply not using the password manager for a lot of cases.<p>It turns out the typical person&#x27;s needs are surprisingly limited, but the risk is enormous as is the number of &quot;pathways to failure&quot;.')
