In some cases, like Uber advertising to get users, this seems entirely plausible.<p>So I largely think ads themselves are kind of harmless.  But ad-backed business models are dangerous, because they optimize for &quot;engagement&quot;, which tends to promote content that is divisive over more thoughtful, nuanced content. Sadly, it also seems to require gathering huge amounts of information about users in a centralized spot, which seems risky for a variety of reasons.<p>The whole thing reminds me of a call I got about 10 years ago to participate in a survey about smoking, and one of the questions they asked was &quot;Do you believe nicotine causes cancer?&quot;  I paused because my understanding is that nicotine itself doesn&#x27;t cause cancer, but the common delivery mechanisms at the time (smoking, dipping) do increase the risk of cancer.  They forced me to answer yes&#x2F;no, so I said &quot;no&quot;, but obviously a decade later, I still remember it.  Do ads cause harm?  Probably not much, taken on their own.  But everything _around_ them seems to.')
