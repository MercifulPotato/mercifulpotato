Item(by='boxmonster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609489345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594539, text='HN won&#x27;t let me edit my comment to clarify (after 2 hours?) but I was pleasantly surprised that Rust felt like C# to me and I didn&#x27;t have to struggle much because I already know about references, pointers, stacks and heaps (from C and asm) Dictionaries and Lists were easy to work with. I grokked the borrow checker. I was motivated to make my post because I struggle with the various return types and syntax like<p><pre><code>    enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {\n       Ok(T),\n       Err(E),\n    }\n\n    match header.get(0) {\n        None =&gt; Err(&quot;invalid header length&quot;),\n        Some(&amp;1) =&gt; Ok(Version::Version1),\n        Some(&amp;2) =&gt; Ok(Version::Version2),\n        Some(_) =&gt; Err(&quot;invalid version&quot;),\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI wasn&#x27;t saying it was bad, just a pain point for me.')
