That negative impact likely does a net harm to society as a whole as it actively works against rehabilitation efforts by serving as a scarlet letter for this person&#x27;s entire life. Working to reduce that by removing these pages when they are no longer newsworthy isn&#x27;t censorship, affirmative action, or anything else that OP it stating or hinting at.  I truly don&#x27;t understand being against a decision like this on the merits.')
