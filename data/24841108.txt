I have a monopoly on the distribution of my blog content, but that does not make any difference in my annual income.<p>Assuming that the parent&#x27;s assertion that airlines have a monopoly on the route from airport X to aiport Y is correct, it does not give them any pricing power in general because they do not have a monopoly on all routes from X to Y. There are multiple airlines providing routes from X to Y, hence price competition.')
