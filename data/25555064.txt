Measured temperature is a 5-min median, otherwise nothing fancy, except a bit of safeties¹.<p>Didn&#x27;t bother with accessible controls - temperature adjustment of cca 2-3K can be made by raising&#x2F;lowering the temperature probe.<p>¹ Contains a secondary probe, in a different room for safety. Doesn&#x27;t heat if any probe above it&#x27;s maximum setpoint, 50% duty cycle is not too bad and there usually is someone present. Median is considered valid only if data is available for each minute.')
