Do you care about people knowing you’re on Signal? Or do you want to keep who you’re messaging private?\n Signal has features make it so that even if someone knows you’re using Signal, if you use sealed sender, they won’t know who you’re messaging with.\nFor me, I’d rather an account tied to me for discovery, but to keep plain text metadata off their servers.<p>That said, Signal plans to release non-phone identifiers, which I’m sure many are eagerly awaiting. I’m looking forward to it too, actually so I can use it to have my server message me instead of via Slack.')
