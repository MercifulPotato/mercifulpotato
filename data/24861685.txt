Say I found a company like WeWork (bear with me and try to forget the shenanigans pulled by their CEO). Things are going pretty well and before you know it, we raise money at a $200 million valuation and my stake is 50%. On paper I&#x27;m now worth $100 million dollars, but that money isn&#x27;t in my bank account... it&#x27;s an imaginary number that my investors decided to invest at. Based on E. Warren&#x27;s wealth tax plan, I now owe 2% of my wealth above $50M. So where do I get that $1 million from? I don&#x27;t have cash or liquid assets, so likely I have to dilute my shares to get some personal money. No problem... investors will understand.<p>So I go on for a few years paying some taxes on my new wealth, 3-5% of my equity a year. Now, the company has grown and we raise a big amount of money. Say Softbank gives us $5 billion at a $20 billion valuation, and i&#x27;ve been diluted to 25% at this point, but now I&#x27;m worth $5 billion on paper. Under EW&#x27;s plan, I owe 3% of my wealth above $1 billion, plus 2% of wealth between 50M and 1B. My tax bill is gonna be $139,000,000. Again, my wealth doesn&#x27;t exist in the bank... it&#x27;s in my private shares. But okay, I raise money from investors to dilute my shares and pay taxes... at this point they expect it.<p>OK... now I make plans to take my company public. Finally I&#x27;ll have some real liquid money and paying these taxes will be easier, because I can just sell shares on the open market. But wait, I put some feelers out and the market thinks my company isn&#x27;t worth $20 billion... it thinks it&#x27;s worth $10 billion. Do I get a refund for past tax payments?<p>The point is that the government will have a very hard time determining what things are worth. It&#x27;s easy to tax income or sales, because those are known values. The price of WeWork, or a Picasso for that matter are not. So what&#x27;s gonna happen? I can guarantee that billionaires are gonna come up with a 1000 ways to claim that they are worth much less than they are. They&#x27;ll start taking companies private. They&#x27;ll put money into hard-to-value and illiquid assets. Some will revoke their citizenship and move elsewhere. On the whole, it <i>may</i> not gonna be great for the economy, even though in a sense there&#x27;s a moral justness to it.<p>There are better ways to tax the wealthy. Higher capital gains taxes and estate taxes to name a few (estate taxes run into the same issues as wealth taxes, but at least it doesn&#x27;t burden people to value their property <i>every year</i>).')
