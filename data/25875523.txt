The article cites a goal of “teaching participants how to think without dictating what to think,” but the same sources already spreading misinformation will reject anything that tries. They&#x27;ll assert that they are dictating what to think. Even if it&#x27;s &quot;misinformation&quot; by my standards and the standards of an overwhelming number of authorities, they&#x27;ll insist that they&#x27;re right and that the &quot;skills&quot; that support me are really just bias.<p>I suspect any program for &quot;cyber citizenship&quot; that could actually be implemented would end up being so vacuous as to be useless.')
