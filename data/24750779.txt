Item(by='sudosysgen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602467962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750475, text='&gt;4chan exists outside of &#x2F;pol&#x2F;, and the rest of the site actively resents it. Doxxes and raids are bannable offenses, and people that openly call for those activities are banned. Yes. Banned. That wasn&#x27;t the case years ago. &#x2F;b&#x2F; was also neutered multiple times to curb the harassment it generated. If you want, you can easily go on &#x2F;pol&#x2F; and make dipshit posts about chuds and cumtown, and they will deride you for it, but they can&#x27;t ban you. The problem stems from moderation, and with &#x2F;pol&#x2F; now being the most active board it&#x27;s gotten increasingly harder to moderate. If you actually bothered to go beyond &#x2F;pol&#x2F;, you&#x27;d see the open hostility that their usebase generates. But you probably only follow &#x2F;pol&#x2F; because it enrages whatever semi-isolated comfortable community you came from.<p>Have you been on 4chan outside of &#x2F;pol&#x2F; since 2016? This isn&#x27;t tha case, &#x2F;pol&#x2F;culture has infiltrated every single board by now. You don&#x27;t notice it because it infiltrated you too.<p>Anyways, let&#x27;s see how ridiculous this is. So, let&#x27;s look at &#x2F;x&#x2F; for 5 seconds - Oh. The coronavirus is a hebrew jewish plot to turn us into cattle and only Trump can save us. Nice.<p>Let&#x27;s look at &#x2F;lit&#x2F; now! I used to enjoy that place. First thread, someone asking about what they should learn. Oh, woudln&#x27;t you guess, it devolved into an IQ thread. A few days ago I tried to give it a chance again, and there was a thread about Hegel were unironically 2&#x2F;3 of the posts had a speech of Hitler as their source on how to interpret Hegel, with a conclusion that is evidently false to anyone<p>So let&#x27;s look at &#x2F;p&#x2F; now. Someone asks, how do I get better skintones in pictures? Half of the replies are insults because they associated with non-whites or calls to genocide.<p>Okay, then let&#x27;s look at &#x2F;sci&#x2F;? Second thread : Quantum Mechanics is untestable somehow and also don&#x27;t believe it because it&#x27;s jewish science.<p>Argh. Maybe &#x2F;mu&#x2F;? Okay then, let&#x27;s see. Out of the first five posts : Two are people trying to debate the impact of african americans in music (with predictable contents), the rest is an unironic moonman thread.<p>As for &#x2F;b&#x2F; and &#x2F;r9k&#x2F;, I don&#x27;t even have to say anything.<p>No, the entirety of 4chan is culturally infested by &#x2F;pol&#x2F;. And so are you. This is an inevitable consequence of the fact that &#x2F;b&#x2F; and &#x2F;pol&#x2F; together are almost 30% of the entire site, and everything else is culutrally neutral or superfocused.<p>You can claim whatever you want about raids and doxxes being banned from 4chan, but they evidently aren&#x27;t banned from &#x2F;pol&#x2F; as long as they are politically motivated. There&#x27;s still a thread on &#x2F;pol&#x2F; right now trying to doxx Doloff.. As for the efforts to get &#x2F;pol&#x2F;tards to &gt;go back, they are useless. It&#x27;s a battle that has long since been lost. &#x2F;b&#x2F; has been neutered, yes, and it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s 4 years too late. 2016 was the point of no return.<p>&gt;Hardly. You are more than welcome to chat with the janitors and moderators on IRC, except they will probably ban you for trying to remove &#x2F;pol&#x2F; because they get complaints like yours every single day, and most often than not its people triggered by fucking australians and canadians roleplaying as nazis interspaced between a few genuine fascists. Once again, having a thin skin on 4chan will give you a bad time, and it sounds like you had a bad time.<p>&gt;roleplaying as nazis<p>When you roleplay for enough years, you start losing &quot;play&quot; part.<p>&gt;A few genuine fascists\n&gt;A few<p>I don&#x27;t want to remove &#x2F;pol&#x2F;, 4chan as a whole is already completely lost. I don&#x27;t care about having a bad time, the cultural hegemony of 4chan has just become literal fascism. Either you became a fascist, or you left, there is no point to it anymore.<p>&gt;And everything is part of the larger merchant driven jewish conspiracy, because once again, it is 4chan, and it&#x27;s not 4chan&#x27;s fault that almost every New York Times or Washington Post opinion editorial writer has a jewish sounding last name. :)<p>You&#x27;re showing your true colors, aren&#x27;t you :). Thank you for proving me right. The only people who didn&#x27;t leave or at least come to loathe that website are literally fasiscts, and you&#x27;re more than on your way there if you&#x27;re not already there. You literally did buy fully into the JQ. I&#x27;m not &gt;making you out to be some sort of far right fascist extremist, you are &quot;protocols of the elders of zion&quot;-level far gone, and that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re trying to hide your power level for the folks over at HN. Liberalism isn&#x27;t even close to being the unopposed cultural hegemony in the anglosphere, and there is more to &quot;opposing liberalism&quot; than quoting Mein Kampf.<p>&gt;Advice Animals, Rage Comics, Pedobear, Xzibit&#x27;s Yo Dawg, Rickrolling, Rules of the Internet, Exploitables, Copypasta and Creepypasta, LOLcats, R9k and its euphoric inceldom, Literally ANY reaction face, Redpill ideology, An Hero, TrollGuy.<p>Yup, and every single one of those is, in the year of our lord 2020 irrelevant, except with for maybe the Rules of the Internet in some circles, which itself was pumped at repurposed from Encyclopedia Dramatica, and rickrolling. Crucially, none of those are from ~2013 before 4chan started seriously going to shit.<p>&gt;which you refuse to acknowledge got popular on the internet because of 4chan<p>Exactly what you were ree-ing about reddit doing, right?<p>&gt;arious creators were also regular 4chan posters, including Rebecca Sugar, Dan Harmon, Deadmau5, Markus Presson (who released alpha and beta versions of Minecraft on &#x2F;v&#x2F; before the rest of the world even knew what Minecraft was)...and probably a lot of more who wish to remain anonymous.<p>All of that, years ago. 4chan is a shithole now.<p>&gt;4chan pokes fun at you, and it pokes fun at itself, because people are far more complex than the consumerist labelism of targeted advertising which strives to extract wealth from them, and that&#x27;s at the apex of our current cultural revolution.<p>It isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s in a cycle we&#x27;ve been in since the 1800s and now 4chan is emblematic of the &quot;1939&quot; stage, except with more incels and NEETs. 4chan was good back in the day, it was interesting, but now it&#x27;s just a place for people that can&#x27;t survive in any pseudonymous community. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s stagnant at ~22M active monthly users for the last 8 years, and why it&#x27;s #1 referal is now jeuxvideo.com (lmao!)<p>4chan is dead, and &#x2F;pol&#x2F; killed it. You&#x27;re just now in so deep that you can&#x27;t see it, and see any assesment of it as an assesment of yourself.')
