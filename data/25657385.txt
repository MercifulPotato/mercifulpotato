A party consisting mostly of former communist politicians won, sure - but pre 1989 there was no democracy, there were elections but just like there are elections in the present-day Democratic Republic of Korea - the ruling party always wins with 99% of the votes. After 1989 we have managed to change the system into democracy where both the parliment and the president are chosen by the people - and well, the best proof of it working is that the SLD party both won and then lost the elections, all before the decade was out.')
