The only thing the vendor can really deny you is the service. In the case of closed source, you can not only be denied the service offered, you also end up with a useless, unpatchable black box if the vendor disappears. In my mind, this makes OSS more resilient, in more ways than one.<p>This doesn’t contradict the point made: of course from an investors point of view I’m sure closed source is often more profitable. But from a consumer perspective, I doubt the same benefits are true.')
