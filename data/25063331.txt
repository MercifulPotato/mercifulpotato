I wish they&#x27;d have stated if they had to make an update to PIM for it to recognize this attack, or if it worked as-is (as-was). The lack of such statement, given that this is a sales blog, strongly suggests they had to update PIM.<p>Indeed it&#x27;s a bit of a cheap shot since they could have gotten the ip via whatismyip.com or any other innumerable ways. It just happened to use CF, which I&#x27;m sure they were jumping in joy about since they get to do a direct compare against CF: Akamai has PIM, CF does not.')
