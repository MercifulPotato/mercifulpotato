We all lived within 250 miles of each other and one day decided to have a gathering with about 6-7 randoms from the channel.  Hilarity ensued as we played games of command and conquer, Starcraft, and Serious Sam.  I was yelled at for saturating the 1.5mbps SDSL line with my webcam, streaming views to our friends who were too far to drive in.  Someone else was eating aluminum soda cans.  At one point one guy happened to login and said “wait you guys are having a LAN party? I’ll hop on the PATH and be right there”.  Then my life changed in front of my eyes.<p>In walks this dude that looked like he came straight out of Hackers.  We all dap up and continue talking about random nerd things.  The conversation goes to cell phones and how the fcc passed this law which OP talks about.  Surprise someone has a grandfathered scanner that could scan 800-900mhz.  Dude that showed up starts talking about how he knows a guy that knows a guy that took his code and runs an elaborate carding net.  Dude then whips out a demodulator app that he wrote that takes beeper signals from the scanner audio and decodes it to text.  He tells us we can pull livery and taxi beeper codes because they text headquarters with the credit card numbers on pickups.  Then his app does it.  One guy holding the scanner at an angle to one of those bend&#x2F;squiggly microphones that were ubiquitous in the AOL era.  Modem like beeping screeching through the air.  Then messages and credit card numbers start streaming through this dudes app. The entire room does a collective holy s#%^ mainly because we can’t believe this would be streaming in “broad daylight” across the Hudson.<p>He went on to explain how he got into hacking almost just like in the movie Hackers.  Dude was brilliant and got recruited into hacking groups as a programmer when he was 13. He was writing stuff like this for 5 years.  We think we had crossed paths at some point because I was deep in the demo scene and wrote patches for hacking groups.. but that day blew my mind about how security through obscurity worked and led me down a black hat path that switched to white hat in the early 2000s')
