I know that Lambda normally reuses a running container for multiple consecutive function invocations. What if I don&#x27;t want to do that for a particular function? Suppose, for security, I don&#x27;t want any leftovers from a previous invocation (in case it had data from a different user). Is there a way I could gracefully tell Lambda to create a fresh container instance for each invocation, and just live with the cold start penalty every time? Edit: I could just look to Fargate at this point, but it sounds like Lambda is doing some extra cold start optimization.')
