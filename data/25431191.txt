However, after work, i spend nearly as many hours on my personal machine which is linux...and that machine runs Fedora 32 for the last several months (I recently switched over from 2 or so years of Linux Mint usage).  When i started with Fedora 32 i started running KDE (and KDE is typically not a choice i tend to make for my DE)...Mind you, i had not run KDE for almost a decade because it used to be too heavy and slow to run for whatever old machines that i used as my personal laptops.  But lately, KDE seems to be lighter...i won&#x27;t go as far to say as light as, say, xfce (and to be fair i have not conducted any fair test between xfce and kde); but KDE nowadays is certainly way better than it used to be.')
