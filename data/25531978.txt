Power output of vacuums. Power output of tea kettles. Rules around washing machines, the shape of cucumbers..<p>Some of those rules have been reformed, however that they existed in the first place was a ridiculous overreach of EU power.<p>Why, for example, is vacuum cleaner power regulated by the EU? Why can’t people sell and buy vacuums that meet their needs? If I have a need for a 3000 watt vacuum, he EU won’t let me have it, even though I pay not only for the product, but any power it consumes.<p>Remember trade is a two way street. If the EU wants access to the UK market, they’ll have to play by UK rules.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;worldnews&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2453204&#x2F;Bent-banana-and-curved-cucumber-rules-dropped-by-EU.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;worldnews&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2453204&#x2F;Be...</a>')
