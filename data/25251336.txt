A typical preparation of the medicine will have a dozen or more plants in it, with two or three recognized as &quot;active&quot; by the standards of Western pharmacology.<p>So it&#x27;s plausible to imagine the curanderos adding a bit of this, a bit of that, as guided by the spirits (or intuition, whatever looked good, your choice), then hitting on the combination.<p>This might sound like I&#x27;m being dismissive of what was most likely a directed search for medicinal plants, which isn&#x27;t my intention. Just simplifying and glossing over that part, to point out that it&#x27;s a two-stage discovery, and you don&#x27;t need both plants in a brew to start using one of them.')
