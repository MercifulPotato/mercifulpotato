Please remember that Nouveau can&#x27;t even do better than a framebuffer on anything newer than a geforce 10 series card. GPU development is just too eratic and fast paced to even try to keep up the effort. Anyone willing to devote that kind of time and expense into the project would be better off engineering a GPU from scratch.')
