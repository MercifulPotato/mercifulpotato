Smart Bookmarks were fantastic. Add your favorite sites&#x27; RSS feeds to your bookmark toolbar and you&#x27;d have all the recent headlines from all your favorite sites at one click. Fortunately I wasn&#x27;t the only one that appreciated this long neglected feature so someone created Livemarks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nt1m&#x2F;livemarks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nt1m&#x2F;livemarks&#x2F;</a>) that mostly replicated its functionality, but it&#x27;s not quite the same as having native support for them.')
