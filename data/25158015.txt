Late 80s. And I have been thinking a lot about insulation and heat &#x2F; ac bills lately. Because we are home all the time. No more timers that let it not run during the hottest parts of the day and such. Trying to figure out how much effort to put in. We got new windows recently and they are not as cold to the touch as the old ones, but probably are leaking more air too. So not sure it was a huge positive. Before that I blew more insulation into the attic, but don&#x27;t think I did enough. Trying to figure out what next. Keep thinking about trying to find someone to blow in foam into the exterior walls, but know thats not going to be cheap. And take a very long time to pay itself off.')
