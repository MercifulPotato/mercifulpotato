It&#x27;s also around the amount of time when business owners welcomed their kids into company leadership positions. The post-war and somewhat &quot;sheltered&quot; children probably weren&#x27;t as compassionate towards their fellow American (as their war-time parents were), leading to benefit reductions, lackluster pay-raises, and overall reduction of profit-sharing, etc. If you look around, it&#x27;s pretty clear this has been compounding ever since.')
