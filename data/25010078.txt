It can also be things like unit tests.<p>Both of those can be anchors that can assure quality and coherence, but they can also become anchors that prevent the ship from moving.<p>Documentation is a <i>huge</i> pain for me. I hate writing it (but I&#x27;m actually fairly good at it). Code documentation is something that I&#x27;ve inculcated into my personal process[0], but &quot;product docs&quot; can be a whole different story (not just things like PDFs, but also support sites, etc.).<p>The biggest problem with both documentation and unit test suites, is that they can easily become &quot;concrete galoshes&quot;[1], that add a great deal of work to a lot of product modification and improvement strategies.<p>Can we call something that prevents or makes extension and modification more difficult &quot;tech debt&quot;? Maybe, maybe not.<p>It&#x27;s definitely possible to write unit tests in a fashion that helps to modify codebases, but that takes a fair bit of planning and care; not something that our industry is known for, when we are in a &quot;ship crunch&quot; (I have known many organizations that deliberately try to maintain a constant state of &quot;ship crunch,&quot; because their managers believe it to be more productive). I tend to prefer test harnesses, over unit tests, because of this[2].\nIn fact, just this morning, I was lamenting that I need to make some changes to a heavily unit-tested codebase that may cause issues with the unit tests. The fixes need to happen, even if they pooch the tests, but I will need to go back and re-run the tests, and fix any that erroneously fail. It&#x27;s a really big job, for this codebase. My testing code is generally much larger than the code under test.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;leaving-a-legacy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;leaving-a-legacy&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;concrete-galoshes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;concrete-galoshes&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;testing-harness-vs-unit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;testing-harness-vs-u...</a>')
