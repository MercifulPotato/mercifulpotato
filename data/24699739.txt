It&#x27;s not for me, but it&#x27;s probably for somebody.<p>There&#x27;s just too much of a premium for this over a standard DigitalOcean droplet though. At the low end you&#x27;re paying double for the same resources, and at the high end you&#x27;re paying 4x.<p>I deployed a toy Node.js app that was a bit too resource hungry for 1 virtual CPU. The cheapest plan with 2 virtual CPUs is $150 per month (vs. $15 for a droplet with 2 virtual CPUs).<p>Seems like there are some pricing issues to work out.')
