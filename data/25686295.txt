When global warming is finally solved, it will have been by 10 separate things that each solved 5-20% of the problem.<p>Also, imposing an arbitrary deadline in 2029 is horrible project management. In a commercial project it&#x27;s also dumb, but at least there you can cancel the project, and people move on to do other things.<p>For Earth, we can&#x27;t cancel the planet in 2029 if targets weren&#x27;t met.')
