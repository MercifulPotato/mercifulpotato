Item(by='wokkel', descendants=None, kids=[25669986], score=None, time=1610014282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667147, text='I&#x27;ve read the word &quot;mitigation&quot; so much (not only here, and not only you; so this comment is not directed at you personally) that I only hear doublespeak now: when people say mitigation I immediately think of a slab of concrete in the back of my car to compensate for not having any brakes installed. Please recognize for what it is: a design failure that is pampered upon. A mitigation is not a solution, it lessens the impact of the failure mode that was identified. Afaik, if the flushes and changes actually work, it is not a mitigation but a workaround: the failure mode cannot occur anymore. Mitigation sounds better than workaround though (and is probably the reason it was choosen).')
