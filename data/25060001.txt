There are important long term changes that lower the marriage rate that also tend to lower the divorce rate.<p>One is that it has become much more acceptable for couples to live together before getting married. 50 years ago, doing so was seen as somewhat scandalous by a large fraction of the population. In many circles, even sex before marriage was still frowned upon.<p>That would lead to couple getting married, then moving in together for the first time and perhaps even having sex together for the first time. Those are huge changes in the nature of the relationship.<p>It is not too hard to find that you get alone great with someone when you do not live with them and&#x2F;or do not have sex with them but that you do not when living with them and&#x2F;or having sex with them.<p>Thus, I&#x27;d expect with living together and premarital sex much more accepted for many couples that in the past would have found out they should not be married until <i>after</i> they got married to find that out nowadays during the &quot;living together&quot; stage.<p>That couple nowadays becomes a &quot;never married&quot; couple rather than a &quot;divorced after a short marriage&quot; couple. This contributes to lowering both the marriage rate and the divorce rate.<p>I&#x27;d expect a similar effect from the growing acceptance of having amd raising a child as a single parent. Many couples that never wanted to get married in the first place used to do so if they had a birth control failure while dating. I&#x27;d expect that too led to eventually divorces that would not happen in similar circumstances today.')
