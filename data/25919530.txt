Most popular, groundbreaking technology isn&#x27;t the first version of itself. Eg, I think of this profile of Tony West: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;12&#x2F;soul&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;12&#x2F;soul&#x2F;</a><p>Tony West is the protagonist of The Soul of a New Machine by Tracy Kidder, the account of Data General creating a new microcomputer in the 80s. The first season of H&amp;CF borrows heavily from it. He was ahead of the curve on a lot of things - laser printers, computers, laptops, thin clients...but never had the ability to bring it all to market in a meaningful way.<p>The tech industry is full of people like this - people that can build the future but not sell it.
