They were getting somewhere ~250 mbps on speed test.<p>Fast forward to everyone having 4g phones, now in practice I see like 1-2% of those speeds typically.<p>I have no idea the inner workings of starlink&#x27;s protocol, but these aspects of wireless seem inevitable. once theres more simultaneous connections than in limited beta, each connection gets a smaller time slice or less frequency band, no?<p>I do not see how its solved either.<p>Currently I have rural DSL, approximately 3mbps down, 1 mbps up, but cheaper and reliable. The one person who has starlink beta is posting 200+ mbps screenshots but if everyone here connects I&#x27;m skeptical the result isn&#x27;t slower, less reliable, more expensive than what&#x27;s already here.')
