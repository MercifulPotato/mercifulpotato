The language is not so aesthetic in many places, but the language was very certainly thoughtfully designed and iterated on. Features by and large work surprisingly well together to form a cohesive language. I don’t agree about things being “tacked on”, which is voluminously evidenced in the discussions about each and every feature.<p>The standard could have been bigger and more comprehensive. But it’s just a non-problem most of the time. Threading is <i>de facto</i> standard and extremely well understood in its interactions with Common Lisp as defined.<p>Common Lisp is an extremely capable language to get things done cleanly. It just does things in a way that simply <i>feels</i> different from later languages.<p>If you want to talk about bolted on features, look no further than the plethora of Scheme libraries.')
