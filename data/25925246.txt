Because let&#x27;s be clear: FB, Twitter, YouTube, ... (and to a slightly lesser degree, Google) - they are all media distributors and opinion amplifiers. <i>Much like traditional publishers.</i> Only instead of creating or sourcing their own content, they syndicate.<p>We also have to acknowledge that content moderation at scale is impossible.[ß] The lines are hazy and fluid, context matters, and incentives are outright perverse. The volume of incoming material is overwhelming. On top of that, people with money, fame or lulz on the line will game any rules based system.<p>But what if these online syndicates had to publish corrections for their worst offenses? News outlets have had to do that for decades, after all. We could as a society take this as an opportunity to move the goal posts for the better. Instead of allowing the correction to be buried in a dark corner nobody ever sees, specify that the correction itself has to be displayed as prominently as the original news itself.<p>You&#x27;re doing print? Then that correction will eat up prime eyeball real estate from the publication. (And make it clear you messed up.) You&#x27;re an online syndicate? The correction needs to go through the same amplification mechanism and get as prominently on top of the users&#x27; feeds as the original item did. It eats up prime screen real estate and makes it equally clear that you messed up.<p>This would have three benefits:<p>1) Content publishers become accountable for their actions. The US media in particular is obsessed with just throwing whatever they get their hands on out there and have the readers sort it out for themselves. To hell with accuracy.<p>2) The requirement to surface corrections as widely as the original item(s) provides a second-order incentive. Your publication forfeits revenue and opportunity from whatever other news are currently floating around, costing both money and reputation. Mess up more often, get punished more often.<p>3) The readers would benefit from increased media literacy education. Get bombarded with garbage and outright lies? Receive more fact-checks after the fact, published and syndicated through the same funnels that fed you the original trash.<p>Freedom of speech is not freedom from accountability.<p>ß: Mike Masnick has been saying this for years.
