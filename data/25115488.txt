Could have the program check the transform... but I&#x27;d like to save the user all that rewriting...<p>- You could specify the arguments with a function at that point (using location to address them). Seems just as bad.<p>- An awkward <i>path</i> through the parse tree to specify each argument is also possible.<p>- In a GUI, arguments could be selected by clicking.<p>- The user could name the transform, and the program automatically find where it is applicable, and apply it - or give a list of applications, and the user selects which one.  But this is a step towards an automatic theorem prover, and is more automation than I want the user to have.<p>Are there other ways?')
