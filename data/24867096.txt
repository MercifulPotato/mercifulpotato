Even in a massive area, the correct way to distrubute people in it is so that they can access what they need with ease. Let people live next to the store, their office, the bus stop and so on. How far apart clusters of people are will determine the overall density. Density doesn&#x27;t say much about whether people are clustered or more evenly spread out however.')
