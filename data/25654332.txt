Bizarre and inscrutable syntax. They say things like &quot;build scripts are just Groovy code&quot;, but some things, like how you define sourcesets or configurations, don&#x27;t look like anything that should parse, much less compile, in any C-like language. They&#x27;re doing some fancy meta-programming stuff behind the scenes to keep things light and simple, but it really isolates (and possibly alienates) developers from exactly what&#x27;s happening under the covers. The Kotlin DSL seems to help make it more clear what&#x27;s going on, but I haven&#x27;t used it much yet.<p>Having used Gradle for years, it is strangely off-putting how unsure I often am about whether to put a colon in a particular place or a comma, or if something should be in parenthesis.<p>2. If you want to do anything beyond what&#x27;s documented you can get into a bit of trouble, and if you find answers more than a couple of years old there&#x27;s a good chance they often won&#x27;t work. Making sense of the DSL documentation is sometimes a little tricky.<p>Beyond that, I would dare say it&#x27;s the least awful option for building for the JVM. Their documentation is very comprehensive, it&#x27;s fast, they are very fair about providing deprecation warnings before features are removed. It&#x27;s rare I find a case where I&#x27;d like to use some external library that has a Maven plugin but no Gradle support.')
