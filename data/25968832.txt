As a macOS User I&#x27;m quite happy with the restrictions and sandbox of macOS, as I also occasionally use Windows and see whats going on there: 3rd Party Applications that you install scanning your harddrive and extracting calendar entries, contacts, heck even your Steam Game List just to upload it to the cloud and sell the data. 10 Years ago those app would be reported as mal-&#x2F;adware by your Antivirus, but since this has become &quot;the new default&quot; nowadays you cannot trust any application on windows anymore - especially since the largest cooperations that you thought are trustworthy, like i.e. Adobe are in on this.<p>So yes, security on macOS is anoying sometimes (&quot;Do you want to allow App X to access your Downloads folder?&quot;) but I can see why allowing software just arbitrary disk&#x2F;network access nowaday is not a good idea anymore.')
