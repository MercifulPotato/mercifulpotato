Lately I have been looking into how museums put together exhibits and how to integrate some of their approaches into web or print publishing.<p>It feels like so much of what you described is lost today ie., skill and decorum in displaying words meaningfully. If I may ask, what are some personal design principles that you look for when critiquing a publication (be it print or on the Web)?<p>For the record I am not employed by any company or agency, I am only an individual who is trying to get a better understanding of what <i>I</i> should be looking for as a consumer and creator myself. To boot, I appreciate your insight and the thought processes behind it. Thank you!')
