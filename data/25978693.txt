And even so, the feelings of love, contentment, and accomplishment are absolutely life changers. If you don&#x27;t love someone other than yourself, you are missing out. If you feel that you need for no one else to be able to love their spouse in order to appreciate your own relationship, you are.. selfish? confused?<p>On another note, this is a girl marrying a guy. The pains she takes to keep everything gender neutral (eg. I waited in their bed, where &quot;their&quot; is her future husband Matt) is so woke and childish, it hurts me to read it.')
