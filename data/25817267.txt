If I google, I don&#x27;t see any evidence that any patent or block of patents is blocking the &quot;tech&quot;. Could you specify which specific patent is blocking?<p>&gt; tied up the tech stack in so many patents, NDA&#x27;s, and exorbitant prices that no one wants to touch it.<p>But... you do realize there&#x27;s lots of startups that enter the bistable display space? eg: ClearInk. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clearinkdisplays.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clearinkdisplays.com&#x2F;</a> They even use the exact same underlying principle which is electrophoresis.<p>If you go to any display conference you&#x27;ll easily see that most of what you&#x27;re saying comes across as highly inaccurate or even ridiculous.')
