There&#x27;s likely continuity going into Biden&#x27;s China policy. He&#x27;s arguably more dangerous to Chinese interest than Pompeo. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s going to be much movement towards improving relations until Biden sorts US out for a couple years and there&#x27;s some semblance of where Trump&#x2F;Pompeo&#x2F;Hawks&#x2F;Republican party is heading for next election. Sanctioning Pompeo probably a gift for his presidential aspirations anyway. Otherwise it looks pretty reciprocal, China doesn&#x27;t have SWIFT levers, so have to inconvenience another way.')
