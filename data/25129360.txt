He&#x27;s portrayed as nearly flawless. This plays into the White Savior[0] trope.</i><p>So now if a white man in media is shown pushing back against racism, he&#x27;s looked down upon as a trope? This is racist and ridiculous. Damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-dont will not get white people on your side on this issue.<p><i>requiring that teachers use better teaching tools in their curriculums isn&#x27;t the boogeyman it seems to be made out to be.</i><p>If such changes are made for racist reasons, then they deserve pushback. Current projections show that whites will be a minority in the US in 2048. If our society embraces anti-white discrimination and dogwhistles like this in the meantime, then there will be cultural reverberations for decades just as the cultural changes of the 70&#x27;s reverberate through today.')
