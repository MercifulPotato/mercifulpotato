The power spectrum, or Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function, isn&#x27;t monotonic for matter on large scales. For example, baryonic acoustic oscillations at early times in the Universe get &quot;imprinted&quot; into the cosmic structure, such that galaxies have a preferential separation between each other.')
