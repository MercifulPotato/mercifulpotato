Another example I remember seeing was crypto&#x2F;hashing performance where you could find embedded processors competing with much faster general chips because they had dedicated instructions for those use-cases, and performance would fall off of a cliff if you used different encryption or hashing settings or an unoptimized libssl.<p>I’d be curious how the unified memory architecture shifts the cost dynamic for GPU acceleration. There’s a fair amount of SIMD work where the cost of copying to&#x2F;from the GPU is greater than the savings until you get over a particular amount of data and that threshold should be different on systems like the M1.')
