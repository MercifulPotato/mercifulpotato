But I also think this is quite a malignant &amp; user-de-empowering &amp; tragic development for the web. The DOM has been extremely powerful as a common language, that users can make use of directly &amp; via extensions &amp; scrapers. Stealing this fire back from the users, renegging on the web&#x27;s promise that it&#x27;s the user&#x27;s agent, for them to use to navigate the web as they like: that&#x27;s a great &amp; sad regression.<p>In my opinion the web is worthwhile &amp; useful. Bypassing it, treating the web like thin-client, a way to push pixels in people&#x27;s face, via some auxiliary rendering process, be it local (webassembly) or remote, is a terrible usurpation of user&#x27;s agency. Projects like Flutter&#x27;s CanvasKit &amp; others are a great danger to one of the few piece of technology that has enabled users some level of control &amp; freedom, the web.')
