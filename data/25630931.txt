So use that example above more as a visual representation)<p>This will generate a non-reversible password with an entropy of 25^64 but it is re-creatable on any system that can display a web page and the password is not stored anywhere (so it&#x27;s firmly &quot;something you know&quot;). If the password becomes compromised then you change your salt and a new unique password will be generated. Thus you only need to memorise a small subset of salts rather than a password per site.<p>This was how I used to do passwords several years ago before I gave into the convenience of password managers.')
