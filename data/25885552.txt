Now that does not mean we should not curb CO2 emissions, rather it is the degree of opacity and uncertainty in a system, as well as asymmetry in effect, rather than specific model predictions, that should drive the precautionary measures.<p>Push a complex system too far and it will not come back. The popular belief that uncertainty undermines the case for taking seriously the &quot;climate crisis&quot; that scientists tell us we face is the opposite of the truth. Properly understood, as driving the case for precaution, uncertainty radically underscores that case, and may even constitute it.')
