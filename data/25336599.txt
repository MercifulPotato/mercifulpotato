A LOT of our migrations are from people who got started on MongoDB, and then it fell over. Another group come from DynamoDB, and then they see their monthly bill.<p>There are also people who have moved to Scylla from PostgreSQL because it fell over, or those who blanched at their Oracle bill.<p>Scalability is not inherent to SQL or NoSQL. It requires both technical features as well as economical offerings. It is a quality of a product made with users and real-world workloads in mind.<p>As in all DB work, YMMV.')
