Minimum scale for any sort of nuclear thermal rocket is below what you&#x27;d want for a manned interplanetary mission, and is thus not relevant.<p>Solar power plus ion engines is in the 1&#x2F;2000 TWR range as far as I&#x27;m aware. That means millimeters per second squared acceleration of your total craft at best, and means you basically don&#x27;t save any time over a standard minimum-delta-v Hohmann transfer - 0.001 m&#x2F;s^2 continuous acceleration gets you 2 AU in ~400 days. It could also do 66,717,283km - the Earth-Mars distance at time of writing - in ~189 days. A Hohmann transfer from Earth to Mars is 259 days. And, of course, the above numbers don&#x27;t take into consideration matching velocities or escaping Earth&#x27;s gravity well in the first place. [1] does a good job of describing why the power supply is the primary limiting factor here.<p>Liquid-core NTRs [0] aren&#x27;t bimodal, and I&#x27;m sort of confused what you&#x27;d mean by bimodal here in the first place.<p>0: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectrho.com&#x2F;public_html&#x2F;rocket&#x2F;enginelist2.php#ntrliquid" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectrho.com&#x2F;public_html&#x2F;rocket&#x2F;enginelist2.php...</a><p>1: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectrho.com&#x2F;public_html&#x2F;rocket&#x2F;enginelist.php#powersupply" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectrho.com&#x2F;public_html&#x2F;rocket&#x2F;enginelist.php#...</a>')
