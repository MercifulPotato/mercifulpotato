It lets you get together with someone who&#x27;s hours away from you and have experiences together in a shared space. The avatars actually convey a pretty convincing sense of &quot;this is another person next to me that I&#x27;m talking to&quot; in a way that video calls don&#x27;t. You trade facial expressions for a sense of physical proximity.<p>Or comparing to normal first person video games, you can see your friends&#x27; character as a fully detailed model, you know they&#x27;re controlling what direction it turns, when it moves, whether it jumps. But the character fundamentally isn&#x27;t <i>them</i>, it&#x27;s a character that they&#x27;re controlling.<p>And that&#x27;s the weird thing about people&#x27;s avatars in VR, it might be a low resolution floating torso and hands, but being in VR where the physical motion of their head and hands is directly translated to avatar movements makes it feel like the avatar is a low-detailed person instead of a high-detailed puppet.<p>The games and other experiences are obviously part of the selling point too. Being able to deflect blaster bolts with a lightsaber, throw droids off the top of a building with the force, shoot hordes of zombies, fly a jetpack, become a wizard, solve puzzles by working together with giant and tiny copies of yourself, have your friends talk you through defusing a bomb, and so many other things that we haven&#x27;t thought of yet.<p>Smaller market, but I can see a lot of promise for virtual training simulations as well. Less sophisticated than flight simulator cockpits for pilots, but dramatically more accessible.')
