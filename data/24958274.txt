There were no executives from the parent corporation present in Germany, all the other employees were Germans, no money could be transferred out of Germany, and after a while they even had to get special permission to send telegrams in or out. They still called themselves Ford Germany or IBM Germany or whatever, but the reality is that this was just a name that they used; there were no real ties of ownership or control left. Naturally when France fell, the French subsidies suffered the same fate, or even worse.')
