AMD&#x27;s drivers are often not usable in released kernels until many months after hardware is released. For example, AMD is just now adding initial support for their new GPUs [1]. From what I have read, good support for AMD&#x27;s previous generation is only now getting to distributions.<p>Intel on the other hand typically has their drivers in released kernels long before their hardware is released. Intel&#x27;s New GPUs haven&#x27;t been released yet, but they first started adding support in early 2019 [2]. I can&#x27;t find it now, but I remember hearing a story about Intel removing drivers from the kernel tree for some hardware that they cancelled.<p>If you want to use a modern high-end GPU in Linux, your only real choice continues to be Nvidia. Their drivers are not open source, but at least they work at launch (except maybe with a 5.9 kernel?).<p>This is why Intel entering into the high-end GPU space is so exciting. Soon we may have a high-end option with good open source drivers while the part is still high-end.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-5.9-Released" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-5....</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;jasonevangelho&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;intel-already-adding-linux-kernel-support-for-2020-dedicated-gpu-releases&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;jasonevangelho&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;18&#x2F;intel...</a>')
