I walk, which is already a commitment.<p>One further problem in the UK, in my opinion, is that roads have always been built, and, worse, continue to be built, the absolute narrowest possible. Very often it is already tight for cars, so cycle lanes are out of the question and cycling is very dangerous. Ideally, all new roads (at least urban and in residential areas) should be wide enough in order to include a good size bike lane segregated from cars... Once again, though, there is no long term plan, at best they&#x27;re just winging it with a quite paint job on the road.')
