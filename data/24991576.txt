Every piece of mail is weighed and imaged and sender anf recipient are placed into a database, so it is impossible to send a letter without creating a permanent record of source and destination.<p>You can, of course, leave off the return address, and this works fine for letter mail.<p>Packages, however, require ID to be dropped off. You cannot use the USPS to send packages anonymously.<p>The analogous version for a state-run ISP would be a blanket filter&#x2F;ban on Tor&#x2F;VPN usage.<p>I donâ€™t think the USPS is a good example of a state-run organization for that reason. The state has already demonstrated their desire to eradicate personal privacy and anonymity.')
