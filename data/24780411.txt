It&#x27;s apple, they not only have the resources and expertise to manage multiple relationships, but they have the market power to drain HUGE number of subscribers from the company by announcing the iPhone wouldn&#x27;t be available at Verizon if they didn&#x27;t play along with apple&#x27;s demands.<p>This dishonesty (plus the huge verizon plug in keynote) doesn&#x27;t look like having carriers bend over, it looks more like apple bending over. Which makes no sense, apple could probably (almost) buy verizon in all cash if they wanted.<p>What&#x27;s crazier, is that (in 2020) 5g is just not that important or valuable. So why is any company (except infrastructure companies) really putting in this much marketing effort?')
