My car does slow down, safely, when it gets confused or contradictory feedback, and I am curious what the in beta FSD software will do. Their new technique looks vastly improved.<p>Traffic aware cruise control which many cars have along with limited lane keep assist can go a long way to making the drive safer but many don&#x27;t use TACC except on highways<p>Look at it this way, its coming. However it is all one sided because again I emphasize, we need better and more consistent signage and road marking.<p>US wise, the HOV and Express lanes are probably the most perfect use case for self driving cars. Get into the lane and it should be hands off until exit.')
