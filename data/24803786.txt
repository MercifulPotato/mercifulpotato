My left ear now has tinnitus, and I too have a hard time hearing conversation in large groups of people. However, after the wreck, I visited hearing specialist several times. I always passed their tests of the faint frequencies. They cannot explain where the ringing originates.?!?! It&#x27;s one of those things it is hard to get a doctor to believe you since they can&#x27;t actually see anything wrong. No broken bones, no lacerations, not bruising, nothing. Just ringing that they cannot hear.')
