Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608835149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25529491, text='A typical long lease is longer than a lifetime, maybe 99 or 120 years, but you could in principle write a shorter one of just a few decades, or a much longer one of hundreds of years.<p>As I understand it the main residual value is from payment to renew leases (mortgage lenders don&#x27;t want to lend against a home you may not have in a few decades, so it&#x27;s often not possible to sell a lease to a &quot;normal&quot; buyer who wants a mortgage if it has say 50 years left on it, you&#x27;d pay to renew it), and from any &quot;ground rent&quot; owed by the leaseholders each year indefinitely. Historically ground rent was often set at a token amount, but of course there was an opportunity for greedy people to jack that up when creating a new leasehold property and so e.g. mine is £250 per annum.<p>It doesn&#x27;t feel like renting at all, it&#x27;s just that historically English law provided no way to outright own 3D space, only 2D parcels of land can have freehold, and arguably in practice it wouldn&#x27;t mean anything anyway. If I &quot;owned&quot; this space, but the building it is in burned down, how do I live here without re-building it?<p>The freeholder is responsible for insuring the building (the certificate of insurance is posted on a notice board on the main entrance floor of my building near the weird art that presumably the owners or builders liked, and the elevator) and collecting a fair share of insurance premiums from all leaseholders, likewise they hire a maintenance company to sort the gardens, do elevator safety checks, resurface the parking, clear junk illegally left by ex-tenants (could they try to sue instead of billing the remaining tenants? Sure, but if a lawsuit costs £1000 and hiring a clearance firm costs £180 guess which gets done) and so on.<p>Leaseholders can (are legally always entitled to) buy the freehold, but now you&#x27;ve got the headache you were paying somebody else to deal with. You (collectively) need to buy insurance, hire a maintenance firm, and so on or else pay to hire somebody to do that on behalf of everybody. For a shared building where I live (as opposed to standalone houses) this division of labour makes at least some sense and I&#x27;m not opposed to it continuing to exist. Creating more leasehold <i>houses</i> is crazy nonsense, but alas the present governing party really like rich people, and thus has not exactly prioritised banning such practices.')
