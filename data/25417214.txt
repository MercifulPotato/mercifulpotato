I have driven from Norway to the UK and back several times over the last three years via Germany, I think that probably only half the motorway driving in Germany was unrestricted.  And even where it is technically unrestricted the traffic is so heavy during the rush hour that you can sometimes walk faster.  I have Hamburg and its perennial roadworks in mind.')
