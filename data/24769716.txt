Bigger phones are easier to throw more tech in since you&#x27;re less constrained by physical size while also making the devices thinner. There was also no risk of losing market share since nobody makes smaller phones anymore. And lastly, most people still bought the product that was available.<p>I am excited to see this return to a smaller form factor. I hope we can get a Pro model eventually and decouple budget and size.')
