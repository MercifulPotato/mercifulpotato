The final deal has the U.K. out of both, with some options for tariff-free trade if you filled out the right forms, but there aren’t enough customs experts to fill out all those forms even if it was a zero-cost exercise.<p>However this is just an interesting aside; regarding MasterCard fees, the <i>explicit</i> point of Brexit was to no longer be bound by EU rules, and so the UK (with huge caveats yet to be fully explored because the agreement has been TL;DRed <i>by the U.K. government</i>) is no longer required to follow rules like the one MasterCard IDs referring to here. (Probably. It’s a long document).')
