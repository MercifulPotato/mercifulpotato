It is quite shocking to hear anyone imply that F# is not ready for production use - that it is just &quot;cool&quot; tech. (when has F# ever been cool in the minds of the masses?)<p>I suspect you&#x27;ll say &quot;7 years is nothing&quot; and <i>maybe</i> it is nothing. But it is still something. It is long enough that we made a couple bad framework&#x2F;library dependency choices early on and to have learnt lessons from such mistakes.<p>By far the biggest technical challenge we&#x27;ve faced in that time is the .NET 5 migration - but even that might turn out to be a lot easier than I currently envisage.')
