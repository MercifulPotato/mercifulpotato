LFTR breeds its fuel and &quot;burns&quot; almost all of it, none of that solid fuel rod crap where only a small fraction is used and then you have &quot;spent fuel rods&quot;. Fuel shipments would be Thorium, not hyper-radioactive dirty bomb materials. No chance of meltdown. No high pressure containers.<p>As for the pace of research, from what I understand nuclear is WEIRD. The permitting process is controlled by government forces that:<p>1) don&#x27;t want you researching it due to proliferation risk\n2) are military so if you are permitted want access to weapons grade isotopes\n3) are the spent fuel rod lobbyists trying to keep their bacon rolling in\n4) NIMBY to the nth power<p>So everything is almost impossible to get going.<p>The replaceable shipping container sized LFTR has great potential.')
