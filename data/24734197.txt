Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602275906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733112, text='&gt; The reality is that there is quite a lot evolution denialism in the Islamic world<p>Not disagreeing with you (based on my own experience), but I would caution against generalizations when dealing with a population of over a billion. In some Muslim countries, over half the population believes in evolution.<p>I can&#x27;t find a comprehensive study on this, but the theory of evolution is taught in high schools in many (most?) Muslim countries (even if they don&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; in it). Indeed, I suspect the opposition in several states in the US is greater than in many Muslim countries. Iran, for example, teaches it in a fair amount of detail.<p>In addition, the situation is fairly dynamic (e.g. taught in a given country, but banned a few years ago, or vice versa).')
