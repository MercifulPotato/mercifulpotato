It has a built-in package manager with an enormous selection of officially supported and community submitted plugins, complete with VST and Linux support.<p>- Waveform Free[4]:  By Tracktion, Waveform is a robust DAW with VST sandboxing and great built-in FX.<p>- Audio Tool[5]: A great web-based DAW, featuring online collaboration.  Last I checked, there was no VST support.<p>- Bandlab[6]: Another web-based DAW by the folks behind Cakewalk.  While it lacks VST support, it offers online collaboration and straight-forward defaults.<p>If you like scripting, Reaper[7] offers a personal license for $60 and supports Lua, Python, EEL2&#x2F;JSFX, and it&#x27;s own ReaScript[8].  Reaper offers a highly customizable, robust solution for power-users.  While the above projects are some of the more complete projects, there are many more scattered around Github.  If you&#x27;re interested in the more niche&#x2F;experimental ones, let me know and I&#x27;ll reply with my more comprehensive list.<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve been an Ableton Live user for over a decade and I recommend it for anyone who wants to invest into a more serious music project.  These days, I tend to reach for Studio One[9] by Presonus for more involved projects.  While it lacks the focus on live performance, it is more feature-complete DAW than Ableton.  Studio One doesn&#x27;t have the same friction-less workflow that Ableton is famous for, but it&#x27;s an absolute powerhouse when mastered.  It&#x27;s very well funded and one of the youngest, so Presonus had the opportunity to adopt the best features of more dated solutions like Cubase, Logic, Pro-Tools, and Ableton, while stripping away a lot of the bloat.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmms.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmms.io&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ardour.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ardour.org&#x2F;</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vcvrack.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vcvrack.com&#x2F;</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tracktion.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;waveform-free" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tracktion.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;waveform-free</a>\n[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audiotool.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.audiotool.com</a>\n[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bandlab.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bandlab.com&#x2F;</a>\n[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reaper.fm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reaper.fm</a>\n[8] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reaper.fm&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;reascript&#x2F;reascript.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reaper.fm&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;reascript&#x2F;reascript.php</a>\n[9] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.presonus.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;studio-one&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.presonus.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;studio-one&#x2F;</a>')
