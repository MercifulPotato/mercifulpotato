Item(by='Mvandenbergh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605694711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134600, text='Two thirds of UK car-owners have off-street parking so it simply isn&#x27;t true that &quot;most people do on-street parking&quot; on a national level. In London, sure it&#x27;s much rarer. You point out that public transport is bad outside of London. Certainly true but it is also the case that we are then left only with the problem of places that have poor public transport and very little off-street parking as the most problematic areas. That&#x27;s quite a step down from needing a charger at every parking spot.<p>The real meat of this is the additional Â£1.3bn of funding for on-street charging. That is enough for hundreds of thousands of simple Ubitricity style lamp-post chargers which will go a long way since private companies are also installing chargers on concession contracts with local authorities and at shopping centre car parks and other convenience charging location. I don&#x27;t doubt that further charging funding will be required.<p>It is true that fast and rapid charger roll-out requires reinforcement of the electrical distribution infrastructure which makes them substantially more expensive to install but that is because they are both high current and &quot;must run&quot; - when you plug into one you want it to charge your vehicle immediately as fast as possible, not decide to wait until 2AM. Most on-street chargers on residential streets will be for slow, overnight charging which can be co-ordinated to do the bulk of their charging during the low-load overnight period.<p>Then there is the timing: this is a ban on <i>new</i> sales from 2030 which means that there will be substantial petrol and diesel cars on the road until late into the 2030s. New hybrids are not banned until 2035 in the current plan. So even properties that are still not near a charging point by 2035 will still have access to brand new hybrids and five year old ICE vehicles.<p>The current share of electric cars as part of new vehicle sales is 8% already and without this intervention probably would have reached more than two thirds anyway, the whole point is to signal that this is coming well ahead of time to accelerate that transition.')
