Item(by='daenz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609644667, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25619092, text='&gt;It would be hard to imagine the Government getting away with bombing downtown San Francisco without any consequences.<p>I didn&#x27;t say &quot;downtown San Francisco&quot;, I said &quot;your home.&quot; How would you prove that blew up your home? If you can&#x27;t prove it, then they got away with it. My point is that when we open up the definition of &quot;can&quot; in this headline to mean &quot;things the government can do and get away with&quot;, then it becomes meaningless if it&#x27;s not bounded by the legality of those things. There are a boundless number of things, including assassinations, framings, etc etc, that the government &quot;can&quot; do and get away with.<p>So the only definition of &quot;can&quot; worth discussing, since the headline is intentionally vague about what &quot;can&quot; means, is whether or not it is legal to do the things described.')
