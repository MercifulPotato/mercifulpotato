They buy them to run games or do professional compute tasks (video rendering, 3d rendering, photo editing, code compiling, etc.). The companies that work in these spaces have realized that they can&#x27;t write single threaded code any more. For example, the two big games I play, Hunt:Showdown (cryengine) and Modern Warfare (custom engine) are both happy to use all sixteen logical threads of my Ryzen 3700x. Gone are the days when gamers only cares about single core performance.')
