I&#x27;d appreciate answers to any of the below that you feel comfortable sharing:<p>- How many have you built? (Either in net terms or per year&#x2F;month). How many do you still maintain?<p>- Is that level of income based on 1 or 2 big wins, or is it dozens of smaller-netting projects that don&#x27;t take much maintenance?<p>- What kinds of projects? Apps, websites, services?<p>- Are there any guides&#x2F;websites that you found particularly helpful in discovering an exploitable niche, or learning the necessary marketing&#x2F;etc?')
