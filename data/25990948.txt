You. nor the bank, can&#x27;t lend more money that you have, but you can <i>promise</i> more than you have.<p>That automatically implies something more complicated than lending. At the very least, money was borrowed (on a promise) from a third party in order to provide the money they loaned.<p>You and I <i>can</i> do the same, I can promise you whatever I like. And if I manage to convince you, or a third party, that my promise is good, I can even borrow money from them. And loan out that money, despite not owing it; Unless there is something fraudulent in doing that wrt my agreements with the borrower - but the bank has the same, nationally regulated, restrictions too.')
