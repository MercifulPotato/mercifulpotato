Item(by='fauigerzigerk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609188804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25561379, text='Apple claims there are 20m registered developers on the App Store [1]. If each of them buys a Mac once every 4 years, that&#x27;s 5m Macs per year. IDC estimates that Apple shipped 18m Macs in 2019 [2]. So 28% of all Macs would have gone to developers. If developers buy more expensive machines (or more machines) than the average customer, their share of sales could be significantly higher.<p>However, I don&#x27;t quite believe that there really are 20m active developers on the Apple platform. Evans Data estimates that there is a total of 27m developers worldwide [3]. It&#x27;s not plausible that 74% of them should be writing software for Apple platforms. On the other hand, not all developers using a Mac are developing for the App Store. A lot of them will be Web developers.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if developers&#x27; share of Mac sales is 30%. Maybe it&#x27;s just 20%. I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s definitely not tiny.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;04&#x2F;app-store-hits-20m-registered-developers-at-100b-in-revenues-500m-visitors-per-week&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;04&#x2F;app-store-hits-20m-registe...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;apple-mac-shipments-down-q4-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;apple-mac-shipments-dow...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.future-processing.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-many-developers-are-there-in-the-world-in-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.future-processing.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-many-developers-a...</a>')
