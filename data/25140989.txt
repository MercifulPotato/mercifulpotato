Doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone would be fine with just mandating it everywhere with no option to disable it.<p>Even then the DX functional spec gives some leeway. As an example if you write x*y+z it will compile it into mad instruction. And that&#x27;s just specified as that the precision must not be worse as the worst possible ordering of separate instructions. So which it is? Depends on the vendor. This is completely fine for graphics, but not fine for all workloads.<p>&gt; No need for manual shenanigans with command queues<p>Unless you do access same buffer from multiple places in a way that&#x27;s still spec conformant, just in a way that the DX11 implementation cannot detect.')
