Commodore worked their dealers hard, and just prior to Christmas that year he was required to stack 250 machines in inventory which just about broke the bank.<p>Meanwhile I was hired to build PC clones for a few hours everyday. While I was there he would argue constantly about the superiority of the Amiga vs. the PC and though I knew he was right (486 PC&#x27;s had just hit the scene) I would argue right back about the fact the PC&#x27;s were winning due to the velocity of change in hardware, storage, video, etc.<p>Anyway we got to the point with it that his wife started yelling at both of us to cut the crap, so not wanting to piss her off since she signed the checks I shut up and let him drone on.<p>As Christmas approached we were selling PC&#x27;s 10 to 1 over Amiga&#x27;s and his anxiety about not moving the Amiga&#x27;s hit the roof. About a week prior to Christmas I came in one day and started building the PC&#x27;s on order (about 30+ on order) and he was forced to help me with building them out.<p>He was pissed, completely off his rocker angry, and started verbally hammering me beyond what I could take. I finally decided enough was enough.<p>I turned to him and I said &quot;I know one thing the PC can do that the Amiga can&#x27;t do.&quot; And taking the bait like the fish he was, sez to me &quot;Nothing can beat the Amiga&quot;. I sez, &quot;There is defintely one thing it does better&quot;, and he SHOUTS &quot;WHAT?&quot;<p>Sez me, &quot;It makes money!&quot; and then I turned to the stack of nearly 200 remaining Amiga&#x27;s sitting in the shop shelves and pointed at them and laughed long and loud.<p>He fired me on the spot.<p>Not exactly on point for this article. But a great story in the timeline of &quot;our thing&quot;. I should mention that I did own a Commodore 64 and the Amiga before I switched to the PC. I loved them both and if it wasn&#x27;t for the C-64 assembler module I would not have built the companies I created years later. The 6502C was the best learning chip ever!<p>2 centavos...')
