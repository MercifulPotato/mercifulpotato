Submitting your results there is a bit more complicated, because all results there are &quot;verified&quot; by independent entities.<p>If you feel like your AI use case is not well represented by any of the MLPerf benchmarks, open a discussion thread about it, propose a new benchmark, etc.<p>The set of benchmarks there increases all the time to cover new applications. For example, on top of the MLPerf Training and MLPerf Inference benchmark suites, we now have a new MLPerf HPC suite to capture ML of very large models.')
