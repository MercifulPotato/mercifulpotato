If you&#x27;re a politician, it&#x27;s nice to be able to pass repeated tax cuts, even as government expenditures continue to grow as a fraction of GDP.<p>All that said, relatively stable price levels are important. Without them, contracts get tricky, particularly around inventory or agreements into the future.')
