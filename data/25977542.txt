Before using docker, every time I migrate to a new version of os or database (which I do every 3-4 years per host), I would often run into small problems in some old apps that must be fixed, which took time because I had to dig into the app again and re-learn the context before I can patch the small issue. After moving everything to docker, it&#x27;s no longer a problem. As long as the host can run docker (be it docker compose or kubernetes) my apps would run on it.')
