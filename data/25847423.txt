I&#x27;m an extension developer that makes a mildly popular extension used by a niche group (1-2k MAU) and the Chrome Web Store has tightened their policies over the years. It&#x27;s possible that you&#x27;re grandfathered in (and haven&#x27;t hit any of the extra reporting requirements if you haven&#x27;t updated your extension recently.)<p>Extensions these days go through a rigorous review process, and Google regularly shuts down &#x2F; imposes arbitrary restrictions against extensions due to changing policies.<p>I understand the importance of strong moderation to protect users from malicious extensions, but I believe Google is using that as an excuse to further <i>lock down</i> their store, increasing barriers to entry and making it harder for developers to build software to extend the most popular browser in the world without Google&#x27;s blessing.')
