Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25652911], score=None, time=1609886308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651925, text='<i>&gt; overall they&#x27;ve taken reasonable measures to deal with the current situation</i><p>Once more, evidently you and I have been living on different planets for the past year.<p><i>&gt; As the pandemic progresses, we learn new things about it and adjust.</i><p>That would be fine if that&#x27;s what happened. But it isn&#x27;t. The guidance had nothing to do with getting more information, and everything to do with trying to manipulate people into doing what the &quot;experts&quot; wanted them to do by misinforming them. The mask quote you give is a perfect example: there <i>was</i> good reason to be walking around with a mask (my wife and I started doing that around the end of February--and social distancing and all the other common sense precautions that any responsible adult should be taking when there&#x27;s a pandemic, no matter what any so-called &quot;experts&quot; say). No protection is perfect (even an N95 is not perfect), but a mask is a lot better than nothing (even if not all virus particles are kept out, drastically reducing how many get into your upper respiratory tract makes a huge difference). But no, our nanny state &quot;experts&quot; were afraid we might touch our face so they lied to us. (They were also afraid health care providers would run short of PPE. But if governments are going to be authoritarian, they can just put themselves at the front of the line for however much PPE the health care providers need, without having to lie or manipulate anybody.)')
