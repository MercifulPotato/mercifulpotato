Imagine an irrational number <i>z</i> which has this property, and another number <i>z&#x27;</i> constructed from <i>z</i> by taking the first 1 digit of <i>z</i>, appending 1 &quot;2&quot;, appending the first 2 digits of <i>z</i>, appending 2 &quot;2&quot;s, appending the first 3 digits of <i>z</i>, appending 3 &quot;2&quot;s, and so on.<p>Using <i>e</i> as an example, our <i>z&#x27;</i> would begin 2.7 2 71 22 718 222 7182 2222 71828 22222...<p><i>z&#x27;</i> is irrational and shares the property that every sequence of digits can be found in its decimal expansion. But it is obviously not normal; over half of its digits are &quot;2&quot;.')
