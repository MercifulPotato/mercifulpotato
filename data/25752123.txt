Being in startup culture blinds you to this. Startups are comfortable with existential threats in the background, because they&#x27;re constantly on the verge of failure anyway.

The typical large company is slow-growing but highly profitable. The number one priority is to avoid killing the goose that lays the golden egg.<p>Think of the most conservative, bean-counting , button-down loan officer in suburban Topeka.
