In 1989, 35% of the entire software industry was manufacturing systems. Back then, services, hand holding, customization, and consulting were necessary to get the systems to where they are today. What was the first massive burst in productivity from technology has stagnated into incremental diminishing returns and exponentially increasing complexity. We can only continue to add complexity for so much longer until the whole system collapses.<p>&quot;Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.&quot;<p>Manufacturing is important. We must deliver a touch of technological genius to reintroduce simplicity, efficiency, and integration.')
