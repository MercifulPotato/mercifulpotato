(In contrast to existing SIMD instructions, which are for a specific width, which is why e.g. Intel introduces new instructions for wider and wider vectors - AVX1, AVX2, AVX512). ARM and RISC-V are both pursuing this approach, with SVE and the V extension, respectively.<p>Though it is unlikely that vector instructions will help very much for typical JS or compilation workloads.')
