Item(by='abernard1', descendants=None, kids=[25434847], score=None, time=1608061158, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25433958, text='I lived in Bakersfield for a long time.<p>You know what they don&#x27;t have, insane zoning restrictions that prevent housing.  For example, the Houston MSA, which has almost no zoning restrictions is within 90% of the population (and 80% population density) of the Bay Area 9 county MSA with an average house price of... $249K at 2,000 sq ft.<p>And there&#x27;s a reason I left Bakersfield and moved to Austin.  It&#x27;s because PG&amp;E energy prices are benchmarked at Bay Area temperatures, and they have progressive pricing.  Because I had a server rack in a garage in super hot (110+ F) summers, I was paying over $600 a month in energy bills in a tiny 1000 sq foot house in a ghetto.  If I had lived in a 4 bedroom house, I would have paid less in energy.<p>And just on a secondary, personal note.  Houses in Houston are way, way nicer than houses in San Jose, Oakland, San Francisco etc.  This is one of those things where I know that people have just not experienced living in other places when I hear quality arguments around housing, food, or amenities.<p>It&#x27;s just not that nice in San Francisco. Seriously. The food is just downright bad in quality and variety compared to even Austin, much less Houston.  The housing stock is dreadful.  Service is slow.  The quality of things in Houston is better than the Bay Area, irrespective of cost.')
