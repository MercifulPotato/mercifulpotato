They are talking about cutting the energy consumption of ~446 million people by 55%, and energy is directly correlated to economic output; using energy to add value and&#x2F;or utility.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear about what that means; that equation can only be affected by a few means and I can assure you with a high degree of confidence that it will not be done by impacting the ruling classes. We are talking about a combination of things like reducing productivity, reducing mobility, reducing living standards, reducing heating and cooling (comfort), reducing amenities, reducing material possessions, reducing social events, etc.<p>There is no other way that you can cut emissions by <i></i>at least<i></i> 55% after decades of already cutting emissions around 20% over the last 25 years. Let alone while also importing people from around the world from low impact to high impact societies.<p>Let&#x27;s also realize that while the EU and people in the USA are pushing for these kinds of things, the Chinese and Indians and other countries are pumping out emissions at rates that are way beyond the worst the west has ever produced.<p>For some more perspective; the EU and US emissions are roughly the same as their share of the world&#x27;s GDP. By contrast, China produces twice as many emissions as the USA, but only 75% of the GDP; India has half the emissions of the USA, but only produces 10% of the GDP.')
