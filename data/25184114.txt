Most people are steered by wrong feelings: they feel strongly about something, although don&#x27;t quite understand it, and act on those feelings. Techies are less suspectible to feelings (they are deaf in some sense), but they often get trapped in mental illusions, i.e. elaborate mental structures and ideas that incorrectly describe the world.<p>This is also why techies dont make it far in power structures: they don&#x27;t get that emotional aspect of human relationships.')
