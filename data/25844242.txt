There&#x27;s extentions to auto copy highlighted text and append urls which makes entire flow straight forward. Log each day is around 1-5mbs of text saved in a big folder. Biggest limitation is trying to advance search unstructured text files by complex keywords within dates. I&#x27;m sure I can setup each clip with delimiters so logs can be imported into a searchable DB, just too lazy.')
