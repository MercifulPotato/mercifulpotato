All I see is &quot;Oops, Restricted Content. We are sorry but this post is restricted to folks that have purchased this page.&quot;. Why would I pay $12 to read a blog post when there is no synopsis, word count, or any other information provided? Visitors have no idea what they would be paying for. A more effective strategy would be to have some unrestricted content on your blog which people can read, and then when they start to derive value from the free content they might convert to paying customers -- you have to draw people in gradually.')
