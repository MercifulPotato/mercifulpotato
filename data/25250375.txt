Federighi&#x27;s comment made me at least think that if MS allowed (and encouraged) Windows on ARM to run on Macs then Apple might do what it takes to make it happen.  Time will tell.<p>Federighi quote:  “We have the core technologies for them to do that, to run their ARM version of Windows, which in turn of course supports x86 user mode applications. But that’s a decision Microsoft has to make, to bring to license that technology for users to run on these Macs. But the Macs are certainly very capable of it.”<p>To be completely clear, this quote may have only been referring to virtualized operation, but given a change in the WinARM solution licensing model, Apple might support booting as they did on x86 Macs.')
