They&#x27;ll walk me through a portfolio and point out a lot of the aesthetics, whereas I&#x27;m asking about their decision-making process: how did you identify the problem? What other solutions did you consider and why didn&#x27;t you go with them? How did you determine the organization of X? Why did you choose this flow? Why are you framing the task this way? Why did you make this more important than that? Why are you grouping this and that together? Why not these other things? Why expose this information at a glance and hide that information behind an interaction? etc.')
