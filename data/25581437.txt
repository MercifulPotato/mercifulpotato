Calling for mob justice and encouraging your followers to “re-educate” people is utterly appalling (dammit, they even re-use the Nazi and Stalinist newspeak), and she should be treated the same way she’d be, had she called to harass anyone else.<p>&gt; It is bizzare to see people of science fall in line with claims that don&#x27;t satisfy even the basic requirements of rigor.<p>Completely agree with that.
