My guess would be each app could have an api file with a bunch of functions. I wonder how that would work in a situation where you have 3 apps, each with a single model, and the dependencies are A -&gt; B -&gt; C. You could still run into situations where B isn&#x27;t supposed to know anything about A yet nothing stops B from importing A&#x27;s api.')
