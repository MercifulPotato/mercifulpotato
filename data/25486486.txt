Item(by='emn13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608475284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483311, text='minor correction: the geometric mean of the uplift of the specfp and specint benchmarks is 21.3%, which is perhaps notably better than 15% (up to interpretation, that).<p>The geekbench numbers comparing the iphone 12 pro to iphone 11 pro average to around 19% difference: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;ios-benchmarks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;ios-benchmarks&#x2F;</a>.<p>A few caveats: A compiler change made made the libquantum uplift (a part of the spec benchmark) huge, and non-representative of hardware changes.  Conversely, the geekbench 5 multicore results are actually worse for the iphone 12 pro vs. 12; hinting that they&#x27;re over-boosting the iphone 12 pro, so peak perf is likely actually a little better (from the hardware&#x27;s perspective, not that an app can do much about it).<p>In any case, let&#x27;s call it a 20% uplift with the same amount of threads, very respectable.<p>Another caveat: AMD may not be able to get the same 20% uplift from 5nm that apple does.  Without any expertise in this matter I can only repeat what others claim, but I&#x27;ve heard people say that it&#x27;s hard to make x86 wider (i.e extract more ILP) because the instructions are variable length, making lookahead more difficult.  I guess we&#x27;ll see next year with zen4 if that&#x27;s true!')
