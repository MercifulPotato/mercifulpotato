The report summary left out some of the more alarming findings [1] (which were conveniently not addressed in your reason article) and there was valid criticism about the consensus model that was used[2].<p>In terms of bad faith&#x2F;good faith arguments. One can argue in good faith, that the large amounts of uncertainty associated with the climate models means that the worst case outcomes can not be definitively ruled out and therefore humanity should plan for the worst case scenario as a precautionary measure. And based on this argument, made in good faith, and also based on the fact that it has been extremely difficult to get the necessary global political buy-in to actually make any progress on the problem, one could justify being extremely alarmist about the problem.<p>I will give you credit though, for attempting to make a good faith argument for why climate change alarmism might be overblown. But I think you fail to acknowledge the large uncertainties involved with climate modeling, and you are also ignoring some of the more alarming risks that were well with in the realm of possibility based on the models. And I also think your economic argument is just flat out wrong. WWII mobilization was followed by some of the most prosperous decades in US history.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2018&#x2F;oct&#x2F;08&#x2F;world-leaders-climate-change-ipcc-report" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2018&#x2F;oct&#x2F;08&#x2F;world-...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;new-climate-report-was-too-cautious-some-scientists-say&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;new-climate-repor...</a>')
