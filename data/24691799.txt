They are also less motivated by startup stock options, having seen them evaporate personally.<p>* By 40, they are more likely part of a family unit that values financial stability.<p>* By 40, they are at their salary cap.  They are simply more expensive.  They&#x27;ve also been around the block enough to have connections and to play the regotiating game harder.<p>Overall, I think the strongest factor is simply the demographics you mentioned.  There weren&#x27;t that many folks that graduated in CS until the 2000&#x27;s.  Also, many of the folks that are around my age have switched careers away from development.')
