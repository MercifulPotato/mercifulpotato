This also has NOTHING to do with any kind of technological advancement at all. There is really nothing particularly more digital about the digital currencies being proposed than any other electronic bank balance or credit card database line item. I think the word digital here is an attempt to sneak in some radical changes to how the federal reserve works under the guise of doing something to modernize banking in the world of cryptocurrency.<p>So then what is this about? What these digital currencies are about is the ability for normal people to hold deposit accounts that are held directly in the Central Bank although a normal commercial bank would still act as the custodian and you would still access them through your normal bank.<p>So why go through all of the trouble to do this? I think it&#x27;s basically an admission that Quantative Easing era is over and that monetary policy in general has run its course and are no longer useful in the age of 0% interest rates while we still face deflation. By having normal people hold  central bank accounts, they will be able to implement a new kind of policy that they have wanted the power to do for decades: hybrid fiscal &#x2F; monetary policy where the monetary policy outcome is deposited directly into the account of a normal person, not a bank.<p>This is basically the Fed acknowledging that they are getting ready for MMT.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;3571&#x2F;text" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;357...</a><p>Edit: I&#x27;m getting downvoted on this, maybe because this seems conspiratorial but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m really saying anything that speculative here. Look at the title of the article linked to in the attached tweet from the IMF: &quot;A New Bretton Woods Moment&quot;. The people involved clearly see this as a time when they need to completely rework the international monetary system (which is what Bretton Woods was in the 40&#x27;s)')
