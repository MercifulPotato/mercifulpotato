It’s not a particularly reputable news source up here.<p>“There’s little privacy anymore” is a reality not a joke. Citizens chose to engage in social media and to buy technologies which expose their private lives.<p>The RCMP bought some script kiddie toys to explore Facebook and the dark web... because they have things like child exploitation units meant to look in places like that. Not news.<p>If anything it’s funny that the RCMP is so much worse at hiding this stuff from the public than the FBI.<p>I feel no threat to my privacy based on what’s written here... at all.')
