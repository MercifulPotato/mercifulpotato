Ask yourself - can I afford to get this wrong?<p>The risk of your home-rolled auth, with all the edge cases and requirements that go with it, vs. outsourcing to a company who&#x27;s entire reputation relies on doing it properly with an army of experts, running on enterprise-grade architecture, with round the clock support&#x2F;updates&#x2F;ops?<p>Are you seriously saying that you can roll your own auth better than Auth0, Fusion etc. can do? And that the hours startups spend on setting it all up vs. an afternoon wiring in an auth-as-a-service provider is time well spent?<p>If you&#x27;re a small company, don&#x27;t risk it, don&#x27;t invest time in it, just buy it it and plug it in and know that it&#x27;s all enterprise-grade under the hood and you&#x27;re covered (far more than you could ever afford to be).<p>If you&#x27;re a big company, and you&#x27;ve done the maths and figure that the risk&#x2F;effort vs. expense is worth it, fine.')
