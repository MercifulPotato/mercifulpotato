You can use tools like react-rails to more easily pass data from your Rails controller to your react components (basically conveniences to create props from instance variables).<p>Stimulus doesn&#x27;t handle rendering at all. It&#x27;s intended to be used for small little &quot;sprinkles&quot; of JavaScript (think things like: showing &#x2F; hiding content, toggling classes, basic event handlers). If you used to write jQuery snippets to wire up a click event to run ~5-10 lines of JS, then you might look at Stimulus as a more modern implementation (es6, mutationobserver, etc). Stimulus plays nicely with Turbolinks since it needs existing HTML (servered rendered from normal Rails views) to attach to.<p>You&#x27;re basically looking at two diverging paths: do you go down a JS-driven SPA application with React (or some kind of hybrid where you have React do parts of the page) or do you opt for Basecamp&#x27;s &quot;I cant belive its not a SPA&quot; approach with Turbolinks, server-rendered HTML, and Stimulus for small interactivity.<p>Here&#x27;s a talk I gave at the London Ruby meetup about Stimulus and in what contexts you might want to use (or not use it): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.lrug.org&#x2F;videos&#x2F;2020&#x2F;september&#x2F;matt-swanson-stimulusjs-modest-js-for-the-html-you-have-lrug-sep-2020.mp4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.lrug.org&#x2F;videos&#x2F;2020&#x2F;september&#x2F;matt-swanson-s...</a>')
