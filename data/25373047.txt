Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607603967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367316, text='It isn&#x27;t &quot;unlimited&quot;, it is &quot;unlimited with caveat&quot;. It is 5 TB soft cap after which upload limits apply, which get progressively harsh the more you are from that 5 TB soft limit. Just like I wrote in my previous post, and as they write on their website. For me, 5 TB in a privacy-friendly country is a bargain deal. Duplicati has support for Jottacloud, and they also provide an CLI for their API.<p>If I had an amount of 24 TB to back up I&#x27;d buy my own server and harddisks, and I&#x27;d physically set that server up at work or at home. Then, travel to the data center (I live in Amsterdam Area, so enough choice) and put the server there, again, physically. No need to &quot;upload 24 TB&quot;.<p>RAIDZ et al. is about availability. Which makes sense for businesses, but for personal data an offsite backup makes more sense. I&#x27;d just go with a mirror of 2 different disks, with different serial numbers (ie. different orders).')
