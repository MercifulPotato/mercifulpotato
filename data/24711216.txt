Their parents sacrifice everything for their only child but at the same time they put a very high burden on them booking every space of their lives.<p>Just letting the kids fool around, experience what interest them, play and make mistakes is inadmissible.<p>Usually the parents work all day and only grandparents could take care of them, so making them go to some class or another is a way to have their kids busy all day.<p>Because they have only one child, the child needs to be perfect all the time, and the bet must be risk free.<p>This creates children than don&#x27;t really know what they really want, and with zero creativity, incapable of making mistakes or take their own decisions.<p>Also when they don&#x27;t have external pressure they just laze, because they lack internal motivation.<p>This particular person is happy on the work because he is told what to do, I suppose he works at Microsoft. Only when he is free to do whatever he can do he feels uneasy.<p>Like adult people(over 40) in Russia when Soviet Russia collapsed, they felt uneasy when there was no one taking all the decisions for them.<p>They just had not the training to deal with freedom.<p>As a kid, when I finished school, I was free, My friends and I decided what we wanted to do all the time. If I joined a competition, I did not tell my parents.<p>Over time you make lots of mistakes,exploring new territories, experiences and dangers, but develop autonomy and learn to deal with chaos.<p>After university I had the opposite problem to this man&#x27;s, I could not stand people at work telling me what to do, specially when I considered they were taking bad decisions, so I started working on my own.')
