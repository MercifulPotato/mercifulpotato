Leaving the chips for longer in the ditch&#x2F;trench will yeild better results, I plan to leave this latest batch for a couple years to really let the mycelium break down the materials.<p>A portion of aged fungi composted material can be added to a hot compost pile to let the bacteria take over.<p>Fungi dominant soils are better for food forests and more stable than bacteria dominate soils.<p>I typically use bacteria dominated soils for kitchen gardens.<p>It&#x27;s all inputs and outputs at the end of the day and simply dropping material into specific conditions can yeild different material outputs. It so much fun to think in terms of systems. I fell in love with computers and networks for this reason. Natural systems are even more impressive to me.<p>Gardening, food production, and nature is all about inputs and outputs over the course of days, months, and years. It&#x27;s a much slower feedback loop to programming, but a feedback loop nonetheless.<p>Thank you for the question.')
