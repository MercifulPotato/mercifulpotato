I find that the right name takes ages to come about. Worse, it may require a lot of architectural refactoring that, many times, has nothing to do with the one entity you are trying to name. Instead, it is connected with the entire workflow you are designing. Nothing worse than spending ages coming up with the right name for a class, only to find out the entire class is not needed and you got the workflow all wrong :-) which I have done many a time, to be fair')
