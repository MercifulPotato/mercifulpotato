Framing it like this ignores important facts.<p>This stock was trading around $4 in August, around $20 in the beginning of January, and is almost at $400 right now. People can have legitimate disagreements about what the true value is: $5 per share? $10? $20? $40?<p>But no way anyone sincerely believes GameStop is worth $400&#x2F;share. People who are buying right now at (or near) that price point are either doing so because they believe the short squeeze will drive the price up even further (Redditors), or because they have to deliver stock they sold short (investment funds). So all parties agree that the stock is overpriced, and people have been buying knowing this fully well.')
