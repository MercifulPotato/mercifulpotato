He was able to to leverage free publicity by aligning his personality with the incentives of the attention economy.<p>Thanks for clarifying on the &quot;neither&quot; issue. I would be an advocate of a &quot;none of the above&quot; vote option. In my mind, it does much as the same as if people voted third party. I wasn&#x27;t equivocating a third party vote to a protest vote. At a certain point, when the percentage of third party votes reaches a certain tipping point those who feel like it&#x27;s a wasted vote may be convinced it&#x27;s a viable option. But I also think there are other (possibly more pragmatic) voting schemes like ranked voting that are being implemented at lower levels in the country.<p>I would be <i>strongly</i> against mandatory voting and I think it could make the system even worse. I think it&#x27;s important to recognize that you also have the right <i>not</i> to vote just like you have the right not to own a firearm, have the right not to speak up even though you have the freedom of speech etc. A &quot;right&quot; is not equivalent to an &quot;obligation&quot;. I think there&#x27;s issues with uninformed votes as it is and this could be exacerbated by mandatory voting. Sometimes the appropriate choice is to refrain from voting rather than casting an uninformed vote.')
