Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607545072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363846, text='&gt; but at the moment, no one can say that with confidence if they are paying attention to the allegations<p>And yet marvel at the number of <i>otherwise highly logical</i> people who do just that.<p>&gt; If Youtube feels obligated to correct what it thinks are misconceptions, they can present their arguments and evidence that contradict current allegations. They should hire a team of lawyers to put together the most up to date refutations of claims, and post that on relevant videos.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that:<p>- a centralized, slowly changing &quot;balance sheet&quot; approach like this, which is a standard in project management, is rarely taken toward matters of public concern - I am a conspiracy theorist, but if there was a resource that enumerated all of the &quot;just(!) a conspiracy theory&quot; claims and illustrated how it is known(!) that they are false, I would gladly read it.  Rather, the public has to somehow sort out what is true based on hundreds of &quot;news&quot; articles that get released into the information ecosystem on a daily basis.  Or, just offload their thinking to The Experts.<p>- we regularly hear that we need more &quot;critical thinking&quot; among the public, but we never get further than talking about the <i>incredibly important</i> need for this<p>It&#x27;s also interesting that ~nobody seems to notice these sorts of things (and when they are mentioned, it seems to generally displease people, for reasons that are not stated).<p>I sometimes wonder if these sorts of information management oversights, apparently by thousands of people in positions of power, are purely accidental.')
