Yes the governments have made it so you cannot bankrupt the tuition debt, but it doesn&#x27;t mean you need to take on that debt to beginwith.<p>Will bureaucracy and identity politics kill the universities? No they wont die, they will simply be of lower quality. What makes a university better than another? The quality of the education fundamentally. If they don&#x27;t hire based on merit, the quality of the education drops.<p>Even if they drop to diploma mill quality, they wont die.<p>What will kill universities is if they get replaced. The &quot;community&quot; derives out of quality education. If you went to a university which gives away diplomas to anyone, then opened a business. You wont want to hire from that pool of applicants. Look at Elon Musk&#x27;s hatred of university degrees and especially MBAs.')
