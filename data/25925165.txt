Still, nowhere close—I eventually concluded that truly imagining artificial intelligence in a way that would make for a compelling narrative is mostly impossible.<p>Others include:<p>- Accelerando<p>- A Fire Upon the Deep<p>- Permutation City<p>- Daemon<p>So far, the only sci-fi novel that meets the level of rigor I was looking for—albeit about aliens rather than AI—is The Three Body Problem.')
