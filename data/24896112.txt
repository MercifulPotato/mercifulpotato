There might also be birds that eat them.<p>I love having hornets on my property if their nest isn&#x27;t  located in a path I have to cross. They also eat wasps and you won&#x27;t have any problems with them throughout the summer. They don&#x27;t try to eat your cake or drink you lemonade and you can peacefully chill in your garden.<p>They always leave their nest after a season and it can make quite a mess. But nothing is better than having them in a remote location in your garden. It is better than any insect spray.<p>But you still might seriously want to get rid of them because they could indeed do a lot of damage in another ecosystem that needs to sacrifice several species until it adapts.')
