Your description just makes it so much more amazing that they have kept this up for 36 years now. Again, I was deeply thankful for all the amazing work the Angels and the greater Congress leadership did in making 35c3 such an unforgettable event.<p>I just wish it was a bit easier to get prepared to buy a ticket. It was very difficult and nerve wracking when I was up early to get in line for the ticket. The first sale caused the website to time out and so I thought there is no chance for me to compete with what I assume were automated ticket buyers.<p>The second sale is where I got lucky and grabbed a ticket as fast as possible. There must be some middle ground between this and having full open admission no? It is impossible to get perfect so I do not fault them for this.<p>&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s an open question if Congress actually wants to grow further. Accomodating more and more attendees from more diverse backgrounds runs the risk of losing your own identity.<p>Yes absolutely. There is no perfect solution to this. One one hand it would be a joy to introduce the hacker spirit to as big of an audience as possible. It could only lead to a better world. On the other hand, you run into problems that Defcon is experiencing with its 30,000+ attendees.')
