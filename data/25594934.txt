I’m astonished the media does not write more about California’s near-absolute, Democrat party control over its government. I don’t care which state you live in, or party you support, single party rule is never a good thing.<p>If that&#x27;s such a problem, why has the California Republican party <i>chosen</i> to remain so uncompetitive there?<p>In America, you only have single party rule if the other party either chooses not to compete or competes incompetently (e.g. runs candidates who are out of step with the electorate they need to appeal to, or doesn&#x27;t run candidates at all).')
