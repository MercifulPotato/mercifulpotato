Item(by='xenadu02', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604128812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947367, text='I&#x27;m a manager at a FAANG company who has gone through the hiring process a number of times now. I was at a startup before that where we grew from 30 to 200 people and I was involved in hiring for quite a few positions. I can assure you 100% that there is no quota system anywhere I&#x27;ve ever worked. It is absolutely prohibited. We are not even allowed to post something like &quot;do you come from an under-represented group? we&#x27;re hiring!&quot;. Anything along those lines is a big ol&#x27; nope. I suggest even if that email thread was real if the legal department found out about it they&#x27;d shut it down very quickly. (FWIW we&#x27;re not allowed to ask about lots of stuff during an interview either like marital or parental status).<p>I&#x27;ll also note that every team I know of at any FAANG company is desperate to find really great candidates. The idea that a team would willingly refuse to hire an excellent &lt;insert group here&gt; candidate to instead fill some kind of diversity quota slot for &lt;other group here&gt; is so bananas to me I can&#x27;t even comprehend it. It&#x27;s so wrong I can&#x27;t even laugh at it. Every manager I know has a backlog of important work a mile long and is desperate to fill open reqs. I&#x27;ve never once seen or heard rumor of anyone from upper management to HR to execs discussing anything even remotely like a &quot;diversity quota&quot;. Not even water-cooler gossip.<p>Whenever I ask for proof of a diversity quota system there is no evidence. When you look at the stats on who is hired (for companies that publish it) to the degree the needle is moving it is moving very slowly. So slowly if there were a quota system it would mean they&#x27;re very very bad at it. So as far as I can tell from personal experience and my discussions with my peers &quot;diversity quotas&quot; are by-and-large either made up or being run illegally by a small group that gets shut down immediately once legal gets wind of it.<p>&quot;Diversity quota&quot; could be an attempt to stir up race or gender resentment: &#x27;you didn&#x27;t get that job because one of &quot;those&quot; people stole it&#x27; or some such notion. Having worked at plenty of other software jobs over the years I&#x27;ve met more than my share of developers who were garbage at their jobs but thought they were God&#x27;s gift to programming. They were also the same people who tended to have complaints about &quot;diversity quotas&quot;. I&#x27;m sure blaming &quot;those other people&quot; is an attractive way to justify not getting what you think you deserve. It&#x27;s an old trope but one that keeps being re-used over thousands of years because it works. Just convince people that &quot;those others&quot; are the enemy and have stolen what is rightfully yours and you can justify anything.<p>It&#x27;s also a really cheap way to tear down someone else - just dismiss them as a &quot;diversity hire&quot;. You need a certain amount of insecurity, cruelty, or hate in your heart to act out like that. I prefer to judge people based on their job performance but YMMV.')
