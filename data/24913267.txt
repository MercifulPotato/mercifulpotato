In my experience, it basically has scanned and processed the QR code when I&#x27;ve barely realized I got it in view.<p>Regarding NFC, I&#x27;ve just seen too many times of having to put the phone in the right place in the right orientation to get the communication to work, and then it still takes time to make the payment. It&#x27;s faster than credit cards when it just works but slower when it doesn&#x27;t. And Alipay and WeChat are faster than both.<p>In China, you don&#x27;t need a wallet. You just need a phone. So you get used to knowing what you need. There&#x27;s an initial learning curve, but then you can be paying and biking around and everything else with just your phone.')
