I don&#x27;t have all the details, but it sure looks similar to the autoritarian governments and police forces locking people up because &quot;they know they meant it&quot;. There is no appeal to violence in that tweet. Just because some nutjob can interpret anything like an appeal, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an appeal.<p>That was literally 1 of two tweets that god him banned, the first just describing a generic Trump tirade about his supporters. How can anyone honestly think this is democratic behavior to ban someone over two tweets that have no appeal to violence?<p>I don&#x27;t care about pro-trump or anti-trump, but this is political censorship.')
