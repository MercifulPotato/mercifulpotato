I’d rather see great hackers, as the dude here, spending their time doing amazing things for companies who aim to provide the “good ARM laptop” experience for Linux. <i>That</i> I would pay for. We didn’t really have the chance to do this for x86 since Linux started with zero marketshare; that’s not the case anymore, we have a decent critical mass both in terms of hackers and consumers, we should leverage that imho.')
