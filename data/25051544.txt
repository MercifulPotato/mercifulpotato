Some of these people (even for wealth &gt; $1bn) are just regular folks. The difference is that there are lots of people around them and lots of rinsers, so they are cautious and it is harder to find them in real life. But beyond that, you can have an average, regular discussion with them. A key point is to not think about their wealth much or at all.')
