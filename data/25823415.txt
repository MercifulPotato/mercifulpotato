Call me the n word all you want. But if you threaten my life you should be stopped. Either by the police or by me.<p>I think free speech is necessary, but not free speech to harass or threaten violence. Free speech including the vile and negative won&#x27;t make the world a better place. Arguing against the bad ideas will. But I do not think it&#x27;s the burden of society to court speech that falls in the category or harassment or threats of violence.')
