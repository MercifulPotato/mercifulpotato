Item(by='kylebenzle', descendants=None, kids=[25152024], score=None, time=1605803904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151061, text='&#x2F;Bitcoin is a good&#x2F;bad example of this. The main bitcoin sub was long ago hijacked by a &quot;pro-Blockstream&quot; moderator who bans users and discussion of anything that does not tow the corporate line. So &#x2F;BTC evolved to be an open discussion forum for all things Bitcoin.<p>The problem is that many new users never make their way to the second most popular version and end up getting fed a one-sided story about how the Blockstream way is the only way to do Bitcoin. They go so far as to demonize the creator Satoshi and people who have done huge amounts of positive work for Bitcoin like Roger Ver because they disagree with the White Paper.')
