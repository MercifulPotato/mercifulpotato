We deeply understand that this will be a disappointment for you as you can no longer create transfers from Spotify to another music service. This is because it violates our Terms and Conditions. \n\n  So here&#x27;s your request to download a copy of the personal data that is likely to be most relevant to you: \n\n  - Log in to your account page.\n  - Select Privacy Settings from the menu in the left.\n  - Under Download your Data, click REQUEST. This page also contains instructions for accessing your data and a summary of the categories of data you can expect to receive.\n\n  If you would also like to receive the technical log information we collect to provide and troubleshoot the Spotify service, extended streaming history, or have a special data request, please let us know. \n\n  Let us know if we can help with anything else. We&#x27;re just an email away.\n</code></pre>\nAnd I replied with:<p><pre><code>  Regrettably, the steps which you have outlined for me are not in compliance with the GDPR article 20 subsection 2, which states that &quot;the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible.&quot;\n\n  Clearly, it is technically feasible to transfer my personal data directly to another controller, as it has been done with SongShift in the past. You decided to disable this method, in violation of the GDPR. Your terms and conditions do not supersede Dutch or European law.\n\n  I demand that you re-enable the API or allow for some other method to allow me to exercise my rights under the GDPR, so I can transfer my personal data directly from Spotify to another music service.\n\n  If you do not allow me to exercise my rights under the GDPR, I will file a complaint (verzoekschriftprocedure) at the Dutch civil court (Rechtbank Midden-Nederland). I expect that you respond with a timeline about when and how I can exercise my rights under the GDPR within 14 days.\n</code></pre>\nCourt cases in the Netherlands are relatively cheap, with a fixed starting cost of € 83, and a maximum of ~€ 2300 in case of loss (as compensation for attorney fees), so it actually seems feasible to go this route.<p>I also want to challenge them on the export taking multiple days to be generated. This also is in violation of the GDPR as &quot;undue delay&quot;. Many people cite that they have 30 days, but this is actually the maximum time.')
