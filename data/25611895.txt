I know at least two, which is more than 0.<p>They aren&#x27;t popular yet, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that they will be with further development. Let&#x27;s not forget that the first automatic gearbox for cars, the 1904 Sturtevant &quot;horseless carriage gearbox&quot;, wasn&#x27;t exactly a market hit - it took until the late 1940&#x27;s for it to take off as a polished product and longer still to overtake manual transmissions (due to similar cited concerns about maintainability and the level of control).<p>In fact, I actually drive a manual transmission in my car because of those factors (and manual is still more popular in the UK), but clearly the majority of the market has moved on.')
