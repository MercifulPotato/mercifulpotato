I had v2 later and liked it better?<p>The first time I had it the smell was off, and the outside was too crisp so it didn&#x27;t taste like a burger - it was closer than a veggie patty or something but the experience was like eating beef that had something off with it (not pleasant). I was disappointed since everyone said you couldn&#x27;t tell the difference and to me it was immediately obvious.<p>After being a vegetarian for a while I tried again and this time it was better. The smell is still a little off, but other than that with condiments and stuff inside a bun it&#x27;s easy to forget it&#x27;s not a real burger. Though it&#x27;s hard to know if it&#x27;s just because I haven&#x27;t had one in a long time.<p>It satisfies enough of what it feels like to eat a burger to enjoy them at a cookout. It also makes it easier for me to be a vegetarian since burgers were my favorite food.')
