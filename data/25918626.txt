Netfliy is probably the most simple way get started.<p>Netlify is... A SERVER (actually many servers).<p>The only ones that DON&#x27;T require a server are distributed. The only ones I&#x27;m aware of use IPFS or Hypercore protocols (formerly DAT). Hypercore&#x27;s probably the easiest as it is built into the Beaker browser and has been around in an easy browser accessible form for a while now, but Brave has just added support for IPFS.<p>Pipette and Orkl are static blog apps for Hypercore. There are probably others. I don&#x27;t know the IPFS world well, so I dunno what&#x27;s there.<p>Practically speaking though, the limited number of people hosting Hypercore &#x2F; IPFS nodes means that the content you want is likely not available on the network at the moment _unless_, you guessed it, you put some of it on a server that&#x27;s always on.')
