I used OsiriX to view them and it totally blew my mind. While the &quot;lite&quot; (free) version wasn&#x27;t exactly like the medical-grade imagery, it was close enough to make me very familiar with every nook and cranium. (sorry for the pun, the CT scans were of my skull!)<p>When you look at the images individually, it makes it more obvious and simultaneously more fascinating how the software maps everything into a 3D image. It&#x27;s actually not that complicated as long as each layer of the scan is consistent. Basically they are a greyscale version of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thescienceexplorer.com&#x2F;brain-and-body&#x2F;dead-body-sliced-5000-times-create-virtual-human" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thescienceexplorer.com&#x2F;brain-and-body&#x2F;dead-body-slice...</a> that the software interprets and colours. I assume DICON viewers could easily interpret the sliced dead-body images because of that.<p>I&#x27;m very happy to see that DICOM viewers have since appeared in open source. I look forward to re-imaging my scans to see what shows up.<p>More on topic -- I always wanted to write a DICOM-diff to make before&#x2F;after comparisons, which can also be useful in seeing progressions over time, but don&#x27;t have the knowledge for the graphical interpretation of each pixel on a 3D plane. But with an open-source solution, that part is already done and I just have to think about a plugin or new menu item for alignment and highlighting in an already-existing package.')
