Your original message states that WhatsApp shares contents of your messages, your location, photos of your kids, etc with third-parties.<p>&gt; The contents of my messages, photos of my kids, who I talk to and when, my location. Is that enough for you?<p>Look, this is simply not truth. You are ex-aggregating things and create a panic out of nothing. If you don&#x27;t like them knowing your location, fine, turn Location Services off. As for media, nobody cares about photos of your kids. It&#x27;s a not monetizable content.')
