When a user-base skews one way politically, this is a terrible feature. People are blind to the fact they&#x27;re chiseling their own echo chamber.<p>Edit: how is downvoting political opinions (and therefore reducing the post&#x27;s visibility) beneficial to anyone? It&#x27;s a shallow way to make the down-voter feel good temporarily, and dissuades actual discussion of other philosophies. At the very least, political downvotes should <i>require</i> a response.')
