Item(by='Shish2k', descendants=None, kids=[24785535], score=None, time=1602724657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783092, text='&gt; authoritative bodies can be wrong &#x2F; misled as well, and shouldn&#x27;t be the only arbiters of truth<p>I agree, but with a very large caveat - the human brain is not good at probabilities, it basically only recognises “outcome A is guaranteed” and “outcomes A and B are equally likely”. So how much credit should we give to an authority who is correct 90% of the time?<p>90% isn’t great when it comes to life-or-death matters, so it’s dangerous to recommend “always trust them”. But recommending “don’t always trust them” results in people thinking that the authorites and the crackpots are 50&#x2F;50 correct, which results in even <i>more</i> people dying :(')
