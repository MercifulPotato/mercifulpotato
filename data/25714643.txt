The scale&#x2F;speed has changed over time, but newspapers and TV stations can and have &quot;de-platformed&quot; people in the past.<p>At the end of the day, I&#x27;m a strong supporter of free speech.  But, it&#x27;s up to the speaker to provide their own platform.  If all they can manage is a literal soapbox in the town square, so be it. There is no fundamental right for a person&#x27;s speech to be easily broadcast, nor is there a right for that speech to be heard or acknowledged.<p>As long as Twitter, Facebook, the NYT, and the WSJ are private entities, they also have their own rights.  If we really want to prevent de-platforming, the solution seems to be categorizing media companies as some sort of utility.  But, I don&#x27;t really know what they would look like.')
