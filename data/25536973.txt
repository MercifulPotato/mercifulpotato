Technology will soon (within 1000 years) take us to a place where whatever we can imagine we can have in a simulation that is indistinguishable from the real world. Why bother with the real world anymore?<p>There maybe some cultures that still see value in the physical world, but I&#x27;d wager not many.<p>I also think it&#x27;s likely that panspermia is a thing. Life is evolving at the galaxy level, it&#x27;s therefore a little more reasonable to think that we represent one of the more evolutionarily advanced life forms at the current time.')
