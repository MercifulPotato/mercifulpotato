When Lagrange reformulated Newtonian physics, he was very proud of the fact that he didn&#x27;t use any diagrams and arrows showing forces in his paper. In fact, of all the Physics I&#x27;ve seen, I found Lagrange&#x27;s work to be the most beautiful and elegant.<p>I love how the commenter put it as &quot;Nature is of no consideration whatsoever in some fields of maths&quot;. I&#x27;d restate it as &quot;Nature is of no consideration whatsoever in pure mathematics&quot; and I&#x27;m quite sure that the pure mathematicians would agree.')
