My name Is Dan and I wanted to share a project I have been working on for over a year - Time Trigger (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timetrigger.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timetrigger.dev</a>). Time Trigger is a system that allows developers to have JSON data sent to an endpoint at a specific time in the future. There are lots of cron services out there, but here is what’s different:<p>1. It’s not a cron service: there are no recurring jobs on the platform.\n2. It’s human friendly. Time Trigger was born out of a need to schedule jobs in the future that were time based, so the service allows you to create jobs like “24 hours from now” or “Next Monday” to handle user registration emails and reminders etc.\n3. It’s secure to prevent abuse: You must own and verify the endpoints you want to send data to - either by static file or DNS TXT verification.<p>This service was originally built for another project I am working on and I decided to just spin it off as a separate product all together  - This is the first side project I have ever actually launched and I would love your feedback on it!')
