To the extent a case involves government-on-government spying, it&#x27;s hard for me to get angry. I tend to see it as a rare horizontal form of transparency&#x2F;accountability among entities that often have too few checks on their corruption &amp; skulduggery.<p>Even between friendly governments, maybe friends that spy on each other achieve an even greater mutual trust - an assurance there&#x27;s nothing being planned internally  that conflicts with the claims made via official channels.<p>&quot;If you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide, you&#x27;ve got nothing to fear&quot; is a shitty principle when hypocritically deployed by the powerful against private people.<p>But doesn&#x27;t it kind of make sense when applied to governments? What right-to-privacy, exactly, does a government have against its citizens or allies?')
