I joined in 2000 I think. I loved to play EV, Override, Nova, and Ferazel&#x27;s Wand. The EV games combined with Resedit were my first forays into modding games, and Ferazel&#x27;s Wand along with Mascot was great fun. I still run SheepShaver on my modern systems because of Ambrosia Software.<p>A friend of mine, who was also a member and fan, wrote a personal reimagination of Barrack as a hobby project while learning coding. While it does lack the ever-charming Bosco, the gameplay is still good!')
