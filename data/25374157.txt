Worse than pointless. Obviously they should have, and kudos to them about being open about the compounded mistakes.<p>Still, this strikes at the fears that lie in the heart of any reasonable, honest developer doing something completely new.<p>New developers should be cautious about cloud platforms, but they were! Not cautious enough, obviously, but they did set limits they thought would be honored.<p>Platforms should have hard monetary limits at the account level, clearly, as well as an option to turn them off. Shame on all of them which don&#x27;t.')
