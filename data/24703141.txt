Short term and long term there&#x27;s a lot of shuffling that would happen until it settled into an equilibrium (Maybe.  On the other hand maybe it would be extremely sensitive to global issues).  Those people all need food and housing and need to buy goods and services, so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re obsoleting an existing person&#x27;s job, you&#x27;re adding demand as you add supply.  Whether one <i>eventually</i> outweighs the other is dependent on many factors.<p>That said, I would assume that short term increased supply would lead to a tighter job market.')
