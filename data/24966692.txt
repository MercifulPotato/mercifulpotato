I don&#x27;t think e-bikes do the same.<p>We have some company EV and in real cold weather with active AC and ventilation within cities, the range almost halves.<p>That said, combustion engines also need more fuel in these cases, which is bad because it also increases pollution as long as the vehicle is still cold. It just isn&#x27;t as noticeable because waste heat is used for heating. It also means that it doesn&#x27;t really work until you drive a bit.')
