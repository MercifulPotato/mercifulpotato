Since OSX doesn&#x27;t have native containerization, our CI system for mac builds runs linux on mac minis and runs osx VMs inside of linux since you&#x27;re allowed to run osx vms on linux if linux is running on mac hardware. So in an ideal world, we&#x27;d run our own linux AMI on the baremetal mac instances and run OSX in VMs.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible of course, but I wonder how painful it would be to setup. Fighting EFI&#x2F;secureboot? Some other bootloader?')
