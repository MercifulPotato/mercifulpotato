Now we have COVID which means you want to be outside, but fire smoke that you shouldn&#x27;t breath, so you want to be inside.  I have a lot of HEPA filters running inside, and if I exercise outside, I wear a P100 even at VO2max.  But if my daughter weren&#x27;t keeping us here for her friends, I&#x27;d consider moving away now.')
