You&#x27;re a rounding error of a rounding error of a rounding error for AWS. Amazon&#x27;s stock price is doing really good and is only going to improve.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that AWS didn&#x27;t change any policies. It just found the backbone to enforce them. AWS never allowed free speech; there have always been terms of service. I guess you just ignored the fact that the ToS exists in exchange for the stability and ease AWS provided you. But now you can&#x27;t ignore that and reconcile your beliefs with your past behavior (i.e. using AWS as a platform). So AWS has to go. That&#x27;s cool. AWS will survive.<p>I would suggest you show ideological consistency and take AWS skills off your resume. It weakens your stance considerably if you&#x27;re using AWS&#x27;s clout to market yourself to employers. Take a stand. Refuse to use AWS in a professional capacity.<p>Free speech doesn&#x27;t require access to AWS. If there is a large market for violent far-right LARPing, the market will adjust and some AWS competitor rise to host white supremacist and white-supremacist-adjacent LARPers. And you can give them your money because you support their stance on allowing Parler and its ilk to use its platform.')
