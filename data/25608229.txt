They hired me 20+ years ago. I got in through the back door during a hiring freeze, and have carved my own niche, mainly by enjoying the kind of work that most engineers hate and being able to communicate the results. I live in a pleasant town, ride my bike to work, play in a band, and enjoy outdoor activities. I&#x27;ve received regular promotions, and am at the highest level that anybody&#x27;s ever gotten without being a manager.<p>And I&#x27;m working with really nice people.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s my imposter syndrome speaking, but I always think that I&#x27;ve pulled a fast one by getting this far in my career without being exposed as an incompetent.<p>Certainly, there&#x27;s someone X levels above me who doesn&#x27;t know who I am and doesn&#x27;t care, but that really doesn&#x27;t affect my life.')
