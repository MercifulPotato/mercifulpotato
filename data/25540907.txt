Interstellar travel is genuinely hard, so hard that advanced civilizations do it from time to time, but not so often to result in &quot;percolation&quot;. In order to have a reasonable argument, let&#x27;s start from contemplating how hard it would be for us, humans. This is the only civilization we know of at this point. There are two things that make interstellar travel very difficult: 1.a. potential collisions with dust grains and 1.b. violence.<p>1.a. Danger of collisions. According to wikipedia, cosmic dust grains can have a size up to 500 microns. At a typical density of 2g&#x2F;cm3 this is a mass of 0.5 mg. Assuming you have a spaceship that travels of 0.01 the speed of light, the energy of impact with such a dust grain will be about 20% the energy of an armor piercing round shot from a modern main battle tank such as the M1 Abrams. Over a 4 light year travel (the distance from us to the closest stars), or a few hundred years of flight at 0.01c, there would be billions- trillions of such impacts.<p>1.b. Human violence. Assuming we get the technological prowess to accelerate things to 0.01c, what&#x27;s to stop someone to point a little projectile in the direction of Earth, or some other place colonized by humans? Such of projectile weighing only 15 kg would have the energy of the Hiroshima bomb. In fact, it&#x27;s actually most likely that the road to interstellar travel will start from military applications, just like the Apollo program was a side-effect of the arms race that created the ICBMs.<p>2. Interstellar communication is hard. Let&#x27;s say that aliens are indeed everywhere, including in the planetary systems of our closest galactic neighbors. How would we know? Would SETI find out about that? The only way we&#x27;d find out were if they were pointing some large antennas straight at us, and putting some megawatts of power into beaming signals at us. How do we know that? We know because we get radio signals from Voyager 1, which is  150 AU from us. Proxima Centauri is 1700 times further, so the signal would be more than 3 million times weaker. Voyager&#x27;s antenna is 3.7 meters and the transmitter has 22 W of power. So, if our neighbors are not actively trying to beam signals at us, our chance of detecting them is practically nil.')
