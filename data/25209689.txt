From places like Fox, Sky News Australia, Ben Shapiro, the message has essentially been: evidence of voter fraud isn&#x27;t sufficient to change the election, there needs to be evidence of voter fraud at sufficient scale to actually change the results, which is highly unlikely. Trump&#x27;s team is well with their rights to pursue an investigation within the legal system, and it&#x27;s actually a good thing for democracy that as many doubts are settled as possible, but it is not okay for him to be declaring himself the winner in the absence of evidence.<p>As others have said, after hearing about Russian collusion for 3 years, as long as Trump keeps his mouth shut about having won the election, I&#x27;m perfectly fine with them making their case within the legal system. As I said, I think it&#x27;s good for democracy if people feel as though their claims were addressed. Especially with a judicial system theoretically predisposed towards favoring Trump, them shutting down the allegations of fraud so far can avoid having been done so we a bias for Biden. The odds of the election results changing are astronomically low, so even if you don&#x27;t want Trump to win, by allowing this process to play out, you are simply bolstering the evidence of a Biden win.')
