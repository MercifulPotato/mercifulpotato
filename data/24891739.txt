What would be interesting to understand is how much of an increase this is - both relative to the number of flights and number of passengers - from prior to March 2020. Primarily, because this seems like a safety issue - every time someone gets banned, there is probably an altercation with a flight attendant (they remind people often to put their masks back on) and thatâ€™s time that flight attendant is unable to perform other duties.')
