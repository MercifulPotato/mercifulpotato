Now you need a whole different suite of tools from the usual tools you use. Your library that parses all the meta tags, identifies the content, &amp;c. is now useless.<p>They&#x27;re no less useless than for SPA&#x27;s that render their content in JS. That&#x27;s all this site is. If your web scraping suite can&#x27;t handle content loaded from JS then you&#x27;re already locked out of most of the web.<p>Same if you disable JS.
