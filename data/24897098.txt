I&#x27;ve found more things have been &quot;solved&quot;\nAlso, Esp8266 has the wonderful Sming framework while ESP32 does not (or it&#x27;s WIP)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SmingHub&#x2F;Sming&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SmingHub&#x2F;Sming&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s basically Arduino but instead of having the central infinite loop it&#x27;s all callback based. So it feels more “proper” I guess. It&#x27;s a bit closer to how you&#x27;re supposed to program a mircocontrollers without Arduino. And it makes going back to Arduino feel clunky<p>That said.. Maybe there is some equivalent for ESP32? I&#x27;m just not aware of it. You can do some other cool stuff with ESP32s. Like run Micropython and Javascript. You can also have wifi and related interrupts on one core and realtime stuff on another core (though I haven&#x27;t exactly figured out how you&#x27;d set this up without using an RTOS)')
