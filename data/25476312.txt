Direct voluntary payments by their audience (one-off&#x2F;recurring).<p>2. Live shows.<p>3. Payment by various entities to sing something.<p>4. Organizations (the state, corporations, philanthropic bodies) which sponsor artists to work on their art without having to also do the work of financing themselves.<p>Still, it&#x27;s quite possible that would fund less than are funded today. To that I would say:<p>1. It would still be a reasonable trade-off.<p>2. It would level the playing field somewhat between today&#x27;s popular performers&#x2F;artists and the vast majority of their peers whom, today, aren&#x27;t funded.<p>3. Communities should motivate themselves, and organize themselves, to support local artists on the individual level, and to provide facilities such as music rooms, instruments, recording studios, professional training&#x2F;lessons - for free or a symbolic fee, to local music artists (and ditto for other kinds of art) - so that at least people don&#x27;t have to pay to engage in their art.')
