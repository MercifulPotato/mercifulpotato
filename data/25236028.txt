Some cycling paths in my area are mixed pedestrian and cycle.  Mostly they are mixed car and cycle.  There are a handful of dedicated bike paths but those often have pedestrians on them anyway.  Good luck changing that.<p>The semantics of &quot;bike path&quot; are not interesting here.  I ride my bike at around 8mph.  I don&#x27;t pass many conventional bicycles.  I don&#x27;t get passed by conventional cycles much either.  When I do it is often by someone on an e-bike going twice as fast.')
