In fact, that kind of win often seems to &quot;inoculate&quot; the person against anything you have to say in the future.<p>When facts and logic fail, I usually fall back on the other two of the good old Greek trio: <i>ethos, pathos and logos</i>.<p>First you need to understand what feelings are driving these individuals. Usually it&#x27;s fear and uncertainty. Until you address the root cause of those feelings (which usually differ from person to person), no amount of fact checking is going to have a permanent effect.<p>The other thing is to build mutual respect, even if you don&#x27;t agree with the person. Branding someone an idiot is generally not considered a winning strategy when it comes to persuasion.')
