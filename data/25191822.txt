Since 2018, I&#x27;ve been owed over $20,000 USD by Surf Air (the LA-based startup in the airline business) that has failed to pay. Some of the other contractors were based out of California and even going the government complaint route has still not paid off for them. At one point, they setup a payment plan and made the initial 1 of 6 monthly payments and then failed to make the rest of them.<p>As a contractor, I&#x27;ve chalked it up as yet another possible cost of doing business however it is frustrating and there seems to be very little one can do that actually results in getting paid without eating up the majority of the payment. Lawyers? See eating up the payment. Collection agencies? My experience was they were out for a quick buck but it was basically no protection from not getting paid a lesser amount (revised terms that ate into the payment). Government? See the other contractors experience -- probably will pay off but company might go bust before it happens. Going public? I think this might be the best route because at least it warns others (although typically it&#x27;ll be too late).<p>Stepping back, I&#x27;m doing just fine and I&#x27;d be far more annoyed for those who have to work off the clock at minimum wage.')
