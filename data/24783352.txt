(The Mucinex is also current.) I just hadn&#x27;t listed it due to classing it with omeprazole.<p>The ranitidine, omeprazole, and pantoprazole are all intended to treat pain[1] from heartburn, and they&#x27;ve all worked at first and gradually lost effectiveness. (While still being mostly effective, just not totally effective.)<p>However, going without heartburn pain for weeks at a time has not helped my throat. When this didn&#x27;t work, the gastroenterologist put a sensor down my throat for a day to record pH levels, and reported the results to me with &quot;good news! You don&#x27;t have heartburn!&quot;<p>Of course, I do have heartburn. The response to &quot;in that case, what does it mean that I have this burning chest pain after eating which is immediately relieved by tums?&quot; was &quot;well, some people are more sensitive to acid than others&quot;.<p>(I have many classic symptoms of acid reflux, including minor regurgitation of food after eating, &quot;globus sensation&quot; (feeling of a ball in the throat) when swallowing, and of course burning pain in the chest.)<p>But I continue the heartburn medication anyway, because heartburn hurts and I independently want to avoid it. :&#x2F;<p>[1] Actually, they&#x27;re intended to suppress the acid itself, not the pain you feel from exposure to it.')
