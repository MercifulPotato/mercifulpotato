These newer plant based burgers do of course address some ethical concerns around meat and certainly seem more sustainable.<p>With any eye on public health rather than sustainability: I wounder what these plant based burgers will do in the long run. I&#x27;ve been on the keto diet for quite a while now which leans heavily on animal-based fats and proteins, never felt healthier. With animal fats for example most of them are quite good for you. It&#x27;s some of the plant based fats that are really problematic (typically the ones that melt at room temperature).<p>I really suspect the &quot;sugar crisis&quot; might actually be the &quot;carbohydrates crisis&quot; (i.e. not just fizzy drinks and sweets, but bread, pasta, rice, cereal, etc). I think most people have diets such that they run off pure carbohydrates 24&#x2F;7 and then get the &quot;shakes&quot; when they go a few hours without them. I think plant based burgers will still be packed full of carbs, nothing to say of the buns and additional toppings.<p>I understand that these plant based burgers aim to break the perception of &quot;plants taste awful, meat tastes good&quot;, but I wish more was done where it really counts in McDonalds meals, like chips, buns, batter, etc.')
