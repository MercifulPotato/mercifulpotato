This is something the team keeps top of mind and influences our decisions and road maps. Please continue to keep us honest here. I&#x27;ll get others to weight in on this, but here&#x27;s my personal opinion on the matter.<p>AppEngine has been around for a long time, 12 years to be exact, and in my mind it&#x27;s a completely different product, and still one of our most successful. While Cloud Run competes with AppEngine on some fronts, customers really appreciate AppEngine&#x27;s deep integration with other GCP managed services. It&#x27;s a full blown PaaS.<p>I expect Cloud Run to improve over time and gain more features that will no doubt match the requirements of many AppEngine customers, some may switch to Cloud Run, but we are not forcing them to.<p>Cloud Functions already shares a lot of underlying infrastructure with Cloud Run, which shares a lot of underlying infrastructure with AppEngine, and that&#x27;s by design. These days I like to think of Cloud Functions as a simplified developer experience on top of Cloud Run focused on task orientated workloads backed by events and triggers.<p>Can we continue to support 3 somewhat overlapping Serverless platforms going forward? I believe the answer is yes, thanks to the shared infrastructure, and the fact we truly believe all three platforms offer a unique set of developer experiences worth preserving. Maybe there is future state where one product satisfies all use cases, but that&#x27;s not today, so we plan to keep listening to customers, and invest across the board.<p>One recent example of investing across the board: you can now leverage global load balancing[1] across all three Serverless platforms.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;load-balancing&#x2F;docs&#x2F;negs&#x2F;serverless-neg-concepts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;load-balancing&#x2F;docs&#x2F;negs&#x2F;serverless...</a>')
