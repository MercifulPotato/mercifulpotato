And we saw some protests turning violent with some protesters losing an eye, hit by rubber ball or gas canister (seen such comments on twitter about the US BLM protests and Trump&#x2F;BLM protesters clashes). It was said that an helicopter was ready to fly the president out of Paris during the peak of the protests and some protesters managed to storm some ministry.<p>The social unrest for me is partly to blame on social media. We also see that with the conspiracy theorists on  covid19, but people don&#x27;t watch traditional media anymore. They get information from Facebook  groups or some twitter feeds, spend their time commenting on the same topic, see that some other people share the same opinion and thus think a large portion of their fellow citizen share the same point of view. It just reinforces extremist views or make them become dominant within a group.')
