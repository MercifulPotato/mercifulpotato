You have told me what I think is the case is toxic, wrong, disgusting and harmful. I now know you feel strongly about this.<p>I don&#x27;t hugely feel like seeing things from your point of view because the only thing you&#x27;ve really told me that might change my mind is that you lose people when you require a basic amount of capability. I&#x27;m sorry to hear that this grievously wounds you on an emotional level, but I don&#x27;t see that as a loss.')
