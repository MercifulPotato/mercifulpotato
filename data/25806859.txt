E2E encryption that&#x27;s easy and works by default. Those would be more than enough killer features, SMTP is just too broken and all the workarounds we have in place like DKIM, SPF, Spam ratings etc etc don&#x27;t make up for it. We still have spam, important mails still end up in our junk boxes, and nobody trusts it enough anymore to put important content in emails. The war has long been lost.')
