Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave makes this quite evident IMO. In the end, we&#x27;re all ignorant, all have our set of beliefs, and all must willfully choose for ourselves what&#x27;s persuasive. Science just sees pointing to evidence as the most practical way of testing beliefs. And quite honestly... what else is there for testing beliefs? Making a different argument for the nature of something that could also be reasonably plausible (e.g. a conspiracy theory)? Well that&#x27;s a hypothesis, which is also a belief, and so we&#x27;re back to square one... which is everything is ultimately a stack of willfully chosen beliefs that we deem trustworthy.')
