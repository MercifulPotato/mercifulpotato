It allows me to set web and app blocklists and schedule them as needed. Usually, the urges go away after a couple of weeks. Ultimately, the goal of digital minimalism is to change your behavior in regards to your device usage, not change your device to appease your urges.<p>The two biggest changes that helped me dramatically reduce phone usage was to A) go full grayscale on my phone and B) to add the screen time widget to my home screen. Grayscale instantly makes the phone less visually appealing, which helps to put it down faster and to reach for it less.  The screen time widget on my home screen allows me to instantly see how much time I&#x27;ve been on my phone, which I then use to decide if I really need to do what I unlocked the phone for.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedom.to&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedom.to&#x2F;</a>')
