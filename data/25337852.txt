Your examples are about users of devices. &quot;<p>Just to level set - as a program manager when I engage with programmers it&#x27;s not because I want to buy programmers.<p>I want the fruits of their labors.<p>Let me put it another way - programmers love to bemoan the way users abuse Excel.  Users abuse Excel because it meets their needs best, given all other factors in their environments.<p>If things like no code environments progress where they can provide at a minimum the level of functionality Excel can for many tasks then it will take off.
