A maintainer would be visiting a pre-baked search list often, which can be done with things like bookmarks.<p>&gt; &gt; I believe the important thing is to make the default search return the issues that the maintainers are not working on, so that known issues are still tracked (but possibly out of the maintainer&#x27;s hair).<p>&gt; What would be an example where this kind of tracking is useful?<p>People would be able to find the existing issues and not file duplicates, reducing bug management burden on the maintainers? As a secondary effect, people might be able to collaborate independent of the maintainer.<p>&gt; &gt; The important thing is that new users would be able to find them<p>&gt; Users can find them either by full-text search or by browsing all issues.<p>Yes, they could. But users generally would make new issues, possible mentioning the existing closed ones, because they are still affected by it, causing more noise. Ideally they&#x27;d just subscribe to it instead and make no noise for the maintainer.')
