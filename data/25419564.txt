Updates going back as far as what, March?, with no indication that the update included this, were involved here.  What I&#x27;m saying is that whether you, or an automated update process are performing the update... You still are susceptible.<p>Unless, as I said, your idea is to block updates completely, which is... not really viable.<p>What should these companies have done better for the update side?  Sure, there were other controls that could have limited the effectiveness of this once the update was in place, but I&#x27;m not seeing anything that would block the update itself.')
