The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;2&#x2F;16599036&#x2F;donna-brazile-hillary-clinton-sanders" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;2&#x2F;16599036&#x2F;d...</a><p>We found out about this thanks to Guccifer, and to a lot of people what the DNC did was a big deal.<p>My original point was that everyone is trying to pull a fast one over on the American public, not just the Russian&#x27;s. Republican&#x27;s also, in case you are offended that we are talking about Democrats at the moment.<p>Do you disagree?')
