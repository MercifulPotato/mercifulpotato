Item(by='brozaman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610412543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738538, text='&gt; They managed to make game on their own engine and launch it on 5 platforms at the same time that&#x27;s impressive to me based on number of developers I saw in credits.<p>Although I appreciate the hard work of the developers and respect them for it as a developer, as a consumer I don&#x27;t care if they paid 5 developers or 5000. I care about the final result, and the truth is I&#x27;ve never seen a game this broken (even though I played assassin&#x27;s creed unity).<p>&gt; probably 90% of people who bought the game are happy cause the story is solid and you can go trough story without problems<p>Probably not, do you have any data to backup that statement? 41% of the sales are consoles[2] and the game is basically unplayable for xbox one, xbox one s, PS4 and PS4 slim. So broken that it was even retired from the play station store. So to get that 90% you would need 100% of the PC users happy and over 75% of the consoles users happy, which isn&#x27;t very realistic if oyu ask me. And even on PC we can&#x27;t assume 90% are happy, PC player base has shrunk 79% since launch[1] and those are the happiest users. The PC (again, the best one) has about 24.9 negative reviews in metacritic[3].<p>The story seems solid and I&#x27;m enjoying it so  far, but saying that you can go through it without problems is simply laughable. I haven&#x27;t had any crash so far but I needed to restart a few times because the game entered an unplayable state, such as being unable to pick a dialog, draw a weapon, or entering a location. And I&#x27;ve played less than 5 hours.<p>&gt; all major main story related problems were fixed before Christmas<p>I only opened it last week, the game is still unplayable.<p>&gt; If you focus on dialogues and don&#x27;t try to destroy city like in GTA the game is great<p>It&#x27;s a videogame, not a novel, even though I appreciate a good story (and so far it seems REALLY good), and even if I think it&#x27;s one of the most  interesting cities of any videogame ever, I also expect proper gameplay. And even dialogs are kinda pointless, many times you have multiple choices that aren&#x27;t actually choices and you end up in the same spot. The life paths so far seem useless and people who completed the game say they are useless. Which isn&#x27;t necessarly bad because I also like linear games.<p>At least on xbox series X input is broken: sometimes after leaving a menu it keeps a previous state of the controller, sometimes some action cannot be performed god knows why, such as changing the camera in a vehicle, when a button can perform multiple actions instead of having a predictable order it seems to do a random thing (pressing B during a dialog sometimes skips ahead, sometimes crouches), etc.<p>Standing on some surfaces triggers weird behavior such as the character stuttering, the other day I stepped on an inclined surface and the character went projected at insane speed, etc.<p>Car physics are just bad, it&#x27;s not a bug, it&#x27;s simply poorly implemented, just do a slow turn, it&#x27;s enough to be obvious how broken it is. A car doesn&#x27;t turn like that. Driving at high speed is simply clumsy, it feels just bad.<p>NPCs do very stupid things even in missions where they&#x27;re supposed to be scripted, etc.<p>No it&#x27;s not insanity, the game is simply broken. I enjoyed The Witcher 3 a lot, way more than I enjoyed GTA V, and quite frankly I&#x27;m very disappointed. I believe it will be a great game if the fix it, but in the meantime I&#x27;m holding it for a few months until it&#x27;s playable.<p>References:\n1- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;318890-cyberpunk-2077s-pc-player-base-has-shrunk-79-percent-since-launch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.extremetech.com&#x2F;gaming&#x2F;318890-cyberpunk-2077s-pc...</a>\n2- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.futuregamereleases.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-sold-8-million-units-in-total-4-72m-on-pc-3-28m-on-console&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.futuregamereleases.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-so...</a> \n3- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metacritic.com&#x2F;game&#x2F;pc&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077&#x2F;user-reviews" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metacritic.com&#x2F;game&#x2F;pc&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077&#x2F;user-revie...</a>')
