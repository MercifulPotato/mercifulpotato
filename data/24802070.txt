Item(by='leoh', descendants=None, kids=[24802203, 24802465], score=None, time=1602863888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800947, text='I&#x27;ve been using the mobile device made by Heartmath lately — <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.heartmath.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.heartmath.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;</a>. It looks at HRV (heart rate variability) and gives you a realtime plot, thereby offering visual feedback about how my breathing is affecting how steady the time between heartbeats is. Hearthmath calls low HRV &quot;coherence&quot; and getting into a lower HRV state (i.e. via regular, smooth breathing; maybe 1 in&#x2F;out breath each ~10 seconds) is strongly associated with enhanced levels of calm and clarity — and I would strongly suspect (though can&#x27;t know for sure) that similar effects would be seen as in the paper w.r.t. the immune system. I&#x27;ve found it exceptionally helpful.<p>I am on and off a long-term meditator (for about a year I was meditating as much as 2 hours a day). Some people don&#x27;t achieve deeper states of calm and contentedness, in spite of meditating often (I&#x27;ve encountered this among serious practitioners of zen, for example; this happens to me sometimes, too) and I strongly suspect that lowering HRV would help.')
