Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602529161, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24753428, text='<i>&gt; You can not criminalize many things that boil down to minor instances of bad judgement and convert many nonviolent crimes into civil crimes, limit the circumstances under which police can arrest, limit the punishments the courts can inflict, require more prompt trials and releases, etc, etc.</i><p>What is interesting to me is that the article itself does not consider this alternative at all. But the simplest way to drastically reduce the number of people who are in jail pretrial because they can&#x27;t afford bail would be to make the things they were charged with no longer crimes. For example, simple drug possession.<p><i>&gt; Criminals who have not yet crossed paths with the system to really get punished to the point of changing or thrown in jail will harm and kill people.</i><p>Harming and killing people, and threats to do those things, would still be crimes in a system where the things you describe were decriminalized, and if those kinds of crimes were the <i>only</i> crimes the justice system had to deal with, the system could afford to hold people charged with such crimes in jail pretrial without bail if it was deemed too risky to release them, because it wouldn&#x27;t take months or years to try them.')
