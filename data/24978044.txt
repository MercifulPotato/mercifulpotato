It was an exo-atmospheric nuclear test above Johnston Atoll. The blast was visible from Honolulu and a large glowing red cloud drifted over the island chain all the way from Johnston Atoll. There are areas of the zone underneath the explosion which are still hot to this day. And that was just one of the tests that went right. There were plenty of failures too, both in atmosphere and on the launchpad, which spread nuclear material and toxic fuel all over the place. High-altitude nuclear explosions are definitely a threat to humanity, no doubt about it.')
