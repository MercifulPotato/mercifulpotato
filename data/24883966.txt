He looked at the scan with me and explained my diagnosis and prognosis. We had at least one more meeting before the surgery, and I still see him every year for follow up (I think he&#x27;s cutting me loose next year after six years - I will miss him he&#x27;s a nice guy). Isn&#x27;t this how it normally goes?')
