I seem to recall conversations here where some larger sites were <i>only</i> allowing googlebot to crawl their site in robots.txt rules. Their thinking was that the vast majority of traffic is coming from google, and it wasn&#x27;t worth it to have multiple also-ran search engines crawling their site frequently. There&#x27;s a case to be made that search engines are actually a natural monopoly.')
