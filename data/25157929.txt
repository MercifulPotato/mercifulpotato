One thing I think is important to note is that I don&#x27;t want, and I don&#x27;t think any hearing impaired person would want (though I can&#x27;t speak for all of them) for you to spend really any time feeling guilty about a potential offense you might have caused.<p>What I&#x27;m advocating for is radical compassion and empathy. When you hear somebody say &quot;this thing can hurt me&quot; worry less about all the times you were involved in that, and consider more how you can help folks avoid that harm in the future.<p>That&#x27;s not to say we should ever introspect. I noticed that with a friend of mine who recently came out as trans I was still often using gendered language &quot;dude, man, etc&quot; from before they came out, even if I usually got their pronouns right. They didn&#x27;t ask me, but the introspection I was doing prompted me to offer them an apology and commit to doing better about those kinds of things. That has brought us closer and given me a better perspective for being a good friend and ally to them.<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody thinks you&#x27;re trying to be a jerk, or intentionally seeking to hurt people&#x27;s feelings. What I&#x27;m reacting to is a vocal minority of folks, often in tech, who seem to react to being told &quot;Hey, this thing sometimes hurts my feelings when I notice it&quot; with &quot;How dare you accuse me of being literally Darth Vader. This is THOUGHT POLICING.&quot;<p>Just... try your best to be kind to people. If that means you&#x27;re the CEO of github and you can change &quot;master&quot; to &quot;main&quot; why the heck wouldn&#x27;t you?')
