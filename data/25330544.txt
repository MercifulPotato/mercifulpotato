Item(by='davidgerard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607332282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326887, text='&gt; Some senior engineer or manager says &quot;I want to work on blockchain projects&quot;, invents a reason to do that within Facebook, or maybe their boss really wants to keep them there, and somehow they get enough buy-in to create Libra. Now they have a blockchain project.<p>This is pretty much how it happened. A Bitcoin fan started at Facebook, started from &quot;how do we use a blockchain here&quot; then came up with something to use a blockchain for, and recruited some executives who thought similarly.<p>Most of what&#x27;s weird and dumb about Libra&#x2F;Diem is because it was started by four bitcoiners, from bitcoin ideas. It turns out that ideas from a cryptocurrency that was started in order to evade government control don&#x27;t play well in the heavily regulated environment of Other People&#x27;s Money.')
