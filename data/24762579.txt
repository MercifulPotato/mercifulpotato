I wanted a typed API definition that generates first-class implementations in Typescript and Python.<p>Haven&#x27;t had much success in the past re: using other formal mechanisms of defining API interfaces, and I&#x27;m no longer up-to-date with what&#x27;s recommended in this space (any suggestions).<p>Alternative was GraphQL (since using React) but that&#x27;s a learning curve and dealing with protos in Typescript and Python is a known-known for me.')
