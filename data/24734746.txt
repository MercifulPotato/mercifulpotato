I&#x27;ve always legitimately wondered what happens in that situation.<p>If you do happen to be a citizen or permanent resident of either Canada or Mexico, it would be safest to do your border-trip at your home-country border.<p>_Update_: Did some real quick research, and it appears that for US&#x2F;Canada at least there are agreements in place that if one country rejects your entrance (at a land border) from the other country, the other country must take you back, but could find you inadmissible and put you in immigration custody pending removal. Fun times.')
