DMCA, getting ISP to disclose data about their customers): if you sell your product so much that you can&#x27;t find a way to understand and legally persecute which of your users is breaching your contract and redistribute your goods, that&#x27;s the way of the market to tax the wealth you&#x27;re making.<p>And I live off selling software (which gets copied and distributed on warez sites hosted where I can&#x27;t touch them).<p>I&#x27;ll pay that market tax happily, given I&#x27;m getting some marketing in return and stopping it would cost me more in legal fees than anything. What I don&#x27;t like is paying for an inept government to steal my money, provide crappy service and threaten me with jail if I don&#x27;t pay.')
