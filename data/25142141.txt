I live in a very inexpensive apartment, where most people are low-income or on gov&#x27;t subsidy, or both. I also walk my dog daily and interact with 3-5 different neighbors each day - so I have a view into their lives.<p>It&#x27;s bad here. I&#x27;d say at least 1&#x2F;3 have lost their jobs and are having a really hard time finding work. More uber&#x2F;lyft signs have popped up in cars in the parking lot. One of my neighbors had to move their family of 3 from an already-small 2br to a 1br (2 kids). I don&#x27;t know how they can make it work. There&#x27;s more people who sit on the sidewalk curb and drink cheap beer and chain smoke. They&#x27;re nice folks (I talk to them), but they can&#x27;t find work.<p>On the flips side, anyone who can WFH is doing better than ever before. They save money by not driving, eating out, or doing the other things they&#x27;d normally do. I&#x27;ve also seen A LOT of brand new cars show up, presumably buying because of low interest rates. WFH folks seem happier than before.<p>The disparity between the haves and have-nots looks like it&#x27;s been rapidly accelerating. If you always stay in the HN bubble, you won&#x27;t see these people. They&#x27;re &#x27;invisible&#x27;, but I assure you they are real. They need help, and they&#x27;re not getting it. It&#x27;s honestly very, very sad - it makes me sad. My empathy is on overdrive because it&#x27;s so easy to see myself in that position. If I hadn&#x27;t chosen tech, I&#x27;d be right there with them with a 6-pack, Marlboros, and no hope.')
