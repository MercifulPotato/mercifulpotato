Back in the day had to create add-ins making use of compiled Matlab code to get access to decent numerical routines. Eventually moved to Python and never looked back, although I still use Excel for certain tasks.<p>However I do miss the VBA GUI editor built into Excel. It allowed for relatively polished interfaces in record time.')
