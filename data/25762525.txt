Key is to not push it when she loses interest. If it&#x27;s important, just end up talking about it again at a later datetime. There&#x27;s only so much input a child (or adult) can accept before the buffer is full and needs to be mapped. It takes time to put into context.<p>Also accept that some things can&#x27;t really be explained by everyone. A guy on YT with a channel on self defense said, &quot;if you are not a violent person, you&#x27;ll never understand violence&quot;, and I think it has some bearing. Sure, I can certainly understand that, in the case of X, he was beaten as a child and therefore may see violence as a way to handle his feelings, but that doesn&#x27;t explain &quot;why did X beat up Y unprovoked last Wednesday&quot;. There&#x27;s rarely a single causality that explains things like that.<p>And, ads, yt-videos, social media, most often are manipulative. Eg the &quot;youtube-face&quot;, excessive reaction-videos, etc. (no, she has no access to social media).')
