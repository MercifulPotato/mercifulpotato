I&#x27;m still unhappy about upgrading 2012 Macbook Air to 2019 Macboook Pro. The main reason for that is that audio setup seems much less stable; there are glitches when I play on output speakers half the time and the audio inteface I use for recording also stopped being reliable. There&#x27;s also a bug when laptop resets itself in sleep mode unless it&#x27;s connected power charger. And there&#x27;s also all 32 bit VSTs I cannot use anymore. I&#x27;m really tired of this, I&#x27;ve paying premium for Apple stuff years ago so I don&#x27;t have to mess around with small issues like that (which occurred all the time on my linux machine), but now this experience is gone. I&#x27;m slowly leaning to agree with my linux&#x2F;windows friends that I&#x27;ve wasted money.')
