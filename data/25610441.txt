The first is the book &quot;UNIX: A History and a Memoir by Brian Kernigan&quot;, and the second the blog post &quot;A Constructive Look at TempleOS&quot;.<p>That blog post [1] along with &quot;A Language Design Analysis of HolyC&quot; [2] inspired me to try out TempleOS for myself. I&#x27;m so glad I did, since I got hooked on developing programs in HolyC, and thus learned C in the process. There&#x27;s something about building a piece of software for a system and knowing that nothing like it has ever existed on that platform before!<p>I&#x27;ve been working in HolyC for over a year, but I just finished K&amp;R tonight, which has me wanting to read more Kernigan, so I&#x27;m glad the UNIX book showed up on my radar.<p>(PS feel free to ask me about TempleOS development; email is open)<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codersnotes.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;a-constructive-look-at-templeos&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codersnotes.com&#x2F;notes&#x2F;a-constructive-look-at-temp...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harrisontotty.github.io&#x2F;p&#x2F;a-lang-design-analysis-of-holyc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;harrisontotty.github.io&#x2F;p&#x2F;a-lang-design-analysis-of-...</a>')
