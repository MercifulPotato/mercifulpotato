Ships generally can support their own weight if only supported at the ends.  Because waves exist a ship can find itself with the stern on one crest and the bow on the next with little or nothing supporting the middle. The under keel explosion works better because:<p>(1) The weight of the ship acts against the explosion increasing the initial stress<p>(2) The gas bubble created can vent straight up on a side explosion.  Under the keel means it has to go through&#x2F;around the ship increasing the stress.<p>(3) Since the explosion lifts the ship you&#x27;re going to get significant additional damage when it crashes back down into the water.<p>(4) Like (2) as the gas bubble disperses water rushes back into the vacuum.  All of this water coming back in will collide in the middle resulting in a geyser going straight up into the ship.')
