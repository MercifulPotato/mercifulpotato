C&#x27;mon. Put that $50M somewhere that averages even a modest 4% annual return and you could pay the tax, draw out $600K a year (I mean, you can live on that, right? Not a hardship?), and still have another $600K left over.<p>The people who would actually be <i>subject</i> to kind of tax would not, in an actual monetary sense, be <i>adversely affected</i> by this kind of tax, and we&#x27;re really falling back on to crying BUT IT&#x27;S THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING. And, fine, but also ironic -- after all, that&#x27;s also the rationale for imposing the tax.')
