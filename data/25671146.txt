Right now, a bunch of people can tweet &quot;John Doe (some public figure) beats his wife&quot; with no verification, and Twitter keeps the tweets up, and doesn&#x27;t get in trouble when John Doe&#x27;s life is ruined by the false accusations.<p>What&#x27;s more, media can then report &quot;John Doe is allegedly a domestic abuser,&quot; citing the tweets as evidence that there are allegations that John Doe is a domestic abuser.  You see this pattern with pizza gate (some dumb social media posts getting picked up by Republican news), and with Kyle Rittenhouse (dumb, false twitter posts picked up by left-leaning news).  In the latter case, the news outlets have been getting sued for defamation because the reporting was damaging and so demonstrably false.<p>Section 230 protection for these platforms erodes all standards of truth for news.')
