It might be the case if you are trying to target IE9, but &quot;we&#x27;ve been trying it over a decade&quot; is no longer an excuse in 2020 when there are only 2-3 relevant browser engines and all of them are reasonably up to spec.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not a matter of strictly separating the groups of people doing one task or another. It&#x27;s a matter of being able to extend in one dimension while keeping the other untouched.<p>&gt; They&#x27;re too intertwined and CSS alone isn&#x27;t powerful enough to do everything you want.<p>I&#x27;d argue that is precisely backwards. The reason that we don&#x27;t see any more different designs and more bold experiments is because we are not defining the interaction points between different layers in the development stack.<p>If most developers keep this mentality that all they need to do is to get a system that solves their immediate problems and solves their own unique solution, then all they are going to do is this mushing together of <i>their  structure</i> and <i>their presentation</i> layers, and all we are going to get is a pile architectures are going to converge to different local maxima. If instead we don&#x27;t take the easy way out and make things with flexibility and extensibility in mind, then the likelihood of it becoming the basis of something ground-breaking grows enormously.')
