There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Just because someone testifies that they saw something doesn&#x27;t prove it. It&#x27;s just hearsay. Please stop spreading disinformation.<p>Many people working minimum wage jobs don&#x27;t have the ability to take an entire day off and spend the money to deal with the nightmare that is the DMV. Just because they aren&#x27;t a fancy software developer doesn&#x27;t mean that there vote shouldn&#x27;t count equally as someone who can afford to take the day off.<p>Regarding needing a state ID to work, you can read on UCSIS&#x27; website what is required. One can use things like school IDs, voter registration, birth certificate, and SSA card. So, no, if you don&#x27;t have a state ID it does not mean that you are working under the table.<p>In reality, there are tons of reasons why we shouldn&#x27;t require more strict voter ID laws.')
