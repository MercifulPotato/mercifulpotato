A family friend who worked on antique cars would often run into the problem where a specific piece broke and he needed to find it replaced. Finding the exact part for a 1970s Porsche is not only  difficult, but also incredibly expensive. Having a 3D model of the specific part and just printing it would have been not only far faster but orders of magnitude cheaper. The exact material could just inferred from the broken part or a stronger material could be selected out of caution.<p>I hope their plan isn&#x27;t to 3D print safety critical parts like the rotor blades, that would certainly end poorly in the way you mention.')
