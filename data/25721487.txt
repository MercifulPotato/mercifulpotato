The closest I’ve found in the same vein is a 1994 article by Edward Luttwak who predicted another wave of fascism in the western world driven by economic decline of the middle class:<p>“It is only mildly amusing that nowadays the standard Republican&#x2F;Tory after-dinner speech is a two-part affair, in which part one celebrates the virtues of unimpeded competition and dynamic structural change, while part two mourns the decline of the family and community ‘values’ that were eroded precisely by the forces commended in part one. Thus at the present time the core of Republican&#x2F;Tory beliefs is a perfect non-sequitur. And what does the moderate Left have to offer? Only more redistribution, more public assistance, and particularist concern for particular groups that can claim victim status, from the sublime peak of elderly, handicapped, black lesbians down to the merely poor.”<p>Link to article here. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lrb.co.uk&#x2F;the-paper&#x2F;v16&#x2F;n07&#x2F;edward-luttwak&#x2F;why-fascism-is-the-wave-of-the-future" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lrb.co.uk&#x2F;the-paper&#x2F;v16&#x2F;n07&#x2F;edward-luttwak&#x2F;why-f...</a>')
