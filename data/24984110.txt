Item(by='the_gastropod', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604438339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979167, text='A little bit off topic, but this thing looks suspiciously  a <i>lot</i> like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunchmoney.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunchmoney.app&#x2F;</a> and as far as I can tell is totally unrelated. Even the Lunch Money logo is used under the pricing section... Is this just a coincidence &#x2F; did Lunch Money also use some stock illustrations thatâ€™re used here? Or is just good old fashioned copying?')
