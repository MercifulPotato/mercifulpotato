I have never looked into macro code more closely than function code when writing Racket programs, and mostly I don&#x27;t know or care if whatever I am calling is a macro or a function.<p>&gt; This and the inability to look up quickly what fields are inside an object or the exact api of a function.<p>At least within Clojure and Racket, you have IDEs like Cursive and DrRacket that will show you function documentation and do code completion. Or are you saying that the presence of macros alters this somehow?')
