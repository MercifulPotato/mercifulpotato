If there is a possibility that some claim could be wrong, it is only a hypothesis.  And that&#x27;s perfectly fine.  Call that knowledge if you like, but you are over-stating your case.  Lying in fact.<p>The reality is that we have far less knowledge than we think.  We may be aware of lots of hypotheses, we can have knowledge of hypotheses.  But this is not knowledge of the thing being hypothesised about.<p>You think you have knowledge when you don&#x27;t.  And I say, if you are unaware of your ignorance, and in fact erroneously believe yourself to be knowledgeable, you are in a state worse than ignorance.  You only have beliefs, but you think they are knowledge.  This is to say, you are guilty of magical thinking.  And that is the essence of religion.<p>Hence why I say, religion and science are the same thing at core - its all belief.  Adherents to each believe they have knowledge, but this belief is without proof.  In a way scientists are worse as they are convinced they do have the truth, and are determined to righteously inflict their truths on everyone else!  They are far from humble.  Its pretty irritating!<p>All the best.')
