The #1 recipient of foreign aid from the US is Egypt, of course a Muslim country, this surprises a lot of people - it&#x27;s to keep Isreal&#x2F;Egypt tensions under wraps. Because they have not had &#x27;hot fighting&#x27; in a generation, most of us don&#x27;t think about that as the &#x27;problem spot&#x27; but really it is - if that broke down it would suck the entire region into a bad black hole of fighting.<p>Without the US to protect House of Saud (and it doesn&#x27;t need to even fire a bullet for that, just the credible threat of retaliation is enough) and their Sunni neighbours, Iran and Saudi Arabia would be going at each other, and though they don&#x27;t have plans to &#x27;invade&#x27; each other, it would break out into something ugly probably very quickly.<p>The populists in Egypt (i.e. Muslim Brotherhood) could easily gain power, and their more radical factions would turn 88M people against Israel and that&#x27;s a real problem, imagine the pro-Trump vs. anti-Trump rallies we see this weekend, but 100x as big, right on the Egypt&#x2F;Isreal border - maybe neither government wants it, but as soon as &#x27;someone dies&#x27; then they are forced to react and it gets swiftly out of hand. If 88M people &#x27;want blood&#x27; then war is innevitable.<p>And Iran&#x27;s intransigence, though obviously fuelled by the US somewhat - is real.<p>(Aside from &#x27;total breakdown&#x27; of power i.e. E. Syria in which case some radical group like ISIS will take power)<p>The &#x27;piece on the board&#x27; that would &#x27;make the system peaceful&#x27; if it were to be removed is point blank Iran, that&#x27;s obvious.<p>Yemen, the Gulf, Syria, Shia Iraq, Kurdish lands, and Lebanese instability via Syria ... it&#x27;s Iran.<p>The US forces in the M&#x2F;E right now are not fighting for the most part, this is no longer Gulf War, so the 5th fleet + support is well placed.<p>There is so much &#x27;inherent instability&#x27; there it would fall apart very quickly. The availability of Oil money, concentrated into a few hands of people with personal and ideological vendettas is just too much. (Of course the real &#x27;piece on the board were it to be removed would mean peace&#x27; is Oil).')
