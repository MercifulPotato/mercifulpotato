This is particularly important in the case of cats. Why? Because cats are an introduced predator with the ability to drive large numbers of bird and other small prey animal species to extinction.<p>Since we are the ones who introduced cats in the first place, we are responsible for the consequences. Violating the bodily autonomy of individual cats is a small price to pay to avoid a population explosion that would ultimately result in the large scale killing of countless birds and other small animals.')
