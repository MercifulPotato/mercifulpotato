That&#x27;s another serious issue much too big to discuss here except to mention two well-known examples that highlight the problems:<p>1.  There&#x27;s are problem with having compiled, thus obfuscated, code in embedded devices such as you mention. The high profile case being the Volkswagen emissions affair.  Given the potential for vehicles (normal or EV) to kill people, there&#x27;s a strong case that all such embedded code in mission-critical applications ought to be open whether the manufacturer likes it or not.<p>2.  Backdoors such as Intel&#x27;s Active Management Technology&#x2F;AMT&#x2F;IME should not be allowed by law unless all aspects of their APIs are published openly.<p>It&#x27;s not only high profile stuff such as I&#x27;ve mentioned either.  Several weeks ago I bought a NETGEAR LB2120 4G&#x2F;LTE modem. I know nothing about the information it sends back to NETGEAR other than it actually does so by virtue of the fact that it advised me of an update (no other information about the update was supplied).  It seems to me that, as user, I not only have the right to know what information is sent back but also that I should have the option to block itâ€”and that this right should be enshrined in law.')
