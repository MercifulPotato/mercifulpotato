Physical appearance isn&#x27;t as important to women as it is to men. Being funny, earning well, having your life together, being confident etc is what does it for most women which is why young girls often end up dating 50 year old men.<p>I&#x27;ve gone through stretches where I was working out, doing pushups every day, etc. In the end it didn&#x27;t make much difference. I found as the years passed I was able to date progressively more and more beautiful women, often to my great surprise, in the sense that I was tending to think they were &#x27;out of my league&#x27; right up to the point we started dating. I&#x27;m not a particularly buff or good looking man by the standards presented to us in movies: quite average really. But women <i>really</i> respond to warm, funny confidence, the ability to entertain them and coming across as smart but not intellectually arrogant (probably they use it as a proxy for earnings potential).<p>I&#x27;m now fortunate to be engaged to the most beautiful women I&#x27;ve ever met, who in addition is calm, logical, self-reliant and self employed, funny, sweet and generous. We&#x27;re head over heels in love. For years I thought it might never happen, because I searched for a long time and dated many girls in a search for love that never seemed to arrive (except once, but it was an unrequited love).<p>By far, the most important factor in me being able to get this girl was <i>not</i> physical appearance, in fact she told me that she finds buff guys <i>unattractive</i> because she associates it with cold and dumb guys who spend all their time working out, meaning they have nothing to say. What let me get her was years of refining my skills in what women start wanting once they&#x27;re older than about 25.')
