I think the key element is how the members actually had to implement their designs. If you just come up with a lazy compromise, it&#x27;ll start haunting you immediately, and not just after the worker bees did their thing.<p>I think the &quot;cabal&quot; responsible for USB 3.1.1.1.gen2-420gig-whatever should have done the same, with each meeting ending in every member having to explain to their grandma why she can&#x27;t connect her monitor to her laptop even though the cable fits perfectly, and that it&#x27;s somehow _both_ the wrong cable and the wrong laptop port.')
