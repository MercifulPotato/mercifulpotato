I suppose maybe a maniacally focused founder or CEO might. But anyone in a position to be involved in these decisions has a huge personal stake in the situation. If I thought I was going to make $100M and instead I made $200M, it&#x27;s hard to imagine being mad at the bankers for leaving the company&#x27;s money on the table. But maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not a big company executive.<p>But anyway, the flip side of a transaction that is incredibly important and you do only once, is that if you go against the norm and it goes badly, it could go very badly and you might not get a redo. If you go along with the experts, you are genuinely probably taking less risk.')
