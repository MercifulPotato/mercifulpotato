He write code like that, during review insists this is OK because he&#x27;s been writing such code for over a decade! I inherited this project after he moved to another country and is not legally to work remotely for company in the UK. He has permissions to override jenkins+sonarqube, so he merges code without test coverage. His code has literally 0 tests. Only today I was rewriting code like:<p><pre><code>   if(i == 1) {}\n   else if(b == true){}\n   else if(s == &quot;string&quot;) {}\n   else if(response.status() == Status.OK){}\n   else if(hereIsARecursiveMethodAlwaysReturningFalse()){}\n   ... 3 more\n</code></pre>\nnotice each `if` block has different variable of different type!')
