Windows will have to target the new, and allow applications to use move to the new ISA at their own pace. With time they can make &quot;Rosetta 2&quot; style emulation with compilation to remove the old ISA all together.<p>That said I seriously doubt that the ISA in and of itself is the reason the chips are slower. After all, underneath is a state of the art architecture. Until I see a independent true cross platform benchmark in e.g. in dotnet be significantly faster and more efficient, I remain skeptical of such incredible claims.')
