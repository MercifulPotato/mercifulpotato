The percentage of chronically ill people who live, and the percentage of people who make it past age 65, will plummet.<p>Everyone who&#x27;s alive now will almost certainly need to socially distance (and <i>should</i> wear an N95&#x2F;KN95 mask in public indoor spaces) for the rest of their lives.<p>What&#x27;s happening now is humanity&#x27;s normal.')
