Reminding the proponents of this &quot;solution&quot; that e.g. the people immigrating from Africa to the EU to ask for asylum may be carrying diseases that are not found in the Western world is likely to cause a hardening of the anti-immigration and anti-asylum stance, rather than any support for better hygiene in developing nations.<p>From a national point of view, it&#x27;s simpler to keep homeless people away from rich peoples&#x27; homes than to make sure they don&#x27;t get sick. So the self-interest argument is not really going to work with people who are already doing fine in their self-interest, they thank you.')
