We&#x27;ve come a long way from, &quot;Papa says, &#x27;If you see it in THE SUN it&#x27;s so.&quot;<p>Most (but admittedly not all) reporters and editors I&#x27;ve known have held themselves to the code you mention.  The problem is that it&#x27;s very rare for a reporter or editor to have the final say.  It&#x27;s the publisher who has that prerogative.  And most (but not all) publishers I&#x27;ve met have little sense of that code.  Their job is to make money for their shareholders.
