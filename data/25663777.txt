This was by design, created from the ground up as a long term play.  In its case, it was not a natural shift of narrative influence or a trade-in for the viewer numbers.<p>Rupert Murdock called on Republican political strategist Roger Ailes in 1996 when creating Fox News.  Ailes launched and then ran Fox News as its CEO for decades.<p>This is the same guy who worked as a media adviser to basically every successful Republican presidential campaign.. Nixon, Reagan, Bush.. and even Trump (before Ailes died, and after a sexual misconduct scandal finally got him canned at Fox).<p>Ailes was so influential as a strategist that he was even credited for one of Bush senior&#x27;s wins back in the day.  And he built and reigned at Fox News for 20+ years.<p>So we had a major republican political operator put in charge of a news network by a global political operator (Murdoch) who only got US citizenship as it was a requirement for US television station ownership.  And who had a history of using his media empire to shape political narrative for influence.<p>The frustrating thing is that Murdoch&#x27;s influence shaping has always been more about accumulating power than towards spreading specific ideology.  In Australia in the 60s and 70s, he backed the faction pushing for universal free health care, free college education for all Australians, and public ownership of Australia&#x27;s oil, gas and mineral resources.<p>Sounds very un-Fox-like, doesn&#x27;t it?  It was the in-road to political power, the faction that would get him the most influence by supporting.  There was a write-up some years ago in the UK that delves a bit more into his history (as he has also been peddling influence in the UK for decades as well):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;a-man-of-selfish-loyalties-rupert-murdochs-apparent-overture-to-tony-blair-strikes-a-chilling-chord-1376362.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;a-man-of-selfish-lo...</a><p>But tying this back to Fox News..  he came to the US, built a TV network and used that foundation to build a news station.  This was a push to become a major political controller by building and embedding Fox News as the media arm of the Republican party.<p>They used this to condition their base. The lead-up to today is decades of people turning on FOX to watch Geraldo, sticking around for the news, then wandering off with talking points stuffed into their heads by influencers with an agenda who were presenting the news.<p>And the strategy was so successful that it generates mimics to the model.  The most evil I see is Sinclair Media buying up local news stations and putting the same talking points into the mouths of local pundits across the nation.  There&#x27;s a creepy video compilation that highlights the tactics of this influence machinery by showing clips from each of these local news outlets with different talking heads each repeating the same points.')
