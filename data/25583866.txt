You&#x27;ve replaced buying stuff with buying &quot;experiences&quot;. But that&#x27;s the great thing about experiences - they don&#x27;t have to cost any money at all. A backyard campfire with friends, beer, and good conversation is just as memorable as a meal at a restaurant. And way cheaper to boot.<p>Some of my most cherished experiences have cost a lot. Others have cost very little. It&#x27;s clear that the value of an experience is entirely unrelated to how much we spend on it. The key to avoiding lifestyle inflation is selecting more of the cheaper memorable experiences.<p>The purpose of accumulating wealth (not necessarily into old age) is to have security and freedom. Someone who is financially independent at 45 has way more opportunity to experience life than someone chained to a desk until 65 because they have to pay for their &quot;experiences&quot;.')
