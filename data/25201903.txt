I hope you are doing well in this trying times! We wanted to check in with you because we have noticed that your Productivity Score is not yet excelling yet per COMPANIES NEXT and EXCEL goals for 2020. While it is totally fine that some of our COMPANY family need some additional time to increase their Productivity Score, we would be overjoyed to assist you in reaching COMPANIES goals.<p>We would like to invite you to a meeting tomorrow morning at 8:30. Your direct line manager, you and me will be present for this meeting. We would like you to prepare a short presentation (9-10 minutes) on how you plan to improve your Productivity Score so we, as the COMPANY family can reach our goals. I am sure we can find a solution together!<p>I am looking forward to talking to you tomorrow morning! Have a relaxing evening!<p>Susan from HR')
