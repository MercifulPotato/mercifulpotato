That&#x27;s a bit of a blast from the past.<p>That said, pretty much every programming lang in existence has sax libraries [since this sort of thing was much more common in the 2000s], many of them will transparently handle the utf-16 encoding, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like something to make that much of a fuss over.')
