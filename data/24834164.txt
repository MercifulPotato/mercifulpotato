I don&#x27;t want the minimum requirements of all software to be perfect decentralization, censorship-resistance, 10 different client implementations in Rust, and so on. Just, better than what we have. Nonprofit companies could do a good job of it imo, similar to how we see Wikipedia and the Internet Archive as such forces of good that will not become corrupted by ads, selling data, and the likes.')
