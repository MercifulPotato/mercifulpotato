We basically leave child raising to the state. See how many people are baffled by what to do when they actually have to be around their kids for most of the day because of the pandemic. Better to toss them at a wildly underpaid person for 6 hours a day who has to watch like 30 kids at once, where their main influences are other kids. We wonder what to do to fix society when part of it is &quot;just stop with the dumb things&quot;')
