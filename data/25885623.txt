In that case, other methods (unless you&#x27;re using O_DIRECT, which ads its own difficulties) still have the kernel read a whole page of memory into the page cache before writing the selected bytes.  So, unless you&#x27;re using O_DIRECT for your writes, you&#x27;re still triggering the exact same read-modify-write, it&#x27;s just that with the file APIs you can use async I&#x2F;O or use select&#x2F;poll&#x2F;epoll&#x2F;kqueue, etc. to avoid these necessary reads from blocking your writer thread.')
