It stopped receiving updates from Apple. I actually did try installing the patched Catalina...but it is practically unusable due to system requirements.<p>Installed Linux Mint 18 XFCE a while ago and recently upgraded to 20. Now it runs really well: I can watch YouTube, run VS Code, compile stuff, do some basic statistical analyses, etc.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for Linux, this machine would end up as waste and I would have to buy something new.')
