They only built them to get down their fleet-overall-CO2-value so they can also build another SUV (which are selling like hot cakes and have a huge margin of profit compared to EVs due to tried and tested technology) and still adhere to the limit.<p>Now the first &quot;legacy&quot; manufacturers slowly start to make &quot;proper&quot; EVs for somewhat normal prices. However, they rely on power companies to build (compatible) charging stations. And those power companies are very reluctant because they&#x27;re waiting for more EV customers to hit the streets before building more charging points. Add to that different standards (CCS, CHAdeMO) and nobody feeling responsible to quickly repair broken stations and we have the current situation.<p>Something that shouldn&#x27;t be forgotten: Tesla early on asked other car manufacturers if they wanted &quot;in&quot; on their charging network. But they all refused. (Might change slowly, though.
