However, whenever I move forward and start suggesting solutions to solve the issue, I make diagrams on how a solution could work; it always finishes in them lacking any motivation moving forward in either finding issues with the solution itself or even thinking of how to get it done.<p>Do you know where I can find people with the right mindset? Are there any communities where we&#x27;re safe sharing ideas and designs with people willing to get things done?<p>Loneliness is kill me :)<p>PS: My wife is really supportive, so at least I have that')
