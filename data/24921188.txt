GSR signed the contract with SCL Elections and sold the Kogan app to them. SCL Elections being the parent of Cambridge Analytica.<p>Kogan&#x27;s app was based on the myPersonality app which was developed by Kosinski and Dr David Stillwell who did work at the Psychometrics Lab and denied Kogan access to their dataset. Cambridge Analytica and Cambridge University are not the same thing at all. So there is no comparison to NYU and Cambridge Analytica or Cambridge University for that matter.<p>Saying I&#x27;m &quot;putting a lot of weight on the intention behind this use&quot; is kind of a bizarre statement considering the data is literally available to everybody.

However, weâ€™ll never ask for information that could identify you&quot;<p>And to that end the code for the plugin that the Ad Observatory project is used also freely available:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OnlinePoliticalTransparency&#x2F;social-media-collector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OnlinePoliticalTransparency&#x2F;social-media-...</a><p>How much more transparent can you get than that? The goal of the Ad Observatory project is literally to try to understand how we are being targeted and manipulated. How is this in anyway the same as the secret harvesting of data by a political consultancy that billed itself as providing &quot;election management&quot; services?')
