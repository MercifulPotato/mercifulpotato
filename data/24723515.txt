I have a juicy Stripe story from a friend, but I&#x27;d rather not share all of the details in case anyone from Stripe is here listening.<p>The gist is that I had a friend apply, go through a few interviews, and then just get completely ghosted. After several emails and attempts to reach out, the hiring manager replied to his email with a two word reply when my friend asked about his application status. That reply was &quot;no thanks&quot;.')
