I got glasses at the age of 13, but didn&#x27;t like wearing the glasses, so never did. Both my late father and my sister (since she was about 12 years old) have to wear thick glasses. My sister started out about the same eye power as I did, but she wears her glasses everyday. My sister&#x27;s glasses got thicker year over year, and finally she got LASIK a couple of years ago. My sister doesn&#x27;t work with computers whereas I spend ~10-12 hours a day with computers&#x2F;TV screens (when I use computer, I don&#x27;t wear glasses and my eye doctor told me that&#x27;s okay). For me, my eye power stayed about the same and never got stronger glass prescription over the last 25 years or so.<p>Having said that, I started wearing glasses about a year ago when watching the TV between 10pm-12am (thanks to my wife who likes watching movies and I joined in). Turns out, my eyesight (near-sight) got a bit worse in a year and now I have a slightly thicker glasses. Again, this is all anecdotal and maybe age comes into play here with my eye sight (but the common knowledge--not sure how true that is--is that the nearsightedness gets better as people age, so what I&#x27;m experiencing is the opposite).')
