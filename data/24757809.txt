I have a generic Pixel 4a, $350 off the shelf phone, works great (really - it&#x27;s nice). I&#x27;ve scoured for this setting, where is it located? I can&#x27;t find a setting to change screen resolution available on my device, or even if it&#x27;s possible. It looks great though just the way it is out of the box, I don&#x27;t know the difference either.<p>&gt; Kids in California fail AP tests because they don&#x27;t know what a file format is and try to submit HEIC images to a web form that only takes JPEG and PNG<p>Apple dealt them this card - you&#x27;re blaming people for not knowing that a single vendor has introduced a new (image) format by default which really, nobody else is dealing with (I guess?) the way Apple folks are; is it fair to lay this blame on the kid, or does it really belong to Apple trying to push a standard before it was globally (widespread, 80% of the web) adopted? PNG took <i>years</i> to get into tooling, if you recall - it just didn&#x27;t <i>poof</i> appear, there were many years where JPG and GIF were the only upload formats - in 2020 you&#x27;re now taking PNG for granted. :) Some day HEIC might be there.')
