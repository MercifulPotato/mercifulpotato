If you need to rely on in (meaning that your program breaks if it&#x27;s not applied, as opposed to just being a bit slower), then shouldn&#x27;t the language provide a way to enforce it? That is, the language semantics specifies O(1) memory for tail recursion, for example. If it does not, you are just up for a guessing game and things will break in unexpected ways and moments.')
