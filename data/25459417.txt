I got fired for similar behavior back in 2016. If your company&#x27;s device policy is preventing you from doing your work, talk to your manager, talk about the work on your plate and the way in which the device policy is slowing you down, make sure your manager understands in concrete terms how this affects your estimates, and then -- either you&#x27;ll come to a solution, or you&#x27;ll have to deal with a device policy that slows you down, or you can line up a job elsewhere and resign. Unilaterally breaking the device policy will get you fired, which is a lot more stressful than resigning on a date of your choosing.')
