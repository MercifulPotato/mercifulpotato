Torrent sites frequently track uploads and kick users off that don&#x27;t upload, so it would be tricky for their Terms of Service to make an exception that works for their network and also tries to ensnare these honeypots.<p>And regarding downloading or acquiring or even purchasing: it has never been up to the consumer to know who has the authorization (license) to distribute a work. We just assume Walmart&#x2F;Target&#x2F;Netflix&#x2F;Amazon etc has the rights to sell us whatever we consume. It isn&#x27;t our problem.')
