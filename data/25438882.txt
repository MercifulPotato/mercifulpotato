Some of that point in time information involves the decisions the camera made about the exposure (Active D Light for Nikon... I&#x27;m sure Sony and Canon have their own settings they are saving) that matter for recording metadata about the image capture that go well beyond just the image itself for the purposes of long-term archival.')
