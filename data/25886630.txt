Item(by='lopatin', descendants=1, kids=[25888557, 25888214], score=2, time=1611439934, title='Ask HN: LISPers, do you use homoiconicity (code-as-data)?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='So IMO the biggest reason to use LISP over other languages that also provide first class functions and closures is homoiconicity. On the other hand, when I was using LISPs as my primary language, I found that I wasn&#x27;t using this feature as much as I imagined I would. And when I did, it was arguably superfluous.<p>So my question is two fold:<p>1. Do you have any examples (aside from PL&#x2F;compiler related work) that LISPs code-as-data features are used to solve problems that otherwise would have been much harder?<p>2. Given that you&#x27;ve likely substituted 50,000 lines of Java code with 300 lines of LISP, it goes without saying that you are a lone wolf programmer. But do you, yourself, ever have trouble understanding what you&#x27;ve written after some time? Also, how do your refactors go? Do you do them at all?')
