Lots of people disagreed. They got to vote in a new president, but that one vote is for a whole basket of issues. Not exactly a referendum on the pandemic, more like a decision on which faction&#x2F;ideology will be in control of the federal government until the next election. Calling the pandemic response a democratic decision seems like a bit of a stretch to me.<p>I&#x27;m sure the situation is the same in many of the elections that you linked, most countries are republics, not democracies.<p>Admittedly I wonder about the modern use of the word &quot;democracy&quot; being used to legitimize what was supposed to be a republic, was never meant to be a real democracy, and has drifted into being a plutocracy.')
