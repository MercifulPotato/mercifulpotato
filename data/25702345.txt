And pretty much every single time cmake fails, it does not have ANY log AT ALL of what it did, and why it thinks libfoo is not there.<p>Take autotools. You get EXACTLY what it did, and you see why it failed. With CMake it just goes &quot;you don&#x27;t have X installed&quot;. But I do. It&#x27;s right there. CMake refuses to say under what cmdline or whatever it tried, and what the error was. Just &quot;X IS NOT THERE!&quot;.<p>And then it depends on some version of cmake being installed, which it may not be.<p>I don&#x27;t do windows coding, but shouldn&#x27;t autotools be more viable now that Windows ships with bash?<p>But even if not, CMake stuff <i>as a rule</i> is not even portable between different flavors of Unix, so why even use CMake if it&#x27;s only going to work on Ubuntu more recent than 18.04 or whatever? It&#x27;s not a silly suggestion. OpenBSD generally just has raw Makefiles.')
