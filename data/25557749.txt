For design&#x2F;code reviews this means having coding standards&#x2F;guidelines and training everyone to stick to them â€“ rules of the game are known ahead of time to all participants. Then it is much easier to convince someone that it is objective feedback.<p>A critical skill for a senior engineer in a team is to define and establish such standards for the team. Rather than reacting to each design&#x2F;code review, taking the time to setup these process mechanisms is a lot more productive and healthy for everyone involved.<p>This requires strategic thinking (a skill that comes with practice) towards how you choose to spend your time at work to accomplish anything.')
