Item(by='bombcar', descendants=None, kids=[25927470], score=None, time=1611743752, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926386, text='There&#x27;s a world of difference between Ikea particleboard crap and heirloom furniture - you can make quite useful and durable furniture from pine board; Ikea actually does (though they could stand to spend some time on the design, the IVAR system is BY FAR the worst storage related problem I&#x27;ve ever dealt with; tossed that into the fire and got Uline wire shelves instead).<p>Moving the lifecycle of a piece of furniture from 3-5 years closer to 20 is highly worth it; even if I no longer need it I prefer to leave it on the curb for someone else than have to shove it into the trash can. And these metal shelves will last longer than I will - and can move to the garage if I no longer need them.')
