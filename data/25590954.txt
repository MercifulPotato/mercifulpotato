This isn&#x27;t a crackpot conspiracy; TBH, it makes the belief in multiple races look crackpot. Similarly, by &quot;intersectionality&quot; do you mean the advances in civil-rights law that let us recognize when women of color are being discriminated against? This isn&#x27;t crackpot, but basic set theory being applied by lawyers.<p>Imagine being a country which doesn&#x27;t feed everybody, house everybody, clothe everybody, give health care to everybody, but does have plenty of time to explain how skin color matters a whole lot and can fund police which will enforce skin-color policies. That&#x27;s rightism in a nutshell.')
