The former are even better since you don&#x27;t need to worry about eg. breaking changes if the foss tool uses version control system (you can always git revert to release that worked with what you need to do).<p>I only argue that leaning on paid subscription&#x2F;service-based software for key part of your professional work&#x2F;craft is asking for trouble.')
