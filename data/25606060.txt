Other than the courts and collections agencies.<p>I was under the impression that this was the reason that consumptive loans generally are capped far far lower than mortgages. And have triple their interest rates.<p>While it is true that I can put my university on my credit card, it is very expensive and very rare. I would wager that the majority of these loans are for cars. Which, I agree can create wealth, but it would have been &#x27;better practise&#x27; to buy a cheaper car, and switch when that anticipated wealth has been created.<p>Moreover, those cars explain only part of the loans. The rest is &#x27;bigger tv&#x27; or the likes. And those do not even create wealth.')
