Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25378345], score=None, time=1607607930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373083, text='&gt; haven&#x27;t figured out how to opt out and to not accept<p>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be an easy way. A lot of their proposed opt-outs rely on either disabling cookies browser-wide, installing an extension or creating&#x2F;signing into an account and customizing your advertising preferences there (which means providing them even more info as part of the account creation and relying on their good faith to actually opt you out).<p>To the best of my knowledge none of these things are compliant with the GDPR:<p>* consent must be granular, so browser-wide cookie-blocking doesn&#x27;t comply because disabling cookies entirely means you lose functionality (the GDPR mandates that you can opt-out of non-essential tracking but retain all other functionality)<p>* mandating that people register for an account might run afoul of the &quot;data minimization&quot; principle (among others), meaning that you must collect the minimum amount of data to fulfil the required purpose; asking people to register&#x2F;sign into an account (thus providing even more information) just to opt-out of non-essential tracking seems non-compliant<p>* consent must be opt-in (seems like cookies were placed before the user explicitly agreed to it)<p>* it must be as easy to opt-out as it is to opt-in, yet in Google&#x27;s case the opt-in is one-click away (though it doesn&#x27;t matter since apparently they set cookies even before the user clicks that) but opt-out is way more involved (and relies on reconfiguring the browser)')
