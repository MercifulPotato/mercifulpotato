Safety is a sliding scale that never reaches 100%. If the Max is 99.9999% safe and regulators are demanding they make it at least 99.99991% safe it doesn&#x27;t detract from my point.<p>If other planes received this level of scrutiny, changes would similarly be demanded. The practice of re-badging old models is widespread.<p>I&#x27;m telling you that personally, I&#x27;d exclusively travel on just the Max for the rest of my days and wouldn&#x27;t lose sleep.')
