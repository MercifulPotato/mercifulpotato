Additionally, you are not likely to source work from most big-company product managers. It&#x27;s all about who is in a position to work with vendors in the first place. These will be &quot;ideas&quot; people, people you meet at business school or business-school-lite multidisciplinary design schools, people who themselves may have limited execution capabilities but have the &quot;people skills&quot; to... tell you what the big company wants and how to format your docs and pass their vetting process. People who aren&#x27;t hung up on just telling you like it is - people who aren&#x27;t pedants. People who are the opposite of most engineers.<p>In this respect, startup and big SV jobs will not lead to drowning in freelance work. Go to an exciting grad school, work at a large philanthropy, work in politics, work in research, consulting, etc. - things where you primarily interact with businesspeople who have vendors.')
