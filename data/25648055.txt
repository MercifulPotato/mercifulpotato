I would think it would be mostly linear compared to 2%, 1%, 0%, -1%, etc...<p>For example - if I have a 20 year mortgage on a $240,000 house @ 0%, I have to pay $1,000&#x2F;month.    If the interest rate is -1% then I have to pay ~$900&#x2F;month.  I don&#x27;t know if that extra $100&#x2F;month really moves the market on home prices that much.')
