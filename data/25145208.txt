Item(by='creata', descendants=None, kids=[25145435], score=None, time=1605749639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25144996, text='* The space of multivectors in Rⁿ is actually <i>also</i> a vector space, and it&#x27;s 2ⁿ-dimensional. The standard basis of this vector space (in 2 dimensions) is {1, x, y, x ∧ y = xy}, and that&#x27;s why we care about representing uv in terms of xy. Hopefully that explains why asking how to compute &quot;i = xy&quot; is a meaningless question. By analogy, `(3, 5) = 3x + 5y` in the same way `xy = (0, 0, 0, 1)`, but keeping track of the order of an 2ⁿ-element basis gets annoying really fast, so we just write `xy`.<p>* Yes, span{a, b}.<p>* u ∧ v ∧ w would represent a <i>volume</i> — the one and only 3D subspace of Rⁿ, together with a sign (i.e. an orientation) and a magnitude.<p>* It&#x27;s sin(θ)*i.')
