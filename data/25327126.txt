Regexps tend to be too narrow and produce a lot of noise = <i>false positives</i>, so not terribly actionable.<p>And <i>false negatives</i> (missed info) aren&#x27;t much better either: sensitive data often lives in images, as people&#x27;s profile photos or passport or ID scans, where you must really look at the pixels (OCR rarely helps). Here regexps instafail because they assume input is text.<p>Personal war story: I encountered a bizarre category, sensitive data that&#x27;s <i>true negative</i> which people nevertheless perceive as <i>true positive</i>. Think &quot;specimen (invalid) passports&quot; or &quot;sample (invalid) credit cards&quot;. Not really sensitive (zero risk), but people still expect to see them detected. Creates some funny situations during testing. If you&#x27;re curious, I wrote about it here [0], with some examples.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pii-tools.com&#x2F;how-to-evaluate-pii-discovery&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pii-tools.com&#x2F;how-to-evaluate-pii-discovery&#x2F;</a>')
