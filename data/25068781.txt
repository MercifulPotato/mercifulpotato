People invested in plug-in ecosystems, like DAWs or video editing, will likely have an endless long tail of plug-ins that aren&#x27;t getting ported, or that require a re-purchase to get an ARM version. And due to Rosetta&#x27;s architecture, you can&#x27;t mix ARM and x86 plug-ins (in-process, like VSTs - Apple wants you to use AUv3 which is out of process but nobody does that), so you will be running your <i>entire</i> workflow under emulation until you can make the switch hard and all at once. And some of your  software will never make it.<p>Mark my words, this is going to be a massive shit show for people using those ecosystems, for 5 years if not 10. It already happened with the PPC transition.')
