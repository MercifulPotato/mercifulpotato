So yes, teach people not to take offense, and <i>also</i> teach people not to be offensive. Being offended on someone else behalf helped us get rid of slavery, helped end the holocaust, gave us many of our social programs that support the poor - it&#x27;s not wrong to see injustice and call it out, even if it&#x27;s not happening to you.')
