Stating that there were good, well-meaning people in a crowd of hateful rascists after a woman was killed by a radical maniac is not a helpful statement, and it provides cover for what was, by most decent people&#x27;s assessment, a despicable display of bigotry and hatred.<p>I also do think that commentators are WAY too quick to impart meaning to Trump&#x27;s words in situations like this.  After observing his actions and statements for 4 years, I&#x27;m quite confident that he doesn&#x27;t think much while he speaks.  Words just dribble out in stupid ways &quot;stand back and stand by&quot; comes to mind.  Trump never learned to speak or think with any discipline.  So it&#x27;s like he follows a Markov chain of words -- I can&#x27;t say the phrase you&#x27;ve asked me to say (&quot;stand down&quot;) because that makes me look weak.  However, &quot;back&quot; and &quot;by&quot; follow the word &quot;stand&quot; with high degrees of frequency, so let&#x27;s just go from &quot;stand&quot; to &quot;back&quot;, and then for extra measure (because saying lots of words makes me look smarter), let&#x27;s try another phrase - &quot;stand by&quot;.  No real thought of the meaning behind that.<p>And that&#x27;s one of the biggest points about this individual.  Not only does he have a complete lack of empathy and a complete fixation on himself, he doesn&#x27;t communicate with enough precision to provide real leadership.  No wonder qanon has so much fun searching for hidden meaning in his words; it&#x27;s effectively just word soup, which can lead to all kinds of interesting crazy conclusions.')
