Let&#x27;s skip the brands out of discussion. Client side a-b testing is impossible to be decent. Period. The fact that optimizely built something for react is not a valid argument.<p>Reply to c) Your react app is 30% slower that anything decent. Why would any bussiness owner would ever sign this off to happen in their acquisition funnel(i.e. where user experience is especially crucial)?<p>Reply to d) Decent is ~100% correctness and completeness versus ~70%.<p>Reply to &quot;I guess you think it&#x27;s just the exception that confirms the rule?&quot; -&gt; You keep mentioning companies and brands instead of implementations which suggest you have no experience on the implementation part. That is the thing - facebook does a&#x2F;b testing server-side. And i&#x27;ll just mention that facebook also used react to create their, arguably, second most important project - facebook ads manager. And it&#x27;s a complete &#x27;bollocks&#x27;(using your words) architectural decision to build such tool for react - it&#x27;s a UX as terrible as it can get and i&#x27;ve used it for 5 years and I know at least 100 advertising agency employees who would sign this statement with their sweat and they are one of two. Just to give a counter-argument of the same origin as Yours one.<p>So am very thankful for constructive discussion - all your arguments are fair and well elaborated. Just you can&#x27;t buy any of them. Really hope am not insulting with my strong opinions, always happy to discuss further!')
