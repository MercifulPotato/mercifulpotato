Even bigger than doubling tweet size did.<p>Twitter is defined by tweets not being polished Facebook or LinkedIn posts. Except for people who don&#x27;t use it that way, but they feel artificial to me. I&#x27;d rather all of Twitter not drift that direction.<p>And personally, I love that I <i>can&#x27;t</i> worry about fixing typos. If they&#x27;re bad enough I delete. If not, move on, stay humble and pay more attention next time.')
