That is why they&#x27;re successful. That&#x27;s why they invest in R&amp;D for battery tech, solar panels, software. It&#x27;s all about the mission, in the end.<p>Tesla made the electric car desirable to the masses. That is no small feat. Toyota could have done it years or even decades ago, but they didn&#x27;t. Other traditional car makers could have done it, but chose not to.<p>Now they&#x27;re all on a race to compete against Tesla.<p>But ultimately, the goal shouldn&#x27;t be to have everybody drive an electric car instead of an ICE car. It should be about having less cars on the road, period. It should be about consuming less resources, wasting less resources, period.')
