I’ve been playing on Nvidia GeForce Now (so essentially a high-end PC), and haven’t encountered any major issues. I’d say the game sets a new standard in terms of the level of detail in the environment. The first time you leave your apartment in Night City is simply stunning, probably the only comparison would be the Uncharted series (which was much more linear).<p>Cyberpunk was perhaps the most hyped game of the last year, so no matter what CD released, I expected a strong and polarizing reaction. I agree with their decision to offer refunds, but I think they don’t need to be as apologetic about what was released. The same issues came up years ago with publishers who targeted the PS4&#x2F;Xbox One — Cyberpunk just drew a lot more attention this time around.')
