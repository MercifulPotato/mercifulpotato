Item(by='dwohnitmok', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602803871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24794630, text='Yes that&#x27;s true. However, I view the author&#x27;s conclusions about why certain damages occurred as being fairly weak.<p>Most strikingly none of the primary sources in the article actually describe the action of breaking a nose. More generally, none of the quotes actually describe any of the exact purposes that the article infers, e.g. the breaking a nose <i>so that</i> the spirit cannot breathe or breaking the arms <i>so that</i> the spirit cannot receive an offering.<p>All of this is instead inferred from passages supporting or warning against general defacement as well as post-hoc examination of damage on various statues.<p>You would hope that if this was a widespread and officially sanctioned practice and given generations of defacement and destruction, somewhere someone recorded &quot;yes I cut off this statue&#x27;s nose to make sure that the spirit could not breathe&quot; or the equivalent with some other body part and spiritual function and yet this article at least has no such quote.<p>Of course history is full of gaps and thus it is not entirely unsurprising that there might not be literature describing this even if it were fairly widespread. Nonetheless, its lack makes me quite suspicious of the confidence in which the author describes his very specific conclusions on why certain body parts were damaged the way they were. (The most well-supported one I see so far is the thing with arms and offerings, although that depends heavily on how prevalent it is, e.g. whether this pattern holds for almost all one-armed statues, which the author suggests is true, but I&#x27;m curious about the overall stats on that)<p>EDIT: My suspicions have only increased after my searches on the Internet on this subject all seem to trace back to this Pulitzer Foundation exhibition. Anybody have any other sources to support the specific relationships between destroyed body part and destroyed spiritual function (e.g. no nose so can&#x27;t breathe) as described in this article?')
