Item(by='Matticus_Rex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609191068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562112, text='Monetary theorists don&#x27;t really use the concept of &quot;intrinsic value.&quot; All value is imputed. If something intrinsically has a use, then as long as people value it for that use, the thing will have some imputed value as a basis for trade, which makes it easier for something to go into circulation as a commodity traded for its own sake (and potentially at some point a medium of exchange). Despite examples of other methods of MOE arising, we do <i>also</i> know it can happen that way. Even Graeber&#x27;s Debt thesis is compatible with the idea that the media chosen to mark debts seem to have been things there was a use for and which were circulating for that use.')
