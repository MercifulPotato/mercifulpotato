UK is not part of the schoengen zone and can deny entry to anyone they want to, even EU citizens if it has enough reason to. The only entry points into the country are either by plane, ferry or train, so UK has 100% control and inspection of every person and vehicle coming in and out.<p>But of course the most damning argument against this nonsense is that countries which have this &quot;absolute control&quot; over their immigration have exactly the same levels of criminals coming over. It&#x27;s almost as if criminals aren&#x27;t going to care about regulations, I know, shocking.')
