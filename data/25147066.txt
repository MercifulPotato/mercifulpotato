I learned a few important things that just blocked me from being able to write Sql before.<p>The main thing I needed to change mindset from programming in java style my brain just couldn&#x27;t fit the Sql mindset.<p>Specifically:<p>1. Think of new columns as variables.<p>2. Think of new tables as variables.<p>3. Think of Sql as functions take some input transform put output in a new column (variable) or new table.  And less like a magical big bulk of Sql to pull many data many tables join and output, no, split to functions, to smaller Sql just like functions.<p>4. When writing Sql try to think first as a sequence of functions, doThis, doThat, doThis, then transform each of them to a small Sql query, each result is in a new column, or a new table.<p>With the above steps I can start thinking about how to write Sql that I need, before getting the above concept I had a block, I just could not get how to approach Sql.')
