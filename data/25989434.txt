Item(by='csours', descendants=None, kids=[25989580], score=None, time=1612193153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989199, text='&gt; Over several years, these short trades drove down the price of GME shares to ~$4 per share.<p>People keep saying this, but I just don&#x27;t see how this would work in the real world.<p>NOTE: I am not a financial professional, what follows is my meager understanding. Please feel free to correct me with facts and information.<p>Here&#x27;s how it COULD work, but DID NOT work: Hedge funds short so much stock, SO QUICKLY that the increase in virtual inventory drives the share price down. Here&#x27;s why it DID NOT work that way: The hedge funds did not actually do this. They kept their short position open expecting GME to go to 0.<p>In fact, if hedge funds DID attempt this, it would certainly be market manipulation, which is something the SEC definitely watches for, especially when large players do it.<p>People keep saying things like predatory shorts drove the price down. As far as I can tell, these hedge funds told a story about why they though GME would go bankrupt. In turn, someone started a story about how this particular trade by these particular hedge funds was EVIL, which is just zany to me.<p>----<p>I do think that Hedge Funds and Traders accumulate too much money for themselves. I don&#x27;t think the GME trade is a particularly good way to fix this. There are plenty of other Hedge Funds out there.')
