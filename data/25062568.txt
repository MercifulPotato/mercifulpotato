I just never used Windows (or the web!) until well past the Netscape era, so I&#x27;m not too familiar with the intersection of modems and early web browsers.<p>&gt; Netscape had integration with the modem connectivity for the OS and would initiate a connection when you tried to visit a remote page.<p>That&#x27;s not &quot;integration with modem connectivity&quot;, that&#x27;s just going through the OS&#x27;s socket API (or userland socket stack, e.g. Trumpet Winsock); where the socket library dials the modem to serve the first bind(2). Sort of like auto-mounting a network share to serve a VFS open(2).<p>Try it yourself: boot up a Windows 95 OSR2 machine with a (configured) modem, and try e.g. loading your Outlook Express email. The modem will dial. It&#x27;s a feature of the socket stack.<p>These socket stacks would also automatically hang up the modem if the stack was idle (= no open sockets) for long enough.<p>My point was that a quiescent HTML4 browser <i>has</i> no open sockets, whether or not it&#x27;s intentionally &quot;offline.&quot; If you do as you say — load up a bunch of pages, and then sit there reading them — your modem <i>will</i> hang up, whether or not you play with Netscape&#x27;s toggles.<p>(On single-tasking OSes like DOS — where a TCP&#x2F;IP socket stack would be a part of a program, rather than a part of the OS —  there was software that would eagerly hang up the modem whenever its internal socket refcount dropped to zero. But this isn&#x27;t really a useful strategy for a multitasking OS, since a lot of things — e.g. AOL&#x27;s chatroom software presaging AIM — would love to poll <i>just</i> often enough to cause the line that had just disconnected to reconnect. Since calls were charged per-minute rather than per-second, these reconnects had overhead costs!)<p>&gt; [Netscape&#x27;s] offline mode let you disable automatic dialing of the modem.<p>When you do... what?<p>When you first open the browser, to avoid loading your home page? (I guess that&#x27;s sensible, especially if you&#x27;re using Netscape in its capacity as an email client to read your already-synced email; or using it to author and test HTML; or using it to read local HTML documentation.)<p>But I think you&#x27;re implying that it&#x27;s for when you try to navigate to a URL in the address bar, or click a link.<p>In which case, would the page, in fact, be served from the client-side cache, or would you just get nothing? (Was HTTP client-side caching even a <i>thing</i> in the early 90s? Did disks have the room to <i>hold</i> client-side caches? Did web servers by-and-large <i>bother</i> to send HTTP&#x2F;1.0 Expires and Last-Modified headers? Etc.)')
