How wrong do political polls need to get before we start laughing at them?<p>Yeah, QAnon is a real shame.<p>But that&#x27;s an interesting thing for you to say. I agree, it&#x27;s a shame the black republicans that were running for congress didn&#x27;t win. But they didn&#x27;t lose to... white republicans. They lost to democrats.
