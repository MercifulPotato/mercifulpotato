I started building in last January with great momentum, but the pandemic made things a bit complicated.<p>As someone that built a dozen of SaaS in the last decades, there were some aspects of the backend I was bored of rewriting. User management is probably the major one.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Firebase and admit I found it interesting for 4-5 days, but as a Go backend developer, it did not suit my need&#x2F;taste.<p>Why not try something just for me. At first, I called it &quot;ezbackend&quot; and built a dirty prototype in Node. I played with rewriting it in Go and started to like where it was headed. In January 2020, I thought that it might interest others, so I renamed the project, made it more rebust, and kept adding the minimal feature sets I personally wanted.<p>I&#x27;m now near the v1 &#x2F; official launch, and I&#x27;d like to get some thoughts. I know it&#x27;s not for everyone. To be perfectly honest, I&#x27;m not 100% clear who might be interested, but I&#x27;m excited enough to build side projects on top of it, it&#x27;s enough for me to build it.<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated.')
