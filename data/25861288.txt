The costs for one single item, in the case of AWS this is one hour of computing, is incredibly low, parts of a cent - but most people out there are not able to do simple maths like multiplication (by 720, the number of hours in a month) or summation (with the costs of the other services you have to implicitly use).\nWhen hosting a simple one-node Kubernetes cluster the costs are easily at a three-figure number per month - the fees for EKS, the fee for the EC2 node, the fee for the inbound load balancer, the fee for storage, ... compared to a root server for $10 that easily outperforms a $60 EC2 instance that&#x27;s really overpriced.')
