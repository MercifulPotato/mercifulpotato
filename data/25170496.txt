The way he did that is actually quite interesting (including the odd ownership structure he had to navigate) and he has lots of interesting things to say. But few people say only interesting things.<p>And when generally interesting people say some incredibly boring things, people treat them as still interesting in some weird afterglow of the other things.<p>So this post is entirely halofied by his other stuff. This is self help guru shit. Which is fine, right? He&#x27;s writing the blog perhaps for himself and we may not be the intended audience. But that&#x27;s what it is.')
