So this reporting on Crypto AG as well as this company can be seen as a criticism that the Swiss government failed to uphold its principles of neutrality, or perhaps (depending on the degree to which the government was involved or aware or not) that the companies were getting a benefit from the international perception of the famous Swiss neutrality while <i>themselves</i> having political dealings with particular governments.<p>I think Snowden also mentions in his autobiography that, because there is so much international activity and discussion in Switzerland, other countries&#x27; spy agencies also like to spy on Switzerland and goings-on there -- including him when he was working for the CIA. People who are trying to rely on Switzerland&#x27;s neutrality might hope that Switzerland succeeds in deterring much of that spying activity, and at least doesn&#x27;t participate in, condone, or encourage it.')
