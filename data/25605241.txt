Google doesn&#x27;t use Leetcode for interviews (at least as of 2018).<p>I&#x27;d be <i>extremely</i> surprised if Jeff Dean (at any point in his employment) would fail a SWE interview loop at Google. The Google interview is heavily based on data structures and algorithms, and Jeff Dean likely knows them cold.<p>Sure there&#x27;s always a degree of luck, and Google errs on the side of false negatives, but there are certain people that are so high above the hiring bar that luck becomes too tiny a factor to be relevant.')
