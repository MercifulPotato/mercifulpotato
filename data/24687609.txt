They just have to understand one fact: they don&#x27;t actually own what they&#x27;re spending their money on.<p>I told them, they understood and they didn&#x27;t care.<p>&gt; Who do you think is going around and warning all these people, in such a way that they can reasonably understand the implications of what is being said, about the risks that come with these kinds of technologies?<p>Me. I used to tell everyone I know. It was useless.<p>&gt; Now, if you were arguing that governments should be regulating these industries, mandating information for customers about the risks and prohibiting abusive behaviours by content providers, then I&#x27;d be the first to agree with you.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I generally agree with this. Actually I have a radical opinion: copyright should be abolished and it should be illegal to implement DRM in any form.<p>This doesn&#x27;t change the fact that these people cannot be helped. They want their pleasure and if you&#x27;re pointing out issues you&#x27;re just getting in their way. They absolutely deserve to be blamed if their accounts get banned and they lose everything.')
