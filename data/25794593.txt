Apps where if both like each other there&#x27;s a 80 to 90 percent chance you will actually start conversing, getting to know each other, talking offline and going on a date or dates.<p>In my experience...Facebook Dating is just a like factory in which people aren&#x27;t seriously looking rather boosting their ego or have a huge list to filter through even if they liked you the conversations doesn&#x27;t go far(I only continue a conversation if she asks about me too). It&#x27;s definitely not a dating app to find women who are serious about dating.<p>Overall during Covid I&#x27;ve had more dates then usual.  Women are out there looking and dating at least here in the suburbs&#x2F;rurual areas of MD and PA; restaurants are open for outside and inside dining.')
