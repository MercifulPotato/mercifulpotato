Item(by='patcon', descendants=None, kids=[25515241], score=None, time=1608700426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25510348, text='&gt; requires government to solve as it is a public goods problem<p>Your comment makes me think of Ostrom&#x27;s Nobel-winning work on governing [natural] commonses[1]. The framework she developed over 40 years makes a case that public goods problems are often misunderstood, and often created by government. Gov does this under the guise of ostensibly attempting to support management of the shared resource, but is likely just trying to render the landscape into a format legible to gov itself. It abstracts away the power and ability to both monitor &amp; enforce, among other things.<p>Her framework says collective stewardship of common-pool resources is possible under ~8 clear guiding properties: (we need to read creatively to think how this generalizes to digital commonses like the internet and data trusts)<p>1A. User Boundaries: Clear and locally understood boundaries between legitimate users\nand nonusers are present.<p>1B. Resource Boundaries: Clear boundaries that separate a specific common-pool resource\nfrom a larger social-ecological system are present.<p>2A. Congruence with Local Conditions: Appropriation and provision rules are congruent\nwith local social and environmental conditions.<p>2B. Appropriation and Provision: Appropriation rules are congruent with provision rules;\nthe distribution of costs is proportional to the distribution of benefits.<p>3. Collective Choice Arrangements: Most individuals affected by a resource regime are\nauthorized to participate in making and modifying its rules.<p>4A. Monitoring Users: Individuals who are accountable to or are the users monitor the\nappropriation and provision levels of the users.<p>4B. Monitoring the Resource: Individuals who are accountable to or are the users monitor\nthe condition of the resource.<p>5. Graduated Sanctions: Sanctions for rule violations start very low but become stronger\nif a user repeatedly violates a rule.<p>6. Conflict Resolution Mechanisms: Rapid, low cost, local arenas exist for resolving conflicts among users or with officials.<p>7. Minimal Recognition of Rights: The rights of local users to make their own rules are\nrecognized by the government.<p>8. Nested Enterprises: When a common-pool resource is closely connected to a larger\nsocial-ecological system, governance activities are organized in multiple nested layers.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.pdx.edu&#x2F;~nwallace&#x2F;EHP&#x2F;OstromPolyGov.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.pdx.edu&#x2F;~nwallace&#x2F;EHP&#x2F;OstromPolyGov.pdf</a><p>(anyhow, hopefully this seems interesting, but pls disregard if not :) )')
