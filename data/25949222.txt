Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything less. I say this because 2% drawdown of the stock market didn&#x27;t happen for zero reason. It happened because these fools are leveraged up to their ass (metaphor) and the bet cost them severely. And it&#x27;s cheaper to take the bad PR while salvaging your fuck up. These people act in a different set of rules and that&#x27;s not okay.<p>IMHO, I&#x27;m concerned about this because this is a 1st amendment problem. Let grown adults gamble. Let them be responsible for their dumb actions (hedge and retail alike). If someone is &#x27;too big to fail&#x27; then they are &#x27;too big to exist&#x27;.')
