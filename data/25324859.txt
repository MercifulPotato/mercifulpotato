Diem&#x2F;Libra is built on Cosmos, which is a proof-of-stake system, not a proof-of-work system. Validator nodes in a proof-of-stake system do not compete to work ever harder to mine the same resources.<p>There are a rather large <i>number</i> of such validator nodes (100+ at minimum), but that&#x27;s also true of banks when you translate their Highly-Available mainframe stacks into equivalent Highly-Available commodity-PC stacks.
