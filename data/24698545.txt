I had a patent lawsuit filed against my company in Texas (we are entirely based in California) that was very distracting and slowed down our innovation. What was the lawsuit over? A BS patent that was used in dozens of other lawsuits claiming ownership over the process of selling things online. Patents should be completely eliminated, all they are is an artificial restriction on trade that leaves bad monopolies in place. If we aren&#x27;t going to ban patents, we should at least add very heavy penalties on BS patents and patent trolls to discourage the worst abuses that have become commonplace. And judges like Albright should be disbarred and possibly even criminally prosecuted.')
