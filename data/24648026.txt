We didn&#x27;t want an MPV or SUV.<p>I&#x27;ve been happy with a &quot;Compact MPV&quot; (which I think is what the class is called). Currently Toyota Verso, previously VW Touran. Both fit 3 child seats in the rear. But it seems the compact MPV class is on its way out (e.g. Toyota doesn&#x27;t produce the Verso anymore), everybody for some unexplainable reason wants a SUV nowadays.')
