I own the device that I buy, I knew how to turn off these controls and didn’t bother during the outage, and I generally refuse to do so. In return, I don’t have to deal with all the weaknesses of the liberated computing approach that you frame as the only optimal outcome.<p>Apple’s restrictions liberate me from having to spend time on fully-liberated computing. I’m glad liberated computing exists, but the idealistic view that all computing should be that way is harmful to my life’s priorities.')
