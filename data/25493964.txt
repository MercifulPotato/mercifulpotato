I maintain a list of lisp-flavored languages [0], so I will add Cakelisp there.<p>How did you implement the macro expansion? Are you translating the macros to C&#x2F;C++, then compile it with C&#x2F;C++ compiler and execute the temporary binary or do you have an interpreter for that?<p>I work on a somewhat similar project called Liz, which is basically a lisp-flavored dialect of Zig [1]. I did not implement user-defined macros yet, planning to learn more about comptime and its limitations first. But the compiler itself uses macro-expansion to implement many features.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dundalek&#x2F;awesome-lisp-languages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dundalek&#x2F;awesome-lisp-languages</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dundalek&#x2F;liz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dundalek&#x2F;liz</a>')
