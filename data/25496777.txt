Item(by='iaw', descendants=None, kids=[25498392], score=None, time=1608570028, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496032, text='&gt;  I go to a school infamous for its high price. And truth be told, I donâ€™t think I could advocate going here barring some serious prerequisites.<p>I went to a similar school. The benefits are not granted when you attend the school but afterward in the alumni network and the reputation of the school.  I get in a lot more doors than I rightfully should given my qualifications because my school was more expensive (and thus prestigious) than most.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be the way it is but the benefits from getting a &#x27;top-tier&#x27; education are more in signaling to people that they should consider you than actually giving you a better education.  There&#x27;s also the argument about the access you have as a student and alumni but I don&#x27;t want to go on forever.')
