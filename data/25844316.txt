There is no good replacement here because the term was tied to this new kind of infrastructure really early. But anytime I hear someone repeat &quot;of course serverless does not mean there is no server!&quot; I die a little more.<p>Naming things is hard but at least we ought to try to come up with terms that are not blatantly misleading.')
