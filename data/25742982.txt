Essentially, if the behavior of one customer does not impact another customer (directly) then the service&#x2F;business should stay out of the matter.<p>Twitter and Facebook have to sell ads to make a profit which means keeping their platforms &#x27;ad-friendly&#x27; and they are also designing everything about the site from the colors to the user experience. So it makes sense for them to moderate or even restrict content to even an arbitrary degree.<p>However, dumb service providers like GoDaddy and AWS make a profit and are designed around providing (generic mostly) services. When they step in to moderate content beyond what is necessary for legal purposes, it really undermines the whole institution of free speech. I think that in the case of GoDaddy is especially worrisome since DNS ought to be a impartial service and not an adjudicator of morality. At least AWS is 99% commodity and not a top down institution like DNS.<p>Personally, although I don&#x27;t need to use it, I prefer nearlyfreespeech.net [1] for my domain name and minor hosting needs. Nearlyfreespech.net (NFSN) offers hosting&#x2F;DNS for anything that is legal in the US (maybe some exceptions [2]). And NFSN offers no-frills DNS &amp; hosting management as well as the best account security I have seen from any site. The prices are reasonable and very simple.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nearlyfreespeech.net&#x2F;help&#x2F;abuse#offensive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nearlyfreespeech.net&#x2F;help&#x2F;abuse#offensive</a>\n[2] Looks like the ToS includes any ToS that NFSN has to adhere to as well so it&#x27;s possible that an upstream domain registrar could exert pressure on NFSN... not sure how likely that is.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nearlyfreespeech.net&#x2F;help&#x2F;abuse#offensive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nearlyfreespeech.net&#x2F;help&#x2F;abuse#offensive</a>')
