Both modifications will require retraining some muscle memory.<p>The staggered layout is a remnant of typewriters, since there was no other way to create room for the bars that connect the key to the hammers.<p>Computer keyboards don&#x27;t have this restriction.<p>Switching from a staggered to ortholinear keyboard took me all of a day to adapt-to, and I still regularly use a staggered keyboard on a regular basis with no hardship (when I take my laptop from my desk)')
