In fact, the source cited (by the source they cite) says that Dunkin&#x27; specifically says that their L-cysteine comes from duck feathers, which is apparently another natural source.<p>&gt; <i>The L-cysteine in several items offered at Dunkin&#x27; Donuts is also derived from duck feathers</i><p>from: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrg.org&#x2F;nutshell&#x2F;faqingredients.htm#cystine" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vrg.org&#x2F;nutshell&#x2F;faqingredients.htm#cystine</a>')
