It&#x27;s kind of crap, but it works and is ubiquitous.<p>I&#x27;m kind of surprised it isn&#x27;t still a thing in Europe. Did cell phones just not take off until the mid 2000s when there were other options available.. so MMS didn&#x27;t have the inertia it has in the US? It is pretty ingrained here, for example all take out services use MMS to give you order status and, AFAIK, they don&#x27;t support other messaging systems.')
