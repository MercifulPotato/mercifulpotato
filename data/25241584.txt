Which would be enough to work. It&#x27;s actually exactly it, but with the extra precaution of wrapping the entire page inside a noscript tag. Hilarious. I guess it&#x27;s useful to avoid having a chance to see the content during a flash, before the script executes.<p>A good contrast with web pages which are not apps telling you &quot;This app requires Javascript to run&quot;.')
