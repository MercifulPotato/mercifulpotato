For measles it is estimated to be in the mid-90%. For some other threats it might be as low as 50%. Over time, we have come to better understand how infectious covid is and one would naturally expect that to impact many aspects of prediction including when we might reach herd immunity.<p>That said, we are not drug mules that need to have the reality of what is in front of us hidden so we can stomach one more baggie of bad news. People need to be told the truth and that kind of straight talk has been sorely lacking in American leadership.<p>Fauci is just a byproduct of the current American reality. If he thinks that the required rate is 85% he should have said so and not tried to sugar coat this as some leaders are want to do. I like him, but I don&#x27;t want to be in a situation where I am ever second guessing if experts are deceiving the public even if they think it is for our own good. This just fuels the conspirator&#x27;s fire.')
