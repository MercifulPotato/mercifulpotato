Free speech rights exist to protect the most offensive speech. It doesn&#x27;t exist to protect popular benign speech.<p>This is what so many people here, mostly foreigners without a doubt, don&#x27;t understand. If you find something offensive or hateful, that&#x27;s what free speech exists to protect. If it doesn&#x27;t, free speech rights are worthless.')
