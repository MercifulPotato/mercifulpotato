And a TOE is precisely a unified treatment of the standard model forces and gravity.<p>The measurement problem isn&#x27;t a physics thing, just like naturalness that&#x27;s more of a life-style choice. In fact, the only reason to have problems with wave-function collapse is precisely a naturalness reasoning, technically it makes very accurate predictions just fine.')
