Posting anon here for obvious reasons, but there are different types of jobs. Some jobs reward you with equity, some reward you with promotions, and some are <i>dead end jobs.</i> Even many senior positions are dead end jobs.<p>I work at an A-round startup. Tons of people in FP&amp;A, sales, accounting, and HR get promoted every six months. Engineers rarely get promoted. No refreshers. No raises.<p>Guess what? Engineers are now clocking out at 4pm, they are working on side projects, and it is the most rational thing to do.<p>On the flip side, I&#x27;ve worked at places where engineers are rewarded regularly for outstanding work. It makes sense to focus on your job.<p>On size advice does not fit all.')
