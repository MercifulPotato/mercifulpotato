Him debunking psychics, talking about religion and faith, talking about magic, the works.  I got so obsessed with him, that I found his website, and sent a very generic &quot;fan email&quot; to him, saying that I respect what he did, and think that he should keep up the good work.<p>Much to my surprise, he responded with a very quick &quot;thank you!&quot; message.  I told my dad about this, and since we lived in Orlando at the time, and Randi was in Fort Lauderdale, he suggested we ask to buy Randi lunch.  I figured there was no harm in sending the email, and much to my surprise, Randi agreed!<p>We drove over to Fort Lauderdale, and he actually spent the whole damn day with us, talking about psychics, doing magic tricks for us, talking about science fiction novels, etc.  He was an incredibly awesome guy, and I thought it was beyond cool that he decided to hang out with some dorky fans from the internet.<p>RIP Randi.  You made the world a better place, and you will always be missed.')
