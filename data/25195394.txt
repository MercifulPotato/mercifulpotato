It&#x27;s really hard to talk about comparisons between the past and present and try to boil it down to a single metric.<p>Many years ago, a friend and I were talking and I was making sort of the same argument you are making -- that things are better than they used to be. And she stopped and said something like &quot;I&#x27;m not comparing it to the past. I&#x27;m comparing it to what I think is possible given present day knowledge and technology.&quot;<p>And she also said something about &quot;low standards&quot; or &quot;low expectations&quot; -- like &quot;Why should we settle for this crap just because the past was worse?&quot;<p>And that really stuck with me.<p>I have gotten off all drugs for a condition where that isn&#x27;t supposed to be possible and that strongly shapes my views and opinions in ways that I can&#x27;t back up with studies or the like to the satisfaction of other people. But I&#x27;m convinced we can raise the bar and do better than this and one path forward is to begin thinking more broadly about the fact that &quot;life is chemistry&quot; and stop acting like a pill is the most important and powerful means to interact with human biochemistry when it&#x27;s really just one of the most convenient ways to manipulate biochemistry that is profitable in our current economic arrangements.')
