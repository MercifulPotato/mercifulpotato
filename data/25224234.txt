That can wipe out an entire country or possibly the whole human race. I don&#x27;t think this is possible biologically.<p>&quot;Killing the host&quot; is not some natural thing that happens with Viruses. It&#x27;s a complex process of immune system + dosage. It&#x27;s not like virus has any evolutionary interest in demobilizing the host. It goes against the evolutionary pressure.
