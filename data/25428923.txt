It is much harder to focus and succeed when you&#x27;re trying to push yourself down a path you think is probably fruitless.<p>This is actually the big one.  Validation that they are making progress allows people to go back to banging on a problem.<p>If one of my senior engineers claims to be stuck on some technical problems and comes to me asking for extra technical advice, we&#x27;re probably going to spend some time digging at things.  That&#x27;s the realm of sounding board.<p>However, I may have given an assignment to an intern specifically so that they will go learn something that I think they need to learn by working it out.  If they come to me, I&#x27;ll give them some limited advice, validate their progress to this point, but I&#x27;m probably going to send them back and tell them to bang their head on it some more.  One of the lessons junior engineers need to learn is &quot;Sometimes the senior guys don&#x27;t actually know the answer and part of your work is actually <i>figuring it out</i>.&quot;<p>And sometimes the task really is just a slog.  Too many junior engineers think everything can be made &quot;easy and quick&quot; like a textbook question.  However, if someone is slogging via brute force and comes to me I&#x27;ll look at it and say something like: &quot;Yup, you seem to be going the right way.  And it looks like you&#x27;re about 10% done.  Keep going.&quot;<p>The validation that they&#x27;re not going down a blind path is the most important thing.')
