This pains me to no end. We’ve been given a near-magical metal (see XKCD, “Plutonium”) but we’re too... base to manufacture and use it appropriately.<p>I’m butchering it, but the quote that keeps coming back to me is, “Nuclear is a 22nd-century solution to a 20th-century problem.”<p>If you’re into fate and religious stuff, I have a suspicion it was deliberately dangled in front of us as the one way to conquer interstellar space, if we can maturely manage the material itself.')
