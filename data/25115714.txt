The mortality rate for the vit D group was not really all that great.<p>On the flip side, given that they comparison group were receiving vit D3 occasionally, just not lately, it is possible that this underestimates the impact of vit D3 on a group that had long-term insufficient vit D3.<p>Nothing here to say that vit D isn&#x27;t good for you, especially if you have a deficiency (such as from insufficient time in the sun), but not a stunning piece of info either.')
