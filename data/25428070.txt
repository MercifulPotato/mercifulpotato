It is horrible for the environment and horrible for the body (an aspect totally ignored in this article). And yet it has become near ubiquitous. Living in a big European city I can for instance buy 30+ types of margarine at my regular supermarket. But every single one is full of palm oil. Even supposedly healthy ones based on olive oil (looking at you Bertoli) are to a large degree palm. Even the bio&#x2F;organic shop has nothing. It&#x27;s nearly as bad for chocolate, spreads, cakes, veggie or non veggie charcuterie, ... Anything that&#x27;s not a standardised&#x2F;pure product is just palm.<p>2 years ago it was perfectly possible to avoid palm. Today I basically don&#x27;t see any chance. Even organic and supposedly ethical products are full of palm, just under the pretense of some certification that sums up to &#x27;the forest was killed 10 years ago so we are now able to call ourselves sustainable while the problem is shifted somewhere else&#x27;.<p>Our food systems seem fundamentally broken. Unless I buy basics at the local market and cook everything from scratch I basically have to eat palm, glutamate, bamboo fibre, gelatine and whatnot other waste every day.')
