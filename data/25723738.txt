It&#x27;s just a no-brainer to let the customer keep a broken comb instead of making them return it. Shipping costs, people who receive the package cost, opening and inspecting the packaging costs and just processing that return costs a lot.   Almost everybody has access to a phone with a very decent camera, that&#x27;s enough to prove a product was broken on arrival.')
