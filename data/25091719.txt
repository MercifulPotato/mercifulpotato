For example, in the US we have criminalized: walking across the street in various circumstances, riding a bike (on the wrong part of the street, without a helmet, on the sidewalk, without a light), spitting, cursing, being loud, driving too fast, driving too slow, and a million other things. Thereâ€™s basically 0 chance of any person living an entire day and not breaking some sort of minor law. This is repeatedly used in the US to justify things like stop and frisk of minorities.')
