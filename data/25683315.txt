Therefore the way that PGP&#x27;s lack of perfect forward secrecy is a feature is that it allows an encrypted message to be generated in a way that doesn&#x27;t require two-way real-time communication, and can therefore be sent by email.<p>The trade-off is that you then don&#x27;t have perfect forward secrecy.')
