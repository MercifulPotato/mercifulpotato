Switching job would presumably require more work from me at least temporarily. I&#x27;d perhaps need to commute initially at least, for example.<p>I&#x27;d like to know this: if I got 2x the pay in the US, could I instead ask to work  1&#x2F;2 and get the current pay level I have?<p>Most likely no, right? So in what way is that higher pay actually helping me pursue passions? I&#x27;d be working at least as much as I do now, and most likely more, for that money.<p>When exactly are those passions supposed to be pursued? When retiring? I&#x27;m pursuing that now. I have had 6-8weeks off in summer the last 10 years. I like to travel, etc.')
