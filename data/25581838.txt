Only the poor people have to store their wealth in cash because they don&#x27;t have enough of it to buy a diversified range of assets, and the short term risk is unbearable to them (while rich people will simply hodl a little longer). Additionally, poor people usually don&#x27;t have the means to renegotiate their salaries often enough to keep up with inflation, much less to beat it.')
