We actually ran a second, unpublished, test into Timescale Forge from the same client(s) that we tested Timestream with. We did this second TimescaleDB test just to see if something was wrong with our EC2 instances or setup in other way. So, completely separate service offering with no VPC or anything - just a raw PSQL connection from client to server. The Timescale Forge instance was 1&#x2F;4 the specs of the DO server from the published results (again, the intent wasn&#x27;t to replicate the TimescaleDB tests all over again), and it still easily achieved 1.2 million&#x2F;sec ingest from the same client computer where Timestream only achieved ~525 metrics&#x2F;sec.')
