In other PDF readers, this is quite harmless. In Preview, it starts editing the PDF. 99.9% of the time I have zero interest in editing or annotating the PDF I am reading. And then when I quit it asks me if I want to save a copy. I never wanted to change it to begin with!<p>(Maybe it is time I found another PDF reader...)')
