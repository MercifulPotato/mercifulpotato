I met him in Austria where he gave a training on OsmocomBB (2010? Found the link [0]) and blew me away with his acquired knowledge of GSM. I worked for a large European mobile provider and it was very uncommon to meet people outside of that bubble to be interested, let alone knowledgeable about the domain.<p>Mind you, at that time there where hardly or no easy accessible &amp; readable write-ups on the subject. Piles and piles of badly formatted and cryptic worded PDF&#x27;s had to be obtained, read and understood. He did it.<p>Remember, this was in the same year Karsten Nohl gave his BlackHat presentation on cracking A5&#x2F;1. Exciting times :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepsec.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Slides&#x2F;2010&#x2F;DeepSec_2010_OsmocomBB.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepsec.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Slides&#x2F;2010&#x2F;DeepSec_2010_OsmocomBB....</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srlabs.de&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;100729.Breaking.GSM_.Privacy.BlackHat1-1.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srlabs.de&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2010&#x2F;07&#x2F;100729.Breaking...</a>')
