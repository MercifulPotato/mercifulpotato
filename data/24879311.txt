The goal is to meet a deadline sooner, and there is absolutely no intention of spending resources to fix it later, unless the customers start making too many tickets.<p>When a manager says &quot;later&quot; or &quot;low priority&quot;, it usually means &quot;never, unless we absolutely have to&quot;. Technical debt is always a &quot;low priority&quot; that will be addressed &quot;later&quot;.<p>Yes, there are situations when meeting a specific deadline is critical, and it is a rational decision to cut some corners and fix things later. The problem is that after the deadline is met, the &quot;fix things later&quot; part is usually forgotten. A new deadline is set, and new corners need to be cut, etc.')
