There&#x27;s the old saying &quot;don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broken.&quot; I think there&#x27;s plenty of arguments to make that it is broken, but there are plenty to say it isn&#x27;t. There are different views on this held by different people and different countries. Some would say break it up so it isn&#x27;t too big to fail. Others say it is the size that allows it to do so well. Unfortunately the nature of the conversation is extremely complex and often these discussions turn reductionist.')
