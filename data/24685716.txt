Which free&#x2F;cheap&#x2F;reasonably priced dominant OS died while its platform was still alive?<p>zOS is still the dominant OS for mainframes (60 years later!), MS-DOS was replaced by a product from the same company, Windows, that is still the dominant OS for desktops (30 years later). I don&#x27;t see anything on the horizon that threatens zOS, nor Windows. Except their platforms disappearing, which is still at least 10-20 years from happening.<p>iOS is the dominant OS for its platform and Apple won&#x27;t abandon it until the platform dies (I guess once we have wearables that completely replace smartphones?), Android is the dominant OS for all other smartphones. Microsoft poured billions into creating a smartphone app ecosystem and failed. Blackberry, Palm, Nokia, Amazon tried and failed. How, pray tell, would Android die if smartphones are still popular? The Google moat is HUGE.')
