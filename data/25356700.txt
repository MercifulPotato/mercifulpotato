On the operating system front, it&#x27;s Linux-only at this point. And the &quot;Linux community&quot; has completed its long way to the dark side, with RedHat paying devs to subvert the portability Unix&#x2F;POSIX has always stood for, with systemd and the rush to containers. For a perspective, consider Docker was originally a way to equalize distro-specific libs and quirks; RedHat and Kubernetes essentially deprecating Docker (and adding unbelievable amounts of code to replace it as infrastructure) just means a central entity calls the shots now. When the problem of non-uniform libs is entirely created by RedHat and too many distros themselves. In reality, starved core F&#x2F;OSS packages haven&#x27;t changed in a decade or more. But enterprise cloud deals are just too sweet, so change for change&#x27;s sake it is. In that context, it makes sense that RedHat has shutdown CentOS now.<p>On the web, it&#x27;s even worse. There are no &quot;browser vendors&quot; except Google and Apple left, and Google is gatekeeping so-called web standards. Recently, HTTP and DNS is up for grabs as well. Hail monopolies.')
