We&#x27;re seeing this more and more with social media and &quot;anyone can publish&quot; combined with the speed of the internet.    Sure, the truth may eventually win out regarding whether or not drinking bleach is a good idea, but several people have gotten badly hurt and&#x2F;or died before the &quot;truth won out&quot;.
