And it didn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; And for 20 years since it has been sufficient to invoke the name to scare away any attempt of actually trying something new, even when they don&#x27;t make the same mistakes, or even work anything like Itanium.<p>People have been invoking Itanium for the last 20 years because that&#x27;s what you do with expensive, painful lessons. Just like &quot;branch delay slots are bad&quot; (MIPS et al) or &quot;no sub-word-size-access is bad&quot; (Alpha) or &quot;there&#x27;s such a thing as too-relaxed memory ordering&quot; (Alpha) or &quot;putting too much magic in the ISA is bad&quot; (iAPX 432), some lessons don&#x27;t need to be repeatedly revisited and repeated.<p>I get that the Mill team wants to prove everyone wrong, but the only way to show that is working hardware and that doesn&#x27;t exist (and given the time they&#x27;ve been working, probably won&#x27;t ever).<p>&gt; compatibility with standard C code is a huge crutch; GPUs couldn&#x27;t exist in that environment for example<p>Except, guess what, Cuda and OpenCL look exactly like C in many ways. The major features they don&#x27;t support (well) are dynamic memory allocations and branchy code - good luck trying to make an architecture work that can&#x27;t efficiently handle malloc. People have tried a lot of different language+hardware architectures over the years, and all of them have been outperformed by OoO machines.<p>&gt; compatibility with the dominant paradigm, running stock x86 code<p>If either Transmeta or Nvidia could have made a standout VLIW architecture, they would have had plenty of business. Defense and HPC customers have absolutely no problem with esoteric architectures so long as the performance is good enough. You could build the craziest architecture, and if you can show it&#x27;ll be a winner, the DoE will buy it.')
