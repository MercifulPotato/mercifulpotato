Item(by='linsomniac', descendants=None, kids=[25685805], score=None, time=1610120579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674964, text='One of the big things I&#x27;m going to miss is: No overdraft fees.<p>Simple is one of the only banks that doesn&#x27;t do overdrafts.  If you try to use your debit card and have no money, it fails.  If you try to send a payment, or a autopay tries to withdraw, and you don&#x27;t have the money, it fails.<p>Looking at replacement options, I&#x27;ve kind of honed in on Alliant Credit Union and PNC.  PNC was close in the running because of their &quot;virtual wallet&quot; tools years ago when I was last looking, but they really have no presence in my area.<p>Alliant has a $25 overdraft fee, limited to once a day (IIRC, been looking at a lot of options).  PNC has ~$38 fee, limited to 4 times a day.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t overdraft often, can&#x27;t remember the last time.  But when I&#x27;m moving to a new bank and trying to get everything set up, chances are high and I know getting $150 in overdraft fees is going to piss me right off.  And they do offer some protections like free pulling from a backup account or one of their credit cards if you have it before doing a full overdraft.<p>But almost $40 for an overdraft makes me question the personality of this bank.')
