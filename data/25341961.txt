You get up to 40x concurrency in the “Pro” plans and I’m sure you could work whatever you need into enterprise.<p>My biggest complaint has been it lacks an very useful built in ability that Travis had, which is automatically running your builds on the merge of your current branch and target branch. You can right a script to do it yourself, but there missing some environmental variables to do it easily (because the build can start before the target branch is known).')
