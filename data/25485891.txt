You don&#x27;t switch to a whole new CPU architecture without clear benefit.<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of effort put into tooling for RISC-V over the last few years, with more ongoing. The RISC-V foundation member list is not to be ignored. There&#x27;s strong corporate and government backing behind RISC-V.<p>The existing licenses won&#x27;t disappear, but whether new cores and&#x2F;or new ISA revisions from ARM will get licensees post-NVIDIA purchase is anybody&#x27;s guess. Mid&#x2F;Long term, I just don&#x27;t see ARM stand a chance against RISC-V.')
