He has several well-known papers, e.g. on &quot;spaces vs places&quot; for collaborative software (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dourish.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;1996&#x2F;cscw96-place.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dourish.com&#x2F;publications&#x2F;1996&#x2F;cscw96-place.pdf</a>), on privacy as boundary negotiation, on why ethnographic research shouldn&#x27;t have to discuss implications for design (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemvweb.com&#x2F;sources&#x2F;ethnography&#x2F;implication_design.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;onemvweb.com&#x2F;sources&#x2F;ethnography&#x2F;implication_design.p...</a>), and more.')
