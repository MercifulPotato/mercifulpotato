Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608222143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25453310, text='&gt; What would it have looked like if class-based components got a v2 rev instead? I feel like a lot of the crazy with class-based components came from the myriad low-level callbacks. useEffect() is a better abstraction, but it seems like some sort of class-based analogue could have been created (perhaps registering effects in the constructor).<p>This certainly seems like it would have been a better design, it would definitely be easier to reason about. Or even just an additional function boundary between where hooks are called and where JSX is rendered (semantically it’s basically the same thing but less verbose). Or even just changing the hooks interface to be a factory, accepting a component function as a parameter, where that component receives props `P &amp; HookState&lt;FooHook&gt;`, which probably would be a lighter lift for React’s implementation because it could simply be a wrapper around the current behavior.')
