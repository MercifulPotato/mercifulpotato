That appears to be the trend right now in the Apple ecosystem at least. I’ve abandoned some apps and subscribed to some as more keep doing that shift.<p>I wonder if starting off and growing a bit by being one off the switching wouldn’t be better business. Of course that strategy is considered repugnant by many. But I’m putting that aside.<p>One weird thing that usually turns me off too much is when the one off payments are less than the subscription per year price. Like Noteplan 3 per year is more than Noteplan 2 Mac and iOS separate purchases.')
