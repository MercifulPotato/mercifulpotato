But there shouldn&#x27;t be any confusion about what it means. Telling somebody that the Holocaust didn&#x27;t happen is indubitably an example of free speech.<p>One of the disputes that exist within the group supporting the liberal idea of free speech is it&#x27;s boundary; there is general agreement that some range of speech that is both false and harmful is excluded, but the boundary of the kind and mechanism of harm that qualifies is disputed.<p>&gt; Telling somebody that the Holocaust didn&#x27;t happen is indubitably an example of free speech.<p>It&#x27;s both false and in many contexts quite arguably harmful; whether it (in any particular context) involves the kind of harm that take it out of the realm of free speech is very much a dispute <i>within</i> the liberal, pro-free-speech community.')
