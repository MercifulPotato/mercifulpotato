I was using fr24 for a while and I think someone on here suggested adsb-e and it&#x27;s a godsend.  Living in the DC area, I see lots of fuckery where military helicopters that don&#x27;t even show up on fr24 at least leave these weird artifacts on adsb-e.<p>Note I live on the flightpath between the WH and Camp David, and the Marines practice this run A LOT.  I only found this out once I started WFH every day due to the pandemic.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s a lone helicopter, sometimes they are in a trio.  But FR never shows anything and ADSB-E at least shows an artifact that essentially appears as a drone with no tail number.')
