Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609828846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635239, text='&gt; Pensions are horrifically anti-worker. You&#x27;re basically withholding X% of someone&#x27;s pay for 40 years, and also confiscating that pay if they don&#x27;t stay at the same company until the pension vests (so people cannot leave without incurring a huge financial penalty even if they hate their job and can find better options elsewhere).<p>It depends.  I have a defined-benefit pension that vested after a short time (5 years? it was a long time ago, but it was about the same as the 401k match).  I&#x27;ve never felt tied down by it, and it&#x27;s a nice thing to have to diversify my retirement assets, since it was one where <i>I</i> wasn&#x27;t taking the risk.')
