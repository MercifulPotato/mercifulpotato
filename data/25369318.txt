I&#x27;m sure you could have centos on a dev box in a place where you have architects which have actually done Dev work in the last 20 years, but I&#x27;ve never seen one.<p>Yes, I am sure you are unhappy being dragged kicking and screaming into a more modern environment, but, if you look at the article it is pretty telling.<p>&quot;It is a betrayal, because for more than two decades IT executives and DevOps engineers in the industry kept using and recommending CentOS for others because of the compatibility it offers with Red Hat, and the stable 10-year updates cycle.&quot;<p>I get you want a 10 year update cycle. But, that implies so much about the ability for the software you are developing on to be containerised or being written in a way to be abstracted away from a particular OS.<p>You go to a place, you see Centos, and you know it is old Oracle databases as far as the eye can see, and disconnected architectural cycles where people don&#x27;t understand the choices they make any more.<p>What windows boxes they have will be ladened with group policies within an inch of their lives, and you would have to fight to get IE 11 as an upgrade.<p>You connect over Citrix systems to servers never built for load they were going to have on day one, let alone what they have now.<p>You will have a big turnover of developers who know what they are doing, and keep on the most soulless, but they are not good.<p>So you put more process in place to cover the inadequacies of what you can keep, over and over again.<p>You have had the rug pulled out from under you. But, it is not a betrayal, it is a wakeup call.')
