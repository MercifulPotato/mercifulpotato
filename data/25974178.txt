The TSLAQ crowd basically has two last bunkers they are defending, profit from regulatory credits and Tesla cars are literal trash when the come out of the factory. Both are vastly blown out of proportion.<p>When Model 3 started to come out people said Tesla could never bring a mass market car to market. Prediction over prediction how it would kill the company. When that was accomplished people said, well but you can never make a mass market EV and be profitable, and the rules and regulation around regulatory credits have not changed since then.<p>Now Tesla is making a profit for 6 quarters, now even in a pandemic year its not enough profit, because some revenue might go away in 2-3 years.<p>What they ignore is the progression of both growth and margin, even excluding credits. Tesla grew automotive deliveries by 36% in a pandemic year and improved overall operational margin from basically less then 0% to among the best of any car company. During 2020 they have innovated technologically in many ways, most uniquely literally turning into a battery company that makes not only its own cell but also its own cell manufacturing equipment. Guidance for next year, and Tesla has been conservative with guidance since 2017 disaster, is another year of growth of around 50% and with operational margin that are as good or better then 2020.<p>During 2020 they have massively expanded, more the doubled, Shanghai factory, they have begun billing truly huge factories in both Europe (Berlin) and the US (Austin). This required huge amounts of capital and will only real start to really make them money in 2022, but its massive operational leverage that is being generated here.<p>Even when taking this into account, what many still ignore is that Tesla has to make massive investments in things they don&#x27;t get a return for yes. Massive expansion of the supercharger network, service centres and stores. Basically every existing car company is making a huge amount of money from service (essentially parts), this is because they are not growing and the have millions and millions of cars that are out of warranty on the road. Tesla because of its growth has way more cars under warranty in relation to those out of warranty and that, plus building up new locations, makes their service a huge drain on the company.<p>In the long run, both the super chargers and service will be making lots of cash for Tesla but you never hear this mentioned, specially in the sites that cater to the TSLAQ. There is just a large market out there for negative prediction on Tesla. The Fool is one of those pages who has been writing negative Tesla articles, for many years now. They have completely gotten the story wrong so many times and the often had known short seller write articles for them.<p>The &#x27;Tesla can not make money without credits&#x27; storyline will hold up maybe a 1-2 more quarters.')
