In Norway, fixed-rate mortgage agreements are always made with a clause mandating settlement of the interest difference, in the case of refinancing or early repayment.<p>The customer therefore has no leverage over the lender by threatening to take the loan elsewhere. They&#x27;d have to pay all of the remaining interest if they wanted to settle the loan, or at best settle the interest difference if moving the loan to a lender with a different interest rate. Assuming both banks agreed to the exchange.<p>Of course, if interest rates increase, such settlement could also favor the borrower. But that hasn&#x27;t been the case in a long time.<p>Most mortgages here are floating-rate.')
