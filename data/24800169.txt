On the other hand I overlooked that in my test scene it samples the lights at every vertex, and I forgot it had textures which needs at least 2 coordinates per vertex. So it needs at least 10 * 32 * 2 = 960 random values for that.<p>I also recall that we tried MT but found a quite noticeable impact on speed compared to what we had, and on the PGC performance page MT is listed in the tens of GB&#x2F;s. Perhaps our implementation was considerably worse though, I can&#x27;t recall us testing it alone like that.<p>As I mentioned though, that renderer was more about physics and fidelity. Typical render times for even a preview would be a minute, for final single-frame stills tens of hours to several days on a single computer was common.<p>For animations you don&#x27;t have that kind of time, so you need a orders of magnitude more samples&#x2F;sec.')
