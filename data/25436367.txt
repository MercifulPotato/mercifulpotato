If you use a short-term credential system to load them via SSO, you have more infrastructure to maintain. If you setup a bastion host, you need to keep that secured because it&#x27;s a really high-value target and might allow an attacker to get higher access credentials than the person they compromised if there are any mistakes on setup (common in what I&#x27;ve seen - internal infrastructure is often neglected compared to production servers)<p>None of that is something which can&#x27;t be solved, of course, but this is a nice way to avoid having to deal with O&amp;M yourself, which is the point to a lot of cloud services.')
