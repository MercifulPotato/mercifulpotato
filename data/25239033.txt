Geocentrism required epicycles. Then Keppler came up with his ellipses. Then Newton unified celestial and terrestrial laws. Maxwell &amp; Einstein allowed us to view time as less special dimension than we thought it wasâ€¦</i><p>Unification, maybe. Simplification, no. That&#x27;s evident if you just scroll down the list of Nobels in physics. You even mentioned Einstein, but I don&#x27;t know how you could claim general or special relativity are simpler than Newtonian physics.')
