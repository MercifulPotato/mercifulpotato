So they put a router in a box, or whatever, and need a power supply and amplifier and connectors to the outside world. The finished system needs to pass compliance testing, but they can&#x27;t modify the parts they&#x27;ve selected - all they can do is fix the cabling and do things to the outside of the purchased components.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like EMI&#x2F;EMC testing of hardware you have designed yourself; it&#x27;s usually much cheaper to apply a bandaid fix (add ferrite cores, shield that cable better, terminate here not there, etc.) and add to a punch list for rev 2, than to go back to the drawing board and change the board&#x2F;die&#x2F;whatever.<p>Of course if you can plan for this during design, you (and your boss&#x2F;bottom line!) will be a lot happier.')
