Because those are the same particle interaction, rotated into different reference frames. (In practice, I think you mostly end up with entanglements like Bit_γ xor Bit_e xor Bit_e̅ = 0, which is why a electron and positron (or matter and antimatter in general) can always annihilate to form a photon (respectively photons) in yet another rotation of said particle interaction.)')
