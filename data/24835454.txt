An average person doesn&#x27;t even have a concept of online privacy internalized, for him worrying about online privacy is basically the same as worrying about TSA agent examining his vacation backpack: he has nothing to hide. But it&#x27;s even worse, since airport examinations happen in physical world and they cause at least some inconvenience, whilst FAANGs harvesting your data is invisible and only brings more comfort.<p>Advertising something with better privacy, permission, etc. will only bring you people that already care about it, i.e. the same 0.01% of geeks. I can see only two ways to achieve the goal of decentralized and privacy-respecting &quot;Internet&quot;:<p>- Convince people that privacy is important. A very hard task in our age for several reasons. Also, it needs to be supported by legislation.<p>- Make the services more convenient to use than existing ones. Arguably impossible due to manpower imbalance and technical issues (privacy and security almost always come at a price of convenience).')
