Dark and light come with connotations. What I&#x27;ve found in my life is that if things look black and white, you aren&#x27;t close enough to see the shades of gray. By playing into the good and evil tropes, I think we run the danger of oversimplifying the situation.<p>People who understand the full breadth of options certainly have an advantage. That, to me, is orthogonal to whether or not people are moral. Just because you know that you can do things doesn&#x27;t make you evil. In fact, from a philosophical standpoint, I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s more virtue in knowing the evil and choosing not to do it than there is in ignorance. And from a business standpoint, there are generally non moral reasons for acting in what look like moral ways.')
