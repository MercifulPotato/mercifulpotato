Here&#x27;s an idea that might help, although I&#x27;m not sure if it can realistically be done:<p>When the video is encoded, the codec does motion estimation (among other things) to reduce the bandwidth required. So why don&#x27;t we use the motion vectors from the video codec to modify the foreground&#x2F;background mask in real time? Obviously this is going to create weird artifacts pretty soon, but it might just be good enough for a few frames before the ML model produces another accurate mask.')
