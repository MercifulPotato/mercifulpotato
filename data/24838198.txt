I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s improved in the few months since.<p>We haven&#x27;t announced it yet, but we&#x27;ve just started rolling out an all new &quot;bot creator&quot; feature this week, which&#x27;ll allow you to create bots for your server without writing any code (and if you do want to write code, we now have an early-access request form for our upcoming API).
