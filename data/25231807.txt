Item(by='brlewis', descendants=None, kids=[25232120, 25232086], score=None, time=1606505141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25231239, text='&gt; How come I know exactly where this essay is going?<p>This is the question I&#x27;ve been thinking as I&#x27;ve checked back in on comments here a few times this morning. Why do so many people &quot;know&quot; that this essay is all about aggrandizing pg&#x27;s own intellect or that of startup founders, when it&#x27;s almost entirely composed of two parts: (1) discussion on when independent thinking is and isn&#x27;t valuable, and (2) advice on cultivating independent thinking? Where does this impression come from?<p>There&#x27;s always some negativity toward any widely-read essay, but there seems to be a higher quantity with this one, making me think there&#x27;s something actually wrong with it. My hypothesis is that its presentation is too neatly wrapped. This essay espouses curiosity, but does not model it. It comes across as having all the answers. This is especially true of the brief part that confidently explains the lack of negative reaction to another essay, with no details of how such confidence was arrived at.<p>This is too bad. I&#x27;d like for this essay to have engendered more discussion on cultivating independent thinking, and less discussion about pg&#x27;s mindset.')
