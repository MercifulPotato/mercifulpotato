If Paddle was going away, you for sure have access to your customer email addresses to ask them to resubscribe and Paddle might help you migrate the payment details to another payment provider. How is the situation any easier or better with Stripe?<p>The Paddle invoice at least has your product&#x2F;company name + website link on it, along with Paddle&#x27;s details. It doesn&#x27;t feel any different to buying e.g. Android, iOS or Steam products to me - I don&#x27;t see why customers would care who is legally receiving the payment as long as they get their product.')
