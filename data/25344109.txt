The OP is a rediscovery of the fact that Lisp parenthesization can, in some cases, be expressed via indentation - and that indentation is in fact crucial to reading Lisp code.<p>When reading Lisp, I never count parens, my editor does that for me; same with indenting my code, my editor solves the issue for me based on the structure of parentheses from the previous point. This allows me to focus on the meaning of a given Lisp form rather than on how it&#x27;s formatted or structured.')
