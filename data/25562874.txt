Do you mean the odds of her ending up with serious symptoms? Part of the point of articles like this is that we don&#x27;t really yet know the prevalence of serious symptoms that don&#x27;t involve acute respiratory failure.\\<p>In a similar vein: I sort of understand the logic behind letting grandparents see their grandkids, because time is limited for them either way. But it&#x27;s probably not a win if your kid visits your mom <i>and she dies as a result</i>, even if it was the last opportunity your mom would ever have to see your kid; it would be a scarring, debilitating thing to live with for your kid.')
